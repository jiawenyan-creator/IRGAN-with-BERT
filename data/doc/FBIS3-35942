<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F>
Democratic Party of Russia, by Pavil Davydov in Moscow; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Davydov] You are on record as having said that if 
and when you gain power, you will change Russia's Middle East 
policies. Can you spell that out? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We view the Arab world as a friend of Russia. 
Russia once was a defender of Arab interests. Our interests are 
advanced if our relations with countries on Russia's southern 
borders are on a friendly footing. 
  [Davydov] But the post-Gulf war Arab world is polarized 
between supporters of Iraq, who are in the minority, and 
supporters of Kuwait, who are in the majority. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] It is in Russia's best interests to be on 
good terms with our closest neighbors on the one hand and the 
Arab orient, particularly Iraq and Syria, on the other. 
However, we are willing to establish ties with all the Arab 
states, notably Iraq and Syria, if only for purely geopolitical 
and geogrpahic considerations. These two are the Arab states 
closest to us. If Yemen, Algeria, or Morocco were to exchange 
places with Iraq, geographically speaking, we would have the 
same attitude toward them. 
  [Davydov] But Iraq is not just a geographical entity; it is 
a political regime led by Saddam Husayn. Do you view Iraq as a 
political fact or geographical location? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I see it in terms of geography, regardless of 
the political system of government that happens to be in power. 
This is a matter for the people of the country. 
  [Davydov] But you are known to be a friend of Saddam's. You 
met him personally and hosted a delegation of the ruling Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party in April, 1993. When you visited Iraq, 
you embraced an Iraqi and Russian national youth education 
program sponsored by the Ba'th party and your Liberal Democratic 
Party, and this is politics. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, I did meet Saddam Husayn, who for two 
years after the Gulf war did not receive any foreign figures, 
including Russians. Russian parliamentarians and various party 
leaders and journalists had sought interviews with him. 
However, I was the only one to be received by him, and that was 
in November, 1992. We had four hours of conversation. He 
impressed me as a person. 
  I would like to reiterate that it is up to each individual 
country to decide the shape of its own political system. We are 
interested in Iraq as a reliable partner from a geopolitical 
angle. Iraq's interests also stand to gain if Turkey and and 
Iran remain weak. 
  [Davydov] But Iraq under Saddam Husayn invaded Kuwait, and 
Iraq's Arab neighbors in the south and west continue to regard 
him as a potential aggressor. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Let us leave the Arabs to sort out their 
issues for themselves. As for Kuwait, I see a parallel between 
Iraq's associatioin with Kuwait and that between Russia and 
Crimea, which is Russian territory. 
  [Davydov] What defines Russia's friends and foes at the 
moment? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] They are defined by Russia's interests. In 
the past, the Communists went too far and rushed headlong into 
aiding practically everybody there was to help, like 
pro-communist regimes in Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, 
Nicaragua, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, and Afghanistan. On the other 
hand, the democrats now take the opposite direction. Whatever 
the United States asks of us we do. They said: Boycott Iraq, 
and so we did. They said: Impose sanctions on Libya, and so we 
did. They said: Go and fight in the Balkans, and so we did. 
The Russian democrats, as you see, have also gone too far. As 
far as we are concerned, we are in the middle. We will not help 
anyone nor get involved in anything unless we are convinced that 
whatever course of action we take will advance Russia's economic 
interests.
