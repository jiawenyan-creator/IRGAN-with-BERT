  [Excerpts] The foreign terrorists who assembled the 
truck-bomb discovered on Thursday probably had Thai allies, 
Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut said yesterday. 
  His admission coincided with a police announcement that a 
warrant will be issued tomorrow for the arrest of a suspected 
international terrorist, and that other warrants may follow. 
  Police said at least four people collaborated in assembling 
the truckbomb. 
  It was likely Thais were involved since it was difficult for 
foreigners to buy all the components locally. 
  "I have learned that some Thais joined the gang. The 
crackdown must be made at their grassroots," Chavalit said.

  Police yesterday produced a sketch of a second suspect in 
the 
sabotage attempt. An artist's sketch of the first suspect, 
drawn from details given by the owner of the motorcycle hit by 
the truck, had already been sent to all police stations. 
  Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen, Thawi 
Thippharat yesterday said the two suspects are from the Middle 
East, but he would not specify their nationality. [passage 
omitted] 
  He said police had lifted fingerprints from the Bung Kum 
house and they should be useful in identifying the terrorists 
and their organization. [passage omitted]
