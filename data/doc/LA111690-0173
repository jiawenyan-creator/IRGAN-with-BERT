DEA RAIDS MAJOR POT OPERATION 
Sheriff's deputies and federal drug agents raided a 20-acre estate, discovering 
a sophisticated marijuana-growing operation based at a million-dollar house, 
authorities said today. 
Search warrants were served on the house at 4363 E. Ave. E Thursday night, and 
officials seized about 6,000 plants that had been cultivated with an intricate 
irrigation system, Deputy Roger Hom said. 
Authorities were tipped to the farm after discovering incriminating bank 
records at a raid of a similar operation Wednesday in Phoenix, a federal Drug 
Enforcement Agency spokesman said.
