 

Moreover, the Exchange frequently uses the term ``options'' to include both equity and index options. For example,
the ``Options Committee'' governs both equity options and index options trading, and ``options trading volume''
includes index options as well. In addition, the use of the phrase ``equity options'' to include index options is not
limited to AUTOM. For instance, ``equity options floor''
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 and ``equity options examination''
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 are common terms. Furthermore, the date when AUTOX was extended to index options corresponds to Commission
approval of the use of AUTOX for ``all Phlx equity options.''
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, it appears that index options were added to AUTOM as part of the extension of both AUTOM and AUTOX
to ``all Phlx equity options.''

Although Commission orders approving various amendments to and extensions of the AUTOM pilot refer to ``equity options,''
the proposed rule changes filed by the Exchange generally describe AUTOM as an order routing and delivery system for
``options.'' In addition, the Phlx has issued memoranda to the trading floor regarding the use of AUTOM/AUTOX
for index options on many occasions, including periodic lists of the maximum size eligibility for AUTOX. The
Phlx also notes that other exchanges permit the use of automatic order delivery and executions systems for index options.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and Section
6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and protect investors
and the public interest by codifying index options into the AUTOM pilot program. The Exchange believes that index
option orders benefit from the advantages of AUTOM, including efficient and prompt order delivery and execution.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx believes that the proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Because the proposed rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning,
administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Exchange, it has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)
of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b4 thereunder. Specifically, the Exchange is proposing to codify
the eligibility of index options, an existing Exchange practice, for an existing Commission-approved system. At
any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to File No. SRPhlx9440 and should be submitted by November 28, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.
