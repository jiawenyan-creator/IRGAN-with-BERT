  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- All-round army 
construction should be directed by Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, a senior 
military leader said. 
  Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, had a discussion yesterday in Beijing with six 
military area commanders and political commissars who were 
attending a forum. 
  Referring to the significance in studying the third volume 
of 
Deng's works, Liu said that it is a long-term strategic task for 
the Army to arm all the soldiers and officers with Deng's theory 
of Chinese socialism and his idea of army building in a new 
period. 
  He stressed that relations between reform, development and 
stability, and between parts and the whole, should be handled 
correctly by means of deepening the study. 
  He said that leading offers in particular should work hard, 
lead their officers and soldiers in any effort and do a good job 
in all aspects of army construction so as to make active 
contributions to the nation's reform, opening and modernization 
drive and to the maintenance of social stability. 
  He said that officers and soldiers should be educated to 
inherit the Army's fine working style. 
  Several top military leaders of the People's Liberation Army 
were also present at the discussion.
