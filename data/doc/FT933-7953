FT  18 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Floating krone lifts Danish
farm prices
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday raised Danish farm prices by 2.2 per cent,
as part of the system for frequent adjustment of 'green' currency rates
adopted in the wake of the August 2 decision to set 15 per cent fluctuation
bands for the European exchange rate mechanism currencies.
The new agrimonetary dispensation recognises all EC currencies as floating
within a wide 15 per cent band, and the commission now reviews farm price
conversion rates every three trading days. If the monetary gap between any
two member states exceeds 6 per cent during these periods, either or both of
the currencies get their green rate changed if individually they have
revalued or depreciated by more than two percentage points.
The current adjustment, based on trading on August 12, 13 and 16, is to plug
the gap between the Dutch guilder, which commission figures show
appreciating by 1.92 per cent against its central rate, and a krone
depreciation of 4.29 per cent. The green krone was revalued by 0.8 per cent
on August 11, along with the agricultural conversion rate for the French
franc, which rose by 1.8 per cent.
Prior to the latest turmoil in the ERM, the Commission was reviewing green
rates about three times a month, but purely for the weaker currencies inside
the ERM, the peseta and the escudo, and those floating outside it, sterling,
the lira and the drachma.
