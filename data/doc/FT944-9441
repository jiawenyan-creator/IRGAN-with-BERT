FT  15 NOV 94 / Bhutto offers peace to rivals
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto yesterday offered to make peace with
her political opponents after the opposition tried to shout down President
Farooq Leghari (pictured left) during the opening of parliament. Mr
Leghari's 45-minute speech to an annual joint session of the two-chamber
parliament in Islamabad was barely audible amid the non-stop chants of 'Go
Leghari, go'. Excited deputies pushed, shoved and hurled insults at one
another as members of Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party (PPP) formed a
protective phalanx around her. PPP deputies lined up on the speaker's dais
to keep their banner-waving opponents at bay. Bhutto supporters later
punched two opposition deputies and witnesses said one of them was bleeding
from the mouth.
'We have always extended the hand of friendship to them,' Ms Bhutto told
reporters later when asked about the chances of a dialogue with opposition
parties. 'Even now the government is willing to talk to them on issues of
national interest,' she said. The incident followed the arrest on Sunday of
Mr Mohammed Sharif, the father of opposition leader Mr Nawaz Sharif, on
charges of obtaining loans fraudulently from foreign banks.
