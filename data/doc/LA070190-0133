SEPARATISTS BLAMED FOR KASHMIR KILLING 
Gunmen killed a Hindu man in the Kashmir Valley in India's Jammu and Kashmir 
province in an attack blamed on Muslim separatists, police said. 
Nilakanth Raina, a former professor, died in his house in Srinagar. The police 
official had no more details on the victim or the attack. Thirteen other people 
were killed in Kashmir Valley over two days, the United News of India and 
officials said, but few details were available. More than 600 people -- mostly 
militants or separatist supporters -- have been slain since January, when the 
government launched a crackdown on the separatist movement.
