TOP GENERALS REPORTED SLAIN IN ETHIOPIA 
President Mengistu Haile Mariam appeared to regain control in Ethiopia on 
Friday as a four-day revolt by mutinous soldiers faded under the guns of 
loyalist troops. 
Nearly the entire high command of this Marxist government has been killed, a 
Western diplomat said, in an attempted coup led by generals humiliated in a 
string of recent defeats against rebels in northern Ethiopia. 
"If we move into a 'night of the long knives,' it (the high command) will be 
gutted even more," the diplomat said, "There'll be a certain amount of 
retribution." 
Despite reports of continued scattered fighting, the government confidently 
said it has thoroughly smashed the rebellion. 
Briefing foreign ambassadors in the capital Friday, Foreign Minister Berhanu 
Bayeh said the revolt "was crushed at the center here in Addis Ababa" within 
hours Tuesday evening. 
Lingering resistance was stamped out Thursday when loyal soldiers of the 2nd 
Army killed their "commander and his collaborators" in Asmara, Ethiopia's 
second-largest city and capital of the northernmost province of Eritrea. 
"It was a very self-confident briefing by the minister," said a Western 
diplomat. "I think Mengistu has got back in the saddle. He has shown a degree 
of efficiency and ruthlessness that might have surprised some." 
But the envoy noted that the "military situation in the north is going to be 
substantially eroded." 
Mengistu's troops have been fighting secessionist rebels in Eritrea and another 
rebel group seeking autonomy for the neighboring province of Tigre. But they 
have consistently lost ground to the rebels, despite massive military aid from 
the Soviet Union, which counts Ethiopia as its staunchest African ally.
