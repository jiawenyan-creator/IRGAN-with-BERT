MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
Bar None From Anthem: Comedienne Roseanne Barr coyly joins husband Tom Arnold 
and talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael in singing the National Anthem on 
Raphael's syndicated TV show that will air from sea to shining sea today (2 
p.m. on KCAL Channel 9). 
On the program, taped Monday in New York, Barr and Arnold try to set the record 
straight about Barr's controversial rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" 
last week before a San Diego Padres baseball game. Arnold, referring to 
President Bush's comment that Barr's singing had been "disgraceful," said, "I 
think the President should thank Roseanne. She took the spotlight off his new 
taxes and his son's savings and loan scandal." ALEENE MacMINN
