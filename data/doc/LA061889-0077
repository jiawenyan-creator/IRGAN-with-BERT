VIETNAMESE GIRL'S ESSAY ON CONTRASTS 
I am writing in response to the essay written by 11-year-old Tuyet Tran (June 
11). I thank The Times for publishing her letter unedited, allowing her message 
to come to the readers directly from the heart. 
Tuyet's poignantly composed essay contrasting the horrors of Communistic 
Vietnam and the beauty of America and its people touched me deeply. It does 
sadden me, however, to think about the many "beautiful people" Tuyet refers to 
who do not always welcome her with open arms and minds. 
As a teacher, I see on a daily basis the insights children have about ideas 
such as freedom, tyranny, and simple acceptance of others. I am also convinced 
it is the children who can make a difference and change the world for the 
better. 
Hopefully, Tuyet's simple, moving essay was able to remind we Americans how 
fortunate we are to live in a democracy blessed with freedom, void of tyranny 
and rich in cultural diversity. 
I send my heartfelt respect to Tuyet, her family and teachers who have 
obviously had a positive impact on her life.
