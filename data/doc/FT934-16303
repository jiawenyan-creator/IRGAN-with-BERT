FT  07 OCT 93 / Ulster Unionists pledge support for John Major
MR James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, gave the
strongest signal yet of his party's willingness to sustain Mr John Major's
government.
In a speech at the Tory party conference, Mr Molyneaux said there was no
reason 'why we should terminate the life of this parliament prematurely'.
In an apparent assurance to Mr Major that he could rely on the votes of the
nine Ulster Unionists when threatened by Tory backbench rebellions, he
added: 'We also take the view that a prime minister should not be evicted
from No 10 by ambitious or nerveless parliamentary colleagues'.
