The last ashes of union martyr Joe Hill were scattered at a Lafayette, Colo., 
cemetery where five striking unionized coal miners who were gunned down by 
militiamen and guards at the Columbine Mine on Nov. 21, 1927, are buried. Hill 
was an organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World, known as the 
Wobblies. A granite marker with the names of six slain miners was unveiled in 
the cemetery 20 miles northwest of Denver. In 1915, Hill was executed in Utah 
for a murder in Salt Lake City, where he had been organizing workers. 
Supporters said the mining industry framed Hill. His body was cremated and his 
ashes were scattered in many states.
