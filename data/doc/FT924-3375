FT  08 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P puts government of HK on
credit watch
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has placed the government of
Hong Kong's implied long-term ratings on credit watch with negative
implications. The move reflects the rapid deterioration of relations between
Britain and China over the governance of Hong Kong during the past two
months, it said.
S&amp;P said that the implied ratings of government-owned Mass Transit Railway
Corp are also under review, although this does not reflect any change in its
stand-alone credit quality.
The credit watch listings affect the A senior foreign currency and A+ local
currency ratings of both the government and MTRC. Short-term ratings are
unaffected.
'The significance of this is not simply that the government is in surplus
and is likely to remain so,' explains Mr David Beers, a director at S&amp;P in
New York. 'The issue is: what are the political risks for the longer tem,
and their economic impact?'
S&amp;P's practice of awarding implied ratings to sovereigns which are not
attached to specific debt issues serves to establish a 'ceiling' for
would-be borrowers in that jurisdiction.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong remains an attractive location for overseas investment
in manufacturing, said Mr T. H. Barma, director-general of industry,
commenting on the findings of the latest survey on the subject by the
industry department.
The total value of overseas investment at the end of 1991 was HKDollars
34.4bn, 11 per cent more than in the previous year, he said.
