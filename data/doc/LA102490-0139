SENATE KILLS PLAN TO LIMIT OWL PROTECTION 
The Senate turned back an attempt Tuesday to bypass the Endangered Species Act 
so logging could continue in Pacific Northwest forests regardless of the impact 
on the threatened northern spotted owl. 
Republican senators in Oregon and Washington pushed the plan to help soften the 
economic blow on communities expected to be hit hard by dramatic reductions in 
timber harvests as a result of federally mandated protection of the rare bird. 
The amendment to the Interior Department appropriations bill failed on a 62-34 
vote. Debate on other provisions of the bill will resume today.
