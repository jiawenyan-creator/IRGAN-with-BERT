VALLEY ROUNDUP: AME OF BURBANK HALTS TALKS OF PURCHASE WITH THIRD PARTY 
AME Inc. said it ended talks with an unidentified third party that had 
expressed interest in possibly buying the Burbank video post-production 
company. 
The third party's interest surfaced after AME's founder and chairman, Andrew M. 
McIntyre, offered to buy the 55% of AME he does not already own for $37 
million. But McIntyre scrapped his $13.75-a-share bid last month because he was 
unable to get financing "on satisfactory terms." 
AME still might get a buyout proposal, however. Its employee stock ownership 
plan, which already owns 25% of AME, also has said it might be interested in 
offering to buy the company. 
AME mainly transfers movies and television shows from film to videotape for 
mass distribution. It also provides computer animation, graphics and audio 
post-production services.
