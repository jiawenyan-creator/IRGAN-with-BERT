Corporation (Rockwell), and the FAA argue that both GLONASS and GPS operations, as potential components of the GNSS,
must be protected during all phases of flight over the United States. To that end, they proffer additional limitations
on Big LEO operations. ARINC/ATA argues that the Commission should clarify that the RR 731E limitation of 15
dB (W/4kHz) for MSS mobile terminals should apply only after GLONASS moves to frequencies below 1610 MHz. Until then,
they contend, the limit should be 78.5 dB (W/MHZ).

 Similarly, Rockwell states that the RR 731E limit is insufficient for protecting GLONASS operations at 16101616
MHz. Rockwell claims that the RR 731E power density level is about 140 dB above the maximum interference level that
can be tolerated by a typical GLONASS receiving system. Rockwell asserts that shared use of this band segment is impractical
absent significant constraints on either MSS or GLONASS. Therefore, it maintains that MSS operation should not be
permitted in the 16101616 MHz band segment until GLONASS operations are shifted to frequencies below 1610
MHz.
<FOOTCITE>157</FOOTCITE>
 The FAA states that the Commission indicated that use of the 16101616 MHz band by MSS is premised upon moving
GLONASS below 1610 MHz. It maintains that the e.i.r.p. density specified in RR 731E is too high to protect in-band GLONASS
for anything but high altitude enroute communications.

126. Several of the MSS applicants also disagree that more restrictive limits should be placed on MSS uplinks pending
a GLONASS frequency shift. Constellation states that more realistic interference criteria and models must be developed
before any requirements other than the RR 731E uplink e.i.r.p. density limit can be adopted.
<FOOTCITE>159</FOOTCITE>
 Ellipsat contends that no additional requirements should be adopted because the aviation community has not provided
a legitimate basis for overly stringent requirements on MSS uplinks. Further, Ellipsat maintains that even if GLONASS
becomes a component of the GNSS, the aviation community has not provided a showing that GNSS performance would be impaired
if degradation were to occur to the small number of GLONASS satellites that would operate above 1610 MHz.
<FOOTCITE>160</FOOTCITE>
 Motorola claims that the proposed limits advocated by the aviation community are based on flawed assumptions and
unsound analysis. Additionally, Motorola asserts that the protection the aviation parties claim as necessary is
based on the erroneous assumption that corrupting a single measurement from a GLONASS satellite will cause unacceptable
degradation in the ability to navigate.

Motorola Reply Comments at 51. Motorola notes that a study conducted for LQP by Sat-Tech Systems demonstrates that
loss of a single satellite will never cause a loss of GNSS (LQP Comments at Technical Appendix, para. 2.2.1 at 12). In
addition, the Committee performed an analysis of the availability of GNSS satellites if the GLONASS constellation
operated only on frequencies below 1610 MHz. It concluded that a minimum of five satellites would always be available
for GNSS. In addition, it noted that this minimum would occur for only 14 minutes in every 51-day period. It noted further
that since only four GNSS satellites are required for navigation and an additional one satellite for system integrity,
it appears that GLONASS satellites operating above 1610 MHz might not be required for either navigation or terminal
approach communications. Committee Report, note 23,
