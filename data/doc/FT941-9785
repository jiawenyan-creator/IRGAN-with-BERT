FT  12 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds steady
Initially encouraging figures from Lloyds Bank were clouded by realisation
that an adjustment for third world debt had boosted 1993 profits by Pounds
193m.
Lloyds shares jumped 12 initially as investors responded to news of profits
up 29 per cent to Pounds 1.03bn and a 20 per cent dividend hike. However,
closer consideration of the results statement showed that they had been
distorted by receipt of bonds from Argentina in exchange for loans and past
due interest.
Cazenove led the selling and the stock ticked back to close only 2 better at
617p. Turnover was 15m.
Lloyds is the first of Britain's banks with a December year end to announce
1993 results. The others will report over the next four weeks.
Other banks responded better to the Lloyds figures. Mr Robert Law at Lehman
Brothers pointed out that strongly capitalised banks such as Abbey National
would pay good dividends. The shares rose 16 to 516p with the market also
focusing on Abbey's exposure to the high-margin mortgage market. Barclays
rose 3 1/2 to 584p and NatWest lifted 8 to 554p.
British Aerospace followers spent the day chasing speculation that Mr Bob
Bauman, currently chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, would replace Mr
John Cahill as chairman. Confirmation of his appointment came after the
market had closed.
BAe shares closed down 6 at 543p, but analysts were pleased with the
prospect. 'To find a chairman in a hurry is difficult; to find someone of
Bob Bauman's stature would be a good move,' said one. Mr Zafar Khan at
Strauss Turnbull said: 'An outsider in a non-executive capacity will be
well-received.' SmithKline shares slipped 6 1/2 to 409p.
GKN fell 3 to 557p as its Pounds 496m bid for helicopter manufacturer
Westland was damaged by an increase in Westland's share capital due to the
exercise of rights on preference shares. The combined holding of GKN and
United Technologies (which has agreed to sell its Westland stake to GKN)
only dropped from around 47 per cent to around 45 per cent, but Mr Martin
Roscoe at Charterhouse Tilney commented: 'That's a big fall when you're
trying to reach 50 per cent and the market's against you.' Suggestions that
GKN would raise its offer were not well received, with the GKN bid described
as 'lacking conviction'. Westland closed down 3 at 334p.
Other engineering stocks hit by the downturn included Vickers, off 6 at
180p, and IMI, down 8 to 349p, whose sell-off of Brook Street Computers was
not well received.
Tomkins rose 5 to 263p on buying from Salomon Brothers, which has included
the stock in a basket of call warrants focused on companies exposed to US
growth.
TI Group continued its gentle slide, down 3 to 407p, following problems with
aircraft landing gear manufactured by its subsidiary Dowty.
The Pounds 103m property sale by Ladbroke, which will help ease the
company's debt burden, helped the shares stay in positive territory, closing
a penny forward at 205p. Burford Holdings is to make a rights issue to pay
for the purchase. Its shares slid a penny to 121p.
A big buyer of Forte, said to be through NatWest Securities, helped the
shares gain 4 to 257p, with turnover reaching 9.5m. Alpha Airports, the
recently floated catering group in which Forte retains a quarter share,
remained in demand and the shares gained a penny to 173p on 6.9m traded.
Merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander gained 5 to 110p after an article in a
specialist magazine tipped the stock.
Internationally traded conglomerate Hanson fell 10 to 289 1/2 p as Goldman
Sachs removed the company from its European 'top priority' list. It also
shaved its 1994 forecast for earnings per share by a penny to 16.3p after
exceptionals, and cut its profit forecast by 50m to Pounds 1.15bn. However,
the broker said it was still positive on the shares.
Glaxo Holdings, hurt during the week by worries about its best-selling ulcer
drug, Zantac, fell a further 12 to 639p. However the market expects
encouraging profits and dividend when half-year results are published on
Thursday. Analysts say a big currency gain, should help the pharmaceuticals
group to report a rise of around 15 per cent in profits to between Pounds
910m to Pounds 980m.
Shares in ICI fell 17 to 787p after light selling in New York on Thursday.
In a surprisingly sturdy food retail sector, Argyll Group added a penny to
257p, with UBS suggesting that the shares may be looking oversold ahead of
next week's trading statement.
Elsewhere, Asda edged forward a half-penny to 58 1/2 p. with J Sainsbury
gaining a penny to 361p and Tesco steady at 225p.
