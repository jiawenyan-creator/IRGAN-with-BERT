FT  31 DEC 92 / Ready for the split
Border country: the sign is already in place outside the northern Slovak
town of Cadca, ready for the split of Slovakia from the Czech republic at
midnight tonight. Cadca intends to celebrate by hoisting the national flag,
singing the national anthem and letting off fireworks, but its population is
divided on independence. Some people fear a grim awakening after the party.
