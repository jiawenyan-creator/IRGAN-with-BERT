PLO REJECTS SHAMIR'S ELECTION PLAN 
The PLO today rejected Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal to hold 
elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it was a 
warmed-over version of the Camp David Accords. 
In its first reaction to Shamir's plan, the Palestine Liberation Organization 
said any elections in the territories Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East 
war should be held after Israeli withdrawal and under international 
supervision. 
Shamir unveiled his election ideas in Washington last week as a way of breaking 
a deadlock in Middle East peace efforts.
