FT  08 AUG 92 / Ford to lift car prices by 1.8% this month
FORD, the UK new-car market leader, is raising the prices of its cars and
commercial vehicles by 1.8 per cent with effect from August 17.
In spite of the continuing weakness of new-car sales, Ford is following its
traditional ploy of raising prices in mid August to stimulate orders during
the first half of the month. It said the increases would not affect
remaining stocks of cars not fitted with catalytic converters, which become
mandatory from the end of the year.
Ford last raised prices in January, by an average of 3.7 per cent across the
range. It was forced to cut prices of some models in March in an attempt to
stimulate sales.
In the first seven months of the year, its registrations have fallen 11.7
per cent, compared with an overall fall in new-car sales of 4.3 per cent.
