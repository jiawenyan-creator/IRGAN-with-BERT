  [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The Parliamentary 
Committee for Petitions, Human Rights and Nationalities today 
rejected two deputy-proposed bills on Czech radio and 
television. Most opposition deputies -- who form the majority 
in the committee -- rejected the proposals, while the coalition 
deputies were for them. 
  The committee members' report concentrated on the 
nine-member 
Czech Television Council, an organ supposed to guarantee the 
public's right to control the making and broadcasting of Czech 
Television's programmes. 
  The proposals were put forward by deputies of the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) and the Liberal National Social Party 
(LSNS).
