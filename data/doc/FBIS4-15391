<F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, chairman of the </F>
Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin faction in the Duma, by Andrzej Rybak; 
place and date not given: "Weimar in Moscow"] 
  [Text] [Rybak] President Yeltsin is sick, a situation 
increasingly reminiscent of Leonid Brezhnev. Does Russia need a 
new president immediately? 
  [Yavlinskiy] I do not wish to discuss Boris Yeltsin's 
health. There is another reason to hold presidential elections: 
Russia experienced a tragedy in October 1993. Every president 
has the moral duty to face the electorate as soon as possible, 
but Yeltsin has not done so. 
  [Rybak] You are one of the most popular politicians in 
Russia. Are you going to run in the coming presidential 
elections? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Yes, if the elections are held in a legal 
manner. I must show that people of other generations, people 
with different political convictions, can make politics in 
Russia. And: I am going to win these elections. 
  [Rybak] You want to take over a ruined country in which 
national communists are already causing trouble. Can a 
bloodbath still be prevented? 
  [Yavlinskiy] In January, we produced 24 percent less than in 
the previous January. Four thousand enterprises are idle. The 
situation is serious but not hopeless. However, the president 
and the government are behaving as if there were no crisis at 
all. In such a situation, tension is inevitable. But I do not 
want to rush to conclusions. 
  [Rybak] How much more deprivation can the Russians take? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The people's patience has been stretched beyond 
its limits. But one dare not even think about a social 
upheaval. It would plunge the country and the world into an 
unimaginable disaster. 
  [Rybak] The constitution gives Boris Yeltsin enormous power. 
But is he really the master over the situation? 
  [Yavlinskiy] No president can manage such a quantity of 
power, and certainly not our president. The consequence of this 
is that his power apparatus is becoming independent and he is 
under no social control. No one can say who makes the decisions 
or who influences them. Yeltsin is running the country in an 
increasingly authoritarian manner. 
  [Rybak] Is that not extremely dangerous? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Even Hindenburg divided the German Parliament. 
He wanted to put an end to the Weimar Republic conditions. And 
what happened? The situation in Russia today is very similar. 
The birth of fascism is following a roundabout route. 
Democratic chaos followed by authoritarianism and then fascism. 
  [Rybak] Does Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's success mean the 
dawning 
of fascism? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Zhirinovskiy is a warning. 
  [Rybak] A change of course is taking place in Russian 
foreign policy. Is Russia seeking to reestablish its empire? 
  [Yavlinskiy] The borders between Russia and the former 
Soviet republics exist only on paper. They are no longer 
guarded. Therefore there is a great danger that ethnic conflicts 
will spread from these republics into Russia. We must 
counteract them. 
  [Rybak] But the Russian Army is itself fanning unrest. It 
is pursuing its own policy in the former republics! 
  [Yavlinskiy] In Russia, everyone is still pursuing his own 
policy -- the Finance Ministry, the Central Bank, and the 
Economics Ministry. That is why the situation is so chaotic. 
The president is also trying to pursue two separate political 
paths at the same time, a democratic path on the one hand and a 
megalo-Russian one on the other. He wants to please all the 
lobbies, but he is enmeshing himself in contradictions. 
  [Rybak] The latest announcements are rekindling old fears. 
Will Russia again be an evil empire? 
  [Yavlinskiy] Yeltsin is a populist. He was a great democrat 
as long as he believed that democracy was very popular. Now 
that he has seen how popular Zhirinovskiy is, he is trying to 
copy him. That is naive. He will not lure the nationalists this 
way, but he will certainly lose his own supporters. Do you want 
to know what Russian politics is going to look like? Then watch 
Zhirinovskiy. Yeltsin wants to be liked, and he wants to stay in 
power. 
  [Rybak] U.S. economics expert Jeffrey Sachs is accusing the 
West of not having rendered adequate financial support to the 
radical reforms. 
  [Yavlinskiy] Why should the West have done so? I do not 
believe in the current leadership, so I would not give it too 
much money. 
  [Rybak] But Russia might overcome the economic crisis more 
successfully if it receives Western aid. 
  [Yavlinskiy] Last year, $15 billion worth of capital left 
Russia. What is the point of granting credits if they 
immediately go back to the West, only this time into other 
people's pockets? 
  [Rybak] Is Yeltsin right to demand a slowdown of the 
reforms? 
  [Yavlinskiy] No. The reforms must continue at a rapid pace. 
But they must be genuine reforms. Up to now we have been 
dealing with quasi-reforms in Russia. Just imagine that you 
want to travel from Hamburg to Berlin, but you board the train 
to Flensburg instead. You keep on traveling, but you never 
reach Berlin. It makes no difference if the train is traveling 
fast or slow. First you must board the right train and in the 
right direction.
