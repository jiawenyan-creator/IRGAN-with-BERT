FT  14 MAY 92 / Observer: Mandarins unmoved
Will Premier Major's classless society accomplish something plain reason has
failed to do for 70 years: get Britain's top mandarins to change the name of
their union, the Association of First Division Civil Servants?
What the name meant was clear when the outfit was set up in 1919 because the
civil service was then organised into three divisions. But that structure
was abolished three years later, taking with it the reason for the title.
Prospects of a re-naming initially looked bright at the association's
conference in London yesterday. Proposing a change, the social security
department's Justin Wickens said the title's elitist ring deterred potential
recruits.
But in the end the reform was blocked, despite the absence of honorary
member Sir Humphrey Appleby, of Yes Minister] Tax inspector Will Richardson
substituted, arguing that the title is a well recognised brand, and adding:
'We may look like a snooty, elitist union, but at least people know which
snooty elitist union we are.'
The killing blow had come earlier, though, when Wickens told members that
with the demise of the first division of the football league, for them too
'it was time for a change'.
That very same phrase had been used by the Labour Party, said a speaker from
the floor - and look where it got them.
