  [Text] Las Margaritas -- Mexican Army troops have occupied 
the three main access roads to the Lacandona jungle to prevent 
the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] from getting 
provisions into this region. Military personnel have set up 
heavy artillery and have dug ditches to prepare for and bolster 
surveillance in this zone. 
  Yesterday, military forces dismantled El Encanto camp and 
set 
up two checkpoints in the communities of Progreso and Gabino 
Vasquez, areas in which the Zapatists presumably obtain 
provisions and medicines. The Army also set up checkpoints 
along the roads leading to Progreso, Gabino Vasquez, and El 
Yalcob, which are thought to be the three main access roads into 
the Lacandona region. The Army still has no control over the 
Guadalupe Tepeyac buffer zone. 
  According to residents in the area, the military has been 
conducting ground-based reconnaissance missions at night. The 
residents also report that soldiers are restricting nighttime 
movements in the area. 
  Meanwhile, some 40 km away, the EZLN has its own checkpoint 
to limit access to the Lacandona jungle, where its forces have 
been hiding since 12 January when the cease-fire was declared. 
In a tour of this zone by EL NORTE, it was confirmed that the 
military is maintaining a state of alert, although the second 
phase of the negotiations on a possible peace agreement is about 
to begin. As part of the military strategy, the military is 
resurfacing the dirt roads that lead to the three Mexican Army 
checkpoints. 
  One military source pointed out that the troops remain 
restless because there is much movement of EZLN-linked people in 
this zone. He said: "This region is one of the most important 
sources of people for the EZLN, and it has been noticed that 
some of them are lurking around in plainclothes. Therefore, 
uncertainty reigns."
