  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS--An aide of the Russian 
president characterised the Duma decision to pardon anti-Yeltsin 
rebels as "dashing and poorly thought out" and added that the 
new Russian Constitution will not allow them to resume 
activities. 
  Member of the Presidential Council Leonid Smirnyagin told 
TASS on Wednesday that the people who the Duma pardoned can 
never change. 
  "Such people as (hard-liner) Ilya Konstantinov are 
untamable, 
do not cede to the reasons of history and will again try to 
unite the irreconcilable under their banner", he said. 
  However, Smirnyagin added that since the new Russian 
Constitution has been adopted "it leaves no room for (Ruslan) 
Khasbulatov and (Aleksandr) Rutskoy in the new Russian 
statehood". 
  The Constitution envisages no post of the vice-president. 
  Smirnyagin added that the Duma decision "doubts the 
political 
morality of deputies".
