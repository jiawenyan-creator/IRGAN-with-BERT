FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Roussel Uclaf up 9.2% at FFr635m
Roussel Uclaf, one of France's largest chemicals companies, yesterday
reported net income up 9.2 per cent at FFr635m (Dollars 123.75m) for the
first nine months of the year.
The company said comparable net income, excluding exceptional items, was
FFr715m,a 52 per cent rise. This was after stripping out restructuring costs
and capital gains from the transfer of its crop protection and environmental
health activities.
The divisions will be transferred to part of the Hoechst group, the German
chemicals company which owns 54 per cent of Roussel Uclaf's shares, at the
end of this month.
Sales for the period were up 13.8 per cent to FFr13.1bn, or up 2.3 per cent
in comparable terms. Canal Plus, the French media and pay-TV company,
reported revenues up 8.5 per cent to FFr6.85bn for the first nine months of
the year, compared with the 1993 period.
