FT  19 NOV 92 / Spanish inquiry into ICI prices
Imperial Chemical Industries is being investigated by Spanish anti-trust
authorities for sharply, and, allegedly, unfairly, increasing prices at
which it transfers agrochemical products to its largest Spanish joint
venture, ICI Zeltia, writes Peter Bruce.
The owners of Zeltia, a Galician-based chemicals group, have accused ICI of
deliberately depressing profits at their 50/50 joint venture, whose share of
the Spanish agrochemicals market has slipped from second to fourth since the
price increases began in the spring of 1989. ICI said yesterday it believed
the complaint was without foundation.
