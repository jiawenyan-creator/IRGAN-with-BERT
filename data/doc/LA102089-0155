LIBERAL THINKINGS VS. BELIEFS OF CHRISTIANS 
Joseph N. Bell's article "The War Against Sin Offers Variety of Enemies" (Sept. 
21) was disturbing to read. In his article, Bell seemed to take delight in 
ridiculing the Rev. Lou Sheldon. I wonder if Mr. Bell realizes that his 
liberal, humanistic article and thinking is an offense to most Christians. 
Mr. Bell states that there wouldn't be much fun in the Rev. Sheldon's world. 
That couldn't be further from the truth. The closer one comes to living a life 
pleasing to God, the closer one is to genuine and lasting peace and joy. The 
happiest people I know are those who try, like the Rev. Sheldon, to follow the 
life outlined and practiced by Jesus. The unhappiest are those who try to 
rationalize why they don't see the need to do so. 
Mr. Bell just couldn't be more wrong when he says nobody has a "direct pipeline 
to God." The Bible teaches us that God hears the righteous man's prayers and 
that he answers those prayers. But Bell is correct when he states that "one 
should not follow the advice of either him or the Rev. Sheldon" and that 
instead one must think it through for oneself. That is true -- but only true 
when one seeks the guidance and wisdom of God as he searches for that truth in 
the Bible. Wise men still do seek him. Only a fool thinks he, or any mortal 
man, has such profound answers. Jesus is the source of truth, and it is He we 
must follow.
