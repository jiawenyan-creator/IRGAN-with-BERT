FT  10 NOV 93 / Howard aims to end bail abuse
THE VIEWS of victims of crime will be sought before bail is granted to the
accused as part of a crackdown on bail abuse in England and Wales.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday unveiled a five-point plan
to tackle the problem, which is expected to be included in the Queen's
Speech later this month as part of the Criminal Justice Bill.
Mr Howard said he planned to give police powers to attach conditions to bail
 -at present police have to apply to a magistrate to have conditions
attached to bail.
The proposal received a mixed response from magistrates, with some arguing
strongly that bail conditions should be left to the judiciary.
Mr Howard said that the balance in the criminal justice system had tilted
too far towards the offender and against the victim and that strong action
was needed to prevent offences being committed on bail.
He said he also proposed to accept the recommendation by the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice that, where appropriate, the views of victims
should be sought before bail was granted.
There were 43,000 breaches of police bail last year and one in 10 people on
bail committed further offences.
Mr Howard's other proposals include:
Giving police power to arrest without a warrant people in breach of police
bail.
Giving courts power to recall defendants and revoke bail if relevant new
information comes to light or there is a change of circumstances.
Removing the presumption in favour of bail for those charged with serious
offences allegedly committed while on bail.
Excluding bail for those charged with murder, manslaughter or rape, or with
a previous conviction for any of those offences.
