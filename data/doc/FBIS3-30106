  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- The Food Agency said 
Friday [25 February] it has found mold or discoloration in 141 
tons of imported table-use rice out of 50,000 tons of rice 
distributed to local prefectures in February. 
  Of the total, the agency found that of 14,000 tons of rice 
imported from California, 1.7 tons had mold. 
  Such rice was found in local bureaus in Chiba, Gifu, Aichi, 
Kochi and Kagoshima Prefectures. 
  The agency said the rice in question reached Tokyo and Kobe 
ports in December. 
  As for imported rice from China, the agency found mold in 
0.6 
tons of rice out of 16,000 tons. It also found discolored rice, 
which had turned brown or black, in 139 tons of rice from China. 
  Such Chinese rice was found in bureaus in 11 prefectures, 
including Shimane, Okayama, Hiroshima, Fukuoka and Saga. 
  No problems were found with Thai rice in local bureaus as 
the 
produce had been checked before being sent to outlying areas. 
  The agency said the amount of problem rice was within the 
expected limit, noting, "it is inevitable to have (some) mold 
after transportation on the sea surface." 
  It said problem rice has not been passed on to consumers. 
  Japan recently began importing rice on an emergency basis 
due 
to a bad crop last year owing to unusual summer weather.
