FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico
Mexican stocks reacted nervously to the decline of Telmex, the telephone
utility, in New York on news that Grupo Financiero Banacci and MCI
Communications had agreed to form a company which might offer long-distance
services in Mexico when the Telmex monopoly is broken up in late 1996. The
IPC index was off 33.81, or 1.26 per cent, at 2,659.90 at the close. Telmex
ADRs declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 3/4.
