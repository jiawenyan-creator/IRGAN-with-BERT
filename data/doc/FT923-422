FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hoskins sells 9 pubs for Pounds 2.45m
IN A MOVE to eliminate its borrowings, Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based
real ale brewer, is selling nine public houses to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley
Breweries for Pounds 2.45m cash, writes Graham Deller.
Announcing the disposal along with a 46 per cent jump in annual profits, Mr
Barrie Hoar, chairman, said: 'This will enable us to take advantage of new
opportunities which are compatible with our current activities.'
Following the deal, USM-quoted Hoskins will continue to operate the
Beaumanor brewery and a reduced estate of seven pubs. 'We will be seeking to
expand the brewing activities of the group and increase sales within the
free trade market,' Mr Hoar said.
The nine pubs contributed about Pounds 22,000 to pre-tax profits of Pounds
83,060 (Pounds 56,685) in the year to March 31, struck after interest
charges of Pounds 137,932 (Pounds 172,145).
Turnover amounted to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 2.08m). Earnings per share were
1.38p (1.23p).
