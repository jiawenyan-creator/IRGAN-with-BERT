Dissident groups in South Korea charged that a radical student was tortured and 
killed by police interrogators, and they called for peaceful protests to demand 
the fall of President Roh Tae Woo's government. About 5,000 students rallied at 
Chosun University in the southeastern city of Kwangju to denounce police for 
the death of Chol Kuy Lee, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. 
Lee, 24, a student at Chosun, had served almost two years in jail for violating 
national security laws and was being sought by police for writing articles 
praising Communist North Korea. His body was found in a reservoir near Kwangju, 
police said. A government spokesman said Roh has ordered an investigation into 
Lee's death.
