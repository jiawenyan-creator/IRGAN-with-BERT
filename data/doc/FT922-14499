FT  06 APR 92 / Lloyd's in talks on share of award
A GROUP of Lloyd's Names who are members of loss-making catastrophe
reinsurance and Outhwaite syndicates may soon be in another dispute with the
market's authorities.
It is understood that talks between Lloyd's and representatives of the
affected Names - individuals whose personal wealth underpins insurance
business - started on Friday and have not yet been concluded.
As members of the Outhwaite syndicate in 1982 they won an out-of-court
settlement this February of Pounds 116m.
They are seeking to avoid payment of claims this year and believe evidence
presented to the commercial court last week alleging irregularities in the
management of Gooda Walker syndicates has strengthened their case.
The bulk of the Pounds 116m was to be funded by 'errors and omissions' (E&amp;O)
policies. E&amp;O insurance is taken out by agencies and covers legal awards
against syndicate managers.
Some Names, who are taking action over Gooda, now claim that Lloyd's is
seeking to withhold the money due to them from the Outhwaite settlement.
Lloyd's last night said discussions were taking place 'about the status of
the monies involved in the settlement, and in particular the relation to the
Names who are party to the (Outhwaite) agreement who have unfunded
underwriting losses.'
It added: 'It is not a matter of Lloyd's seeking to withhold these funds.
Rather, it is seeking to ensure that where Names have obligations to
policyholders, those funds are available. Our concern is to ensure that each
underwriting member is in a position to meet his underwriting obligations.'
