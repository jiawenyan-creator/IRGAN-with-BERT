FT  28 JAN 92 / World Trade News: GEC Alsthom shares in Dollars 770m Iran
power order
AN international consortium including Howden Group Canada, part of the
Scottish engineering company, and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French power
engineering group, has won a Dollars 770m (Pounds 425.4m) turnkey contract
to build a 1,100MW power station in western Iran.
The contract is the first important project for GEC Alsthom in Iran since
the end of the Iran/Iraq war, and one of the biggest announced in the Middle
East since the end of the Gulf war. Over the past year, Iran has been
reactivating projects in thermal and hydroelectric power generation.
GEC Alsthom said it had won 'the major part' of the contract, while Howden
said its share was Dollars 121m. Other members of the Ontario Group
consortium include Babcock &amp; Wilcox of Canada and Italy's Nuova Cimimontubi.
The project, at Arak, is for Tavanir, the Iranian electric utility.
Construction will begin later this year and the new station is due to be
fully operational by 1996. GEC Alsthom and Howden will design and supply the
turbine island.
