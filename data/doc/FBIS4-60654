  [Text] Mr. 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi, a member of the 
presidential council, said that the declaration of the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] does not mean that south has 
split away from the north. The purpose is to prepare the Yemeni 
arena to receive a unified Yemeni state that remains on a 
democratic basis and takes the pledge and accord document as an 
approach for government in which no party seizes power to the 
detriment of other parties. 
  Mr. al-Makkawi added in a talk to the Egyptian AL-AHRAM 
newspaper published today that the fighting which broke out in 
Yemen in the last weeks was only aimed at drowning Yemen in the 
blood of its sons. He pointed out that the Yemeni Socialist 
Party did not begin the war and the repartition, and that those 
who took the war decision are to blame. Mr. 'Abd-al-Qawi 
Makkawi expressed confidence that Aden city will not fall and 
that the victory by military power will not be achieved.
