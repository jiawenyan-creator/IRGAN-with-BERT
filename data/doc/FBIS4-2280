  [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur gave assurances Thursday his government would 
not "interfere" in China's internal affairs, including the human 
rights issue, a Chinese official said. "France has no intention 
to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and 
France is willing to discuss the issues with other countries on 
an equal footing," Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin 
quoted Balladur as telling Premier Li Peng in a meeting 
Thursday. Wu said the comment came as the two sides discussed 
the issue of human rights, with Li briefing Balladur on U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent visit. "It is 
obvious that China and France have different views on the human 
rights issue. We also noted that the French side will not 
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," said Wu. 
  The spokesman said the French leader did not bring up the 
recent arrest of China's leading dissident Wei Jingsheng during 
the meeting.
