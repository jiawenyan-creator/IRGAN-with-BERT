SOUTHERN SECTION SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
TONIGHT'S BOYS' GAMES; 
MISSION VIEJO WILL MEET SANTA BARBARA FOR 3-A TITLE 
Mission Viejo High School is the only team of five seeded Orange County boys' 
soccer teams to advance to the finals of the Southern Section playoffs. 
The Diablos (22-1-3), the top-seeded team in the 3-A, meet unseeded Santa 
Barbara (21-1-6) in the 3-A championship at 8 tonight at Gahr High School in 
Cerritos. 
The Diablos field a strong and unselfish offensive unit. Fifteen of the team's 
16 field players have scored at least once. 
Midfielder Joe-Max Moore leads the way with 24 goals and 10 assists, followed 
by Andy Wortrich with 13 goals and 15 assists. 
Whittier Christian, top-seeded in the Small Schools division; Brea-Olinda, 
top-seeded in the 2-A; Pacifica, third-seeded in the 2-A; and Santa Ana, third 
seeded in the 3-A, all have been eliminated. 
Though the seeded teams have been upset, unseeded teams, such as Edison, have 
take up the slack. The Chargers, the No. 1 team from the Sunset League, 
advanced to the final in the 4-A. 
In the 2-A, unseeded Esperanza (16-3-2), the top team from the Empire League, 
plays Central (21-1-1) for the championship tonight at Gahr at 6. 
Second-year Coach Kino Oaxaca's Aztecs are out to prove to the rest of the 
Empire League that they are a quality team. 
Despite winning the Empire League, the Aztecs were overlooked by the league 
coaches when it came time to select the all-Empire League soccer squad. The 
coaches selected only one Aztec, Darin Martinez.
