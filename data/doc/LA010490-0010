WATT CENTER'S IMPACT ON L.A. 
Having read Bill Boyarsky's column ("Art Snyder, in the Sprint for Growth," 
Metro, Dec. 15), I hasten to suggest the prime weakness in its comment on the 
City Council's approval of the Watt City Center project. 
The project will not "dump an estimated 250,000 vehicles a day onto the Harbor 
Freeway. . . ." In fact, it is so tightly circumscribed by traffic mitigation 
measures that when it is finally built and 100% occupied, with its traffic 
demand management program in place, in the evening peak hour it will generate 
at any single point in time, less than 10 cars southbound on the Harbor Freeway 
between the project location at the 8th Street southbound on-ramp and the Santa 
Monica Freeway. 
The Chicken Little approach to municipal planning, which calls for planners, 
journalists, and "activists" to run about flapping their wings and shouting 
that "the sky is falling," does little to promote the much more difficult 
process of hard work and long-term planning for traffic movement and economic 
growth intertwined, which is exemplified by the Watt City Center project -- and 
which is critical to the future of downtown Los Angeles. 
The Watt project was approved by the City Council simply because it did its 
work and participated in that planning, and by its construction does more to 
solve downtown traffic problems than it does to create them. (Ditto, by the 
way, for housing problems, child care, job training, public spaces, urban 
beautification, and a number of other issues not mentioned in Boyarsky's 
column.) 
The importance of my role in the project was not the selling of it to the 
council, but the structuring of it in its conception as a program whose 
approval would be to the advantage of the entire city, not just to the builder 
-- and which would be and was finally approved on it own merits.
