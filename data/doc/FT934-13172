FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Anglovaal subsidiary in R393m
rights issue
TARGET Exploration, a subsidiary of the Anglovaal group, has announced
details of a R393m (Dollars 117.3m) rights issue. The proceeds will go
towards the preparation of an area which may be developed as a R1.5bn gold
mine.
The rights issue follows an initial exploration effort which has produced
encouraging results.
It comes in the wake of a firmer trend in the gold price in recent months
which has prompted South Africa's mining houses to re-examine some of their
potential mines.
If Target's next phase of development confirms the promise of early
exploration work, it may open a 135,000-tonne-per-month mine, costing R1.5bn
with a life of over 20 years and a recovered ore grade of 11.58-8.85 grams
per tonne.
Target's lease area is in the Bothaville gap, an area of the Orange Free
State between the existing Welkom and Klerksdorp goldfields.
Target's main shareholders, Anglovaal and Anglo American, are both
supporting the issue. They will provide R310m. The balance of R83m will be
underwritten by Anglovaal.
After the rights issue, Anglovaal's shareholding will fall to 48 per cent
from 56 per cent , while Anglo American's will rise to 30 per cent from 17
per cent.
Loraine gold mine, which holds 17 per cent of Target, will not be following
its rights. These will be designated, at cost, to its shareholders.
