  [Text] Washington, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Withdrawal of 
China's most favored nation (MFN) trade status will probably 
raise the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) by 2.2 percentage 
points, according to a study released here today. 
  According to the study done by CS First Boston Corporation 
Economist Neal M. Soss, raising the cost of Chinese imports, if 
with no other effects, will raise the U.S. CPI by 0.15 
percentage points. 
  "If the increased tariffs on Chinese items created a pricing 
umbrella so that all other toy and apparel and footwear prices 
went up commensurately, the effect would be to raise the CPI by 
2.2 percentage points," the economist said. 
  "For reasons of inflation control, it would be better if the 
political discussions with China were resolved in a way that 
permitted the continuation of China's MFN status," the economist 
said in a press release. 
  According to U.S. statistics, the 1993 U.S. merchandise 
trade 
deficit was 115.8 billion U.S. dollars, with China accounting 
for 22.8 billion dollars, or 19.7 percent. 
  China now accounts for 1.9 percent of total U.S. merchandise 
exports and 5.4 percent of imports. The U.S. accounts for about 
one-third of China's merchandise exports. 
  The average U.S. tariff rate is now 8.8 percent and would 
almost sextuple to 50.5 percent if MFN was withdrawn. The bulk 
of U.S. imports from China are toys, apparel, footwear and 
electronics. 
  China products account now for 48 of all the toys sold in 
the 
U.S.. Chinese products account for almost 15 percent of 
imported apparel and footwear in the U.S., the New York-based 
economist explained. 
  The threat to China's MFN status along with the invocation 
of 
Super 301 "led some observers to fear the U.S. is sliding down a 
slippery slope toward protectionism with adverse consequences 
for our inflation outlook among other potential harms," Soss 
said.
