SURPLUS SCHOOL SITE SOLD TO BUILDER FOR $9 MILLION 
The Board of Education of the Downey Unified School District has given its 
final approval for the sale of a surplus elementary school site to a Los 
Angeles-based home builder for $9 million. 
The district will receive $6.75 million from M.J. Brock &amp; Sons Inc. once 
the sale clears escrow, which could take as long as two years, said Gary 
Orsinger, assistant superintendent of administrative services. 
The remaining $2.25 million will be paid as M.J. Brock sells the homes proposed 
for the 10.5-acre Edith Unsworth School site, which is in a residential area at 
9001 Lindsey Ave. 
The agreement approved by the Board of Education also enters the district into 
a limited partnership with M.J. Brock. In addition to the money from the land 
sale, the district will receive 35% of any profits generated by the proposed 
housing project, Orsinger said. Orsinger did not have a projection of those 
profits. 
M.J. Brock must still secure necessary permits from the city to build the 
project. 
District officials plan to use about $4 million of the money to renovate 
several buildings at Downey High School. The rest will pay for other building 
improvements throughout the district. 
The district stopped using Unsworth as an elementary school in June, 1972, 
after a decline in enrollment. It then was used to house special education 
offices, which have been relocated to the district's newly expanded 
administration center.
