FT  11 JUN 93 / US presses N Korea on N-treaty
THE US yesterday pressed North Korea again to reverse its decision to
withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but apparently without
success.
After face-to-face talks all day, the two sides agreed to resume
negotiations today in what will be, for the Americans, a last-ditch effort.
Pyongyang's withdrawal from the pact is due to go into effect tomorrow.
Mr Robert Galucci, US assistant secretary of state, discussed the problem at
the offices of the US mission to the UN with Mr Kang Sok Chu, North Korean
vice-minister for foreign affairs. Afterwards, Mr Galucci reported to the
representatives of Britain, France, China and Japan on the results of the
meeting.
After two sessions last week, he had recorded 'no significant progress'. It
was not clear whether the agreement to hold a fourth meeting today might
mean there was at least some hope North Korea would delay its withdrawal.
Although the meetings are not under UN auspices, the US has the backing of a
Security Council resolution, of May 11, that called on North Korea to
reconsider and to co-operate with the International Atomic Energy Agency in
its verification programme.
