first paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Text] At a meeting of the Belarusian Security Council, 
the Foreign and Defense Ministries have been asked to examine in 
detail the issue of possible Belarusian membership in NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative. 
  Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb noted that, to 
fulfill 
the request, Belarusian specialists may even have to go abroad. 
They will have to examine issues concerning the training of 
personnel and holding consultations on possible financial and 
technical assistance. 
  The "Partnership for Peace" initiative, the state leader 
believes, includes aspects that are both admissible and not 
entirely admissible to the Republic. The participation of 
Belarusian servicemen in peacekeeping missions aimed at 
preventing conflicts on territories of other states was 
described by Mechyslaw Ivanavich as one of the inadmissible 
aspects. 
  If a decision is made to join the initiative, the document 
may be signed as early as this year, Mechyslaw Hryb stated.
