FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Falling prices hit Kaiser
Aluminum
FALLING aluminium prices and lower output drove Kaiser Aluminum deeper into
the red in the second quarter, writes Richard Waters. Net loss per share on
ordinary operations rose to 34 cents from 29 cents in the first three
months.
'The continued weakness of market prices for most all aluminium products',
was partly to blame for a fall in turnover, to Dollars 432.2m from Dollars
490.9m a year ago, Mr Stephens Hutchcraft, chairman, said . Turnover for the
first half was down to Dollars 874.8m from Dollars 954.6m.
The company suffered a net loss of Dollars 19.4m, compared with a deficit
(before an extraordinary charge and accounting changes) of Dollars 16.6m in
the first three months. Year-ago net income totalled Dollars 12m, or 21
cents. The net loss of Dollars 36m in the first half compared with a net
profit of Dollars 20.4m.
Aluminium prices averaged 51 cents a pound in the second quarter, 8 cents
lower than in the same period in 1992.
The company has not brought back to full capacity two plants in the
north-west, partly as a result of lower prices.
The timing of shipments also reduced the volumes of aluminium and other
products sent.
