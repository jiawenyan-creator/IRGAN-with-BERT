FT  19 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
It was a quiet session in the derivatives sector as investors assessed the
implications of the latest unemployment figures from the UK against the
background of Wall Street's latest burst of strength. An early gain in the
FT-SE June futures contract helped equities very briefly but the contract
soon fell from the day's best and trading volume quietened down.
By the end of the session, the premium on the futures contract had shrunk to
only 28 points against the underlying cash price, virtually eliminating the
premium against the Fair Value calculation which allows for dividend flows
and carrying costs.
Traders commented that London investors, already feeling less certain about
the outlook for UK equities over the short term, are now also unsure Wall
Street's underlying strength. In addition, some uncertainties over the
outlook for sterling were voiced by securities analysts in London yesterday.
The Traded Options market also had a poor trading session. Some interest was
shown in the Euro FT-SE contract and two London houses traded heavily in the
British Telecom option.
There was some activity in Land Securities and in Asda where matched trades
were operated. Elsewhere, however, the sector lacked features.
