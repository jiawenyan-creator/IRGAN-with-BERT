FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: The ideal four-point framework for
fair provision
THIS is the pensions framework I would like to see for the present and
future generations of pensioners.
1 A high level of flat rate basic pension well above the poverty level, say
three-quarters of national average earnings.
This pension would be available to all persons, with married men and women
not in employment receiving credit from their spouses' contributions.
It would be funded on the present pay-as-you-go system with the current
generation of employed and self-employed paying for the current pensions.
2 The employee or the self-employed would make his or her own arrangements
to provide for any additional pension, either individually or collectively
through employers or trade or professional bodies.
Collective arrangements would ensure that people changing jobs are treated
fairly and that the value of pensions is maintained. But otherwise, they
should have flexibility in their benefit structure.
Employees would fund these additional pensions themselves and not rely on
future generations for the payment of earning-related pensions.
As such, a state earnings-related scheme would not exist unless it could be
properly funded.
Above all, the government, employers and individuals must face up to the
cost of providing pensions and not try to fudge the issue by deferring
costs.
