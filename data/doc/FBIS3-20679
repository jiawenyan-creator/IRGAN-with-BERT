<F P=106> [Article by M. Lazanski: "With Missiles at Serb Humanitarian </F>
Aid Helicopter"] 
  [Text] The camera of Ognjen Radosevic, photographic 
reporter of SRPSKA VOJSKA, the journal of the army of the 
republic of Srpska, took an exclusive photograph [reproduced in 
POLITIKA] in the sky above Romania [a mountain in Bosnia]. On 
this occasion, a Turkish F-16 fighter-bomber, as part of the 
NATO patrol that continuously flies in the skies over the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, encountered a humanitarian aid MI-8 
helicopter of the army of the republic of Srpska with visible 
Red Cross markings. Nonetheless, the Turkish pilot fired two 
short-range air-to-air Sidewinder missiles at the humanitarian 
aid helicopter. The Serbian pilots, through skillful antimissile 
maneuvers, avoided both Sidewinder missiles, and the lighted 
trail of these projectiles is seen in the lower left corner of 
the photograph. The Turkish F-16 fighter did not want to risk a 
new attack and got away from the area of this unusual aerial 
settling of accounts.
