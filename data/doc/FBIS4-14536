  [Text] Tallinn, 30 March -- Head of the 3d department of 
Estonian Defence Forces Headquarters Valdo Reiman told ETA that 
state defence departments intended to call about a thousand 
Estonians to the regular military service this spring. 
  Every year there are about 4,000 conscripts in Estonia and 
they are called to join the Army twice a year, in spring and in 
autumn. 
  Less than three thousand conscripts serve in the Estonian 
Defence Forces, the rest being professionals, volunteers, etc. 
  Only Estonian citizens that have become 19 years old can be 
conscribed to military service. 
  Reiman said that a major problem is constituted by men who 
have Estonian citizenship, but whose knowledge of Estonian is 
poor or who do not speak Estonian at all. He added that these 
people amounted to 10-15 per cent of the defence forces, the 
largest number of them in Viru and Kalevi battalions that are 
located at the north-eastern predominantly Russian-speaking 
region. Head of the Kalev battalion Alar Laneman admitted that 
Russians were mostly good soldiers and the authorities have 
tried to distribute them to the units so that they would be 
forced to speak Estonian to learn the language.
