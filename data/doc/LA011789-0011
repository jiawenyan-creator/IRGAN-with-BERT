MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK 
A new record of pop, rock and jazz standards by former Beatle Paul McCartney, 
released exclusively in the Soviet Union, is fetching up to $250 a copy in the 
United States -- if fans can find one. Dealers say copies of the first edition 
of the album ("Back in the U.S.S.R."), released in November by the state-run 
Soviet label Melodiya, have all but vanished into Beatle heaven. The record was 
made with the understanding that it would not be exported out of the Soviet 
Union, and a first edition run of 50,000 copies sold out almost immediately in 
the Soviet Union at a cover price of 4 rubles ($6.60). McCartney, 46, made the 
record as a gesture of good will to the Soviet Union and its policy of 
glasnost, or openness. ALEENE MacMINN
