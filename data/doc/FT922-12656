FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: PepsiCo's party line prevails in
in Poland
POLISH investors learnt a bitter lesson about small shareholders' influence
over company policy at the first annual meeting of Wedel, the confectionery
producer which is 40 per cent owned by PepsiCo Foods International, the US
food snacks concern.
About 200 shareholders turned up at the annual meeting, many of them angry
that Wedel had decided not to pay a dividend out of its 1991 profit of Zl
163bn (Dollars 12.2m).
It was left to Mr James O'Neil, who heads PepsiCo Foods' north European
division, to field repeated questions about the dividend decision. 'It would
almost be a sin to take profits from this company and not invest them,' he
said.
PepsiCo itself was investing a further Dollars 17m in the business this year
or Dollars 2m more than expected under a five-year Dollars 56m
capital-spending plan, he explained.
The shareholders' plea was for a symbolic dividend or an undertaking that
dividends would be paid within two years.
'It's not that you haven't made yourself sufficiently clear but it's that we
don't agree with your decision,' a Polish investor replied to Mr O'Neil's
explanation.
Mr O Neil, who had not spent 25 years in the salty snacks business to let an
angry group of investors faze him, tried another tack. 'All I can say is
that the dividend question will be reviewed each year,' he said.
Under the voting system, weighted toward the board, it received 6.9m votes
while the shareholders managed to muster 43,141. The Polish government,
which holds 1.14m votes, voted with PepsiCo.
The small shareholders did not hide their disappointment. 'We took part in
staged meetings like this for 45 years knowing that there was absolutely no
point to them,' said one, remembering the communist past.
