COUNTY'S FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN LISTS 21 PARTICIPATING GROUPS; 
ARTS: BRUCE JOSEPH IS ANNOUNCED AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE RETAIL 
PROMOTION AND CULTURAL EVENT IN OCTOBER BEING SPONSORED BY SOUTH COAST PLAZA 
AND THE BRITISH CONSULATE IN L.A. HE COORDINATED 'UK/LA '88 -- A CELEBRATION OF 
BRITISH CULTURE,' A $7.2-MILLION GALA. 
The "Festival of Britain Orange County -- 1990," a countywide retail promotion 
and cultural event scheduled for Oct. 12 through 28, has hired an executive 
director and has announced 21 local arts and entertainment organizations that 
will participate. The festival is being co-sponsored by Costa Mesa's South 
Coast Plaza mall and the British consulate in Los Angeles. 
The executive director is Bruce Joseph, who coordinated "UK/LA '88 -- A 
Celebration of British Culture," a 12-week, $7.2-million gala that included 
presentations by Los Angeles and British arts organizations. Joseph also was 
artistic coordinator of a Soviet arts festival staged in San Diego last fall. 
He will coordinate the festival's arts component, which is being organized by a 
committee of local arts officials. Judith Peterson, director of Fullerton's 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center and co-chair of the committee, said works with 
British artists, themes or both are expected from: 
The Art Institute of Southern California, Ballet Pacifica, Bowers Museum, 
Fullerton Museum Center, Garden Grove Shakespeare Festival, Garden Grove 
Symphony, Children's Museum at La Habra, Laguna Art Museum, Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center, Newport Harbor Art Museum, Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, Orange County Philharmonic Society, Pacific Symphony, Poets Reading 
Inc., Saddleback College art gallery, South Coast Repertory, South Coast 
Symphony, Stop-Gap theater troupe, and the UC Irvine Chamber Music Series. 
Edwards Theatres and the Pacific Amphitheater also will participate "in some 
way, but we don't know how yet," Peterson said. Peterson said specific arts 
events will not be announced for a "couple of months," when participants have 
finalized their plans. All arts events will take place at participants' venues. 
Peterson said 150 groups had been sent applications. 
A budget of about $500,000 has been proposed to support the arts projects 
through grants to the groups, Peterson said, adding that organizers plan to 
raise the money from public and private sources in Southern California and 
Britain through a newly formed nonprofit organization. She would not name any 
specific funding sources but did say that Joseph, who was not available for 
comment, already has begun work on the effort. 
Peterson also declined to give a budget for the entire festival, which will 
include educational programs on British culture and a British retail promotion, 
described by organizers as one of the biggest ever staged in the United States, 
centered at South Coast Plaza mall. Officials have said that all eight mall 
department stores and more than 50 smaller shops have agreed to take part by 
selling British products.
