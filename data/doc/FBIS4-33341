  [Text] Brasilia, 5 Jun (AFP) -- The Brazilian Government 
will send an Army infantry company to assist the UN peacekeeping 
mission in Mozambique, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, based at 
the Itamaraty Palace, officially announced on Sunday. 
  The Brazilian decision to send infantry troops was in 
response to a request made by the United Nations. Brazil 
currently has 94 observers, 27 soldiers, and 67 policemen posted 
in Mozambique.

reveals the Brazilian commitment to UN operations for the 
preservation of peace and its commitment to the efforts to 
promote national reconciliation in Mozambique."
