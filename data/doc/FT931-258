FT  31 MAR 93 / US renews its backing for trade and debt initiative
THE Clinton administration yesterday reiterated its support for the
Enterprise for Americas initiative, the trade, debt and investment programme
launched by President George Bush in June 1990.
In a speech delivered in Hamburg yesterday on behalf of Mr Larry Summers, US
undersecretary designate for international affairs the US also underlined
support for the North American Free Trade Agreement subject to
understandings in the areas of environmental quality and workers' rights.
Washington said it hoped 'to be able to negotiate and extend the benefits of
Nafta to other nations as well.'
The speech called for greater attention to be paid to the region's social
problems and urged the InterAmerican Development Bank to expand its support
for such programmes. 'Latin leaders must address critical issues, including
the alleviation of poverty, human rights, environmental protection and
removing government impediments to innovation and growth.'
US officials said yesterday that debt relief under the Enterprise for
Americas initiative would continue to be funded in fiscal 1994, having
survived intensive budget discussions. Contrary to a report in yesterday's
FT, agreements signed in December and January with a handful of countries
had secured funding in the 1993 budget and most had already gone ahead.
