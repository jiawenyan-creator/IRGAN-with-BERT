 

Redesignation of TSP Nonattainment Areas



EPA's final rulemaking of July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24682) promulgating the PM

10

 standard encourages states to request the redesignation of TSP nonattainment areas as unclassifiable for TSP at
the time they submit their PM

10

 SIP revisions. This is permissible because TSP is no longer the indicator for the particulate matter NAAQS. An area
designation (i.e., unclassifiable) must be maintained until the PM

10

 increment takes effect because section 163 PSD increments depend on the existence of section 107 designations. New
Hampshire has requested the redesignation of Berlin and Manchester from nonattainment to unclassifiable for TSP.
The entire State of New Hampshire was originally classified as Group III (52 FR 29383); therefore it is permissible
to redesignate these areas as unclassifiable for TSP.



Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990



The Agency has reviewed this SIP Revision for conformance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the State Submittal
preceded the date of enactment. Group III PM

10

 areas which did not show a violation of the NAAQS for PM

10

 are now designated as unclassifiable for PM

10

 under section 107(d)(4)(B)(iii).

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective 60 days from the date of this 

Federal Register

 notice unless, within 30 days of its publication, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.
If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing
two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing
a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective on October 18, 1994. 



Final Action



EPA is approving revisions to EnvA 303.01 and EnvA 1001 as New Hampshire's Group III PM

10

 SIP; and EPA is approving the State's request to redesignate Berlin and Manchester from nonattainment to unclassifiable
for TSP.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq

., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000.

This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 22142225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The US EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co. 

v. 

U.S. EPA

, 427 U.S. 246, 25666 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. Although New Hampshire submitted this request
prior to November 15, 1990, the Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. The revisions
strengthen the requirements in the New Hampshire SIP and conform to all of EPA's current regulations.
