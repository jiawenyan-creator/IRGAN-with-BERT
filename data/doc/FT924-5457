FT  26 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
At sales in Australia this week, prices have continued to move into higher
ground. The market indicator has moved more slowly, but advances have been
recorded daily, with 533 cents a kg reached yesterday. Wool sold strongly at
higher prices in New Zealand and South Africa last week, and at a Bradford
sale of British wool. The British sector is important to the combing
industry as well as trading as merchanted wool, and sterling devaluation
made prices competitive on a world basis, but market improvement has only
just been evident but trade assessments are cautious.
