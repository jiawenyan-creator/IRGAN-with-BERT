FT  03 JUN 94 / Observer: Combat ready
Admiral Leighton Smith, USN, Nato's C-in-C South, the man who has to rain
down fire and brimstone on Bosnian Serbs when they incur the wrath of
General Sir Michael Rose, recently visited Bosnia to get a clearer picture
of the people he might be bombing. He got more than he bargained for.
Rose took him to the Serbs' north-eastern corridor near Brcko, reputedly now
one of the hottest spots in the war. They found a sole elderly and somnolent
shepherd who, spotting the admiral's medals, struggled to his feet and
saluted.
'You're obviously a military man,' ventured Smith. 'May I ask who you fought
for?'
'For Germany,' replied the shepherd proudly. 'Heil Hitler]'
