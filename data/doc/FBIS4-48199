  [Text] Efforts to evacuate Tanzanian nationals in Rwanda 
continue. The government said it was making further efforts to 
repatriate 40 Tanzanian nationals who have been stranded in 
Rwanda following intensified ethnic clashes. Speaking in a 
telephone interview yesterday following reports that 40 
Tanzanians were stranded in offices previously used by 
Tanzania's diplomatic mission in Rwanda, the permanent secretary 
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation, Dr. Ibrahim Msabaha, said the government had 
already made contacts with various NGO's, including the Red 
Cross, asking them to provide assistance in the form of food and 
medicines to the Tanzanians. 
  Besides this, the government has also contacted the French 
and Belgian Embassies in Rwanda to look into the possibility of 
transporting the Tanzanians by road. More than 40 national 
flags were sent to Rwanda the day before yesterday to be used by 
vehicles that would provide transport to the Tanzanians.
