FT  24 MAR 94 / Television complaint by Fowler is rejected
The Independent Television Commission yesterday rejected a complaint by Sir
Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, that a issue of Granada TV's
World in Action lacked due impartiality, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The programme took three Tory-voting families in the marginal Conservative
seat of Dover and gave estimates of how their tax bill was going to rise as
a result of government tax changes.
Mr David Glencross, the commission's chief executive, said in his letter to
Sir Norman: 'It is not our conclusion that the programme breached the 1990
Broadcasting Act nor the ITC programme code that derives from it.' He said
politicians did not have 'a right of veto' over the content of a programme
because they refused to appear in it.
The commission expressed reservations about a visual element of the
programme - an advertising van driving around Deal with a 'Tory Tax
Bombshell' image - but decided this did not amount to a breach of
impartiality rules.
