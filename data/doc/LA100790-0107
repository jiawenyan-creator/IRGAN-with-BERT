WAC ROUNDUP; 
COLORADO STATE CONTROLS GAME, BEATS UTAH, 22-13 
Colorado State's balanced, ball-control offense paid dividends again Saturday 
as the Rams remained unbeaten in the Western Athletic Conference with a 22-13 
victory over Utah at Fort Collins, Colo. 
Brian Copeland rushed for 99 yards and Tony Alford added 82 for Colorado State, 
4-2 overall and 3-0 in the WAC. 
The Rams sacked Utah quarterback Jason Woods seven times, intercepted three of 
his passes and recovered two fumbles. 
Utah (2-4, 0-3) continued to experience offensive problems. The Utes' only 
consistently productive weapon was a pass to the tight end, one of which 
resulted in a 72-yard touchdown play from Woods to Mike Anglesey early in the 
fourth quarter. 
Air Force 24, Navy 7 -- The victory at Air Force Academy, Colo., gives the 
Falcons the edge in the race for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, awarded 
annually to the service academy team with the best record in round-robin play 
with the other academies. 
Joe Wood kicked field goals of 34 and 32 yards in the second quarter to help 
the Falcons (3-3) to a 13-0 halftime lead. He then hit a 47-yarder in the 
fourth quarter clinch the victory over Navy (2-3). 
The Falcons scored the first time they touched the ball on offense. Fullback 
Chris Howard dived over from the one-yard line after Mike Rodgers blocked 
Jefferson Triplett's punt and Joe Stattmiller recovered at the one. 
New Mexico 48, UTEP 28 -- The Lobos (2-4, 1-0) snapped a four-game losing 
streak as Jeremy Leach completed 21 of 32 passes for 284 yards and three 
touchdowns. Also, the Lobos' usually dormant running game accounted for a 
season-high 282 yards against Texas El Paso (2-4, 0-3). 
Aaron Givens led the Lobo ground attack with 124 yards.
