FT  29 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Housing doubts remain
THE LATEST reports on UK house repossessions and mortgage arrears found a
cautious response in the stock market. Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance, the
two composite insurers most exposed to mortgage indemnity losses, were
unsettled by profits downgrades and a shift of stance by Credit Lyonnais
Laing, the stockbroker.
Mr David Hudson, insurance specialist at Credit Lyonnais, downgraded profits
estimates for both companies. After reviewing the news on repossessions and
arrears, he was less optimistic on the recovery in the mortgage indemnity
business, which has caused heavy losses at both groups.
He lowered his 1993 profits forecast for Sun Alliance from Pounds 63m to
Pounds 25m, moving his stance from 'hold' to 'sell', and for Royal cut his
1993 estimate by Pounds 20m to Pounds 35m and shifted his stance from 'buy'
to 'hold'.
Royal lost 9 to 276p and Sun Alliance 8 to 331p. The former reports 1992
results on February 25 and Sun on April 2.
Recent dollar strength and good results from Marsh and McLennan, the US
insurance broker, prompted keen buying of the insurance brokers, where CE
Heath rose 9 to 347p and Willis Corroon 5 to 205p. Steel Burrill Jones
jumped 15 to 253p.
Rolls-Royce strong
In a strong aerospace sector, shares in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce
moved sharply forward by 7 1/2 to 125p in brisk trade of 5.8m shares on
strong hints that it had clinched a lucrative engine order from USAir.
The US airliner was said to have ordered 15 Boeing 757s, with an option on
another 15, and they are to be powered by Rolls-Royce's 535 engines. An
announcement of the order is expected today.
However, there were reports that some of yesterday's buying had come from
the US, a factor that does not bode well for Rolls-Royce. Any further buying
from overseas may breach the ceiling of about 30 per cent on foreign
ownership, which was last reported to be around 29 per cent.
Lasmo news
The resignation of Lasmo chief executive Mr Chris Greentree shocked the
market and triggered strong suggestions that his departure could see the
final dividend cut, possibly by half, when the preliminary figures are
announced on March 24. Mr Greentree was regarded as the architect of Lasmo's
expansion in the late-1980s and the acquisition of Ultramar last year.
Lasmo was strong initially, touching 169p amid vague takeover rumours, but
fell sharply to 153p on the resignation news before stabilising and closing
8 down at 155p. Turnover reached 21m, the heaviest day's trade since
September 1988 when British Gas staged an ultimately unsuccessful dawn raid
on the shares.
Dr Rob Arnott at Hoare Govett, who yesterday published a bearish note on
Lasmo, said: 'Until the dividend decision is taken we believe Lasmo shares
will fall further.' Mr Simon Flowers at NatWest Securities said: 'We thought
the chances of a divident cut were 50-50 before this news; now the chances
are much greater.' Mr Fanton Chuck at Strauss Turnbull, said he was
'supportive' of Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's new chief executive, and that although
the shares 'are still too expensive we are no longer rock-bottom bearish'.
Hanson steady
Conglomerate Hanson, which earns 25 per cent of its profits from tobacco
subsidiary Imperial Tobacco, shrugged off worries over a UK legal settlement
in favour of a passive smoking claim and maintained its recent firm trend.
Analysts said that no amount of bad news could compete with the bare fact
that on a prospective return of 6.2 per cent Hanson shares were yielding
more than cash in the bank. The shares broke through what is considered a
significant 240p barrier on Wednesday, when the company held its annual
meeting. Yesterday they improved a further 1 1/2 to 246p. However, tobacco
groups Rothmans International and BAT Industries were hit by the news of a
Pounds 15,000 out-of-court payment. Tightly traded Rothmans fell 16 to 612p
while BAT lost 12 at 975p.
VAT ruling
News that leisure groups Thorn EMI and Granada had won their appeal against
the UK Customs and Excise office came too late to help the shares, which
dipped 3 to 815p and 4 to 352p respectively. The authorities had demanded
more than Pounds 50m as part of VAT due on the companies' rental businesses.
The companies made no provision in last year's accounts for the possibility
of losing the appeal and some analysts had drawn attention to the
nervousness in the shares while the outcome of the legal ruling was awaited.
The well-signalled rights issue from Asda finally arrived, with the
supermarket group making a three-for-10 cash call to raise Pounds 347m. The
market was very receptive to the move, with the company stressing its desire
to accelerate its refurbishment and new store programme.
Asda's accompanying statement that profits would be at the top of market
forecasts sent analysts reaching for their pens. BZW increased its 1994
forecast from Pounds 144m to Pounds 190m. The shares strengthened 5 to 67
3/4 p with 78m shares dealt in the market and the equivalent of a further 5m
changing hands in the form of traded options. However, some specialists
expressed surprise at the strength of the rest of the food retail sector -
which suffers a lot of switching between stocks - in reponse to the Asda
move.
Dealers reported little new enthusiasm for the stories suggesting a rights
issue at Burton Group, although there were hints that the company's advisers
may have struggled to find sufficient support for a cash call. Burton
appreciated 1 1/2 to 75p.
Hotel group Stakis attracted attention with improved results, a rights issue
and a big disposal. While analysts were satisfied with the group's recovery
from its financial difficulties, the sale of its nursing homes raised doubts
over the longer term strategy. The shares added 4 at 45p. Analysts upgraded
forecasts to a range of Pounds 7m to Pounds 10m for next year.
Among metals and engineering stocks, British Steel was heavily traded and
saw turnover of 20m shares as the stock firmed 2 1/2 to 71 1/2 p. The demand
was said to have come after a bullish presentation at BZW.
Vague talk of financial worries at BM Group led to a sharp retreat for the
shares early in the day. At the day's worst they were down 49 but they later
recovered to close 10 off at 50p. The improved outlook for the motor trade
led to strong demand for truck manufacturer ERF and the shares jumped 30 to
200p.
Construction and housebuilding issues were given a big boost by a Credit
Lyonnais Laing note recommending eight of the housebuilders as strong buys.
The broker's housebuilding research team, in its outlook for 1993 and 1994,
said it expected housing starts to increase by 8 to 10 per cent and house
prices to stabilise.
Laing recommended Barratt, 2 firmer at 116p, Bellway, 2 up at 345p,
Berkeley, 10 higher at 351p, Persimmon, 10 to the good at 225p, Wilson
Bowden, 3 firmer at 393p, Wilson Connolly, 3 better at 154p, and Wimpey, 5
higher at 122p.
Continued speculation that the Al Yamamah 2 defence order from Saudi Arabia
was about to be announced boosted British Aerospace and the shares moved
forward 8 to 235p.
A stock overhang continued in BAA and the shares fell 10 to 780p. Some
attributed the the weakness to switching out of BAA and into British
Airways, which closed 6 1/2 higher at 277 1/2 p.
