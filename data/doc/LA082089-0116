CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN SEARCH OF J. D. SALINGER BY IAN HAMILTON VINTAGE: $8.95 
This biography became something of a cause celebre in 1986, when Salinger 
emerged from two decades of seclusion and attempted to block its publication. 
After a series law suits, Hamilton rewrote the text, shifting the focus to his 
labors as the biographer of an unwilling subject. The result is an arch 
solipsism that attempts to cash in on the continuing popularity of "The Catcher 
in the Rye." 
Salinger is so obsessed with protecting his private life that he has committed 
the literary equivalent of seppuku and refused to publish any fiction for 
almost 30 years. In a series of coy dialogues with himself, Hamilton decides 
that Salinger's search for privacy is really a sort of dare to "catch me if you 
can." He can't. He assembles an array of facts about the man's life from 
secondary sources, but his subject eludes him, and there is little, if 
anything, in this book that will enhance the reader's enjoyment of Salinger's 
fiction.
