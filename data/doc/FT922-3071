FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BM bid for Thwaites is referred to the MMC
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the secretary of state for trade and industry,
yesterday referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission the proposed
acquisition of Thwaites, the Leamington Spa-based site dumper company, by BM
Group, the construction equipment manufacturer.
It is thought that BM consulted the Office of Fair Trading confidentially
over whether it would run into problems with the proposed purchase but that
in order for OFT to ascertain this, it could not remain confidential.
The DTI considers that it 'raises competition issues in the supply of site
dumpers in the UK'. Beyond that official statement, its press office could
throw little light on the referral.
The combined BM/Thwaites group would have between 80 and 85 per cent of the
UK site dumper market, though Thwaites currently has about 50 per cent in
dumpers with  3/4 to 8 tonnes payload.
However Mr Roger Shute, chairman of BM, said the two companies make
different types of dumper - for example BM's are two wheel drive and
Thwaites' are four.
And he claimed that in areas where BM was weak, Thwaites was strong and vice
versa.
He was not surprised by the referral but added that it ran across the idea
of looking beyond the UK market to Europe and the rest of the world.
He would be most interested in Thwaites' export side. Only about 20 per cent
of BM's business is in the UK.
Also BM had not made a firm offer; bids for Thwaites had been invited and a
handful of companies are on the shortlist.
Because of this Mr John Webb, managing director of Thwaites, said he was
unable to comment at this stage.
The MMC will make its report by September 11.
