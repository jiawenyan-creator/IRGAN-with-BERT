Company meetings are annual general meetings unless otherwise stated.
RESULTS DUEICI, the chemicals giant, announces its first quarter results on
Thursday. Pre-tax profits are expected to be between Pounds 195m and Pounds
225m compared with Pounds 198m for the same period last year. The figures
will include an exceptional profit of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m on
the disposal of the salt business.
Analysts' attention will be focused on the pharmaceutical division which in
recent quarters has been producing most of the group's profits. Its trading
profits are likely to be up on a weak quarter last year, although the
results for this March are likely to be poor following price rises in the
US.
The performance of the agrochemicals division, which generates much of its
profits in March, will also be closely watched, as will industrial chemicals
to gauge the extent of the pick-up in the US economy.
Interim figures from Associated British Foods, the Sunblest bread to British
Sugar group, on Monday are hard to call following the change of year-end to
September last year. The half year will include a full contribution from
British Sugar, acquired in January 1991, but the income from the diminished
cash pile will be lower.
Milling and baking has been a difficult business so estimates are for a fall
in pre-tax profits from the Pounds 185m comparable figure. The range is
wide, from Pounds 160m to Pounds 175m.
Kwik Save, the discount food retailer, has been the subject of many rumours
recently, some of which - such as the management succession  - might be
explained with Thursday's interim figures. The expectation is for pre-tax
profits rising from Pounds 48.1m last time to around Pounds 52m.
Bad debts will be closely watched at Travis Perkins, the builders' merchant,
which reports on Wednesday. It is forecast to reveal a sharp decline in
annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 20.4m to around Pounds 13m. However,
investors should be reassured by the lack of gearing and the maintained
dividend.
