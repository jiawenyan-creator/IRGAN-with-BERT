  [Text] President Itamar Franco asked today for support from 
the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate for the 
approval of the Social Emergency Fund. 
  President Franco met today for almost three hours with 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the presidents of 
the Chamber of Deputies and Senate to discuss alternatives that 
would guarantee the implementation of the government economic 
plan. 
  Franco delivered a letter to Deputy Inocencio Oliveira and 
Senator Humberto Lucena calling for the urgent approval of the 
constitutional amendment proposal that creates the Social 
Emergency Fund to balance the budget and to maintain a zero 
deficit. With the rejection of the provisional measures 
increasing the income tax rates on large companies and creating 
a control tax on banks, the public treasury will end up with a 
deficit of $410 million. The provisional measures were not 
voted on in Congress for lack of a quorum, and cannot be 
presented again because of the annuity principle [principle by 
which a tax cannot be implemented in the same year it is 
approved by Congress]. 
  Franco says in the letter that he was not only surprised, 
but 
also concerned over congressional approval of a tax increase for 
workers but not for large companies. Franco called for the 
urgent approval of the complementary draft law that increases 
social contributions from the profits of financial institutions, 
and that a constitutional amendment be included in the Social 
Emergency Fund allowing the banks to collect the Social 
Integration Program, PIS. 
  Franco also called for the approval of the 1994 budget with 
the changes proposed by the government. Franco reaffirmed his 
belief that there still is time to reverse positions, and called 
on the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate to 
double their efforts, along with the party.
