PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT 
What prompts me to write is my support of the democratic system of government 
in the Philippines. 
The attempted military coup in the Philippines will soon turn in a mangled mess 
of issues. I am afraid that many will miss the central issue, and it is this: 
The rebellion against the Philippine government is an act against the 
democratic system of government. 
In 1986 the Filipino people dramatically and at grave risk to their lives chose 
Aquino to be president. They got rid of the Marcos dictatorship and reinstated 
democracy in the Philippines. It is, therefore, not right for these rebels to 
subvert the will of the Filipino people. If the people are dissatisfied with 
the current government, let them speak; let them decide. There are venues for 
change; there is a peaceful system for change. 
Bloody rebellions should not be the vehicle for change.
