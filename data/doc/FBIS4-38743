  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 1 June TASS--Turkey is 
interested in Moldavia's [Moldova's] prosperity and territorial 
integrity and is ready to provide it with broad assistance, 
visiting Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said. 
  In his address to the Moldavian Parliament on Wednesday, 
Demirel said that Turkish business circles are ready to invest 
in Moldavia's economy, especially its southern areas inhabited 
mostly by the Gagauz, Turkish-speaking minority. At the same 
time he stressed that the Gagauz must respect the territorial 
integrity of Moldavia. 
  Demirel called for granting Gagauz areas special legal 
status. He pointed out that Turkey's interest in the Gagauz 
should be viewed as a sign of the big importance it attaches to 
territorial integrity, peace and economic and social development 
of Moldavia. The Gagauz people must become a bridge of 
friendship and cooperation, which will help in strengthening 
ties between the two nations, he said. 
  Speaking about prospects for setting up an economic union of 
the Black Sea countries, the Turkish president said such a union 
would provide a new scheme of economic relations in the world. 
  Demirel is in Kishinev on a three-day official visit. During 
the visit, the sides will sign a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation and discuss Turkish investments in the Moldavian 
economy.
