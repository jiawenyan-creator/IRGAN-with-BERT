FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Rising markets lift Aberdeen Trust profits
79% to Pounds 3.1m
Aberdeen Trust, the fast expanding fund management and accountancy services
group, yesterday reported a 79 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 3.1m for the year to September 30.
Turnover, from management fees on its many unit and investment trusts, and
from accountancy services, was up 32 per cent to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds
11.1m).
The group, which was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1991, had Pounds 2.2bn
under management on December 31 1993, spread across 14 investment trusts, 20
unit trusts, as well as institutional and private individuals' funds.
Most of the trusts carry the Abtrust label. The company specialises in east
Asian stock markets and in smaller UK companies.
Mr Martin Gilbert, chief executive, said the improved profit was due partly
to the fact that world stock markets had done well in 1993 and to success in
raising new funds, while the group had reduced its operating costs.
Additional funds worth Pounds 140m were committed to the group's investment
trusts during the calendar year, representing 5 per cent of all funds raised
for UK investment trusts during the year.
He believed the full benefits of reducing overheads and increasing funds
under management would flow through in the current financial year.
Operating profits jumped from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 4m but interest charges
doubled to Pounds 1m as a result of a transaction in 1992 with Century Life.
A proposed final dividend of 1p makes an unchanged 1.5p total. Earnings per
share were 61 per cent higher at 2.46p (1.53p) after allowing for
reorganisation costs of Pounds 600,000 incurred in the first half.
