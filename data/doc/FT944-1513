FT  20 DEC 94 / BCCI plan wins court approval
The latest settlement plan put to creditors of the failed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International was approved by the High Court yesterday.
The decision helps pave the way for the payment of an interim dividend to
creditors. But it will depend on courts in Luxembourg and the Cayman
Islands, the other jurisdictions involved, also clearing the plan early in
the new year.
It is understood that under the plan proposed by the BCCI liquidators
creditors could eventually receive a dividend of between 30 per cent and 40
per cent of the money they lost. The interim dividend is expected to be
about 20 per cent.
In approving the plan Sir Richard Scott, the vice-chancellor, said the
proposed settlement had the backing of the vast majority of creditors. This
was a matter of 'very great significance' and he would need a very strong
reason not to give the liquidators the go-ahead.
Sir Richard rejected opposition to the plan from one depositor. The strength
of feeling among former BCCI depositors was understandable but this could
not be allowed to stand in the way of attempts to 'rescue what is left from
the wreck', he said.
Sir Richard also refused to consider applications from former BCCI directors
and employees for some of the assets recovered by the liquidators to be held
separately to meet possible future compensation awards to them.
The hearing in the Cayman Islands is scheduled for January 12. Luxembourg
courts are due to deliver their judgment on the same day.
An appeal against yesterday's High Court decision can be lodged within 14
days.
