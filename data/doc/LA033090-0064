POP MUSIC REVIEW; 
KILLDOZER: THICK-ROCK FOR DREAM STATES 
When you fall asleep in the back of a rock club at 3 in the morning, the 
Wisconsin power trio Killdozer is the music that you dream: vestigial pounding 
and low guitar drone, bass like what booms from your neighbor's party 
downstairs after you've turned off all the lights and wrapped a pillow around 
your ears. Killdozer -- emphasis on doze -- plays thick-rock; its current 
album, "12-Point Buck," is something of an underground classic. 
At Bogart's on Wednesday, Killdozer's narcoleptic drummer Dan Hobson looked 
ready to fall asleep at any moment; his beat was not so much powerful as 
deliberate. Frontman Michael Gerald intoned in a mutant cross between Laibach 
and the Fall's Mark Smith, acerbic lyrics delivered in a guttural hell-voice. 
Though you can't make out a word he says, you get the feeling of great 
intelligence from Gerald, the way you would watching a young man sweat his way 
through his Ph.D orals in a language you don't understand. Performing is 
probably very therapeutic for him. Guitarist Bill Hobson entangled himself in 
his guitar strap as if it were seaweed, and then reconciled himself to playing 
with his teeth for a while. JONATHAN GOLD
