FT  30 MAR 93 / Sharp rise in Ulster failures
THE NUMBER of Northern Ireland businesses which have collapsed this year has
risen by more than 200 per cent compared with the first three months of last
year.
The number of failures this year is 172, up from 56 in the same period last
year, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group.
Small businesses have borne the the brunt of the failures with 120
bankruptcies. Among larger companies there was an increase in liquidations
from 41 to 52.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet said: 'Even with an expected upturn in trading conditions
in the UK mainland, it does not follow that any pick-up in the Northern
Ireland economy is assured in the short term.'
