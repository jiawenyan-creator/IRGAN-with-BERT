MUSIC REVIEWS; 
CALIFORNIA COMPOSERS IN SPOTLIGHT AT GINDI 
Californian composers were the focal point of Monday night's Los Angeles 
Philharmonic Chamber Music Society concert at Gindi Auditorium. And, sure 
enough, it was this native music that received the most sympathetic and 
idiomatic readings. 
The exotic and inventive Varied Trio (1986) for violin, piano and percussion by 
the Northern California-based Lou Harrison opened the concert. 
In this engaging five-movement, 15-minute work, Harrison's simple, repetitive 
melodies and harmonies are given subtle, soft color through an imaginative 
variety of instruments and techniques. The mechanical flavor of the pulsating 
second movement is captured by the use of violin pizzicato, a mallet thumping 
on the wood of the piano and chopsticks clanking against water-filled rice 
bowls. 
The finale is a rambunctious Middle Eastern dance -- Igor Stravinsky in Baghdad 
-- using tambourines, tom-toms and, effectively, baker pans. Philharmonic 
veterans Raynor Carroll (percussion), Zita Carno (piano) and Rochelle Abramson 
(violin) performed with attentive bravado and calm assurance. 
Ingolf Dahl, who spent the greater part of his life teaching at USC, was the 
other Californian represented. 
His "Concerto a Tre" for violin, cello and clarinet is a playful bit of 1940s 
neo-classicism a la Stravinsky. David Howard, exceptional on clarinet, 
violinist Barry Socher and cellist Gloria Lum were the crackerjack soloists. 
The anti-climactic closer was a poorly tuned, scrappily played rendition of the 
Piano Quintet, Opus 81, by the non-Californian Dvorak.TIMOTHY MANGAN
