METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
OPENING OF WILDLIFE SANCTUARY DELAYED 
A wildlife lake and bird sanctuary in the Sepulveda Basin will not be opened 
until the end of the month because of a delay in obtaining a permit from the 
state Regional Water Quality Control Board, authorities said. 
The corps and the city of Los Angeles had hoped to open the lake in January, 
but a meeting to discuss the permit was delayed until Wednesday because some 
participants could not attend, according to Sheila Murphy, a project manager 
with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Murphy said officials are ready to fill the lake, which would be accessible 
only by hiking trails, as soon as the water permit is granted.
