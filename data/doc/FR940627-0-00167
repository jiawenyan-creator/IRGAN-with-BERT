 

In the NPRM, EPA requested comments on the possibility of establishing special provisions for small businesses.
The regulated industry expressed concerns regarding the costs of the program and the potential impact of the F/FA
regulations on the financial status of small companies. EPA understands that small businesses might be particularly
affected by the F/FA regulations due to their smaller resource base, generally lower rate of representation in trade
organizations and, consequently, their potentially limited opportunity to participate in grouping and cost-sharing
arrangements. In view of these circumstances, EPA is including in today's rule special provisions to alleviate the
economic impact of this rule on small manufacturers of F/FAs, taking into consideration the comments received. 
 
EPA examined the distribution of currently registered F/FA companies across various sales ranges and identified
a sales level which will define a ``small business'' for the purposes of this rule. A comparison between registered
fuel manufacturers and registered additive manufacturers indicates that the distribution across sales ranges
is similar for both industries. Each industry appears to be made up of many small companies and relatively few larger
companies. Approximately a fifth of registered fuel manufacturers and a third of registered additive manufacturers
have sales above $100 million. For 
both industries, most of the companies with sales under $100 million tend to cluster under $50 million. Thus, within
each of the industries, companies tend to cluster above $100 million and below $50 million in sales. Furthermore,
companies with sales below $50 million also tend to have sales below $10 million, especially within the additive industry.


Based on the analysis of F/FA manufacturers' sales data, EPA identified $50 million as a reasonable sales level for
differentiating between small and large companies within each industry.

 As a result, this final rule defines a small business as any motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive manufacturer with total
annual sales of less than $50 million.

 The small business provisions established for this rule are defined below.

In cases where subsidiary, divisional, or other complex business arrangements exist, the business entity to which
this sales level pertains is the parent company with ultimate ownership. The ``ultimate'' parent is defined as the
uppermost headquarters or topmost company encompassing all related parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches,
or other operating units. This definition follows that used by the Small Business Administration. It also helps to
ensure that companies will not subdivide merely to become eligible for the small business provisions of this program.

``Total annual sales'' means the average of the manufacturer's sales revenue in each of the previous three years (i.e.,
the three years prior to the submittal of the supplemental notification form required under this rule).

Special provisions for small


F/FA companies were developed based on assumptions regarding the degree to which manufacturers will have the opportunity
to group with other manufacturers to share costs, and the degree to which information on similar products can be expected
to be submitted by larger companies. A review of EPA's registration data base shows that nearly every registered F/FA
manufacturer produces at least one baseline or non-baseline product. Hence, even if generous special provisions
are provided for small manufacturers of these products, EPA is assured that test data on such products will still be
submitted by other, larger companies which do not 
qualify for the special provisions. Therefore, in regard to registration of products in the baseline and non-baseline
categories, this final rule requires small businesses (i.e., companies with annual sales less than $50 million)
to submit only the basic registration data for their baseline and/or non-baseline products. Such companies are not
required to meet the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements in order to register their baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. Since
the larger companies will still be submitting the data for these products, this provision does not compromise EPA's
ability to get the necessary information to evaluate the potential health and welfare effects of baseline and non-baseline
products. 



The above assumption, however, is not valid in the case of atypical F/FAs. Analysis of current registrations shows
that there are fewer atypical products than baseline products and fewer large companies that produce atypical F/FAs.
Therefore, if the same small business provisions described above for baseline/non-baseline F/FAs were also applied
to atypical F/FAs, then there would be no data submitted for many atypical F/FAs. EPA would then be unable to evaluate
the health and welfare effects for these atypical products. Nevertheless, EPA realizes that the testing program
will be particularly burdensome for very small manufacturers of atypical F/FAs. In part, this is due to the added compliance
requirements for atypical products (e.g., more rigorous mileage accumulation requirements prior to emission generation
(see Section VI.E) and more extensive emission characterization requirements (see Section VII.B). An even greater
impact results from the fact that grouping 
opportunities for these manufacturers might be quite limited. Not only do atypical products tend to be unique, but
also, the smallest manufacturers rarely are members of the dominant trade associations which are most likely to take
the lead in organizing and administering F/FA group functions. Thus, high program costs could fall on manufacturers
with low financial resources and perhaps few opportunities to share the costs. 

Based on the above reasons, this final rule includes additional special provisions applicable to the atypical F/FAs
of small businesses. However, these provisions apply to fewer manufacturers and are less liberal than those established
for baseline and non- baseline products. Specifically, for manufacturers of atypical products with less than $10
million in annual sales (rather than the $50 million sales level applicable to manufacturers of baseline/non-baseline
F/FAs), the minimal requirements of the program include only basic registration and Tier 1 data. These requirements
fall between those applicable to small manufacturers of baseline/non-baseline F/FAs and the general requirements
of the program for larger manufacturers.
