FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Estate pre-tax drops
by 5.3%
MITSUBISHI Estate, the Japanese property developer and agent, reported a 5.3
per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profit to Y30.98bn (Dollars 286m)
despite a 43 per cent gain in sales following the recovery of domestic
demand for apartments.
Sales for the period were Y204.3bn, up from Y142.5bn in the corresponding
six months last year.
Apart from an increase in demand for standard apartments, rent income was
boosted by the completion of two large complexes, though profits were eroded
by the resulting increase in depreciation charges.
For the full year to March, Mitsubishi Estate is forecasting sales of
Y430bn, against Y349bn last year, and a pre-tax profit of Y50bn, compared
with Y70.6bn.
Net profit is expected to be unchanged at Y37bn.
