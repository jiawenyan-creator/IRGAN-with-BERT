FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: AGF blames bank arm for drop in
profits
ASSURANCES Generales de France said yesterday that a FFr963m loss by its
banking subsidiary, Banque du Phenix, was the main reason for the insurance
group's 45 per cent drop in profits to FFr1.49bn (Dollars 275m) last year
and a cut in dividend to FFr12 from FFr13.70.
But Mr Michel Albert, president, said his group had weathered the recession
and property slump better than many other French insurers, and insisted that
AGF, of which the French state owns 75 per cent directly and indirectly, was
still a prime candidate for privat-isation.
He said there was logic in the government selling off state insurers first
rather than waiting for them to enlarge their holdings by buying into
companies already privatised.
AGF claims that the balance sheet of Banque de Phenix has now been
strengthened by the sale, albeit at a discount, of some FFr3.5bn in property
assets to Comptoir des Entrepreneurs.
But the latter property company has had to be recapitalised by its owners,
among them AGF which has a 20.8 per cent stake. AGF's share in Comptoir des
Entrepreneurs loss last year was FFr217m.
Mr Albert said AGF was still on course to become 'a big federal European
insurance group,' with its new alliance with Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligung, the number two German insurance group, in which AGF now has a
controlling 25 per cent stake.
This part of AMB's results will be consolidated into AGF accounts from this
year.
AGF congratulated itself on the rise in profits in its international
operations to FFr122m from FFr56m, largely achieved by more than halving the
losses of its UK branch to FFr108m from FFr274m over the same period.
