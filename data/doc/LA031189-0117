HOT LINE KEEPS TRACK OF WILDFLOWERS IN BLOOM 
Wildflowers are starting to bloom earlier this year thanks to winter rains and 
recent high temperatures, according to the Theodore Payne Foundation, a 
nonprofit organization that perpetuates native California flora. The 
foundation's hot line -- (818) 768-3533 -- informs which flowers are blooming 
and where they may be seen. The message is updated each Thursday through May 
31.
