FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Argyll may start to depreciate assets
Retail analysts believe Argyll, owner of Safeway, may be the first of the
big UK grocery chains to start depreciating its land and buildings - a move
which could hit balance sheets and earnings across the sector.
Analysts at James Capel, the stockbrokers, issued an internal note yesterday
suggesting that Argyll, which announces its interim profits next Wednesday,
'may use these results to announce a change in accounting policy and a
modification in strategy.'
Argyll is forecast to announce an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
205.5m to about Pounds 216m. But James Capel says it believes the company is
considering adopting depreciation for freehold and long leasehold buildings.
It says a 4 per cent depreciation of assets in the current year would reduce
pre-tax profits by Pounds 25m, and earnings per share from 26.8p to 25.3p.
Other analysts said Argyll was thought to have been considering the move for
some time, and may now have decided to put it into practice.
Fears about the sustainability of grocers' margins and returns on capital
have raised the question of whether superstore assets should be depreciated
over their useful lives.
Analysts have warned that unless food retailers began steadily depreciating
their assets, they might be forced to make big one-off write-downs.
Wm Morrison is currently the only large chain to depreciate land and
buildings, but at a rate of only 1 per cent a year. Based on 4 per cent
depreciation, James Capel has suggested earnings would fall by up to 12 per
cent at Tesco, and 9 per cent at Sainsbury.
