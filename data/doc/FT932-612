FT  28 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 18m Rochdale headquarters
WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION has been awarded an Pounds 18m contract to build a new
headquarters (pictured above) for Co-operative Retail Services in Rochdale.
The scheme comprises the construction of a five-storey office complex with a
total internal floor area of nearly 16,000 sq metres. Set on a 12ha site in
Ashfield Valley, the development will be built into the hillside slopes of
the Pennines, just one mile from the town.
The project will house the 750 staff who administer the company's Homeworld
and Leo's Supermarket stores. About half the staff will be transferred from
central Manchester and other regional offices.
