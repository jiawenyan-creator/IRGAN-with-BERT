FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): 13-year hitch -
Briefcase
More than 13 years ago, I had a company which sold products to a company in
Georgetown, Guyana. It paid by cheque but the money never got further than
the Bank of Guyana, which advised me that payment was held up due to
'insufficient international funds'. The story has been the same ever since
despite repeated queries.
I estimate that I am now owed Pounds 6,000 in interest and costs and I do
not see why I should write this off. I sold the goods in good faith and the
customer paid for them. So why should a bank grab the money?
Our feeling is that 'insufficient international funds' may well be a
smoke-screen suggesting that the Guyana company is in financial difficulty.
To find out more about its financial standing, it could be worth contacting
an accountancy firm in Georgetown, the capital. These firms may be able to
assist: Jack A. Ali Sons &amp; Company, 145 Crown Street 6, Georgetown; and DRT
International, PO Box 10506, 77 Brickdam Stabroek. Georgetown. (Reply by
