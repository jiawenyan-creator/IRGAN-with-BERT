FT  11 OCT 93 / Government is warned over fragile recovery
ECONOMIC RECOVERY is fragile and the government should act with caution if
it raises taxes in the November Budget, two reports published today warn.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, found confidence about
sales prospects had increased among managing directors for the fourth
consecutive quarter. But this was offset by falls in profit and export
expectations over the past six months.
The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, the independent economic forecaster, expects
growth to accelerate to 2.6 per cent in 1994 from 1.7 per cent this year but
says 'significant risks' surround the outlook. It warns that further sharp
tax increases of Pounds 10bn spread over several Budgets would risk higher
inflation and lower growth in the middle of the 1990s.
The Dun &amp; Bradstreet poll of 1,745 managing directors between September 9
and 21 found that 37.2 per cent favoured lower spending on public services
to correct the Budget deficit against 25.7 per cent advocating higher
indirect taxation and 24.2 per cent in favour of higher direct taxes.
Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, said the survey
suggested that Britain's economic recovery might be beginning to run out of
steam in spite of the prospect of a last-quarter spending spree this year.
While two-thirds of companies expect increased sales in the current quarter,
against 15 per cent expecting a sales decline, two out of three expect no
increase in exports compared with last year and only 28 per cent expect
higher profits compared with a year ago.
After subtracting the percentage of companies forecasting declines from
those forecasting increases, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that on balance 51 per
cent of companies expect higher sales in the fourth quarter. Although this
is the strongest indicator of sales optimism since the third quarter of
1989, on balance only 14 per cent of companies expect a year-on-year
increase in profits, against 21 per cent in the second quarter of this year.
The export optimism index has declined to 18 per cent from 28 per cent six
months ago, while the balance of managers expecting new orders to rise has
fallen to 36 per cent from 41 per cent.
The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey points to little overall change in selling
prices and only modest increases in employment, with a balance of 11 per
cent of companies expecting to increase staff. There is little sign of wage
inflation: 21.8 per cent of managers forecast no change in wage levels over
the coming year while 26.6 per cent predicted increases of 1 per cent to 2
per cent, and 37.1 per cent increases of 2 per cent to 4 per cent. Only 14.5
per cent said they would give pay rises of more than 4 per cent.
The Item Club, which uses the Treasury economic model to make its forecasts,
says growth is likely to settle back to 2.4 per cent by 1995 and 2.2 per
cent by 1996. The recovery will, however, generate new jobs from next year
and will push unemployment below 2.75m by the middle of the year.
It expects the public sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94 will be
Pounds 2bn below the March Budget forecast of Pounds 50bn.
Item's central forecast, which envisages net fiscal tightening of Pounds
3.5bn in November, puts the 1994-95 PSBR at Pounds 38.7bn against Pounds
44bn in the March Budget.
