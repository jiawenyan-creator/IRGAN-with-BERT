FT  30 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
A somewhat featureless trading session in derivatives left the June contract
on the FT-SE 100 Index showing a discount of several points to the
underlying cash market yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
However, trading volume was moderate, with some 14,000 contracts transacted
by the close of after-hours' dealing.
The session opened well, with the Footsie contract supporting a firm start
by the underlying stock market and then moving to a good premium even
against the day's peak in the cash market. But there was no follow-through
and by mid-morning both cash and futures had begun to slide.
It became clear that the initial firmness reflected little more than the
backwash of a selling programme in the stock market and there was little
further strength in the markets.
By the close of official trading, the June contract had slid back to 3,117
from its morning high point of 3,156. There was no reappearance of the US
houses which had made the running on the previous day.
Activity in traded options was similarly subdued, with the number of
contracts dealt dipping to 23,741, from just over 28,000 on Monday. The
FT-SE 100 option, however, recorded 9,446 lots, compared with 8,470.
