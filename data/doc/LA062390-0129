ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; 
CITY STAFF LAUDED AS COUNCIL OKS BUDGET 
After applauding the city's financial well-being, the City Council passed a 
$22.5-million operational budget and a $24.5-million capital improvements 
budget. 
The plan for 1990-91 will fund such projects as a $5-million community center 
and the widening of Imperial Highway. 
It represents an increase of 10.4% in operational expenditures, while revenues 
are projected to increase 11.6%. More than half of the operating costs are for 
fire and police services. 
City Manager Frank Benest told council members that much of the increase in the 
budget can be attributed to state and federal mandates. 
The spending plan includes $400,000 in new expenditures for city services, with 
about $215,000 for new equipment and building improvements, and the remainder 
is for new staffing costs. 
Last year the council established budget guidelines that limited new 
operational spending to $500,000, required expenditures to equal revenue and 
required a minimum reserve equal to 13% of expenditures. 
Council members took turns congratulating the city staff on meeting or 
exceeding all three of the goals. According to city projections, income will 
exceed expenses in the next five years and reserves will range from 31% to 37% 
of expenditures. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE
