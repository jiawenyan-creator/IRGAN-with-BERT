FT  22 AUG 94 / Women 'beating men for top jobs'
Women prove more successful than men when they are competing for senior
management positions, statistics released by an executive recruitment
consultancy show.
The survey, which focused on 85 posts in the Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 75,000
salary range handled by the London office of NB Selection, found that from
the shortlisted candidates for the posts one in four women, compared with
one in six men, secured management positions.
The company also examined a sample 31 vacancies covering 3,000 applicants
and found that, proportionately, women again fared better. Some 22 per cent
of women applicants secured interviews compared with 10 per cent of male
applicants.
Ms Elisabeth Marx, head of NB Selection's psychological assessment practice,
said that while significantly fewer women applied for jobs in comparison
with men, 'it is obvious that the women who apply are of higher calibre'.
One of the reasons behind the better success rate, she suggested, was that
women tended to apply only for those jobs for which they were sure they
fulfilled all the criteria whereas men were more willing to chase jobs for
which they might not have every qualification.
She urged women to be less conservative about their job applications,
'otherwise they may be lessening their chances of securing positions which
they deserve'.
She added: 'We should not lose sight of the fact that significantly fewer
women are applying in comparison to men.'
