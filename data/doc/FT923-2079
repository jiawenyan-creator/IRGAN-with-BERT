FT  19 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: US, German clash likely
THE US and Germany are expected to clash over interest rates at today's
meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations in
Washington's Dumbarton House.
The US has been urging Germany to take more active measures to stimulate the
world economy, and Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, will argue
that Germany must make further cuts in interest rates to help growth in the
European Community.
While US treasury officials welcomed the Bundesbank's reduction in official
interest rates on Monday as 'a significant change in direction', they made
it clear that they believe more cuts are needed soon.
'I think you can say in due course in Germany you will look forward to lower
interest rates,' said Mr David Mulford, US treasury undersecretary for
international affairs. 'That's clearly the signal they sent. The timing of
that is a complex matter dependent on developments in Germany, developments
in markets and so on.'
Now Japan has met insistent demands by the US for faster growth with an
ambitious government spending package, Germany will be the chief target for
the US at today's G7.
Senior US treasury officials say the German economy is now showing clear
signs of slowing down, and the Bundesbank may not be giving itself enough
credit for success in controlling the inflationary pressures of unification.
But in the absence of any credible US commitment to reducing its vast budget
deficit - which many countries feel poses a more significant problem for the
world economy than German interest rates - Mr Brady will have little to
offer in return for the rate cuts he seeks.
