  [Text] Moscow, 5 Jan -- "The Georgian Interior Ministry is 
in possession of information on the suicide of ex-President 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia and is engaged in rechecking it," an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent was told today on the telephone by Shota 
Kviraya, the republic's interior minister. 
  It was reported that Zviad Gamsakhurdia had committed 
suicide 
on the night of 30 to 31 December 1993 in one of the western 
areas of Georgia. The ex-president's last statement, issued 
today in Groznyy, makes the point that he performed this act 
consciously as a protest against the existing regime in Georgia. 
  Nothing is yet known about the reaction of official Tbilisi 
to Zviad Gamsakhurdia's suicide.
