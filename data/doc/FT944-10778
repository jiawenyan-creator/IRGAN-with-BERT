FT  09 NOV 94 / Observer: Ghost buster
Try as it must, Britain's new-look Labour party will have a struggle on its
hands to convince the financial markets that it is not 'soft' on inflation.
Take Ruth Kelly, a bright young economics writer on the Guardian, who
moonlights by writing an occasional column for Tribune, the traditional
Labour party weekly.
In her latest offering there she notes that 'if inflation were allowed to
rise from its 27-year low in the first few years of a Labour government,
with a drop in the rate pencilled in towards the end of its term, that would
allow government and companies to tackle the bottlenecks in the economy and
raise it on to a higher growth path, uninhibited by an absurd inflation
constraint'.
This sort of thinking is not going to shock Kelly's normal followers. For
them the belief that there's nowt like a whiff of inflation to sort out the
problems of the British economy is still conventional wisdom.
But it may raise a few eyebrows at the Bank of England, where she starts
work on Monday morning as deputy head of its inflation report division. If
people working on the inflation report do not believe in the importance of
the target it is evaluating, why should anyone else?
