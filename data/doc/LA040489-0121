FOR THE RECORD 
An article on March 16 erroneously said movie producer Michael Seemann had been 
ordered by an arbitrator to pay $237,500 to a director who had been hired for a 
film that was never made. Two companies of which Seemann was an executive were 
ordered to pay, but he was not personally named in the decision.
