WEATHER FORCES SNOWBOUND ALLEN TO DELAY SIGNING 
Brian Allen, a Times' All-Valley tight end from Hart High, was forced to 
postpone signing a letter of intent with UCLA on Wednesday because of snow and 
bad road conditions. 
"I'll sign Thursday or Friday," Allen said. 
UCLA assistant coach Ed Kezirian was scheduled to visit Hart and sign Allen, 
who led Valley-area players with 62 receptions and 13 touchdowns. But roads 
leading to the Santa Clarita Valley school were closed Wednesday because of 
snow. 
"I'll sign whenever I go back to school," said Allen, 6-foot-4, 225 pounds. 
Allen said that he spent Wednesday sledding and throwing snowballs. 
Hart, along with Canyon and Saugus, were closed after three inches of snow 
blanketed the area. 
"Funny thing," Allen said, "A little snow and they call off school." VINCE
