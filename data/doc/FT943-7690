FT  22 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Delays in Denver
Denver International Airport, the opening of which has been long delayed,
ran into further trouble last week with reports that there may be problems
with the way its runways were built.
Allegations last week from the University of Colorado-Denver that some of
the runways had developed hairline fractures were dismissed by the airport.
It said: 'We are strongly confident that its runways were built right.'
The airport's opening has been delayed by a string of setbacks including
difficulties with an automated baggage handling system.
