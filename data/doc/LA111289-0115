SOUTH BAY POLITICS 
South Bay Democrats want to sic a pack of candidates on incumbent U.S. Rep. 
Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) when the former Reagan speech writer runs for 
reelection next year. 
Los Angeles County Democratic Committee member Steve Beale and Ruth McGrew, who 
chairs the Palos Verdes Democratic Club, say the strategy will give more 
exposure to Democratic issues in the heavily Republican 42nd Congressional 
District. 
And if the Democratic candidates agree not to tear one another apart, Beale 
says, that could cause problems for Rohrabacher: "There's something to be said 
for having different people who are in a good position to go after him from a 
number of different angles." 
So far, the only Democrat publicly expressing an interest in entering the race 
is Guy Kimbrough, the Mt. San Jacinto College political science instructor who 
Rohrabacher beat last year by an almost 2-to-1 margin. 
"I'm very serious about running, but the formal announcement probably won't be 
made until January," Kimbrough says, adding that he expects several Democrats 
to enter the race. "It's best to spread the Democratic message throughout the 
42nd District, and a good way to do that is to have a lot of candidates out and 
about." George Hatch
