FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Deloitte and Touche sued for
Dollars 250m
The US management consulting arm of Deloitte and Touche, the world's fifth
biggest accountancy firm, is being sued for Dollars 250m. Figgie
International, a struggling Ohio-based group, alleges that Deloitte failed
in its promise to install a world class manufacturing programme for the
company.
While it is not uncommon for accountancy firms to be sued, it is very
unusual in the case of management consultants.
Figgie says that over a three-year period beginning in late 1990, Deloitte
promised 'to develop and transfer technologies that would improve
manufacturing throughput (and) decrease inventory levels'. It claims to have
paid Deloitte fees and expenses of over Dollars 22m, and to have been billed
for a further Dollars 33m.
In the event, Figgie moved from a net profit of Dollars 63m in 1989 to a
loss last year of Dollars 129m. Having breached financial covenants, it was
forced into a financial restructuring this summer.
Figgie's business ranges from electronic systems and materials handling
equipment to insurance, sports goods and real estate.
Figgie says 'the consulting firm at various times misrepresented to Figgie
the progress and achievements of the world class manufacturing projects it
designed and implemented'. It also claims Deloitte failed to staff the
projects with professionally competent personnel.
Deloitte was unavailable for comment last night.
