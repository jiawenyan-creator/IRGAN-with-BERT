  [Excerpt] The Chat Thai Party committee investigating the 
alleged drug links of Thanong Siripichaphong is expected to 
recommend that party leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha ask the Nakhon 
Phanom MP to resign voluntarily from the House to protect the 
party's and Parliament's image. 
  Party sources said the move came after a U.S. federal grand 
jury indicted Mr Thanong on drug smuggling charges three years 
ago. The indictment was only revealed in the United States 
yesterday. 
  The sources said the Chat Thai committee headed by Sa Kaeo 
MP 
Burin Hiranburana would seek a meeting with Mr Banhan today 
where it would ask him to request Mr Thanong's resignation 
rather than expel him from the party. 
  "The committee believes Mr Thanong should resign to show 
political spirit by protecting the image of the party and 
Parliament," said one of the sources. 
  Mr Burin yesterday confirmed the proposal but said this 
would 
only be done if the evidence against Mr Thanong is credible. 
  He said the party's findings would be based on the available 
documentary evidence, press reports, wire agency reports and 
information from government agencies. 
  He said Mr Banhan would sign a letter asking the Prime 
Minister to order relevant government agencies to cooperate with 
the party by making available any information. The agencies 
include the Office of the Narcotics Control Board and Police 
Narcotics Suppression Bureau. 
  Mr Thanong is to testify before the party committee this 
morning at 10.00. The five-man committee will also seek 
meetings with drug suppression officials to obtain more 
information and evidence, said Mr Burin. 
  He said the House of Representatives Affairs Committee had 
already given the party panel permission to attend its meetings 
and to use its information. 
  "I think the Chat Thai panel will be able to complete its 
probe within the 15-day limit given by the party," he said. 
  The panel is expected to prepare a summarized report by May 
20 for submission to Mr Banhan 
  Panel member Man Patthanothai will look into the legal 
implications and problems connected with the case. 
  Mr Burin said the United States was only proceeding with 
civil action against Mr Thanong, but criminal action should also 
be taken if it has information linking him to marijuana 
smuggling. 
  "Senior party figures will decide what to do once we finish 
our probe, but one option is that Mr Thanong could review his 
position in an effort to save the image of the party and 
Parliament," he said. 
  Party sources said Mr Banhan wanted to act responsibly but 
has chosen not to launch an investigation by saying the matter 
occurred before Mr Thanong joined Chat Thai. 
  One source said Chat Thai would take real action against Mr 
Thanong and would not let things drag on or try to defend him 
because the allegation is causing severe damage to the party.
