FT  05 AUG 94 / Healthy core helps TI advance 11% in first half
Growing demand for car parts and industrial seals helped TI Group, the
specialist engineering and aerospace company, to achieve an 11 per cent
increase in first-half profits.
The group announced that pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 62.8m to Pounds
69.8m as all three core businesses - John Crane, Bundy and Dowty Aerospace -
got the better of mixed trading conditions to increase operating profits.
Sales on continuing operations increased 5.2 per cent to Pounds 722.7m.
Underlying operating profits - excluding last year's Pounds 5.3m gain from
the electronics and fuel systems businesses, which have since been sold -
rose 23 per cent to Pounds 76.2m.
The shares gained 7p to 412p.
Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman, said the figures showed the group was on
course with its strategy of developing global businesses in niche areas.
The improved performance was underpinned by a 21 per cent increase in
operating profits at Bundy, the tubes and fluid systems company, which
benefited from buoyant automotive production in North America and orders
from European manufacturers. Its operating profits rose from Pounds 23.8m to
Pounds 28.9m on increased turnover of Pounds 326.3m (Pounds 301.4m).
Profits at John Crane, the industrial seals and polymers business, rose 15
per cent to Pounds 34.6m on sales of Pounds 246.6m (Pounds 227.4m).
Last year's restructuring of Dowty Aerospace helped the aircraft components
business lift profits from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 13.6m despite reduced sales
of Pounds 149.8m (Pounds 158.4m). Sir Christopher said Dowty's lucrative
contracts with Airbus Industries and its new landing-gear joint venture with
Messier of France would enable it to exploit an upturn in demand. Improved
cash flow and gains on property disposals and exchange rates also allowed
the group to cut net borrowings from Pounds 241.1m to Pounds 136.3m,
equivalent to gearing of 41.5 per cent.
Analysts welcomed the figures and said they would have been better had it
not been for a Pounds 1.9m reduction in pension credits; Pounds 1.2m of
costs associated with operations in hyper-inflationary economies; and Pounds
2m in redundancy and reorganisation costs. Earnings per share rose to 10.1p
(9p) and an increased interim dividend of 4.05p (3.85p) is declared.
