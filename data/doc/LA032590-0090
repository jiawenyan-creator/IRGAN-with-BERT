DELAWARE RIVER FOULED BY ACCIDENTAL OIL SPILL 
A tanker on Friday spilled about 1,000 gallons of oil into the Delaware River, 
the Coast Guard said. 
Unloading was stopped and floating booms were placed in the water around the 
ship. A private anti-pollution contractor also was called in to clean up the 
spill.
