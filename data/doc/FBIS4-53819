  [Text] President Suharto appreciated the decision of 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos to bar foreigners from 
attending the so-called Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor. 
President Ramos' move showed that the Philippine Government put 
friendly relations with Indonesia above a conference which 
obviously is intended to attack Indonesia. Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas said this after accompanying his South Korean 
counterpart, Han Sung-chu, during a courtesy call on President 
Suharto at Merdeka Palace this afternoon. 
  Meanwhile, Minister and State Secretary Murdiono separately 
disclosed the Indonesian Government's appreciation of President 
Ramos' stand. 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] The government appreciates the 
move taken by President Ramos as this reflects the Philippines' 
profound understanding of our stand on the East Timor issue. 
For us, the East Timor issue is over and East Timor is part of 
the Republic of Indonesia. As proof, the people of East Timor 
have taken part several times in general elections as Indonesian 
citizens. [end recording] 
  The Philippine president announced several days ago the 
decision to bar foreigners from attending the conference 
organized by several Philippine non-government organizations to 
discuss the East Timor issue.
