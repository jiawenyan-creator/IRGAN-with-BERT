FT  30 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities follow fall in bonds
on Fed chairman's remarks
Wall Street
AFTER investors had largely ignored Tuesday night's State of the Union
address, a big decline in bond prices knocked US stock markets out of their
stride yesterday, leaving share prices sharply lower, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 47.18 at 3,224.96.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 retreated 4.62 to 410.34, while the Nasdaq
composite of over-the-counter stocks ended 4.98 off at 616.31. Turnover on
the New York SE was a substantial 249m shares.
Expectations had been high that Mr Bush would unveil a range of economically
stimulating measures in his speech to Congress, but in the event the package
of reductions in defence spending and tax cuts proved a disappointment.
After opening lower, however, prices gained ground steadily throughout the
morning and by early afternoon blue chips were in record territory. But a
sudden plunge in bond prices, prompted by comments from the Federal Reserve
chairman which appeared to rule out further interest rate cuts, sparked a
rush of selling in mid-afternoon.
Computer program trading added to the downward pressure, and by the close
the market had recorded its biggest one-day setback since the strong rally
began more than a month ago.
Most of the leading stocks which rose in the morning were swamped by the
late wave of sellers and ended lower. Philip Morris was a case in point.
Having climbed more than Dollars 2 at one stage on news of a healthy
increase in fourth-quarter earnings, the shares eventually stood Dollars
1/2 off on the day at Dollars 75 3/4 .
Du Pont also suffered a turnround, closing a net Dollars  1/8 easier at
Dollars 48 5/8 in the wake of a fourth-quarter 36 cents a share loss, which
included a series of restructuring-related charges totalling more than
Dollars 700m.
Bethlehem Steel, which has benefited in recent weeks from heavy demand for
cyclical stocks, dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 13 3/4 on news of a big
fourth-quarter loss, the omission of its 10 cents quarterly dividend, and a
plan to reduce the workforce by 6,500. In the same sector, Armco tumbled
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 4 7/8 after revealing a fourth-quarter deficit in
the wake of charges and warning that it may lose more money in 1992.
Black &amp; Decker initially rose more than Dollars 1 in the wake of a 'buy'
recommendation from securities house Salomon Brothers. Several Wall Street
analysts had posted positive comments about B &amp; D after the company
introduced a new line of power tools to the investment community in New York
on Tuesday, but the shares succumbed to selling and finished Dollars  1/8
off at Dollars 21 3/4 .
Russell Corp was a rare stock to buck the trend, climbing Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 38 5/8 on reports that analysts have forecast that the athletic wear
producer has plenty of room for further growth and that its share price will
continue to post solid gains throughout the year.

setback. The composite index closed 24.6 off at 3,598.6 as declining issues

Inco fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 36 7/8 after reporting a fourth-quarter
loss of USDollars 5.8m, or 7 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net
of Dollars 72.6m, or 68 cents.
American Barrick, off CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 31 1/2 , said it and Newmont
Gold have agreed in principle to co-operate in developing their common areas
in the northern sector of the Carlin Trend in Nevada.
Bramalea eased CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 5 1/8 . Dominion Bond Rating
Service downgraded its senior debentures, preferred shares and commercial
paper.
