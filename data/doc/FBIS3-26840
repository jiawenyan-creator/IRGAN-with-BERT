  [Text] Officers and men of the Tibet Military Region, 
including those working in offices, have been engaged in field 
training activities since the new year. 
  Because of heavy snowfalls, most parts of the Tibet Plateau 
are very cold. To be prepared for future warfare [wei lai zhan 
zheng] and to train crack troops able to carry out all emergency 
missions under any weather conditions, the military district, 
after careful planning, notified all units in the district to 
immediately leave their barracks and train their troops in 
snow-capped areas to improve their combat effectiveness. 
  During the last 10 days of January, offices of the military 
district organized their civilian personnel, cooks, drivers, and 
other workers to take part in marches. In accordance with their 
geographical environments and natural conditions, units 
stationed in Lhasa, Shannan, Nyingchi, Xigaze, and Qamdo 
Prefectures trained their troops in areas where conditions were 
unfavorable. So far, over 85 percent of the units in Tibet have 
carried out their winter training assignments.
