  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 Jun (AFP) -- This Thursday, the 
provisional government of President Emile Jonassaint (not 
recognized by the international community) established a visa 
requirement for foreign citizens whose countries demand visas 
from Haitian citizens. This measure particularly affects U.S. 
and Canadian citizens, who until now did not need visas to enter 
Haiti. 
  A government communique stated that a $50 tax will also be 
required of foreigners entering Haiti. Foreigners will be able 
to obtain visas at ports and airports in the country.
