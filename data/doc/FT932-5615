FT  03 JUN 93 / N Korea refusing to yield on treaty
THE US yesterday failed to make headway in talks with North Korea on nuclear
weapons, but a new round of talks is to be held tomorrow.
The Americans pressed North Korea to adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty, holding out the prospect of better relations if the Pyongyang
communist regime reversed its March decision to renounce the pact.
'We had seven hours of discussions but I cannot report any significant
progress,' said Mr Robert Gallucci, a US assistant secretary of state. The
chief North Korean delegate, Mr Kang Sok Chu, said only that the talks went
on 'in an atmosphere of frankness and sincerity'.
Although the meeting in New York was not under UN auspices, the US was
acting in line with a Security Council resolution calling on North Korea to
reconsider its decision to withdraw from the treaty and to co-operate with
the International Atomic Energy Agency on verification.
The US has indicated it might respond to a positive reply by suspending
military exercises with South Korea, long an irritant for Pyongyang. North
Korea wants a big cut in America's military presence in the South and is
keen to develop trade with the US.
South Korea yesterday said it had agreed to key North Korean conditions for
a meeting but insisted on keeping to its own timetable, Reuter adds from
Seoul.
In a letter to the Pyongyang leadership, South Korea said it accepted the
North's agenda for talks aimed at defusing a row over nuclear proliferation,
but it said the meeting could not be held before Saturday, rather than North
Korea's preferred date of tomorrow.
