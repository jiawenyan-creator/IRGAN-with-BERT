FT  22 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fight against art tax fallen on deaf
ears
Sir, Antony Thorncroft ('UK wins 2.5 per cent VAT for works of art',
December 18) appears to misunderstand why the art trade fought so hard to
resist the imposition of value added tax on works of art imported into the
UK from outside the EU.
Our battle over two decades has been to protect the future of an open and
free domestic market for the benefit of collectors and dealers and as a
means of strengthening the cultural inheritance of future generations.
Had we been forced to settle for a once and for all 2.5 per cent tax, across
the whole EC, we would reluctantly have had to accept this as a regrettable
but inevitable step in the relentless harmonisation sought by the European
Commission. However, we have now lost the principle of the well-tried and
successful free market. We are also left with uncertainty about future
levels of this new tax.
It is disingenuous of the auction houses to say that 'the dealers are crying
wolf' and unhelpful to make suggestions that would further encourage the
market in New York at the expense of that in London. At a time when the art
market is showing signs of recovery, this repatriation tax is a most
unwelcome development.
