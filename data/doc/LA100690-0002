BAD THINGS BREWING AT RAIDER GAMES 
Is it only anti-Raider fans who write to the L.A. Times or does The Times 
choose to print only letters from such morons? People in L.A., wake up! Just 
try openly flaunting your support of an opposing team in New York, Chicago, 
Pittsburgh or any other NFL city (except maybe Anaheim) and security will 
remove you quicker than a breakaway run by Bo Jackson.
