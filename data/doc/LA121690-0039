THE NEW LEAR 
So Norman Lear has decided to do his own brand of evangelism ("Divining the New 
Lear" by Judith Michaelson, Dec. 2), sort of a cosmic mix of comedy and God. 
We're all waiting to see whose "god" Lear will choose to ridicule. I think we 
Bible-believing Christians have a good idea which one it will be.
