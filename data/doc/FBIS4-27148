  [Text] On 31 May North Korea sternly expressed the 
intention of refusing to accept [suyong kobu uisaul pyomyong 
haessumnida] the UN Security Council presidential statement. 
After the UN Security Council formal meeting ended today, Kim 
Su-man, deputy ambassador to the North Korean mission to the 
United Nations, said: This statement is another attempt by the 
United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
to stifle North Korea and, therefore, it is refused. 
  Deputy Ambassador Kim Su-man stressed that all pending 
issues 
must be resolved through talks with the United States, not by 
the UN Security Council, and said: North Korea is, however, 
willing to hold further negotiations with the IAEA. 
  He added that although North Korea has made efforts to 
reasonably solve the problems, the IAEA has refused the North 
Korean proposal.
