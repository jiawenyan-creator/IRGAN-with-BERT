FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Clash at Tace as brokers and director quit
TACE, the environmental control equipment group where a revolt by
institutions last year removed founder chairman Mr Jock Mackenzie, was
yesterday further shaken by the resignations of Mr Michael Beckett from the
board and Hoare Govett as the company's broker.
Sir David Nicholson succeeded Mr Mackenzie as chairman against the wishes of
the institutions who had wanted Mr Beckett to head the board.
Mr Beckett is understood to have clashed with Sir David over group strategy
but was not available for comment.
Less than a month ago Mr Beckett brought Hoare Govett on board as Tace's
brokers ahead of an anticipated reorganisation of the company's capital
structure. Previously Smith New Court was broker both to Tace and Goring
Kerr, its 51 per cent controlled process control equipment affiliate.
Hoare Govett appears to have been reluctant to continue as broker when its
advice was being ignored and would have stayed on had Mr Beckett remained on
the board.
The capital restructuring is likely to require each company to have
different brokers to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
Yesterday, Tace said its planned to close its London head office from which
Mr Mackenzie ran the business and will be moving to the head office of
Goring Kerr in Windsor. The move will save Pounds 750,000 a year.
