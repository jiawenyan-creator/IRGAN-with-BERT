LOCAL WATCH; 
VETERANS AT WAR 
It's sad: Once soldiers side by side. Now veterans waring among themselves. 
Who should be listed on a proposed L.A. monument to American soldiers of 
Japanese ancestry? The question threatens a community project designed to honor 
those who served in three segregated World War II units. 
One group wants the privately funded monument in Little Tokyo to list the names 
of all 12,000 members -- living and dead -- of the Army's all-Japanese-American 
100th Battalion and 442nd Infantry Regimental Combat Team, which served in 
Europe, and the Military Intelligence Service in the Pacific. An opposing group 
wants to honor only the 700 killed during World War II, but to include the 
names of 325 Japanese-Americans who died during the Spanish-American War, World 
War I and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. 
The debate is muddling the intent of the monument: To make a special 
acknowledgement of the blood, sweat and tears of those Japanese-American 
soldiers who fought hard to prove their loyalty to the United States so their 
families, unjustly interned in U.S. concentration camps during the war, would 
be more readily accepted by other Americans. 
They were tested as few others were. They deserve an enduring testimonial -- 
one designed with the names of all the Japanese-Americans who served in World 
War II as the centerpiece of the monument. The design also could incorporate 
secondarily the names of others who died in combat. 
They don't deserve to be fought over like this.
