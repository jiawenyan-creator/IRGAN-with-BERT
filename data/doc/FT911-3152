FT  26 APR 91 / High-definition TV pact near
EFFORTS to achieve a common European approach to introducing high-definition
television (HDTV) are close to agreement, European Commission officials said
yesterday.
'Agreement on the principles' of what high-quality television strategy to
adopt has been reached by broadcasters, satellite operators and the
electronics industry, though details have still to be finalised,' they said.
The intention is still to introduce the D2-Mac satellite standard, on
wide-screen television sets.
But Brussels is still considering whether or how to compensate broadcasters
and equipment manufacturers already using other standards.
'It is not clear how this would be organised,' officials said.
Current EC rules require all direct broadcasting satellites to use this
system, as a stepping stone towards an improved HDTV standard in 1995.
But around 2m viewers - including subscribers to British Sky Broadcasting -
already receive pictures from the Astra satellite on the competing PAL
standard. Astra is exempt from the rules because it is telecommunications
rather than a television satellite. The Commission is working towards
getting a memorandum of understanding signed prior to introducing a new
directive, and is seeking a compromise among the interests affected. The new
directive is scheduled to be presented to telecommunications ministers on
June 3.
Brussels is not ruling out compensation for broadcasters on other standards.
But officials would not comment on the Commission's response to BSkyB's
compromise proposal to broadcast simultaneously in both D2-Mac and PAL,
provided the EC picked up the additional costs.
