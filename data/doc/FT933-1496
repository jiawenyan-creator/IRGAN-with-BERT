FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Thai bank seeks Bt5bn in notes
programme
INDUSTRIAL Finance Corporation of Thailand is to borrow Bt5bn (Dollars 200m)
through an Asian currency note programme that its designers say adds an
extra dimension to the region's capital markets.
Lehman Brothers, the programme's arranger and dealer, is making a series of
issues with maturities ranging from one day to 10 years at fixed or floating
rates in Baht or Hongkong dollars to create a revolving credit line for the
bank.
'The time is right - this lays down a small building block in a huge
movement of capital,' said Mr Phillip Kim, a vice-president of Lehman
Brothers Asia.
Mr Asawin Kongsiri, president of IFCT, which is 31 per cent owned by the
state, said: 'This will make our capital market more international as well
as lower the bank's cost of funds.'
Lehman will arrange the mix of pricing and maturity when the IFCT needs
funds. The first issue is expected to be a fixed-rate note of between Bt1bn
and Bt500m in mid-October. Mr Asawin said that as a quasi-sovereign
borrower, the notes should provide the fledgling Thai domestic capital
market with useful benchmark pricing.
Mr Kim said that Thailand's highly-publicised problems in digesting
infrastructure development, as well as some political uncertainty, was not
likely to trouble the programme.
Joining Lehman as dealer in the note programme will be Bangkok First
Investment &amp; Trust, Finance One Public, IFCT Finance and Securities and
Phatra Thanakit.
New Japan Securities, the second-tier brokerage, is to close six branches in
metropolitan Tokyo, Reuter reports from Tokyo. After the shutdowns, New
Japan will have 76 branches in Japan. The brokerage revised down its
forecast for parent current profit in the September half-year to Y200m
(Dollars 1.9m) from an earlier Y3.5bn forecast.
