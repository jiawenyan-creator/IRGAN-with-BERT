FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Outokumpu sets out plan for
return to profitability
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday announced a
reorganisation of its copper operations and said it was speeding up
rationalisation as part of a determined bid to return the unit to profit.
The group says the moves should improve Outokumpu Copper's operating profit
by FM200m (Dollars 38.91m) next year and, even if market conditions remain
tough, should get the unit back into profit from mid-year. Outokumpu Copper
is Outokumpu's largest segment and has suffered losses for the past three
years.
The streamlining, due to take effect on January 1, concentrates Outokumpu
Copper's operations on four business areas: tubes, strip, drawn products and
rolled products.
The group is also planning to scale back its operations in Spain and Sweden.
It will cut 400 staff in Spain, concentrated at Zaratamo tube plant. At
Vasteras in Sweden, lossmaking electrostrip production will be phased out.
Outokumpu Copper, which last year posted a FM497m deficit, will make another
big loss this year, aggravated by FM300m of restructuring costs in the final
four months.
