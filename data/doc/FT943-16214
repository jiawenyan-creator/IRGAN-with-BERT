FT  06 JUL 94 / Fiat faces strike in Poland
Workers at Fiat Auto in Tychy, southern Poland, have voted to strike in
support of a wage claim if talks with management fail. The plant's 6,000
workers, who produce Fiat's Cinquecento model, voted 84 per cent in favour
of strike action. The unions are demanding a 40 per cent pay increase. At
the same time, the Solidarity union in Warsaw has threatened a boycott of
Italian goods as a result of a four-week strike at the Warsaw steelworks
owned by Lucchini, an Italian private steelmaker. Solidarity says the
'strike will determine if Italian capital and other foreign investors are to
treat our country as terrain for ruthless exploitation or will respect our
workers and consumers'. The factory, taken over by the Italian company two
years ago, has been occupied by its 2,000 employees and 10 of them have
begun a hunger strike in an attempt to force a 30 per cent wage rise and to
speed the modernisation of the plant. Lucchini says that delays over
establishing title to the land have held up financing for new equipment in
the Dollars 300m project.
