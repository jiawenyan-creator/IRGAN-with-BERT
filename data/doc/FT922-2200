distributor
FORD Motor of the US and Mazda of Japan have reached a preliminary agreement
to become equal partners in Autorama, the company that distributes Ford
products in Japan, Reuter reports from Detroit.
Under the agreement, Ford will boost its stake in Autorama to 36.5 per cent
from 34 per cent, while Mazda will cut its stake to 36.5 per cent from 39
per cent. The remaining 27 per cent will continue to be owned by individual
investors.
The agreement is expected to be finalised by July 1.
Autorama was created in 1982 as a sales channel for Mazda-produced Ford
models in Japan. Imported Ford models were added to the Autorama product
line in 1988.
Mazda and Ford acquired their equity interests in the company in 1989. In
1991, Autorama sold more than 75,000 Ford vehicles.
Ford declined to specify how much it would pay to build up its stake.
The US group said that the deal was not related to the company's previously
announced plan to purchase a 50 per cent stake in a Mazda assembly plant in
Michigan.
