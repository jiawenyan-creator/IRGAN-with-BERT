FT  12 AUG 93 / Fyodorov says rouble zone unlikely
MR Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, said yesterday it was
unlikely that a handful of former Soviet republics would be able soon to
recreate either a rouble zone or an economic union.
He denied Russia was seeking to write off debts to the west, saying that a
statement to this effect had been the personal opinion of Mr Konstantin
Kagalovsky, Russia's representative at the International Monetary Fund.
Negotiations were under way with republics that wanted to keep the rouble as
their currency, Mr Fyodorov said, but 'what will happen to the rouble zone
remains to be seen'. The central bank's botched monetary reform which
proclaimed to endow Russia with a currency of its own and to cut off other
republics, had shown 'these issues cannot be resolved so easily,' he added.
He also expressed scepticism on plans for economic union with Ukraine and
Belarus.
