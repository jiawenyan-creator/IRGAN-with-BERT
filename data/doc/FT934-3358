FT  09 DEC 93 / Strikes shift to service sector
Strikes in the UK are becoming increasingly concentrated in the service
sector, and especially public services, the latest government study shows.
The international comparison of strike activity, published in yesterday's
Employment Gazette, a Department of Employment publication, shows that in
the UK the strike rate in the service sector was more than twice that in
traditionally strike-prone sectors such as mining and manufacturing.
Mr Derek Bird, author of the report, says: 'The data suggest that there may
have been some form of behavioural change with respect to strike activity in
the traditionally strike-prone sectors.'
He shows that the UK strike rate for the five years 1988-92 was 75 per cent
lower than in the previous five-year period. That is a bigger reduction than
every other OECD country except Denmark and far better than the OECD median
of a 32 per cent reduction.
Between 1983 and last year the countries showing the highest strike rates
were Greece, Spain and Italy. Countries recording few days lost per employee
included Switzerland, Austria and Japan.
The UK's strike rate has been below the European Union average in each of
the past 10 years with the exception of 1984.
