MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK 
Rolling Stones fans will get some "Satisfaction" later this year when the 
legendary rock band reunites for a North American tour, said guitarist Keith 
Richards on Friday, confirming rumors of a reunion that have been reported ever 
since Richards and Mick Jagger played together in a jam session following the 
band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last month. After spending 
the past week in Barbados writing songs with Jagger, presumably for a new album 
that will be released in conjunction with the tour, Richards said that the 
Stones will tour "from around September through to December." ALEENE MacMINN
