PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: SOME TIPS TO REDUCE FUTURES TRADING RISK 
If this week's indictments of 46 Chicago commodities traders have you scared 
about futures markets, you're not alone. Even without the scandal, it is risky 
territory. At least four of five individual investors who dabble in futures 
lose money -- and that's assuming their trades are handled properly, as is the 
case most of the time, since most brokers are honest. 
This week's developments show that even some of the most sophisticated 
professionals don't know when they are being cheated by illicit trades. Victims 
of some of the indicted broker-traders actually thought they were getting good 
"fills," or prices at which their trades were executed. 
Instead, however, they may have been victims of "front running" -- in which a 
broker-trader illegally trades for his personal account first, profiting from 
the price movement that will result from the customer order. In other cases, 
brokers were alleged to have skimmed customer funds, kept more profitable 
trades for themselves or committed other transgressions. 
But if you still want to include futures as part of your investment strategy -- 
knowing that you can earn far more than in stocks, bonds or real estate if you 
make the right moves -- the Chicago probe provides some insights into how to 
reduce your chances of getting taken: 
* Know with whom you are dealing. Although it is no guarantee that you won't 
get hurt, deal with reputable firms. Make sure that your broker is registered 
with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is a member of the National 
Futures Assn., an industry watchdog group. To do that, contact the NFA at (800) 
621-3570, or 200 W. Madison St., Suite 1600, Chicago, Ill. 60606. Soon the NFA 
might also have records on whether your broker has ever been disciplined by any 
of the exchanges. 
* Keep vigilant. Monitor your trades like a hawk. Keep good notes. Review your 
confirmation statements carefully. "Don't lose touch with your money," says 
Robert K. Wilmouth, president of the NFA. 
* Complain vigorously. If you suspect bad trades, call your broker immediately 
and gripe loudly. Don't expect anyone else to be vigilant for you. "I wonder 
how much the big brokerage firms watch every trade," says Robert N. Gordon, 
president of Twenty-First Securities, a New York trading house that uses 
futures. 
If your complaint is serious and corrective action hasn't been taken, consider 
complaining to the exchanges or to the NFA. They offer arbitration procedures 
for investors. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also handles 
complaints. The NFA acts as a clearing house for information on grievances. To 
complain or find out more about arbitration, contact the NFA. 
* Be wary of "market orders." Some longtime investors avoid making so-called 
market orders, the type that require the floor broker to execute at the best 
possible price at the time the order hits the trading pits. Those orders are 
most vulnerable to abuse. 
To see that your market orders are satisfactorily executed, you must monitor a 
computer showing the exact price movements at the time of your order, says 
Almer Orr III, president of A. O. Management Corp., a Pittsburgh firm that 
manages commodity investments. Otherwise you may never know whether you've been 
shortchanged, he says. 
"Once you're leaving your destiny in someone else's hand, you're open for the 
type of (fraud) that goes on," Orr says. 
Similarly, Orr says, be wary about placing orders to be executed at the open or 
close of trading. Those also are vulnerable to abuses such as front running or 
prearranged trading between collaborating brokers. 
Accordingly, Orr suggests, stick largely to "limit orders" in which you specify 
the exact price you want for your trade. There are drawbacks to these orders 
too, however. If the market moves too fast, and thus away from the price you 
specified, your order may not be executed unless you specify a new limit order. 
* Consider professional management. If you can't monitor the markets 
constantly, then you probably have no business trading futures on your own. 
Instead, consider hiring a professional commodity manager or invest in a 
private or public commodity pool or fund. They are like mutual funds in that 
they invest in futures and are professionally managed. Their professional 
managers are in a better position to make sure you don't get cheated. 
Public commodity funds are run as limited partnerships and require initial 
investments of as little as $3,000, says Leon Rose, publisher of Managed 
Account Reports, a Columbia, Md., newsletter that tracks these funds. Privately 
run commodity pools also qualify as limited partners but require a bit more as 
an initial investment -- say, $5,000 to $10,000, he says. Having your own 
manager may require at least $50,000. 
Some public funds have performed quite well, with some gaining more than 100% 
annually in recent years. On average they have posted gains in four of the past 
five years, Rose says. But individual funds can lose big amounts. 
They key is finding a fund manager with a good long-term record in both good 
and bad markets. Several firms monitor commodity pools and funds. One of the 
best known is Managed Account Reports. Write them at 5513 Twin Knolls Road, 
Columbia, Md. 21045, for a free sample.
