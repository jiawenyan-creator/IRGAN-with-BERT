DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FARM WILL APPEAL BAN ON CHRISTMAS TREE SALES 
Cicero Farms will return to court to try to persuade an appellate judge to lift 
the ban on its Christmas tree sales at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, 
attorney Harold Kippen said Tuesday. 
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order Monday. 
The judge said Joe Cicero did not have the right to sell trees on the property 
because it was not allowed under his lease agreement with the Los Angeles 
Community College District. 
That lease calls for the sales of produce grown on the property. 
Kippen said Cicero will claim that he would face irreparable harm if the 
restraining order is enforced because he has ordered $120,000 worth of trees 
and has spent another $30,000 or so putting up lights and erecting a motorized 
sleigh ride. 
Stu Miller, owner of one of the largest Christmas tree companies in the state 
-- Miller &amp; Sons -- prompted the court action by filing lawsuits against 
Cicero and the college district, citing unfair competition. 
One of Miller's 40 lots is across the street from the Cicero operation.
