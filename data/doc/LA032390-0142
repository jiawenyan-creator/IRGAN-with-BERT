TWO O.C. CONGRESSMEN WIN GENEROUS PRAISE FROM TAXPAYER GROUP 
Reps. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) were 
among seven California congressmen singled out for praise by the National 
Taxpayers Union on Thursday for casting votes against increased federal 
spending. 
Nine members of California's congressional delegation were classified as "big 
spenders" and seven as "taxpayers' friends" in the group's 17th-annual rating, 
based on recorded votes to reduce or increase government spending on national 
defense and social programs. 
Dannemeyer ranked second among all House members on the NTU's list of low 
spenders, with a 72% favorable rating. Rohrabacher, whose district includes 
part of Orange County, had a 60% rating. 
California lawmakers on the NTU's spenders list were led by Reps. Glenn M. 
Anderson (D-Harbor City) and Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), both with 26% 
favorable ratings. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) also made the roster with a 
32% rating. 
"The big spenders in Congress are so out of touch with the majority of 
Americans who oppose higher taxes and spending that they are taking a 'let them 
eat cake' attitude toward American taxpayers," said NTU Chairman James Davidson 
at a Capitol press conference. 
Cranston, however, disputed the group's characterization of his voting record. 
"I do not have time now to analyze each of the 18 votes that the National 
Taxpayers Union objects to," Cranston said in a statement. "But I did take time 
to check the three votes they considered the worst and gave a negative 'vote 
weight' of 10. All three dealt with catastrophic insurance care reform, and in 
each case, I voted to retain many of the Medicare catastrophic benefits while 
repealing or reducing the premium surtax." 
The National Taxpayers Union "thinks those were three of my worst votes," 
Cranston said. "I think they were three of my best, and I'm proud of them."
