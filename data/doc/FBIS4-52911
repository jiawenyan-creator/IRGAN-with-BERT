  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP] is concerned about Asia-Pacific Peace 
Foundation Chairman Kim Tae-chung's proposition that Washington 
send former President Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang as a special 
envoy and invite North Korean President Kim Il-song to visit the 
United States, saying it may get the North Korea policy confused. 
  Chief policy-maker Yi Se-ki said Saturday Kim had made "an 
inappropriate proposal at an inappropriate time," adding that 
the proposal might bring about confusion to the policy toward 
the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  He said he could hardly understand Chairman Kim's proposal 
for a meeting between former U.S. President Carter and North 
Korean President Kim Il-song and expressed concern about Kim's 
true meaning. 
  "It is desirable for the National Unification Board to brief 
opposition politicians on the unification policy so that there 
will be no confusion in North Korea policy," he said. 
  Yi made the remarks during the party's higher-level staff 
meeting on Saturday morning, party spokesman Pak Pom-chin said. 
  Pak also expressed concern about Kim's proposal, saying 
although the proposal is related to international politics, it 
is having influence on domestic politics.
