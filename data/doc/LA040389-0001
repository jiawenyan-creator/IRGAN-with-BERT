New York City police acknowledged that 30 women arrested while demonstrating 
for AIDS research funds were strip-searched, and said at least two police 
matrons will face departmental charges. The treatment of the members of the 
AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power was "clearly improper" in light of the "minor 
charges" against them, said Alice McGillion, deputy police commissioner for 
public affairs. She said a strip-search is conducted only when there is 
"reasonable" belief that a suspect is armed or carrying drugs, and even then 
special permission is required. One of the demonstrators, Catherine Saalfield, 
23, of Manhattan, said she was ordered to strip in a cell at Manhattan's 7th 
Precinct, but "(police) never checked the pockets of my jacket. It was purely 
for intimidation and harassment."
