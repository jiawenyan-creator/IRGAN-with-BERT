FT  12 DEC 92 / Limit sought on auditor damages
THE GOVERNMENT should consider limiting the extent of damages that can be
awarded against auditors and widening the groups to whom they are
responsible, Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council,
said yesterday.
He called for an examination of ways to reduce the escalating legal awards
against auditors and for a review of the restrictive 'duty of care' of
auditors determined in the House of Lords Caparo judgment.
His comments built on his statement in the council's second annual review,
being sent to all listed companies, and echo the conclusions of the Cadbury
committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, of which he was
a member.
Sir Ron said he had written to the Department of Trade and Industry
expressing his concerns on the subject.
In the council's review, he called for companies and auditors to approach
the Accounting Standards Board's urgent issues task force to gain approval
for new accounting practices before they are adopted.
He wants to see the task force move in the direction of its equivalent in
the US, rather than reacting to dubious new accounting practices once they
have emerged in published company accounts.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, emphasised in the review that it was
important to give companies and accountants time to discuss, comment on and
adapt to new accounting standards in an evolutionary way.
As a result, he said the board would issue only two new standards next year.
He also said there was no intention to amend existing standards until at
least two years after they were introduced.
But the ASB is also expected to produce final guidance on the operating and
financial review.
Sir Ron said the Financial Reporting Review Panel was concerned about a
number of issues that do not conflict with company law but which 'do not
best serve the interests of informing shareholders and creditors on the
financial affairs of companies'.
