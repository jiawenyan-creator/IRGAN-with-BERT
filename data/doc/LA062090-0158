THE SIDELINES; 
GARVEY TO AID SOVIET BASEBALL 
Steve Garvey and 28 other members of Amateur Sports Development USA head to the 
Soviet Union on Saturday to help build baseball participation in that country. 
"Two years ago, I would not have imagined going to the Soviet Union," said 
Garvey, an All-Star first baseman with the Dodgers and San Diego Padres. "This 
is a wonderful opportunity to be part of a great historical trend." 
The seven-day tour to Moscow, Leningrad and Sventemba will include a game at 
the new Olympic baseball center at Sventemba, as well as clinics and lectures 
to explain and demonstrate the sport. 
In two years, the number of baseball teams in the Soviet Union has increased 
from eight to 64.
