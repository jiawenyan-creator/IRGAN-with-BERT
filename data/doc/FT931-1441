FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: GPG seeks agreements
GUINNESS Peat Group, New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley's UK
investment arm, was last night seeking agreements with Kredietbank
Luxembourgeoise to allow it to make an agreed bid for Brown Shipley
Holdings, the investment and broking business.
GPG said it would proceed with a full cash bid of 35p, valuing BSH at Pounds
5.6m, if agreements 'with the relevant parties' were reached by 5.30pm
today. (It originally said it was considering a bid on March 17, contesting
an earlier 30p bid by KBL which had already been recommended by the BSH
board.
KBL's bid was made after it emerged that it had potential claims on BSH of
Pounds 2.4m. These arose from indemnities given to KBL when it bought Brown
Shipley and Co, BSH's banking arm, last year.
GPG said it was satisfied with all the information it had received, as
demanded last week, on BSH. A full bid was now conditional on the settlement
and release of all claims KBL had against BSH, and the continued provision
of computer facilities to BSH by KBL.
