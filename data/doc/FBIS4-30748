  [Text] President Lech Walesa has called the information 
contained in Boris Yeltsin's recent book a misunderstanding. 
The Russian president says in this book that during his last 
visit to Poland he handed over to the Poles not only documents 
concerning the imposition of martial law, but also KGB files 
concerning Solidarity. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In a book published in over 20 
countries over two weeks ago, the Russian president has written 
that in the documents that he passed on to Lech Walesa, Polish 
and Soviet Cheka officers spelled out the entire truth about 
Solidarity leaders: Sometimes it was frightening to read the 
documents; the KGB X-ray machine was so ruthless. I patted the 
file and said: Everything is here. Walesa went slightly pale, 
Boris Yeltsin says in his book. 
  The Sejm Constitutional Accountability Commission has asked 
the foreign affairs minister to obtain a copy of the book by the 
Russian president. 
  [Jerzy Wiatr, chairman of the Sejm commission] "We will see 
whether there is anything in Yeltsin's book that could be useful 
for the commission's work." 
  [Correspondent] Lech Walesa has given an assurance that he 
has not concealed any documents that were handed over to him by 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  [Walesa] "Most probably it is some misunderstanding, or 
there 
have been some leaks. I immediately passed on everything I had 
received. I think that the press had it earlier than the press 
spokesman. The documents were made available straight away." 
  [Correspondent] Vitaliy Pavlov, head of the KGB Warsaw 
station in the eighties, claims that the Russian president 
overdramatizes and excessively colors things that the KGB 
archives contained. 
  [Pavlov, in Russian with superimposed Polish translation] "I 
cannot imagine that any materials compromising Solidarity could 
have been included in the files handed over by Boris Yeltsin to 
Lech Walesa. They could have contained only our reports 
assessing the situation during the crisis in the eighties and 
reports by party apparatchicks who paid visits to Poland in 
those days." 
  [Correspondent, in Russian fading into Polish translation] 
"So, there are not any materials there that would not be known 
to the Ministry of Internal Affairs?" 
  [Pavlov] "I do not think so." 
  [Correspondent] Pavlov did not rule out, however, that the 
KGB center could have had in their possession some other 
materials obtained from the special services of other Communist 
countries, because such documents did not pass through his hands.
