FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Insurers in talks on sale
Skandia, the Swedish insurer, is in talks with Trygg-Hansa, part of Swedish
insurance group Trygg-Hansa SPP Holdings, about the possible acquisition of
Trygg-Hansa's North American reinsurance operations, AP-DJ reports from
Stockholm.
The sale would be in line with Trygg-Hansa's 1993 decision to discontinue
its international reinsurance business, Skandia said .
The Trygg-Hansa units under consideration were not currently underwriting
any new business, the group said.
If negotiations prove successful, Skandia intends to integrate the units
into its own North American reinsurance operations. It believes this can be
done in a cost-effective manner.
