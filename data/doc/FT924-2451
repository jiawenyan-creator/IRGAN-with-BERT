FT  12 DEC 92 / Record Pounds 4.4m for Dutch master: Saleroom
A PAINTING by Pieter de Hooch, 'The Courtyard of a House of Delft', sold for
Pounds 4.4m at Christie's in London yesterday to the dealer Noortman. The
1658 painting, from the golden age of Dutch art, is similar to a work in the
National Gallery.
For more than 150 years it has hung at Wrotham Park, Hertfordshire. Before
that, it was in the collection of the Empress Josephine.
The price was slightly below its estimate of between Pounds 4.5m and Pounds
6.5m (possibly because a child in the picture has a distorted face) but was
a record for a work by de Hooch. It ensured a successful auction of Old
Master paintings, which totalled Pounds 12.3m. There were 10 artist records
and the morning session was 24 per cent unsold.
After the sale, a portrait of Madame de Vicq, by Rubens, which had
disappeared from view for almost 150 years, was sold for Pounds 990,000,
just below its estimate of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m. If it had been
bought during the auction the result would have looked even better.
Another work by Rubens, a painting of 'The Entombment' that was only
recently re-discovered, sold above its estimate for Pounds 1.045m, while an
oil sketch by the same artist for a tapestry went for Pounds 748,000, which
was a record for a Rubens in this medium. A Venetian view of the Molo by
Canaletto was on target at Pounds 462,000, and 'Fruit in a Basket' by the
Dutch painter Ambrosius Bosschaert II doubled its estimate at Pounds
319,000.
