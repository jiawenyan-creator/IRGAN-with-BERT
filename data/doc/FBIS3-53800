  [Text] The minister of state for home, Mr. Rajesh Pilot, 
said that there was a strong evidence of ISI's [Inter-Services 
Intelligence] involvement in terrorist acts in the country. He 
said the same forces are now creating trouble in the 
northeastern states by sneaking into the country from the 
Bangladesh border. Mr. Pilot was addressing a press conference 
in Hyderabad today. The minister said the gang whose members 
were arrested recently in connection with bomb blasts at several 
places was operating from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and 
Hyderabad. He said Dawood Ibrahim, who is the kingpin behind 
these incidents, is still at large and efforts are being made at 
all levels for his extradition. 
  The minister also took salute at the passing out parade of 
the 11th batch of assistant commandants of the Central 
Industrial Security Force.
