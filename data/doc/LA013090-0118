QUAKE RATTLES NEW MEXICO 
A moderate earthquake jolted central New Mexico strongly enough to rattle 
furniture Monday morning, but no injuries were reported. A spokeswoman for the 
U.S. Geological Survey said the quake registered a magnitude of 4.5. The 
epicenter was 40 miles south of Albuquerque.
