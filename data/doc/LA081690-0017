SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: GUITARIST AL DIMEOLA LONGS FOR RETURN 
TO FOREVER DAYS 
Fourteen years after the breakup of Return to Forever, guitarist Al DiMeola 
still misses being a member of the seminal electric jazz band led by Chick 
Corea. DiMeola, in fact, still harbors hopes of a reunion with former band 
mates Corea, the piano and keyboard player, drummer Lenny White and bassist 
Stanley Clarke. 
"It was the most ridiculous thing for Chick to ever break up the group," said 
DiMeola, who plays the Bacchanal at 8:30 Monday. "I have expressed this to 
Chick, and I know Stanley and Lenny feel strongly, too. I've met with Chick, 
and Stanley's met with him. We've tried to talk sense into him, but I think we 
have a Scientology problem to deal with, possibly due to Stanley leaving 
Scientology. That doesn't sit very well with Chick." 
Corea is an acknowledged devotee of the self-improvement movement founded by 
the late L. Ron Hubbard. When Clarke gave up Scientology, Corea broke up the 
group after the "Romantic Warrior" album. 
"We had signed a multimillion-dollar deal with CBS, but Chick decided to go in 
a different direction," DiMeola said. 
His disappointment is understandable. He hasn't recorded on his own since the 
1987 album "Tirami Su." 
"It's very strange. I've talked to labels like GRP, and I haven't gotten a 
response at all. Which is bizarre. All I can tell you is that the majority of 
what I've heard coming from that label is extremely boring. I have a demo worth 
of material which is as strong or stronger than anything I've ever done, and 
I've sold close to 5 million records. I'm right up there with some of the 
best-selling jazz artists around -- worldwide." 
DiMeola is playing San Diego with his World Sinfonia, a quartet also including 
classical guitarist Chris Carrington and percussionists Arto Tuncboyaci and 
Gumbi Ortiz. 
"I heard Chris 10 years ago at a club in Dallas, and I always had it in mind to 
do something with him. The magic in this particular group is the spontaneity. 
We leave lots of room for improvisation, and we have a real good rapport, 
especially with the percussionists." 
The songs are mostly DiMeola's, but the group also tackles DiMeola's 
arrangements of other pieces. 
In November, DiMeola plans to hit the road with a new electric band. The group 
will hone material for an album he hopes to record by year's end. 
The flip side of DiMeola is guitarist Larry Carlton, who has a seven-album deal 
with GRP. Carlton's career spans more than 20 years of solo projects and 
prodigious studio work with Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, John Lennon, Jerry 
Garcia, Neil Diamond, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt, mostly during the early 
'70s. And of course there was his tenure with The Crusaders, the funky jazz 
band, from 1971 to 1977. 
Carlton's album "Collection," released this year, is a compilation of 20 years 
of his music, including such signature tunes as "Nite Crawler" and "Minute by 
Minute." He said he plans to play many of his light-jazz radio hits in San 
Diego next Wednesday night during shows at 6 and 8:30. 
Guitar virtuoso Stanley Jordan, whose patented "tapping" technique wows 
listeners, will share the bill. By tapping the strings with the fingers of both 
hands, an effect which almost makes the guitar a keyboard instrument, Jordan 
gets a symphonic sound which seems impossible from a single human being. 
The concert will be a homecoming for San Diego saxophonist Hollis Gentry, who 
left his local band Neon to join Carlton's band last year. 
Flutists have seldom made it big as leaders, but Dave Valentin seems a rare 
exception to the rule. 
'If you look back historically at flute players, you'll find Eric Dolphy, James 
Moody, Yusef Lateef, Hubert Laws and Herbie Mann, not necessarily in that 
order. Many, like Moody and Dolphy, doubled on saxophones. But I think Herbie 
Mann was able to make the flute a legitimate lead instrument. 
"Naturally, I'm an aggressive player. But I would like to show the public that 
the flute has a whole texture of colors and sounds." 
Valentin and his group stop at Elario's Monday and Tuesday nights for shows at 
8:30 and 10:30 as part of a West Coast tour. After all this talk about GRP, 
it's worth noting that Valentin was the first artist signed to the label 11 
years ago.
