THE STATE 
A Merced County farmer whose foreclosed ranch is being considered for a kit fox 
sanctuary says the proposal would destroy his chances of rebuilding the farm. 
Tom Castle of Morgan Hill says he legally has the first right to buy the 
683-acre ranch he defaulted on last fall. But if two government agencies get 
their way, the land will be converted to permanent pasture and then restored as 
a habitat for the endangered fox. "That's a real good idea, except nobody's 
ever seen a kit fox on this land," said Castle's lawyer, Karen Russo of 
Woodland.
