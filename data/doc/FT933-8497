FT  14 AUG 93 / Dollars 610m oil loan for Russia
The World Bank has given Russia a Dollars 610m (Pounds 420m) loan to develop
oil wells in Siberia, the largest loan for a single project in the bank's
48-year history, officials said yesterday, AP reports from Moscow. The
agreement, signed in Moscow, is aimed at reversing the decline in Russian
oil production. Russia has the world's largest reserves of petroleum and
natural gas, but output has dropped 31 per cent since 1987 because of
antiquated equipment, poor planning, labor problems and leaky pipelines. The
loan is earmarked for restoration of 1,300 wells and replacement of more
than 1,000km of pipeline.
