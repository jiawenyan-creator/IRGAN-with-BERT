ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; 
NONSMOKING AREA INCREASED TO 60% 
Despite a Chamber of Commerce plea that the marketplace should determine what 
percentage of an eatery should be open to smokers, the City Council has voted 
to more than double the amount of restaurant space that must be reserved for 
nonsmokers. 
As a result of the unanimous vote Tuesday, restaurants will be required to 
increase their nonsmoking sections to from 25% to at least 60%. Bars and 
outdoor areas can be excluded from the calculations. The ordinance was also 
clarified to give restaurant owners the option of banning smoking entirely in 
their eateries.
