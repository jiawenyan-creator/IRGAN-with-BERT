  [Text] What will the first presidential edict be? We can 
provide an answer to a certain degree because the candidates for 
president of Belarus -- as their public statements show -- have 
already specified their positions on the issue. When Vyachaslaw 
Kebich met with workers of the Minsk Margarine Factory, he 
stated that the first document to be signed by him in the 
highest post of the Republic will be an edict concerning 
combating crime. Alyaksandr Lukashenka intends to begin his 
office with a similar decision. According to Syarhey Navumchyk, 
campaign manager of Zyanon Paznyak, the first edict of the 
Belarusian Popular Front leader -- should he be elected 
president -- will sack ministers who are in charge of mass media 
in the Republic. As to Alyaksandr Dubko and Stanislaw 
Shushkevich, they wish to begin their careers with resolving 
economic issues. As it was declared at the first news 
conference by communist leader Vasyl Novikaw, his first edict 
will annul the presidential post in Belarus.
