CFC11 Polyolefin 
HCFC141b (or blends thereof) 
Unacceptable 
HCFC141b has an ODP of 0.11, almost equivalent to that of methyl 
chloroform, a Class I substance. The Agency believes that non-ODP 
alternatives are sufficiently available to render the use of HCFC141b 
unnecessary in polyolefin foams.

Electronics cleaning w/CFC113, MCF 
Perfluoro-carbons (C5F12, C6F12, C6F14, C7F16, C8F18, C5F11NO, C6F13NO, C7F15NO, and C8F16) 
Acceptable for high-performance, precision-engineered applications only where reasonable efforts have been
made to ascertain that other alternatives are not technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements


The principal environmental characteristic of concern for PFCs is that they have long atmospheric lifetimes and
high global warming potentials. Although actual contributions to global warming depend upon the quantities of PFCs
emitted, the effects are for practical purposes irreversible. 

Users must observe this limitation on PFC acceptability by conducting a reasonable evaluation of other substitutes
to determine that PFC use is necessary to meet performance or safety requirements. Documentation of this evaluation
must be kept on file. 

For additional guidance regarding applications in which PFCs may be appropriate, users should consult the Preamble
for this rulemaking.
