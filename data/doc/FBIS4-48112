  [Text] The minister of Agriculture, Dr. Kraai van Niekerk, 
said the redistribution of land should gain impetus soon, and 
that as part of the process attention is being given to the 
question of finance and the identification of suitable land. 
  Dr. van Niekerk also referred to widespread dissatisfaction 
with the producer price of maize, and said that negotiations 
were taking place with all the role players. He said a solution
