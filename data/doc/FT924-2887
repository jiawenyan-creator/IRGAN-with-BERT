FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lombard North swings back with Pounds 89.8m
LOMBARD NORTH Central, the National Westminster Bank's credit finance
offshoot, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 89.8m for the year to
end-September, shrugging off three years of poor results.
Earnings per share improved sharply from 12.8p to 31.5p, confirming the
turnround in the group's interim performance when it turned a Pounds 1.4m
pre-tax loss into profits of Pounds 44.6m.
The banking group, whose profits were eroded from Pounds 120m in
pre-recession 1988 to Pounds 3.2m last year, improved income before
provisions for bad debts to Pounds 245m (Pounds 175m).
The directors said net interest income benefited from lower interest rates
and greater focus on Lombard's profitable businesses. However, the recession
was still taking its toll, and reduced new business volumes saw a Pounds
500m reduction in net assets.
Operating costs fell slightly, but 'the general fall in demand for capital
investment and for consumer credit had necessitated major reviews of
processes and costs'.
Provisions for bad debts fell from Pounds 171.8m to Pounds 155.2m, although
they remained 'a very substantial drain on profits', the group said. These
provisions were unlikely to fall lower until the UK moved out of recession.
Lombard would be able to maintain the interim performance until its new
year-end in December, in spite of the absence of significant recovery in
industrial activity, investment or consumer confidence.
This is Lombard's second interim report as it moves accounting dates in line
with NatWest's December year-end.
