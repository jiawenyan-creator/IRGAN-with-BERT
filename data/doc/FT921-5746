FT  03 MAR 92 / Western creditors agree to reschedule part of Jordan's
Dollars 7.2bn debt
THE Paris Club of official western creditors has agreed to reschedule part
of Jordan's Dollars 7.2bn foreign debt, a minister said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Amman.
The accord reached on Friday provides a 10-year repayment period with ten
years' grace for official debt originally due for repayment between 1991 and
mid-1993, Mr Ziyad Fariz, the planning minister, said.
Jordan would repay government-backed loans over 15 years, including an
eight-year grace period, he added.
Mr Fariz would not provide further details but a Jordanian economist said
Dollars 1.4bn of Amman's Dollars 5bn official debt had been rescheduled.
Financial officials had said a rescheduling would cut interest payments this
year to about Dollars 700m from Dollars 1.3bn.
'What we got means support to the economy and confidence in the ability to
perform well in the coming years,' Mr Fariz said.
Mr Basil Jardaneh, the finance minister, and central bank officials are
expected to return this week after holding rescheduling talks with the
London Club of commercial creditors.
Jordan also said yesterday that the US had agreed to provide Dollars 20m in
soft loans to buy 115,000 tonnes of US wheat.
It said the terms of the loan included seven years' grace followed by a
repayment period of 24 years.
