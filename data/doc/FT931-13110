FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Weyerhaeuser posts sharp gains
WEYERHAEUSER, the US forest products group, yesterday posted sharp gains in
fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting improved economic conditions and the
benefits of the company's restructuring, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Net income for the three months to December 27 was Dollars 85.3m, or 42
cents a share, on sales which rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.34bn.
A year earlier, Weyerhaeuser took restructuring charges of Dollars 283m
which contributed to a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 256.4m, or Dollars
1.27, on sales of Dollars 2.13bn. Excluding special items, it earned Dollars
26.6m, or 13 cents, a year ago.
For the whole of 1992, earnings amounted to Dollars 372m, or Dollars 1.83,
on sales of Dollars 9.2bn, against a net loss of Dollars 162m, or 80 cents,
on sales of Dollars 8.7bn.
Stripping out one-time items in 1991, the group earned Dollars 182.1m, or 90
cents, last year.
Its timberlands and wood products division posted near record fourth-quarter
earnings.
