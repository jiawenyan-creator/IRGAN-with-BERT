EASTERN EUROPE AND GERMANY 
You are really going to have to make me understand this one. 
On Sept. 14, President Bush doubled Polish food aid to over $100 million this 
year. This is in addition to the tens of millions of dollars the United States 
has already paid or committed to Poland. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman 
of the Agricultural Committee, wants the President to do even more, including 
forgiveness of the over $2 billion in agricultural debt already owed to us 
(Part I, Sept. 15). Not to be partisan, Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.), just 
returned from Poland, relays to us the immediate need now for dollars. 
Now let's see, we're doing all of this to support the new government in Poland, 
a Marxist state in the best tradition. The new government has absolutely no 
hope of becoming democratic. Meanwhile, back in this hemisphere, we have a 
semi-democratic state in Central America, whose people want to be democratic, 
but whose government is controlled by a dictator, and turning quickly Marxist. 
Why is it that when the American leaders lack the guts, and the people the 
insight, people in our own back yard who need our help and support suffer? Why 
are we aiding a Marxist state, leaning democratic, and shutting off support to 
a democratic state, leaning Marxist? Isn't it easier to prevent things than to 
change things? Is there anybody sane out there?
