HORMONE UNBOUNDED 
After reading Peter Rainer's June 24 article on movie violence and viewing the 
summer lineup of films (all male-in-dire-jeopardy plots), I figured maybe a 
good title for the whole mess would be "Testosterone Wars," because I suspect a 
large amount of this hormone has been dumped into Hollywood's reservoirs. 
I wondered, where are all the blockbusters about women (who are not whores or 
psychos)? 
Then it came to me, BANG! like a slow-motion, blood-spurting head shot: 
Crash + thrash + mash + slash + bash + gash + trash = Cash!
