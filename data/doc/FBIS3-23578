Colonel Yevgeniy Sigutkin, under the rubric: "A Scholar's 
Opinion": "Highly Mobile, Well Equipped -- On the Question of 
the Development of the Ukrainian Ground Troops' (Ground Defense 
Troops (GDT)) Organizational Development Concept"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Ground Troops Organizational 
Development Concept is a definite system of views on the conduct 
of Ground Troops military (combat) operations and their 
organization at the current or at a definite stage of Ukrainian 
Armed Forces organizational development. That is, the concept 
must be developed in a definite period because various points of 
view on Armed Forces organizational development exist in 
military theory, military plans change and searches are being 
conducted for new solutions to military organizational 
development issues. 
  The concept must define the goals, missions, primary 
direction and stages of the organizational development and 
formation of the Ground Troops (GDT) under new, radically 
changing conditions in accordance with the state's new missions 
and capabilities. To do this, we need to characterize the new 
conditions, missions and the capabilities of the state that have 
developed for the creation of the Ground Troops (GDT). 
  The experience of the transformations in the Soviet Army of 
the 1950's --beginning of the 1960's was not entirely 
successful, especially in the methods of conducting large-scale 
troop reductions and changes to the structure of the command and 
control elements. While resolving the issues of Ground Troops 
(GDT) organizational development at the current stage, we need 
to take into account the fundamental changes in the world 
community's interstate relations and also an examination of the 
assessments of threats to stability in the world and Ukraine's 
national interests, views on possible causes of military 
conflicts and the nature of the conduct of armed combat, and the 
content of armed forces operations in wars and military 
conflicts of varying intensity. 
  We need to conduct an assessment of the content and nature 
of 
modern operations to determine the primary missions of the 
Ground Troops. Research and experience permit us to say that 
modern Ground Troops operations must be carried out in the form 
of air-ground combat operations and must be mobile in nature. 
The "relative importance" of a breakthrough of a rigid defense 
that has been prepared beforehand will be reduced in modern 
operations, line and position types of combat operations, 
employment of unwieldy tank and mechanized formations, and the 
stability of fronts will lose their meaning because the 
destruction of troop formations that have selected position 
types of combat operations on prepared defensive lines will be 
achieved through long-range electronic and fire pressure. 
  The primary missions of the Ground Troops (GDT) will consist 
of the following: 
  In peacetime -- 

  -  maintenance of high combat and mobilization readiness of 
the command and control elements, formations, units and 
institutions; 
  -  ensuring the guaranteed transition of troops from 
a peacetime to a wartime footing with the goal of accomplishing 
missions to repel enemy aggression in coordination with the 
formations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' support 
services; 
  -  steady, purposeful training of command and control 
elements and troops to accomplish missions in accordance with 
their tasking designation; 
  -  conduct of the call-up of citizens 
for training assemblies and the build up of a trained military 
reserve; 
  -  equipping the troops with modern systems, military 
equipment and materiel; 
  -  participation in the fulfillment of 
Ukraine's obligations to maintain peace and stability in various 
regions; 
  -  and, rendering assistance to the population while 
eliminating the aftereffects of technological and economic 
catastrophes and natural disasters. 

    In wartime: 

  -  accomplishment of missions based upon the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces strategic deployment plan, implementation of measures and 
the conduct of combat operations to localize (end) armed 
conflicts, repelling aggression using permanent readiness troops 
(covering formations) that are deployed in strategic areas in 
peacetime and, when necessary -- using mobilized troop 
formations; 
  -  the conduct of joint, with formations of the various 
branches of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, defensive and 
counteroffensaive operations to defeat an 
aggressor; 
  -  participation in repelling an aerospace attack, the 
conduct of airborne assault and other joint operations of the 
various branches of the Armed Forces; 
  -  participation in 
preventing attempts to commit terrorist acts against 
strategically important targets; 
  -  the formation, training and 
transport of strategic reserves based upon tasking designation, 
and the replacement of personnel, arms and military equipment 
losses. 

    The primary goal, direction and missions of Ukrainian Armed 
Forces organizational development is determined based upon an 
analysis of the nature, conditions of conduct and the content of 
modern operations and missions which the Armed Forces must be 
prepared to accomplish. 
  The following must be the primary missions of Ground Troops' 
organizational development: 

  -  the maintenance and restoration of the combat potential of 
Ground Troops formations, their infrastructure, command and 
control and communications system on the territory of 
Ukraine; 
  -  bringing the strength and combat composition of the 
Armed Forces into accord with the established quotas, level and 
nature of the missions assigned to them; 
  -  ensuring an increase of 
the professional level of the military cadre and of all 
personnel; 
  -  a transition to a mixed troop manning system; and, 
improvement of the support and command and control system. 

    We need to realize Ground Troops organizational development 
and reform missions consistently, in accordance with the classic 
principle, in three stages. 
  The first stage -- Ground Troops organizational 
development has primarily been completed at the present time. 
  The second stage must provide for the creation of 
the preconditions for profound transformations in the Ground 
Troops and the conduct of research on the substantiation of 
their strength, combat composition and structure. 
  The third stage -- This is the transformation of 
the structure of the branches of the armed forces and special 
troops, the system of command and control elements, manning and 
training of military cadres and troops, and the initiation of 
reequipping with new weapons systems and military equipment. 
  While resolving the Ground Troops' organizational 
development 
and reform missions, naturally, the need will arise to resolve a 
number of problems. This is also the problem of the composition 
of formations and troop deployments, improvement of the Ground 
Troops organizational structure, development of modern 
facilities and the troop mobilized deployment structure and 
training of reserves, and a fundamental review of troop manning 
principles and the troop manning system. 
  Ground Troops' organizational development and reform is 
large-scale work. Realization of the Ground Troops' 
organizational development and reform missions will permit us to 
impart to them a qualitatively new appearance that meets modern 
requirements.
