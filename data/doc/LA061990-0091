SPEAKING OF: QUALITY OF LIFE 
Narrowing the Gap 
While there are still horrendous gaps in the level of development between the 
First and Third Worlds, some gaps have closed during the last four decades. 
The Infant Mortality Rate: 
Deaths per 1,000 live births 
1950: 200 
1985: 79 
The Literacy Gap: 
In percentage points 
1970: 54 
1985: 40 
The Life Expectancy Gap: 
In years 
1960: 23 
1987: 12 
1. 
The United Nation's development program's new Human Development Index is a 
composite derived from the performance of each country in three areas: life 
expectancy at birth, the rate of adult literacy, and income for a decent living 
standard. The higher the number, the more desirable the level of human 
development. 
2. While economic performance is intimately tied to levels of social 
development, it is equally important how a country uses its wealth. Some 
countries with modest levels of per capita income have achieved high levels of 
human development, while others with rapid growth and comparatively high income 
levels have not shown commensurate improvement in fulfilling basic human needs. 
3. Here's a look at some of the countries with the greatest disparity between 
their level of wealth and their human development performance. With 130 
countries evaluated, these figures are based on each nation's ranking in terms 
of gross national product per capita, less its ranking according to the U.N.'s 
Human Development Index. (see below) The lower the rating, the worse the 
country's record of translating its wealth into a comparable level of human 
development.
