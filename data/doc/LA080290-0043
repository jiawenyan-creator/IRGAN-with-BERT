ATLANTA ARCHBISHOP QUIT OVER RELATIONSHIP, CHURCH CONFIRMS 
The resignation last month of Atlanta's Roman Catholic archbishop was prompted 
by the discovery of his two-year relationship with a woman, his successor 
confirmed Wednesday. 
Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, 56, who was the nation's highest ranking black 
Roman Catholic, resigned July 10 for what he said were health reasons and the 
need for "spiritual renewal, psychological therapy and medical supervision." 
He had relinquished his duties in May because of severe stress and a near heart 
attack. 
But Atlanta television station WAGA reported Wednesday that Marino's 
resignation followed the church's discovery of a relationship between the 
archbishop and a lay minister, Vicki R. Long. Marino's temporary successor, 
Bishop James P. Lyke, said the former archbishop gave permission Wednesday to 
confirm the relationship after the television station's report. 
Neither the television station nor Lyke said whether the relationship was 
sexual in nature. 
Lyke said that church officials were told in March that Marino was involved 
with a woman. He defended the decision of the archdiocese to withhold the 
details of Marino's resignation. He said Marino was the only one who could 
"call the shots." 
Father Peter Dora, Atlanta Archdiocese spokesman, said church officials would 
not comment further until a news conference today. 
In 1987, Long filed a $2.3-million paternity suit against a priest, Donal 
Keohane of Columbus, alleging that he fathered her child. The church is paying 
child support, but denies that Keohane is the father of child. 
Long declined to comment about the allegations involving Marino. 
The television station reported it had obtained photographs of Marino and Long 
attending various functions together and a flight insurance policy for a trip 
to Mexico taken by Marino. Long was listed as the archbishop's beneficiary on 
the policy.
