FT  16 APR 91 / Bush warns of rail strike dangers
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday warned that failure of the rail industry to
avert a strike called for midnight tonight could 'seriously disrupt' the US
economy just as it was 'trying to turn around and get out of this
recession'.
Most of the country's 235,000 freight line workers have threatened to walk
off their jobs if there is no breakthrough in a three-year-old dispute over
wages and health benefits. Lengthy bargaining sessions convened over the
weekend by the National Mediation Board failed to produce a settlement.
The president urged labour and management to resolve their differences.
He said a report issued by a presidential emergency board, which held eight
months of hearings, could provide a basis for settling the dispute.
'Because of the potential economy-wide disruption, it would be prudent that
all efforts and actions be taken to avoid the strike,' he said. 'My
administration is willing to work with the parties to help in any way
possible.'
Mr Bush did not, however, threaten to go to Congress which could pass a bill
ordering the strikers back to work. While he did not specifically threaten
legislative action to block a strike, he implied that the recommendations of
the emergency board could be imposed if the parties failed to resolve the
dispute voluntarily.
A walkout would affect all Americans as well as the hundreds of thousands of
rail workers, since the rail industry transported a third of all goods sold
in the US, Mr Bush said.
Union officials said talks appeared stalled between two key unions - the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the United Transportation Union -
and railroad management.
A total of 11 unions are at loggerheads with railroad management.
