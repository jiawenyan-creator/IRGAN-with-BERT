SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; 
BREA-OLINDA GIRLS WILL PLAY THURSDAY 
Brea-Olinda's second-round game in the 3-AA girls' basketball playoffs has been 
postponed until Thursday at the direction of the Southern Section office, 
Associate Commissioner Dean Crowley said Tuesday. 
Brea-Olinda will meet Foothill, which defeated Rim of the World, 64-47, Tuesday 
night at Foothill. 
The Foothill-Rim of the World game had been scheduled for Saturday night, but 
snow prevented Rim of the World from traveling through the Cajon Pass to 
Foothill. The game was rescheduled for Monday, but the weather forced another 
postponement. 
Foothill's game with top-seeded Brea-Olinda was moved to Thursday to give the 
Knights (15-9) a day of preparation, Crowley said. 
A coin flip will determine the site of Thursday's game.
