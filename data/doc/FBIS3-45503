  [Text] Nanjing, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The development 
zone in Nantong city, Jiangsu Province, is attracting large 
foreign corporations. 
  According to Qian Zhongyi, chairman of the zone's 
Administration Committee, the zone had become home to 130 
foreign-funded enterprises with a combined investment totalling 
400 million U.S. dollars by the end of last year. It is now 
holding talks with overseas business people on the setting up of 
30 more projects. 
  In addition, an increasing number of foreign-funded 
enterprises have reinvested in the zone. 
  Located on the northern part of the estuary of the Chang 
Jiang River, China's longest, the five-sq-km Nantong development 
zone is fully occupied by foreign-funded projects, and is being 
expanded. 
  Qian noted that 95 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises 
are profitable. Their per capita gross profits rank fifth among 
development zones in China's 14 open coastal cities. 
  Qian predicted that foreign investment will surge ahead this 
year.
