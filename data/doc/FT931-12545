FT  28 JAN 93 / Mandatory code for GCSE marking
A NEW code of practice to ensure consistent marking of the GCSE examination
was sanctioned yesterday by the government. It is designed to tackle alleged
shortcomings in assessment procedures.
The mandatory code of practice will ensure standardised procedures for
awarding grades, assessing coursework and marking spelling, punctuation and
grammar between the five GCSE examining boards in England.
The code will begin to take effect this year and will be fully in place by
1994.
The School Examinations and Assessment Council, a government agency, will
appoint independent external assessors in each of the main national
curriculum subjects, to guarantee consistent standards across groups.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said: 'Parents and employers must have
confidence in GCSE exams. This new code will put beyond doubt the
credentials of the GCSE as a reliable way of measuring achievement at the
end of compulsory schooling.'
Claims of 'grade inflation' have been widespread since the GCSE replaced
O-levels as the examination taken by all 16-year-olds in England and Wales
1988. In 1987, the proportion of pupils gaining grades A to C in O-level,
generally considered to be the pass standard, was 39.8 per cent; in last
year's GCSEs, more than half gained the top three grades.
Lack of consistency marking the GCSE last year was criticised by the schools
inspectorate, leading Mr Patten to instruct SEAC to consider reforms.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, rejected 'the implication that GCSE standards were at risk', and
said agreement on the code was only possible 'because of existing good
practice'.
Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said the time had come
for a single national GCSE exam board to be established. 'We have a national
curriculum,' he said. 'We should have a national exam board.'
