  [Excerpts] Tempers have somewhat calmed down in Yafo, but 
hundreds of Arab residents are still clustered on Yefet Street. 
In the riot in the street this afternoon five people were 
slightly wounded by stones, among them policemen, an IDF Radio 
correspondent and an Israel television worker. Our 
correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i reports that hundreds of raging 
rioters threw stones, attacked policemen and passersby, called 
for avenging the Hebron massacre, and chanted anti-Israeli 
slogans. One shop was torched and several other shops on Yefet 
Street were damaged. Tires and garbage canisters were set 
ablaze and windows of several vehicles were smashed. The police 
used tear gas and repulsed the rioters from the street. Arab 
dignitaries from Yafo, Tel Aviv municipality representatives, 
and Police commanders are trying to calm tempers. Police 
Commissioner Rafi Peled is also at the site. [passage omitted]

hurled it at the policemen. One of the policemen, who thought 
the youth was handling a hand grenade, shot the youth and killed

place.
