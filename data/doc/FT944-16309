FT  14 OCT 94 / East-West disappearing act
A Bulgarian investment company is to reduce the value of its investors'
savings from Lv1.1bn (Dollars 17m) to Lv1m (Dollars 15,600), according to
the Bulgarian financial daily, Pari. The East-West International Holding
Group said its financial 'difficulties' were due to poor management of
incorporated companies based abroad, but business analysts believe East-West
is simply another east European pyramid scheme which exploits naive
investors unfamiliar with capitalism. Two months ago East-West suspended
payments and stopped trading at the Sofia stock exchange. Worried
shareholders queued in front of the company's headquarters in Sofia
yesterday to demand their money back, but were told that payment was
suspended. Some 8,000 people have bought 364,345 non-voting shares of
East-West at a price of Lv1,000, which are worth Lv1. East-West president
Ivo Nedyalkov, who controls the company's majority stake of voting shares,
was reported to be in London. 'Now I understand what East-West International
really means,' said an investor, 'we remain in the east and our money goes
west, together with Nedyalkov.'
