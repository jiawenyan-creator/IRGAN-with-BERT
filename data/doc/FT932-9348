FT  14 MAY 93 / Ship safety regime attacked
SHIP classification societies such as Lloyd's Register were criticised
yesterday when Lord Donaldson, chairman of the inquiry into the implications
of January's Braer shipping disaster, questioned the effectiveness of the
ship safety regime, Roger Milne writes.
He said that the 49 societies were inadequately regulated, too numerous and
requested vessel surveys too infrequently.
Mr Gary Beaumont, for Lloyd's Register, conceded that there had been a loss
of confidence in the societies by the underwriters, but blamed low freight
rates and an oversupply of ships for leaving little money to be spent on
maintenance and new construction during the 1980s.
He pointed out that the rate of ship casualties had fallen sharply last
year.
The inquiry also heard that lack of data on accidents and crew deaths is
hampering a full risk assessment of the move to double-hold tankers, led by
the US. The inquiry has heard that tankers with two 'skins' are not
necessarily the safety panacea many believe as they have an increased risk
of explosions.
The inquiry will begin a series of hearings in Scotland next week before
returning to London.
