Christine Laird, Derby's director of housing and environmental services, has
been appointed chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing. The
institute, which has 12,000 members, represents housing professionals, with
the bulk of its members working in local authority housing or for housing
associations.
Aged 38, Laird has experience of most aspects of public housing. She started
as a trainee housing manager in Birmingham's housing department in 1974 and
worked her way up to housing centre manager.
After a period as housing director of Copec housing trust, she returned to
municipal housing as assistant city housing officer for Worcester. She was
deputy housing director of Leicester City Council before moving to Derby.
A vice-president of the institute, she is currently a member of the Northern
Ireland Housing Policy Review Group and principal adviser on housing to the
Association of District Councils.
Derby is one of eight local authorities piloting compulsory competitive
tendering in housing management for the Environment department.
Laird will take up her new post in December, succeeding Peter McGurk, chief
executive for the past 12 years. McGurk becomes managing director of Inside
Communications, the institute's commercial arm which organises conferences
and produces publications on housing.
