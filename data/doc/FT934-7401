FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Orix plunges 53.3% halfway
ORIX, the leading Japanese leasing company, saw a sharp plunge in parent
pre-tax profits due to the prolonged economic slump, but managed to prop up
after-tax profits thanks to proceeds from stock sales, writes Emiko
Terazono.
Pre-tax profits for the first six months to September fell 53.3 per cent to
Y3.2bn on a 4.9 per cent decline in revenue to Y309.8bn. After-tax profits
increased by 1.1 per cent to Y2.5bn.
Operating profits fell 14.3 per cent to Y8.1bn, and the company posted
special profits of Y1.5bn due to sales of its stock holdings.
For the full year to March, Orix expects a 5.3 per cent fall in revenue to
Y620bn, but foresees a decline in its interest burden and projects a 89 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits to Y9.8bn.
