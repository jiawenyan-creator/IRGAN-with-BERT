FT  25 FEB 93 / 'Delighted' Airtours sees its share price rise by 5p
AIRTOURS' hostile Pounds 225m bid for rival holiday group, Owners Abroad,
took on renewed urgency yesterday.
This followed the decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, not to
refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The decision marks the end of the phoney war that has accompanied the early
stages of the bid as institutional shareholders have awaited Mr Heseltine's
decision.
Airtours' shares fell on the news before closing up 5p at 302p, while Owners
Abroad shares jumped 13p to 129p.
Airtours' three for eight share offer values each Owners share at 114p and
its partial cash alternative at 110p.
Owners Abroad welcomed Mr Heseltine's decision and Airtours said that it was
'delighted'.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, welcomed the removal of uncertainty
and a return to debate on the underlying value of Owners and its 'excellent
prospects'.
In a written statement , Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, called on
the Owners Abroad's board to 'recommend the offers without delay'.
Mr Klein said Owners Abroad's final defence document, due by Friday, would
focus on the fact that Airtours has under-valued Owners' worth and potential
and that there is great promise in the proposed partnership between Owners
and Thomas Cook, the travel and financial services company, controlled by
Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank.
City observers, said the proposed tie-up called on Thomas Cook to make a
minimal financial commitment of less than Pounds 2m for its 10 per cent
equity stake in Owners Abroad.
If Thomas Cook were to try to take even a blocking stake, it would have to
commit a greater amount of funds to the partnership.
