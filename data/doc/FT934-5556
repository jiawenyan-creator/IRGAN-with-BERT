FT  29 NOV 93 / Poll battle in Mexico
The Mexican state of Yucatan voted for a new governor yesterday in a closely
fought election where the centre-right opposition has a chance of snatching
victory from the governing party, writes Damian Fraser in Merida, Yucatan.
The opposition National Action party (PAN) views the state, on the eastern
tip of the country, as a stronghold. It already controls the state capital
and put up popular mayor Ana Rosa Payan as its candidate. The ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party enjoys the advantages of incumbency and is
still favourite. Mr Federico Granja, its candidate, says he has 240,000
committed supporters, nearly half the electoral roll.
