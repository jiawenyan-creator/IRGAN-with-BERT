CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
EL DORADO COUNTY; 
WATER RELEASE INTO STREAMS CONTINUED 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has been ordered to continue 
releasing water into four Mono Lake streams that have suffered damage from 
diversions into the city's aqueduct. El Dorado County Superior Court Judge 
Terrence Finney ruled on behalf of the National Audubon Society and Mono Lake 
Committee, which had said Los Angeles' diversions through the years have 
eliminated fisheries and streamside flora. 
Los Angeles was required by earlier rulings to give up part of its water supply 
to restore the streams and Mono Lake. But the new order details the minimum 
flows Los Angeles must maintain down Parker, Walker, Lee Vining and Rush 
creeks. A hearing to set the minimum water level of Mono Lake also is set to 
begin June 19.
