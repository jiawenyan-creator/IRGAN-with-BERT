FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Boral down 28.5% at midterm
BORAL, the Australian building products group, yesterday announced a 28.5
per cent cut in interim net profits to ADollars 91m (USDollars 68.4m) for
the six months to December on sales down 7.7 per cent to ADollars 1.9bn.
The group said trading had continued to be 'subdued' in January and
February. It added that the second-half result was unlikely to exceed the
comparable period of last year, implying a significant fall in full-year
profits.
Boral said the first half was adversely affected by an increase in the
effective tax rate from 38 per cent to 42 per cent and a decline in demand
for most of the group's products.
Australian operations are expected to benefit from infrastructure projects
announced last week by the federal government as part of a package of
measures intended to stimulate the economy.
However, the board said demand for materials for commercial building
construction was expected to continue to decline for some time.
Economic recovery in the US was expected to be 'modest,' and there was
little prospect of growth in the UK. The group said its businesses in both
countries were hit by a low level of demand in the first half.
Boral's balance sheet remained strong in spite of the 'difficult' economic
background. However, bad debts remain a problem: the group wrote off
ADollars 8.3m in the six months, in addition to provisions for doubtful
debts of ADollars 9.9m. The board said the level of bad and doubtful debts
was similar to the 'historically high' level of the 1990-91 financial year.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 8 cents a share, fully
franked, the same as the final dividend for the year to June 1991, but a 33
per cent reduction on the previous first half.
