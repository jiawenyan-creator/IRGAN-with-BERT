FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Robson Rhodes voted out as auditors of J
Foster
ROBSON RHODES was ousted as auditors to John Foster, the wool and textile
group, at an extraordinary general meeting.
Shareholders voted overwhelmingly to remove the firm in a highly unusual
meeting forced by Robson Rhodes' refusal to resign at the request of the
directors and without the approval of shareholders.
In a circular distributed last month, Mr Victor Watson, chairman, said that
while the last audit had been concluded satisfactorily, the board, which was
revamped about a year ago, wanted a change of accountants.
He recommended that Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte be appointed, primarily
because of the depth of resources the firm offered. It also tendered a lower
fee. Coopers is believed to have quoted at about 65 per cent of the Pounds
42,000 charged for the last financial year.
Nineteen of the company's 850 shareholders attended the 20-minute meeting in
Foster's mill at Queensbury, near Bradford. Robson Rhodes was represented by
Mr Hugh Aldous, national managing partner, and Mr Chris Connor, head of the
Leeds office.
Mr Connor said the firm had not been given any substantiated reason why it
should quit. 'We are here on a matter of great principle,' he said.
'Auditors owe their duties to shareholders as a body and are not the casual
appointees of the directors.'
But Mr Graham Creswick, finance director, said: 'We were badly let down by
the 1991 audit. It was very straightforward and perfectly competent, but it
was very quiet. We did not get the benefit we are entitled to expect.'
