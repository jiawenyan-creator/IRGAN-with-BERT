FT  14 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Saatchi
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's non-executive directors must decide at Friday's board
meeting whether to back their shareholders or their chairman. They should be
in no doubt where their duty lies. Investors accounting for a third of
Saatchi's shares want a change in group name and a scaling back of Mr
Maurice Saatchi's proposed options package. If directors do not listen to
shareholders, the group will be engulfed in a public squabble leading to a
bitter extraordinary general meeting. If Mr Saatchi makes his continuing
chairmanship dependent on no name change, other directors should call his
bluff. After all, in the nine years since he has chaired the group, its
shares have fallen by over 98 per cent against the market.
