FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists advances 16%
Lloyds Chemists, the UK's second largest pharmaceuticals retailer, yesterday
promised to step up dividend growth as it announced a 16 per cent increase
in interim pre-tax profits and a 35 per cent rise in the first half pay-out.
The dividend, up from 2p to 2.7p, is covered more than five times by fully
diluted earnings of 13.96p (12.4p). Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman, said the group
intended to increase the payment until cover approached the stores sector
average of more than twice.
The decision reflected the board's confidence in the group's less
acquisitive future, he said. It had been two years since the last large
acquisition - that of Macarthy in 1992 - but Lloyds 'continued to show good
rates of growth'.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 were Pounds 26.2m (Pounds
22.6m) on sales up by 17 per cent to Pounds 460m (Pounds 394.7m).
The largest sales advance came from the pharmaceuticals division, which
increased net external sales by 44 per cent to Pounds 123.2m (Pounds 85.7m).
This included an 80 per cent improvement in external sales to Pounds 94m at
Barclay Pharmaceuticals, the wholesaler. However, the wholesaling
environment continued to be very difficult, Mr Lloyd said.
The flu season, which was earlier than expected, helped boost sales in the
retail division from Pounds 284.5m to Pounds 307.7m. The company said
like-for-like sales were 9 per cent higher in the chemists shops, 1 per cent
up in the Supersave Drugstores, and 3 per cent ahead in the Holland &amp;
Barrett healthfood chain. Margins had improved, partly due to the
introduction of electronic point of sales systems, from 7.6 per cent to 8
per cent over the 12 months.
On debt of Pounds 31.6m (Pounds 32.4m) gearing fell to 25 per cent from 31
per cent. The group announced a seven-year loan facility of Dollars 100m
(Pounds 68m) at 7 per cent interest.
COMMENT
Lloyds is stressing its organic growth record in order to prove that the
lingering doubts about accounting practices and quality of earnings are
unfounded, While some concerns may have been allayed, others are beginning
to appear.
These include the potential for the wholesaling division, which is suffering
some margin pressure in a competitive environment. There is also the
question of a replacement for Mr Dick Steele, the departing finance
director.
These issues may well explain why the company continues to trade at a
substantial discount to the stores sector. Forecasts are for between Pounds
55m and Pounds 57m, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of about 12.
Their attraction may be enhanced by an improved yield of 3.7 per cent.
