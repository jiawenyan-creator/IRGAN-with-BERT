DAVIS WILL GET BONUS FOR ALL-STAR GAME 
Outfielder Eric Davis will receive a $55,000 bonus for appearing in tonight's 
All-Star game, Reds General Manager Murray Cook said. 
There had been some doubt about the bonus because Davis' contract calls for the 
bonus if he was elected by fans. Davis was not elected but selected by the 
National League to play. 
"Our position is that if a player is on the All-Star team, he receives the 
bonus," Cook said. "It doesn't matter if he is elected or selected to the 
team."
