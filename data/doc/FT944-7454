FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Stora surges as demand rises
Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, yesterday announced a
SKr2.04bn (Dollars 277m) pre-tax profit for the first nine months, a
seven-fold increase on last year's SKr294m.
Higher volumes, lower financial costs, the weak krona and capital gains all
contributed to the surge. Mr Lars Ake Helgesson, chief executive, said the
group had benefited from higher prices during the third quarter.
Average prices were up 1 per cent, with higher pulp, fine paper, newsprint
and packaging paper prices offset by lower board, magazine paper and
light-weight coated paper prices.
Mr Helgesson said the impact of higher prices would be greater in future,
since prices for half the group's production volume were yet to improve.
Prices for newsprint and uncoated magazine paper were due to rise by as much
as 25 per cent from January, he said.
The upturn in pulp and paper demand means Stora is operating virtually flat
out, with capacity use rising to 93 per cent from 89 per cent and deliveries
climbing 6 per cent to 5.11m tonnes. The increase in European demand for the
group's products ranges from 5 per cent for newsprint to 18 per cent for
coated fine papers. The trend has helped to push up underlying sales by 11
per cent to SKr35.3bn.
Operating income of SKr2.94bn included one-off gains of SKr590m, arising
mainly from the sale of the Tarkett floor material unit. The comparable 1993
figure was SKr1.55bn, when there were one-off gains of SKr188m.
The group's financial costs fell to SKr905m from SKr1.26bn due to lower
interest rates and a reduced debt burden.
All of the group's divisions improved their performance, except for Stora
Financial Services, where operating income dropped to SKr249m from last
year's unusually strong SKr702m. Stora Feldmuhle lifted profits to SKr641m
from SKr90m, while Stora Papyrus saw profits jump to SKr509m from SKr158m.
Stora Power and Stora Building Products were the only divisions to remain in
the red.
Analysts are predicting a full-year profit of more than SKr3bn after last
year's SKr530m.
