FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at Colorgraphic
COLORGRAPHIC, the adver-tising and direct mail group, has gone into
administrative receivership. The company had been in talks with its bankers
after breaching banking covenants.
Mr David Lovett and Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen have been appointed
joint receivers and hope to sell the company as a going concern. Analysts
said it looked unlikely that shareholders would recoup any of their
investment.
Colorgraphic's shares were suspended at 25p on June 30, valuing the company
at Pounds 4.2m. On the same day Mr Nick Winks, chief executive, and Mr Alan
MacLeod, marketing director, left the company. Mr Ron Welch, founder and
executive chairman, resumed the chief executive's role. He was not available
for comment yesterday.
The company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.3m in 1991, blaming the
recession. The 1991 accounts, published in March, received an unqualified
auditor's report. Net debt and finance lease obligations totalled Pounds
5.8m compared to shareholders funds of Pounds 8.8m.
Mr Welch, who holds 27.5 per cent of the shares, said in the annual report
that the board was confident it was 'very well placed to resume growth again
in 1992'. The report also showed that four leading institutions held
significant stakes in the group.
Analysts were surprised by the speed of the downfall. One said: 'It is hard
to reconcile the year-end position and the position now.'
Earlier this week Colorgraphic put two of its subsidiaries into
receivership. Its US and Dutch subsidiaries and The Decisions Group, its 50
per cent-owed UK associate, are not in receivership.
