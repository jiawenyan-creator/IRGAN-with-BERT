  [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro said in the Colombian 
city of Cartagena de Indias, where he attended the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit, that Cuba has its own means of popular 
participation and there is no exclusive model of democracy. 
  In statements to the U.S. television network CNN, the top 
Cuban leader said that popular participation on the island is 
more practical than in the rest of Latin America. 
  Castro said Latin America's land and wealth distribution 
systems are among the worst in the world and that Cuba, 
meanwhile, has made the greatest social progress in the 
hemisphere's history. 
  As for the Ibero-American summits, Castro underscored the 
positive mark they have left in addition to fostering friendship 
among the nations of the region. 
  Regarding the U.S. blockade against the island, Castro 
explained that he had to attend the summit to express his 
concern about the lack of opposition to that unfair measure 
aimed at making the Cuban people give in to hunger. He also 
described as complex the issue of Cuba's possible reinstatement 
to the OAS, adding that it is being considered.
