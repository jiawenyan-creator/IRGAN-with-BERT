BUSH BLAMES CONGRESS FOR BUDGET DEFICIT 
President Bush today put most of the blame for the federal budget deficit on 
Congress and said he wouldn't lay out his proposals for cutting the red ink 
because that would undermine talks with Capitol Hill. 
"If I outlined the problem now, I'd rely on some of the fact that the Congress 
appropriates all the money and raises all the revenues. . . . I will point out 
that people understand that the Congress bears a greater responsibility for 
this," Bush said at a news conference when asked about his refusal to publicly 
lay out his plan for cutting the U.S. budget deficit. 
"But I'm not trying to assign blame. That's why I'm not doing it right now," he 
said with a smile as reporters exploded in laughter. 
"If I go out now and say what I think . . . I might say something like I just 
said, and I don't want to do that," a grinning Bush added. 
Bush called the talks because higher interest rates, weakness in the economy 
and rising costs for shoring up the savings and loan industry have pushed the 
deficit far higher than expected. 
The Gramm-Rudman budget law could force automatic spending cuts of more than 
$70 billion unless a deal is worked out. Cuts of that magnitude would likely 
hit basic government services and programs and could spell trouble for 
congressmen seeking reelection in November.
