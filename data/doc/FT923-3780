FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Heron bond holders to receive interest
Holders of Heron International's bonds are to receive interest covering the
period from December 1991 to June 26 this year.
The total amount involved is about Pounds 15m, of which half will come from
escrow accounts into which the group paid interest accruing between March 26
and June 26.
Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's private property, housebuilding and automotive
group, which is in the middle of a financial restructuring, had suspended
interest payments on all its bank debt and bonds.

to be completed in the autumn.
