  [Excerpts] Wroclaw, 17 Jun--President Lech Walesa arrived 
in Wroclaw this afternoon, where he is to attend tomorrow's 
graduation parade of officer cadets of the Tadeusz Kosciuszko 
Mechanized Troops College graduating with the rank of 
lieutenant. [passage omitted] 
  When asked if he was not afraid that the left would win in 
the local government elections on Sunday, Walesa replied that he 
divided people into active and inactive, and the active people 
into less or more prepared. "Whatever we may say, inside the 
left, because it was in power for 50 years, people are better 
prepared. And that is normal for the times we live in. The 
right has to learn and learn again, and, in a short time, it 
will be in power. It depends on the learning--if there are a 
lot of prize pupils, it will be quicker," the president told 
journalists.
