  [Text] The Council of Ministers held an exceptional meeting 
this morning to discuss political and military developments. 
The conferees discussed the Higher National Defense Council's 
decisions, especially the need to adopt all measures to maintain 
the sixth cease-fire, which went into effect at 2400 last night, 
in response to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
appeal and the humanitarian cease-fire calls by brothers and 
friends. However, during its exceptional meeting, the Council 
of Ministers received a number of military communiques and 
reports indicating that the rebels have violated the cease-fire.
