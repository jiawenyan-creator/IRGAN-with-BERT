NBC CHANGES 'DRUG WARS' PROMOS AFTER NORIEGA ARREST 
Following the surrender of former Panama strongman Manuel Noriega Wednesday 
night, NBC said Thursday it was changing its promos of "Drug Wars: The Camarena 
Story" to include mention of Noriega's alleged ties to drug traffickers such as 
those depicted in the miniseries. 
The six-hour drama, which airs Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, tells the story of 
Enrique (Kiki) Camarena, a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent 
whose abduction and murder in 1985 has been tied to drug lords in Mexico. 
"Noriega was the funnel for drug lords in Mexico, and Kiki Camarena went up 
against a major drug lord there," John Miller, the NBC vice president in charge 
of promotion, said in an interview Thursday. "We began to mention Noriega in 
headlines in our promos several days ago. But last night, as we were watching 
news stories about Noriega's surrender and his ties to the drug trade, we 
decided, 'This is a real connection to a major news event -- let's take 
advantage of it."' 
Exact wording of the new spots was still being worked out.
