METROMEDIA IS IN TALKS TO SELL ITS 70% ORION STAKE 
Metromedia Co., which is controlled by investor John Kluge, confirmed Friday 
that is in "extremely preliminary" talks with several potential buyers of its 
70% stake in Orion Pictures Corp. 
Metromedia didn't identify the potential buyers, though recent published 
reports have said Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis was among them. 
Davis didn't return a call seeking comment on the reports. 
Orion shares closed Friday at $22.50, up 75 cents, as 117,900 shares changed 
hands in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
On Thursday, Orion had said it didn't know of any corporate development that 
would account for a $2.875 jump in its stock price that day. 
Orion captured only about 4.2% of the domestic box office in 1989 -- down from 
6.6% in 1988 and 10.4% in 1987 -- and has been plagued by repeated rumors of a 
pending management shake-up. 
An Orion spokeswoman said she wasn't aware of any major changes in company 
management.
