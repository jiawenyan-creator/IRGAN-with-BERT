  [Text] Moscow, 17 Feb -- Russia's Air Force will not take 
part in bombing Bosnia. This is in accord with the position 
adopted by Russia which has expressed its opposition to missile 
and bomb strikes against Bosnian Serbs. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told today in the press center of the Air 
Force that the Russian Air Force Command considers that the 
Bosnian conflict must be resolved by political methods. 
  Russian military airmen consider that with modern aerial 
equipment it is difficult to achieve high precision bombing of 
artillery positions. In conditions of mountainous, broken 
terrain in former Yugoslavia, the effect of aerial bombing will 
be insignificant. The Russian Air Force Command, in particular, 
is worried that totally innocent people and the civilian 
population could suffer during the bombing. 
  The press center of the Russian Air Force rules out the 
possibility of any future participation by Russian Air Forces in 
the peacekeeping forces under the UN's aegis.
