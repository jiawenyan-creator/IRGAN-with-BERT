  [Text] Bonn, 12 May -- Cooperation between German and 
Russian savings banks, which has existed since the end of 1991, 
is to be further developed and intensified. This has been 
agreed by Horst Koehler, president of the German Giro 
Association (DSGV), and Oleg Yashin, president of Rossberbank, 
at a meeting in Bonn. As the DSFV announced, the Russian 
savings bank, which has 42,000 offices, 200,000 employees, and a 
balance sheet sum of about 2 billion German marks, is among the 
five largest Russian banks and is the only Russian bank that has 
a nationwide network of offices. 
  According to the DSGV, other fields of cooperation are a 
small-loan program for the newly developing medium-sized 
industry in Nishniy-Novgorod, participation in financing housing 
construction and in leasing business, advice for the 
establishment of a savings bank association, as well as joint 
ventures with the Central German Handicrafts Association (ZDH), 
whose Secretary General Hanns-Eberhard Schleyer also attended 
the meeting in Bonn. Already, the German savings banks and land 
banks are participating in the establishment of a decentralized, 
market economy banking sector in Russia via the Savings Banks 
Foundation for International Cooperation.
