FT  11 FEB 92 / Appointments: Activism versus action
Paddy Linaker, the blunt-spoken managing director of M&amp;G Group, is to take
over as chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers Association in May. He
succeeds Charles Nunnelly of Robert Fleming Asset Management, who served as
IFMA's first chairman.
Linaker is a suitable choice for a trade organisation which has on occasion
taken a more aggressive stance on shareholder issues than its Bank of
England-backed counterpart, the Institutional Shareholders' Committee. Among
other things, IFMA has urged shareholders to vote against the award of stock
options offered to company directors at a discount, and has spoken out on
terms of directors' contracts.
Linaker is said privately to hold the view that shareholder activism is too
infrequently translated into action - a view on which he will have ample
scope to pronounce in his new role.
