FT  11 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 25m marine treatment works
scheme
BIWATER TREATMENT, a division of Biwater Europe, has been awarded a Pounds
25m contract for the design and construction of the new Eastbourne Marine
Treatment Works by Southern Water.
The scheme is a big part of Southern Water's 'Operation Seaclean', and will
provide primary treatment facilities for up to 216,000 cu m per day of
incoming sewage from Eastbourne and surrounding areas.
The works, scheduled for completion in December 1995, will incorporate fine
screening, grit removal and chemically assisted primary settlement using
lamella plate separators. The primary effluent will then be pumped to sea
via a 3.2km outfall.
The plant will be completely underground involving highly complex civil
construction due to its location on the seashore.
