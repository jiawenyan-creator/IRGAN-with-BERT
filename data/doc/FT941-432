FT  30 MAR 94 / People: Sir Tom Cowie joins rival EMH
Sir Tom Cowie, 71, who stepped down at the end of 1993 after 45 years as
chairman of the company he founded, seems intent on getting back into the
motor trade business. He's been recruited as a non-executive director of
European Motor Holdings where Roger Smith, 54, a past president of the
Retail Motor Industry Federation, has just been made chairman.
Sir Tom has never been one to collect non-executive directorships and he
says that he's limiting himself to EMH, where the chief executive is Richard
Palmer, 47. Palmer made his mark in the City by selling Western Motor
Holdings to Tozer Kemsley at a substantial profit in 1990 and he hopes EMH
will be equally successful.
In terms of market capitalisation, T. Cowie is eight times the size of EMH
but Sir Tom says that the board is 'young and ambitious and so am I'. Sir
Tom, who owns just under 5 per cent of Cowie and remains life president,
intends to buy a stake in EMH. He says that he's 'one of those strange
people who believe in putting their money where their mouth is'.
Roger Smith, who has taken over from Jeff Bizley, goes back a long way with
Sir Tom. He is a former chairman of Trimoco, which was taken over by
Hartwell, and an old grouse-shooting chum. Even so Sir Tom's decision to
join the EMH board has caused some puzzlement at his old firm. Sir Tom, for
his part, will not comment on rumours that he was unhappy with the way he
was gently edged out of power. All he will say is that 'it's nice to join a
happy camp'.
In the City, news of Sir Tom's new job has had a mixed reception. One
analyst says that Sir Tom built a large and very successful business but
towards the end he was 'spending more and more time on the grouse moors'.
And, he continues, it is 'an absolute travesty' to suggest that Sir Tom
posed any threat to his old firm.
