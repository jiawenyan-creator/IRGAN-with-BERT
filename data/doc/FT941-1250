FT  25 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Latin America): Uncertain prospects for
Mexico
With the country's financial markets closed yesterday following the
assassination of thepresidential candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio on
Wednesday, active trading in Mexican equities was seen in New York and
Europe.
A rush of sell orders initially led to the suspension of Telmex ADRs in New
York. They were later requoted and at the close of trading had fallen
Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 60 1/8 .
Ms Sarah Lavers of Latinvest in London commented that European investors had
taken a measured view of events so far, with expectations of a possible
correction in the market of between 5-10 per cent.
A more important test would come from US investors, she added, while the key
determinant of the market's future direction would come from the currency
markets. If the local currency weakened appreciably, then this would clearly
put a certain amount of pressure on companies with dollar debt, she said.
Investors were waiting to see whether Mr Manual Camacho Solis, who had
announced earlier in the week that he would not put his name forward as a
presidential candidate, would change his mind.
Kleinwort Benson's Latin American team commented that the central bank was
likely to allow the peso to break out of its trading band in the short-term,
while interest rates were also expected to rise.
Elsewhere, equities opened sharply lower in BUENOS AIRES where the Merval
index dropped 2.2 per cent to 589.16.
This followed a gain of 4.7 per cent on Wednesday, and a rise of 2.8 per
cent on Tuesday.
