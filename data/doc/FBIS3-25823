  [Text] Shenyang, January 30 (XINHUA) -- About 14,000 
unemployed workers and staff members in Shenyang city, the 
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, are now 
receiving relief payments from the Unemployed Insurance Service. 
  Dong Lianzhi, an official of the Shenyang City Labor Bureau, 
said that the relief funds for the unemployed last year amounted 
to about 3 million yuan, the highest sum in history. 
  The official said that most of the unemployed were from 
enterprises. According to their different working years, they 
could get relief payments for from three to 24 months, adding 
that the monthly payment to each of them would be about 75 
percent of their past salary. 
  As one of China's leading heavy-industry cities and the 
largest industrial base in northeast China, Shenyang has more 
than 5,500 enterprises, with 2.3 million employees. 
  With the deepening of the reforms in the economic sector and 
labor system in China, the number of unemployed people is 
expected to increase. 
  To provide living guarantees for the unemployed in the city, 
the relevant Shenyang labor department set up the insurance fund 
service for the unemployed in 1986. 
  So far, at least 18,000 unemployed people have benefited 
from 
the system.
