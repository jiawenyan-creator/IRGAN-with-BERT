FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Tokyo
Investors remain cautious over the direction of the yen and announcements of
revised interim corporate earnings, writes Emiko Terazono.
Although share prices failed to react to most of last week's upward revision
announcements, investors have not missed the opportunity to sell on downward
earnings revision releases.
While buying by public pension and insurance funds is expected to support
the 225-share Nikkei average until the listing of Japan Tobacco later this
month, a further fall of Japan Telecom could trigger selling.
