THE SIDELINES; 
SENNA SHATTERS MONACO RECORD 
Ayrton Senna of Brazil shattered the qualifying lap record on the first day of 
trials today and won the provisional pole position for Sunday's Monaco Grand 
Prix. 
Senna, in a McLaren-Honda, sped through the Monte Carlo street course in 1 
minute, 21.797 seconds. 
That bettered by more than a half-second his own qualifying mark set last year 
of 1:22.308. He averaged 91.01 m.p.h. today. 
The second best time was turned in by Senna's teammate, Gerhard Berger of 
Austria -- 1:23.001. Third was surprising Jean Alesi of France in a 
Tyrrell-Ford -- 1:23.372. 
After an off day Friday, the drivers come back on Saturday for the second 
qualifying session to determine the final starting grid for Sunday's Formula 
One race. 
Senna leads the world drivers' championship standings after three races with 13 
points. Prost and Berger have 12 points.
