  [Text] With the evacuation operation approaching its end, 
the question of whether our Blue helmets will remain in Rwanda 
needs to be clarified. In this respect, Foreign Minister Claes 
sounded out UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on this in 
Bonn last night. Butrus-Ghali reacted positively to Minister 
Claes' request to withdraw the Belgian Blue Helmets from Rwanda. 
This station has learned this from a reliable source. 
  The UN secretary general, however, wants a formal decision 
on 
this by the Security Council, which reportedly could meet today. 
  Belgium thus will avoid a unilateral withdrawal. A limited 
cabinet meeting was held this morning. The only topic on the 
agenda was the situation in Rwanda. The government is closely 
monitoring the evacuation of Belgians, as well as a possible 
withdrawal of the Blue Helmets from Rwanda. The government also 
has decided to hang the flags on public buildings at half-mast 
as a sign of national mourning, from tomorrow at 1100 to 
Saturday [16 April].
