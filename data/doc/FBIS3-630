  [Text] Our guest this morning is Pascal Lissouba, the 
president of Congo, who is having a number of high-level 
meetings in Paris at the moment. He has been able to meet 
President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Balladur, and the ministers 
of cooperation and of foreign affairs. This has enabled both 
sides to take stock of relations between France and Congo. 
Pascal Lissouba spoke to Monique Mas: 
  [Begin recording] [Lissouba] We have had with France--I 
can't 
say a conflict, I can't say say a problem--I would prefer to say 
a misunderstanding. And I have come here not to try to make 
myself loved but to try to make myself understood. 
  We had to sign a contract with Occidental Oil, and this was 
misunderstood. I misunderstood other people. And today I have 
understood what they wanted to say, and I have give a positive 
response to our French partners, Elf, since I have taken a bill 
that I have submitted to the National Assembly to strengthen 
Elf's place in my country. 
  [Mas] (?There) were also aspects to this quarrel that could 
more or less be described as political. Some rather harsh 
things were said about you, for example, by the French minister 
of cooperation. 
  [Lissouba] Who said in substance, to you, to the media, that 
strictness is a mark of love. Why should I think the opposite? 
In my country there is a proverb that says: You throw 
[indistinct word] where it bears fruit. 
  [Mas] Is France always going to be a factor for Congo? 
  [Lissouba] [sentence indistinct] Congo had the honor of 
being, in a small part of its history, the capital of 
[indistinct word]. The ties binding us are not simply material 
ties. (?The day) we stop being connected with France, we 
(?shall) stop speaking French. Seventy percent of our debt is 
with France. If we want to get out of this, we have to come to 
an agreement with France. 
  [Mas] In the past few months political life in Congo has 
been 
very chaotic, with bloody clashes. What do you think the nature 
of this situation is? 
  [Lissouba] Let us say [words indistinct] it is a lack of 
democratic culture. Imagine that for 25 years power (?was 
achieved) at the barrel of a gun. Then suddenly, as if by 
magic, you tell them: No, power isn't at the barrel of a gun, it 
is in talking. 
  [Mas] The question of security is fundamental in Congo? 
  [Lissouba] Decisive. 
  [Mas] [words indistinct] Israeli mercenaries. Why? 
  [Lissouba] Why do you call them mercenaries? Say it. No, 
they aren't mercenaries. They are gentlemen who have a skill, 
and we simply found ourselves in a position to buy this skill -- 
that is the word -- to help our young people to protect our 
people tomorrow against the oppression I have just described as 
ridiculous. 
  [Mas] And the Congolese Army? After all, your prime minister 
is still General Yhombi-Opango, who, incidentally, is a former 
head of state. 
  [Lissouba] Of course, a former head of state. So today it is 
not his position as a general that counts. Since he has been 
head of state, it is his political sense. And he is a 
politician whom I took for reasons connected with our history. 
  [Mas] You announced a government of national unity. 
  [Lissouba] No. When I came to power, I spoke of a government 
of national unity. I didn't ask for a government based on 
parties. That wasn't what I wanted. They wanted to impose on me 
a government based on parties. When we held this experiment for 
three or four months, it was a disaster. I called the 
opposition prime minister, and before coming to see me, he first 
went to consult the head of his party. I don't want this sort 
of exercise, this sort of government. 
  And what I call a government of national unity today has 
nothing to do with that. I want to take specialists, experts, 
from all sides, on condition that they agree to work for their 
country. If we have a program, and we want to implement it, and 
the people seem to agree, let's work together. On that basis. 
  [Mas] So no sharing of power, but perhaps personalities from 
the opposition invited to support your political program? 
  [Lissouba] First, no, not to support my political program. 
To support a program that will help the Congolese people to get 
out of their difficulties. 
  (?Now) sharing power. But power isn't simply being a 
minister. We are going to decentralize our country. At the head 
of each region there will be people elected by the people. It 
could be someone from the opposition. And he will administer 
the region with the means that the government puts at his 
disposal, all the more in that the essence of this 
decentralization is to try to distribute in the least unequal 
possible way the resources and the products of the nations. We 
want to give them to each region so that they can develop. That 
is what power is. 
  So what kind of sharing do we need? That I should divide our 
country (?in two)? [end recording]
