  [Text] Comitan, Mexico, 10 Jan (EFE) -- The Zapatista 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) today released approximately 80 
social security workers it had held hostage in Guadalupe 
Tepeyac, which is about 800 meters from the Guatemalan border. 
  The workers, who walked 40 km to the community of Pimienta, 
said there could be about 100 EZLN members in Guadalupe Tepeyac 
and that they had reports that former Chiapas Governor Absalon 
Castellanos Dominguez might be in that town. Castellanos, who 
was Chiapas governor from 1982 to 1988, was kidnapped on 2 
January by EZLN members and his whereabouts remain unknown.
