FT  24 JAN 94 / International Company News: Full-year deficit for Amdahl of
Dollars 580m
Amdahl, the US mainframe computer company, reported continuing losses for
its fourth quarter as it struggled to adjust to weak demand and fiercely
competitive pricing in the market for IBM-compatible mainframe computer
systems.
Fourth-quarter losses were Dollars 40.9m, or 36 cents per share, on revenues
of Dollars 443m. In the same period last year, the company recorded net
income of Dollars 2.4m, or 2 cents a share, and revenues of Dollars 745m
For the year, including third-quarter pre-tax restructuring charges of
Dollars 478m, net losses were Dollars 580m, or Dollars 5.09 a share, on
revenues of Dollars 1,68bn. In 1992, Amdahl incurred pre-tax workforce
reduction charges of Dollars 25m and suffered a net loss of Dollars 7m, or 6
cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 2.5bn.
Fujitsu of Japan, which holds a 44 per cent stake in Amdahl, has agreed to
provide the US company with Dollars 100m in low-interest loans, according to
reports from Japan - which also say Fujitsu will provide Amdahl with
high-speed work stations to be sold under the Amdahl brand name.
This month, Amdahl announced an agreement with Fujitsu jointly to develop a
new generation of mainframe computers. The agreement will reduce research
and development costs, it said.
