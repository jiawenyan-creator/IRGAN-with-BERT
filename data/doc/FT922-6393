FT  23 MAY 92 / Fears rise of further Outhwaite cash calls
NAMES on the troubled Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 at the Lloyd's insurance
market may need to pay new cash calls to meet higher-than-expected losses on
the 1982 year.
In February, nearly two thirds of the syndicate's 1,614 Names won a Pounds
116m out-of-court settlement compensating them for losses. The deal included
a Pounds 34m provision to compensate for claims still arising from US
liability reinsurance business. There are now fears that this amount could
be inadequate. It is understood that claims of about Pounds 24m were
notified last year, bringing the syndicate's losses for 1982 to about Pounds
224m.
