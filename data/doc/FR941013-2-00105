 

The trading of options on the Israeli Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, however, raises
several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact.
The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the Amex adequately has addressed these concerns.




A. Index Design and Structure



The Commission finds that the Israeli Index is a narrow-based index. The Israeli Index is composed of only eleven securities,
all of which represent Israeli companies.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, in light of the limited number of components in the Index, the Commission believes it is proper to classify
the Israeli Index as narrow-based and apply Amex's rules governing narrow-based index options to trading in the Index
options.



<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The reduced-value Israeli Index, which is composed of the same component securities as the Index and calculated by
dividing the Index value by ten, is identical to the Israeli Index.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the overwhelming
majority of the components that comprise the Index are actively traded, with an average daily trading volume for the
period from January, 1994 through June, 1994, ranging from a high of 453,000 shares per day to a low of 32,000 shares
per day. Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging, during the same
period, from a high of $1.46 billion to a low of $80 million, with the mean and median being $487.7 million and $252.95
million, respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of eleven component securities, no one particular
security or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no one stock or ADR comprises more than 12% of the
Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 60% of the Index's
value. Fourth, at least 85% of the securities in the Index, by weight, and at least 80% of the number of components of
the Index, must be eligible for standardized options trading. This proposed maintenance requirement will ensure
that the Index is substantially comprised of options-eligible securities.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Fifth, if the Amex increases the number of component securities to more than fourteen or decreases that number to less
than nine, the Amex will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before listing
new strike price or expiration month series of Israeli Index options and Index LEAPS. This will help protect against
material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the Amex's obligations to
protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in Israeli Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the Amex
will be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa31
of the Act. This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission
believes that, as discussed below, the existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in the underlying Index components
(or options on those securities), will help deter such illegal activity.

</FOOTNAME>
Currently, nine of the eleven Index components are options-eligible securities while 89% of the Index, by weight,
is comprised of options-eligible securities.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission finds that the Exchange's requirements covering minimum capitalization, monthly trading volume,
and relative weightings of component stocks are designed to ensure that the trading markets for component stocks
are adequately capitalized and sufficiently liquid, and that no one stock or stock group dominates an index. Thus,
the Commission believes these standards are reasonably designed to ensure the protection of investors and the public
interest and that the satisfaction of these requirements significantly minimizes the potential for manipulation
of the Index.




B. Customer Protection



The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as Israeli Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Israeli LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized
exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: 
(1) The special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; 
(2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and

(3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the Index options and
Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the
Amex, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in Israeli
Index options and full-value and reduced-value Israeli Index LEAPS.




C. Surveillance



The Commission believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing the list a security
index derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the securities underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
security index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the Amex, NYSE, and NASD are all members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary
surveillance information.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Further, as to present and future ADR components of the Index, either the Exchange must have comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreements with the primary foreign markets for the securities underlying the ADRs or the U.S. must be the
relevant market for surveillance purposes.

If the prices of the ADR components, or the composition of the Index, should change so that greater than 20% of the weight
of the Index would be represented by ADRs whose underlying securities were not the subject of a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement with the Amex, then it would be difficult for the Commission to reach the conclusions reached in
this order and the Commission would have to determine whether it would be suitable for the Exchange to continue to trade
options on this Index. The Amex should, accordingly, notify the Commission immediately if more than 20% of the numerical
value of the Index is represented by ADRs whose underlying securities are not subject to a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement. Such a change in the current relative weights of the Index or in the composition of the Index will
warrant the submission of a rule filing pursuant to Section 19 of the Act. In determining whether a particular ADR is
subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement,
