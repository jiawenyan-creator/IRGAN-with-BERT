  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Poland will not accept the NATO 
decision not to allow members of the former Warsaw Pact join the 
organization, Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski told 
the news magazine DER SPIEGEL. His country will do all it can 
to "become a member." However, with regard to "Russia's 
encirclement phobia," nothing will be undertaken that would harm 
Moscow's interests. If Russia continues on its way to 
democracy, Olechowski said, the "resistance against our 
membership" will fade. Otherwise the West will have to admit 
Poland into the defense alliance despite a Russian veto. There 
is "no alternative" to this, the Polish foreign minister 
stressed.
