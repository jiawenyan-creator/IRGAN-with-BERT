Pedestrians sprint down a Cairo street yesterday as a strong earthquake

appeal for doctors to report to hospitals after collapsing buildings left at
least 65 people dead and 381 injured, Tony Walker reports from Cairo.
The earthquake, which struck soon after 4pm local time, was Cairo's most
severe earth tremor for more than 30 years.
Mr Rida Abdel-Aziz, Cairo's security chief who was heading rescue
co-ordination, gave the early casualty figures, which were broadcast over
state radio.
Experts at the US Geological Survey reported the tremor at around 5.9 on the
Richter scale - strong enough to damage a city extensively .
