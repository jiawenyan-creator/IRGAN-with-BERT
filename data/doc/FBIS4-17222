  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 19/4/1994 -- The parliamentary 
commission for ensuring the performance of Ilie Ilascu's deputy 
functions, held yesterday in Tiraspol negotiations with Dniester 
leaders regarding the release of political detainees, told BASA 
Sergiu Mocanu, member of the Commission of the Christian 
Democratic Popular Front [FPCD] Alliance. Mocanu specified that 
during the meeting with Vladimir Bodnar, vice-president of the 
Supreme Soviet of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic and 
Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeyev), president of the Tiraspol Security 
Committee, the Moldovan side suggested for discussion two 
problems: manners of discussing the problem of releasing Ilascu 
and the access of members of the commission to the detainees. 
"According to the available information, the health of our 
detainees is very bad, especially Ilascu's, one of the causes 
being the constant pressures to make them ask Smirnov for a 
pardon," mentioned Mocanu, specifying that Ilascu has not 
information sources at all. According to the quoted source, 
Bodnar refused to discuss the release of Ilascu, emphasizing 
that "he is a criminal," but Shevtsov promised to organize a 
meeting of the commission with the detainees of the Ilascu group.
