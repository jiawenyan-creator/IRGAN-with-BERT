FT  04 FEB 93 / Soweto violence in dispute over taxis
ANGRY taxi drivers yesterday stoned buses and attacked bus drivers in
Soweto, South Africa's biggest black township, and police were trying to
stop the protest spreading into central Johannesburg, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg. Two people have been killed and dozens injured in running
battles between police and the protesting taxi drivers in the South African
commercial capital, which was declared an unrest area on Tuesday night.
The drivers allege that they are constantly harassed by police and are
demanding government subsidies.
