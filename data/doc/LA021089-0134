The Rev. Jesse Jackson flatly denied any interest in running for mayor of 
Washington and said he would never move to unseat Mayor Marion Barry. "I've 
expressed no interest in the job," Jackson said after leading an anti-drug 
rally at a city high school. "Under no condition would I run against Marion 
Barry." Asked later if he would run if Barry decided not to seek reelection in 
1990, Jackson responded: "I have expressed no desire to be mayor."
