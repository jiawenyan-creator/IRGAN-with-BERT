FT  04 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: News Intl rises
A sparkling set of results from BSKyB, the 50 per cent-owned satellite
television arm of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, offset a hit from
the recent Sun and Times price cuts. News International, News Corp's UK
subsidiary, rose 21 to 314p.
BSKyB's main UK shareholders, Pearson and Granada, also benefited. Pearson
rose 7 to 725p, with SG Warburg calculating that the conglomerate's 17 per
cent stake was worth 128p a share, against 75p previously. Granada was a
penny off at 579p, but analysts calculated that the benefits of its 13 per
cent stake would be diluted by the acquisition of LWT, up a penny at 696p.
Paper and packaging groups Bunzl and David S. Smith were firm after
encouraging noises from Credit Lyonnais Laing. The house published a wide-
ranging review of the sector, arguing that paper prices are picking up after
a long spell in the doldrums.
It has selected the two second-line companies as core holdings, arguing that
both have 'strong management stories, offer superior earnings and dividend
growth prospects and have indicated that they can add value'. Bunzl put on
10 at 170p and Smith gained 6 at 508p.
A recommendation for Courtaulds Textiles lay behind a rise of 8 to 583p in
the share price. Smith New Court published a hefty buy note on the company,
saying that investors were taking an overly gloomy view following the
cautious trading statement in December. 'From the current base of 4.5 per
cent operating margin we believe the group can achieve a level of 7 per cent
on the back of volume acting on a heavily rationalised cost base,' argues
Smith's Mr Mark Puleikis.
Royal Bank of Scotland was up 18 at one stage on rumours that the banking
group was about to sell its insurance subsidiary Direct Line to French
insurer UAP. Mr Charles Landa, insurance analyst with SGST, said: 'UAP have
shown an interest but Royal Bank had described Direct Line as a core holding
and it does not need the money, so I would be surprised.' The shares closed
5 higher at 515p.
A new pricing scheme from BT intended to build up brand loyalty was
announced but could not help the shares escape the muted market tone and a
bout of profit-taking. They closed 7 down at 470p. But Vodafone firmed 2 to
614p on the back of this week's good subscriber figures.
Water stocks rose on Wednesday's market talk of investments channelled from
European privatisation funds. Among these, South West climbed 9 to 654p,
Welsh 19 to 739p and Yorkshire 9 to 615p.
Insurance group TransAtlantic Holdings announced plans to float off a
property investment company, with property assets of Pounds 740m
concentrated mainly in shopping centres. The stock jumped 33 to 462p.
There was a big seller of Caradon as the shares tumbled 16 to 424p in
turnover of 5.3m.
The rumoured deal at Upton and Southern finally came to fruition when the
regional stores group announced an agreed Pounds 2.44m offer for Reject
Shops. The latter's shares became the day's biggest percentage faller,
slumping 50 per cent before closing 21 down at 38p. The Upton offer valued
each Reject share at 22.37p. Upton, which also announced a 10-for-one rights
issue to raise Pounds 4.5m, added a penny at 6p.
Reverberations of the Dollars 10bn Paramount bid battle continued to focus
attention on the multi-media market and buoy Thorn EMI, the shares adding 17
at 1145p in turnover of 2.6m.
Comment on Euro Disney's mounting losses saw the stock crumble 35 to 375p.
An agency cross in hotel group Stakis pushed turnover to 16m. The shares
were steady at 86p.
Allied-Lyons faded from an initial spurt as Kleinwort Benson reiterated its
positive stance and recommended a switch out of Scottish &amp; Newcastle. The
former closed 3 adrift at 646p, after 654p, while S&amp;N receded 6 to 573p.
British Airways rose 7 to 491p in trade of 6.3m shares after revealing a 9.7
per cent year-on-year increase in January passenger traffic figures.
Metals group Johnson Matthey was making visits around the City and the
shares improved 10 to 605p.
GKN fell 14 to 600p after Smith New Court urged investors to sell the stock.
A feeling that shares in Rolls-Royce had run ahead too far saw the stock
ease 6 to 180p, on volume of 8.7m. News that its US rival Pratt &amp; Whitney
had won an order to supply engines for Japan Airlines also hit sentiment.
The prospect of a successful flotation of Ashanti Goldfields, of Ghana, in
which Lonrho has a 45 per cent stake, continued to excite investors and the
shares firmed 2 to 172p.
