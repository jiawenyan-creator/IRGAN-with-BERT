FT  29 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firms as Pacific
Rim trades quietly
INDEX-LINKED buying of investment trusts and purchases by tokkin, or
specified money trusts, supported share prices, and the Nikkei average
firmed in spite of arbitrage unwinding, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 78.61 at 20,172.72 after moving between 20,128.91 and
20,299.23. The index shed some of its morning gain in the afternoon, but
finally ended higher. Most investors ignored the meeting between Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, and Mr Bill Clinton, the US president,
which was held in New York on Monday.
Volume was 240m shares, against 200m. Rises led declines by 529 to 445, with
184 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on
2.71 at 1,623.07 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.04 to
1,249.04.
The construction sector was hit by news of the arrest of Mr Shuntaro Honma,
governor of Miyagi prefecture, on Monday night on allegations of accepting
bribes of up to Y20m from contractors.
Taisei, the contractor whose officials have been arrested for alleged
bribery, fell Y6 to Y644. Other construction companies were also weak, with
Obayashi down Y4 to Y653 and Kajima losing Y8 to Y826.
Consumer-related sectors were supported by heightening hopes of an income
tax cut, while drug-related issues were bought ahead of the spate of medical
and academic meetings next month.
Retailers were higher: Daiei, the supermarket chain, advanced Y60 to Y1,550,
while Ito-Yokado climbed Y160 to Y5,450 and Jusco Y70 to Y2,450.
Housing shares were mixed, with Daikyo, a leading condominium builder,
unchanged at Y1,260, and Juken Sangyo, a processor of housing plywoods,
gaining Y40 at Y1,220.
Sankyo, a leading drug maker, added Y80 at Y3,050 and Yamanouchi
Pharmaceutical firmed Y10 to Y2,510.
Large-capital issues were lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel receded Y8 to
Y307 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y13 to Y657.
Shiseido, the cosmetics company, eased Y10 to Y1,310 after the Tokyo
district court ruled that the cancellation of a shipment contract with a
discount retailer by the company's sales subsidiary could be a violation of
the anti-monopoly law.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 105.47 to 22,292.71 in volume of 58.9m
shares. The index was supported by purchases in pharmaceutical and
biotechnology-related shares.
Roundup
TRADING WAS subdued in many of the Pacific Rim markets. Taiwan was closed
for a public holiday.
HONG KONG saw a late round of institutional buying offset light
profit-taking and push stocks to a modestly higher close. The Hang Seng
index finished 18.41 ahead at 7,470.50. Turnover was a relatively thin
HKDollars 2.12bn, with investors cautious ahead of a meeting on Friday of
the foreign ministers of China and Britain to discuss Hong Kong's political
reform plans.
Overseas institutions focused on blue chips, taking HSBC up 50 cents to
HKDollars 79.50. Cheung Kong rose 10 cents to HKDollars 27 and China Light
25 cents to HKDollars 43.50.

data and the All Ordinaries index eased 0.7 to 1,942.3 in thin volume of
179m shares.

interest ahead of the quarter's end.

SEOUL recouped early losses to finish higher before the public holiday which

718.87.

hour, against the normal two, to enable settlement in cash shares. The BSE
30-share index advanced 9.58 to 2,750.04.

counter in otherwise quiet trading, as the Straits Times Industrial index
eased 0.21 to 1,989.14.
KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's highs after profit-taking became more
pronounced in the afternoon, although a late surge in Telekom Malaysia
lifted the composite index from the day's low of 846.61 to finish 3.74 up at
849.92. Telekom firmed 30 cents to MDollars 17.10.
