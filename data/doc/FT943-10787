FT  03 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: PO cares - somewhere
Sir, If the Post Office is sold off, will it really become more competitive
and more efficient?
On June 20 I wrote to the Post Office at Lincoln pointing out that a
correctly stamped, first class parcel, posted by our supplier on June 3,
reached our customer at Oakham on June 13.
This letter was acknowledged by The Royal Mail at Doncaster on June 23
saying: 'Perhaps I should explain that Royal Mail wish to ensure that their
customers receive the best possible standard of service, which is why we
have provided local contact points for all enquiries and complaints.
'I hope, therefore, that you will understand why I am forwarding your
enquiry to your local customer care unit at Nottingham Customer Care.
'I can assure you that the staff there will be only too pleased to help and
reply to you as quickly as possible.'
On June 29, I received the following letter from the Customer Care Centre at
Nottingham:
'I am writing to let you know that this is now being dealt with by
Parcelforce. You can contact them at Customer Care, Parcelforce, Glasgow.
They will make enquiries and reply to you as soon as possible.'
As yet, I await a positive reply.
Can Glasgow have any idea what goes on between Lincoln and Oakham?
