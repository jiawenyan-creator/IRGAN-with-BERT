FT  01 MAY 93 / Letter: Yen's peak against the US dollar
Sir, Your newspaper has recently referred to the yen/dollar exchange
('Rising yen may not cut Japan's surplus', April 21) stating that the yen
had reached a postwar peak of Y110.25 to the dollar. This was not a record
high.
Prior to the second world war the rate was lower than Y4 to the dollar;
after the war the US occupation authorities imposed a 15-to-one conversion
rate which was raised considerably as inflation soared. The 360-to-one
exchange rate imposed in 1949 lasted for more than two decades.
