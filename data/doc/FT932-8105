FT  20 MAY 93 / Observer: Share drive
Shares in golf clubs have long been traded in Japan - but the very idea
provokes splutterings of disapproval at most British 19th holes. That could
well change, though, if Simon Hampel (nephew of ICI's Ronnie) has his way.
The young Hampel has just set up a stock broker, Mercator International,
which aims to match buyers and sellers of shares in the Wisley golf club
south of London.
Built by British Aerospace's Arlington property subsidiary and the Middle
East-backed Mannai Corporation, Wisley has 480 shareholders. They have
stumped up Pounds 15m of equity over the last three years, at between Pounds
26,000 and Pounds 40,000 per head.
Under the rules of the club, a free market came into effect in January,
allowing the odd speculator and, it is rumoured, a few distressed Lloyd's
Names, to bail out.
The developers currently offer new shares at Pounds 35,000, but, if recent
transactions are anything to go by, Mercator may be able to do a better
deal.
With a few other clubs joining in, perhaps there is room for a European
version of the Nikkei Golf index, which is a recognised lead indicator for
the Japanese economy.
