Turbine-Generator Unit at the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant"]

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  On 29 March 1991, the first run-up test of the Qinshan 
nuclear power plant's turbine-generator unit succeeded with 
non-nuclear steam and reached the rated speed of 3,000 
revolutions per minute. The steam was generated from the heat 
converted from the mechanical rotation energy of the main pump 
in the primary loop. The features of this successful run-up test 
are: 1) the cost of a de-bugging boiler is avoided; and 2) the 
coordination test of the primary and secondary loops is 
conducted. This paper presents a concise report on the technical 
preparation, testing process, and results of the 
turbine-generator unit run-up with non-nuclear steam. 
<H3>  1. Power Installation and De-Bugging at Qinshan Nuclear 
Power Plant </H3>
<H5>  1.1 Outline of Power Installation </H5>
  The power installation at Qinshan nuclear power plant 
consists of the following three groups: the pressurized-water 
reactor, the primary loop system, and the secondary loop system. 
The parameters of the reactor and the reactor coolant system 
are: working pressure, 15.2 MPa; average temperature, 302C; 
rated flow, 24,000 tons per hour (t/h); rated reactor thermal 
power, 966 MW; and is projected to reach 1035 MW. For the 
secondary loop system the parameters are: rated steam flow, 1870 
to 2020 t/h; pressure, 5.2 to 5.54 MPa. The steam is capable of 
generating electricity of 310 to 330 MW. 
  The reactor coolant system is composed of two loop circuits 
connected in parallel. Each loop circuit has one steam generator 
and one main coolant pump. All the components in each circuit 
are connected to the reactor with 316 stainless steel tubes 
forming a sealed circuit. In addition, the system contains one 
pressure regulator and one pressure relief box as well as 
instruments and valves for operation control and safety 
protection. 
  In addition to the main system, the primary loop has 16 
auxiliary systems whose functions are divided into three 
categories as follows: 
  (1) The starting and shut-off system for the operation of 
the 
reactor and the primary loop, including: chemical volume control 
system, boron recovery system, main pump water sealing system, 
water draining system, equipment cooling water system, reactor 
shut-off cooling system, and sample collection system. 
  (2) The safety and emergency system, including the safety 
injection system, the safety shell sprinkling system, and the 
de-hydrogen system. 
  (3) Environmental protection system, such as waste gas and 
liquid waste processing system, as well as liquid waste 
solidification and solid waste processing system. 
  The main installation in the secondary loop is the 
turbine-generator unit. At the Qinshan nuclear power plant, the 
saturated steam turbine is of the condensing steam type having 
single shaft, three cylinders, and four exhausts. The generator 
with inner water-cooled stator and rotor is brushless, magnetic 
exciting, three-phase alternating current generator. Its 
terminal voltage is 18 kV, with a rotating speed of 3,000 
revolutions per minute (RPM). Between the high-pressure cylinder 
and low-pressure cylinder of the turbine, two steam-water 
separation heaters are installed to eliminate moisture and to 
heat up the steam. During turbine load shedding, 70 percent of 
the steam can quickly enter the condenser through the bypass 
after its temperature and pressure are reduced to prevent shock 
to the reactor due to excessive load change. If leakage in the 
main steam pipe occurs, the steam flow rate will be limited by 
the flow restrictor installed at the outlet of the steam 
generator so that the tendency of reactor overcooling due to the 
excess loss of steam is reduced. The condenser is cooled with 
sea water. The condensed water is de-salted 100 percent to 
assure water quality. 
<H5>  1.2 De-Bugging Process at Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant </H5>
  The pressure test of the coolant system is completed on 5 
November 1990, which indicates that the Qinshan nuclear power 
project has progressed to the overall de-bugging phase. 
  The Qinshan nuclear power plant de-bugging is conducted in 
A, 
B, and C stages. Stage A, the preliminary test, includes the 
cold state test (A[.sup]1[/]) and the hot state test 
(A[.sup]2[/]). The characteristics are as follows: more test 
items, longer cycles, and more crisscross complexities. Because 
the Stage A test is before the nuclear fuel loading, we hope 
that all possible problems will show up and be discovered at 
this early stage, so that adjustment of the system and equipment 
can be made under non-radiative conditions. At the same time, we 
hope that the equipment defects that take long cycles of 
corrective measures will also be exposed. Stage B consists of 
nuclear fuel, loading as well as the cold state and hot state 
tests after the loading (B[.sup]1[/]); the first reactor 
critical test (B[.sup]2[/]); and the low power test 
(B[.sup]3[/]). Between Stages A and B, there is a period of 
three to four months for installation, system adjustment, and 
repair, as well as for the safety shell's strength and sealing 
tests. Stage C is the rated power test of the generator, in 
which the power is gradually to its full rated output. Then the 
complete project is to be checked and accepted by the State. 
<H3>  2. Run-Up of Nuclear Power Turbine-Generator Unit and Its 
Timing Selection </H3>
<H5>  2.1 Nuclear Power Turbine-Generator Unit </H5>
  Based on the American Westinghouse building block model 
(BB051, BB074) with some modifications, the steam turbine of the 
Qinshan nuclear power plant's 300MW turbine-generator unit is of 
the condensing steam type with a single shaft, three cylinders, 
and four exhausts, designed and manufactured by the Shanghai 
Steam Turbine Factory. The generator, with a rated power of 
310MW, is manufactured by the Shanghai Electric Machinery 
Factory. 
<H5>  3.3 Timing Selection for First Run-Up of Turbine-Generator </H5>
  The turbine-generator unit is 40 meters (m) long and 7.5 m 
wide. Any major mechanical trouble during run-up would cause 
serious economic loss, therefore the timing of the 
turbine-generator run-up is crucial. 
  According to the aforementioned de-bugging stages, during 
Tests A[.sup]2[/] and B[.sub]1[/] the primary loops can 
generate non-nuclear steam for turbine run-up. However, during 
the run-up period the primary loop goes through a large 
temperature and pressure change, hence, in Test B[.sup]1[/] 
with the fuel already loaded, the abnormal temperature and 
pressure change will unfavorably affect the nuclear fuel 
components and other parts. Therefore, the first run-up of the 
turbine-generator unit should not be conducted during Test 
B[.sup]1[/]. 
  The turbine unit run-up test is also a large-scale combined 
de-bugging test of the primary and the secondary loops, 
therefore, it is appropriate to conduct the first run-up in the 
later phase of Test A[.sup]2[/]. Besides, there is a period 
of three to four months for equipment adjustments and 
corrections after the completion of Test A[.sup]2[/]. Hence, 
any run-up malfunction can be identified and corrected during 
that period. 
  To sum up, the first run-up of the turbine-generator unit is 
scheduled for the later phase of the hot-state test 
(A[.sup]2[/]) in the preliminary test stage. 
<H5>  3. Test Goals </H5>
  (1) To measure the vibration amplitudes and phases of all 
the 
bearings during unit speed increase, the critical rotating 
speed, and to verify the balance standard of the turbine 
generator's shaft system. 
  (2) To verify the bearing temperature, and the operation of 
the control set-up, as well as to investigate whether the 
various oil pressure indications meet the requirement. 
  (3) To inspect whether all the moving parts operate 
normally. 
<H5>  4. Selection of Steam Source for First Run-Up </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Selection of Steam Source </H5>
  Overseas experiences in nuclear power plant installations 
reveal that steam sources for the first run-up test of 
turbine-generator unit are as follows: 
  (1) Installation of a de-bugging boiler with sufficient 
steam 
capacity. 
  (2) Utilization of existing steam available at the old 
plant. 
  (3) Utilization of the rotating energy of the reactor 
coolant 
pump to heat up the main system; as well as using the heat 
capacities of the system and the equipment to generate 
non-nuclear steam from the steam generator to perform the run-up 
of turbine-generator unit. 
  The Qinshan nuclear power plant is located at Qinshan, 
Haiyan 
County, Zhejiang Province. Since the new location has no nearby 
power plant or steam supply, the steam source for the first 
run-up is a choice of either installing a de-bugging boiler or 
taking advantage of the main pump energy. 
<H5>  4.2 Selection of Steam Source for Qinshan Turbine Run-Up </H5>
<H5>  4.2.1 Comparison of Plans </H5>
  There have been successful experiences abroad in the 
turbine-generator unit run-up with non-nuclear steam produced 
from either de-bugging boilers or main pump energies, especially 
that there is no significant problem with de-bugging boilers 
present practically no serious problems. However, most of the 
nuclear power stations utilizing non-nuclear steam to run-up 
turbines are those having well-developed turbine-generator units. 
  The de-bugging boiler can fully provide flexibility during 
the de-bugging of the second loop and the turbine-generate unit; 
however, it will amplify the construction cost, time and land 
required. A standard medium-pressure boiler will produce steam 
at 110-130 t/h with steam pressure of 3.8 MPa. The boiler proper 
costs 3 million yuan. It will be over 4 million yuan with the 
additional investments of matching auxiliary components and 
boiler modifications. 
  Overseas experiences show that the steam energy required to 
start a mega-kilowatt class turbine-generator unit, and to run 
at the rated rotating speed is 2-3 percent of the rated steam 
consumption. As estimated by the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, 
the turbine-generator unit of the Qinshan nuclear power plant 
probably requires 5-7 percent rated steam consumption, i,e. 
100-140 t/h of steam with pressure greater than 1.96 MPa. 
  Although there is no extra investment and construction space 
involved, the utilization of non-nuclear steam from the rotating 
energy of the main pump in the reactor coolant system has 
certain degrees of difficulty and risk, identified mainly in the 
following areas: 
  (1) At present, none has the experience to run-up a 
turbine-generator unit with non-nuclear steam at the full-rated 
speed of 3,000 rpm. 
  (2) Since this is the first nuclear power turbine-generator 
unit in China, we lack accurate data on the function of the 
turbine-generator unit, the power demand for run-up, and other 
parameters. 
  (3) The reactor coolant system of the Qinshan nuclear power 
plant is composed of two loop circuits. Yet, the run-up 
experiences in foreign countries are in great part based on 
systems with four loop circuits. The two-circuit system and the 
four-circuit system are quite different in energy generation and 
storage. 
  To sum up, the difficulty lies in whether the Qinshan 
nuclear 
power plant's main system can generate and store enough energy 
to run-up the turbine-generator unit to the rated operating 
speed and to maintain a steady operation. 
<H5>  4.2.2 Energy Calculation of the Non-Nuclear Steam Source </H5>
  The main system of the primary loop utilizes the heat from 
two reactor coolant pumps and the electric heating elements of 
the pressurizer to raise the system temperature and pressure 
from room condition to 280C and 15.2 MPa as well as to 
maintain normal operation under these parameters. At this time, 
the steam pressure in the steam generator is 6.32 MPa. Due to 
the fact that the input energy of the main pump is far smaller 
than the energy required to run-up the turbine, after the 
turbine is started, the pressure of the steam generator 
gradually drops; subsequently, the temperature and the pressure 
of the main system drop accordingly. Therefore the final 
turbine-generator run-up state is determined by the operation 
safety limit of the main system. 
<H5>  4.2.2.1 Basis of Heat Engineering Calculation </H5>
  The highest liquid level of the steam generator is 11.4m; 
the 
lowest, 9.675m. 
  The initial steam pressure of the steam generator is 6.32 
MPa; the lowest, 2.94 MPa. 
  The lowest liquid level of the pressurizer is 2.5m. 
  The initial pressure of the pressurizer is 15.2 MPa; the 
lowest, 11.27 MPa. 
  The initial temperature of the system is 280C; the 
lowest, 235C. 
<H5>  4.2.2.2 Calculation of Main System Energy Output </H5>
  Heat released by the two main pumps running continuously 
(Q[.sup]p[/]): 


  Secondary side heat released from the steam generator 
(Q[.sup]g[/]) 
  Q[.sup]g[/] = q[.sub]i[/] - q[.sub]f[/] (kcal), 
  where, q[.sup]i[/]: heat capacity of the steam generator 
at the initial state; 
  q[.sup]f[/]: heat capacity of the steam 
generator at the final state. 
  Then, the total steam energy generating capacity from the 
main system (including the steam generator secondary side heat) 
during the run-up of the turbine-generator unit (Q[.sup]T[/]): 
  Q[.sup]T[/] = Q[.sub]p[/] x T + Q[.sub]m[/] + 
Q[.sup]s[/] + Q[.sub]g[/] + Q[.sub]e[/] - 
q[.sup]d[/] - q[.sub]c[/] 
  where, Q[.sup]e[/]: heat from the electric heating 
elements of pressurizer; 
  q[.sup]d[/]: heat dissipated from the main 
system; 
  q[.sup]c[/]: heat carried away by the chemical 
volume control system; 
  T: duration of the turbine run-up, hours (h). 
<H3>  4.2.2.3 Calculation of Steam Supplied By the Steam Generator 
During the Run-Up Period (G </H3>
[.sup]g[/]). 
  G[.sup]g[/] = G' + G" (t) 
  where, G': steam generated from the steam generator without 
feeding water; 
  G": steam generated from the steam generator during 
water feeding; and 


  Based on the above calculation, during the turbine run-up 
period, in 30 minutes the primary loop can supply the turbine 
unit 43.6t of saturated steam with 6.32-2.94 MPa. 
<H3>  4.2.3 Calculation of Liquid Level Change in the Pressurizer 
During Run-Up </H3>
  During run-up of the turbine-generator unit, the main system 
energy output causes reactor coolant temperature drop, which in 
turn causes coolant contraction. Although the deficit can be 
replenished with water in the pressurizer, yet the liquid level 
in the pressurizer must not drop so low as to expose the 
electric heating elements. To prevent this, during run-up the 
feeding water flow has to be increased to replenish water to the 
main system, and consequently heat consumption of the main 
system increases. 
  This calculation aims at determining the initial liquid 
level 
in the pressurizer before the run-up, and whether it is 
necessary to replenish water to the main system during the 
run-up. 
  Based on the heat engineering calculation, the temperature 
of 
the reactor coolant drops from 280C to 235C; and the 
pressure, from 15.2 MPa to 11.27 MPa. The changing of the 
coolant density causes the change of total water volume in the 
main system, namely, the liquid level in the pressurizer drops. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CEN-002C-39A>           Formula </FIG>



  According to the calculation, at the end of the 
turbine-generator run-up, the contraction of the main system 
coolant causes a drop of the pressurizer liquid level to 2.57m, 
which is more than marginally above the electric heating 
elements. 
<H5>  4.2.4 Assurance Measures </H5>
  During the turbine-generator run-up, the estimated required 
steam is 50 to 70 tons. Certain effective measures must be 
adopted to assure the successful run-up at the first trial. 
<H5>  4.2.4.1 Realigning Steam Pipeline Layout of Starting Steam </H5>

Extractor. 
  By normal starting procedure at a nuclear power plant, the 
working steam for the condenser steam extractor is the freshly 
generated steam from the steam generator. Each starting steam 
extractor requires 7000 kg/h working steam with 0.88 to 55.4 MPa 
pressure. Two starting steam extractors are installed at the 
Qinshan nuclear power plant. The system layout is shown in 
Figure 1. 



  The Qinshan nuclear power plant is equipped with two plant 
boilers to supply heat to the plant and steam to the auxiliary 
system of the primary loop whenever the reactor is not in 
operation. Each boiler supplies steam at the rate of 10t/h with 
1.27 MPa pressure. For the run-up, the steam pipeline is 
realigned in such a way that the boiler steam can flow directly 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CEN-002C-39B>           Figure 1. Steam System Flow Diagram of Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant </FIG>

to the starting air extractors. At the same time, the boiler 
steam is also used as heating steam for the de-oxygen device in 
the second loop. With this arrangement the non-nuclear steam 
from the primary loop can be solely used as turbine-generator 
run-up. 
<H3>  4.2.4.2 Raising the Temperature of Feeding Water to Steam 
Generator. </H3>
  The temperature of the de-oxygen water in the de-oxygen 
device and de-oxygen feeding water tank is raised to the highest 
possible degree with plant steam. Thus, the enthalpy in the 
water fed to the steam generator is increased, resulting in the 
slight increase of steam output. 
<H5>  4.2.4.3 Re-Analysis of Limits for Main System Operation </H5>
  Through the instantaneous analysis of the main system, 
calculation shows that the operation limits can be lowered. 
  In addition, the quality of the turbine-generator unit is 
warranted. We believe that the original estimation for run-up 
steam consumption, 5-7 percent of the rated steam consumption, 
is more than required. 
  The above analysis indicates that the non-nuclear steam 
run-up of the turbine-generator is feasible, therefore, the plan 
of using non-nuclear steam to run-up the turbine generator unit 
is decided to carry on. 
<H5>  5. Implementation of Turbine Run-Up </H5>
<H5>  5.1 Preliminary Test </H5>
  On 27 and 28 March 1991, five run-ups of the 
turbine-generator unit with non-nuclear steam were conducted, 
among which three run-ups were preliminary tests. The rotating 
speed of the first preliminary test started at 50 rpm and 
gradually increased to 600 rpm. Friction inspection of the unit 
was conducted after the operation became steady. The second test 
used the same rotating speed pattern. Overall inspection was 
conducted on the unit and system after steady operation. The 
speed of the third preliminary test started from 100 rpm, 
increased to 600 rpm, and was maintained at that speed for five 
minutes. Subsequently, the unit was operated at the starting 
speed of 150 rpm and then raised to 1200 rpm. The unit and 
system was completely inspected during the steady operation 
period (test results will be reported in another paper). After 
the three preliminary tests, the condition of the unit was 
satisfactory. With some other adjustments, the unit was on 
standby for the run-up. 
  Incorporating experiences learned from the preliminary 
tests, 
the following measures are to be taken to assure the successful 
first run-up of the turbine-generator unit to the rated speed of 
3000 rpm. 
  Take timely measures to operate the electromagnetic valve of 
the main steam isolation valve to reduce steam leak. 
  Carefully control the water-drainage before the main steam 
isolation valve to assure operation safety as well as to reduce 
direct steam consumption. 
  In the gathering and recording of test data, unify the 
command with increased proficiency and the use of microprocessor 
to minimize interruption while the run-up test is in progress. 
  Adjust the main system operation limits within the design 
tolerance during the run-up test. 
<H5>  5.2 Run-Up Test </H5>
  On 29 March 1991 
  1900 [Time]: With a long period of preparation, and 
adjustments after the three preliminary tests, the primary and 
secondary loops and the turbine-generator unit of the Qinshan 
nuclear power plant reached satisfactory starting state and the 
major parameters of the main system were attained: outlet steam 
pressure and liquid level of the steam generator, 5.25 MPa and 
11.81m, respectively; average temperature of the main system, 
283C; as well as pressure and liquid level of the 
pressurizer, 15.2 MPa and 8.5m, respectively. 
  1914: The bypass valve of the steam isolation valve was 
opened first. When the steam pressure was equalized, the main 
steam isolation valve was opened. 
  1919: The turbine-generator unit started running, and its 
rotating speed was increased by 100 rpm. When the speed reached 
600 rpm, the unit was allowed to run steadily for a few minutes 
for inspection. Then its speed was increased by 150 rpm. When 
the speed reached 1200 rpm, the unit was maintained steadily at 
that speed for 10 minutes for complete inspection and 
measurement of bearing vibration. When the inspection results 
were considered satisfactory, the speed of the unit was 
increased by 150 rpm, targeting at the rated rotating speed. 
When the speed was being increased, supervision and inspection 
of the unit were enhanced, and bearing vibration was 
continuously measured to pinpoint the critical rotating speed of 
the unit's shaft system. 
  1951: For the first time, the turbine-generator unit of the 
Qinshan nuclear power plant reached the rated speed of 3000 rpm 
and operated steadily at that speed. A series of test data were 
measured and recorded in the following areas: unit vibration, 
metal temperature of cylinders, cylinder expansion, lubricating 
oil temperature and pressure for bearings, as well as the main 
steam pressure, the condenser vacuum and others. During data 
collection, complete inspection of the unit was conducted, and 
no abnormal symptom was observed. Following the standard 
procedure, the unit operation was stopped, and the unit idling 
test was conducted. Inspections were conducted on the automatic 
main steam valve, regulator valve, re-heating main valve and 
re-heating regulator valve, and it was assured that they could 
be readily closed. 
  As the speed was slowing down, the following functions were 
inspected during the idling test: 
  When the rotating speed drops to below 600 rpm, the spray 
cooling device in the low-pressure cylinder must close 
automatically. 
  The rotor vibration indicator is switched to an eccentric 
recorder. 
  The oil temperature controller is re-set from 45C to 
30C. 
  When the speed drops to 200 rpm, the upper shaft oil pump 
must start automatically. 
  When the speed reaches 0 rpm, the rolling gear starts 
normally. 
<H5>  6. Test Results </H5>
  After the tests of increasing speed for 22 minutes, steady 
speed for 12 minutes and idling for 48 minutes, the first run-up 
test of the turbine-generator unit was successfully completed at 
2041. 
  Figure 2 shows the variation of speed increase and idling 
with time. Figure 3 shows the variation of main system coolant 
temperature with time. Figure 4 shows the variations of pressure 
and liquid level in the pressurizer with time. Figure 5 shows 
the variations of outlet steam pressure and liquid level of the 
steam generator with time. Figure 6 shows the curves for the 
measured critical rotor rotation speed of the turbine-generator 
unit. 















<H5>  7. Conclusion </H5>
  The first run-up success of the Qinshan nuclear power plant 
was primarily the result of the cooperative efforts of all the 
participating departments. This successful first attempt shows 
that the design, manufacture, installation, and de-bugging of 
the turbine-generator unit were successful. 
  The turbine generator run-up with non-nuclear steam also 
marks the first consolidated de-bugging test of the primary and 
secondary loops at the Qinshan nuclear power plant. Its success 
also validates that the interface between the nuclear island and 
conventional island in the field of technology, heat 
engineering, control device, electrical engineering is becoming 
a normal event. 
  The success of the non-nuclear steam run-up of turbine 
generator not only saves capital investment cost, but also 
brings new experience to nuclear power construction in China.
