FT  01 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not yet last of a line
Sir, I would question the statement in your news item 'End of the line'
(August 27) about the last button A and B pay phone being in the Shetland
Isles.
During a sailing holiday to the Small Isles in the Inner Hebrides my husband
and I visited the island of Soay off the south coast of Skye. There, on
August 1 1994, we saw a telephone box with buttons A and B and powered by
solar panels. I suspect it is still there.
