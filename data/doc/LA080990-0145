PLAN TO MOVE SHERIFF'S COPTER SQUAD MOVE FROM L.B. IS OPPOSED 
The Pomona City Council has voted to oppose a plan by the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department to move its helicopter squadron from Long Beach Airport to 
Brackett Field in La Verne. 
The move to nearby La Verne would "jeopardize the safety, security, peace and 
quiet of the residents of Pomona," the council declared Monday. 
The department is considering moving its squadron to La Verne because of a rent 
increase at Long Beach Airport. 
Sheriff's Cmdr. Lee Baca said the move would require approval of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors after public hearings. 
He also said that the move is at least a year or two away and that the squadron 
has operated without complaint from neighbors in Long Beach. "We don't fly 17 
helicopters all at the same time," he said.
