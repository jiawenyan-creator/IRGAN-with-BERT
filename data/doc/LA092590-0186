SHORT TAKES; 
PATTY LOVELESS REVEALS MARRIAGE 
Country singer Patty Loveless is coming out in the open about her relationship 
with record producer Emory Gordy Jr.: They're married. 
Loveless, whose current hit is "On Down the Line," married Gordy in Gatlinburg 
in February, 1989. 
Loveless, 33, revealed her secret in interviews with People magazine and on The 
Nashville Network's "Crook &amp; Chase" show, scheduled to air Wednesday night. 
Loveless said one reason she had kept her marriage secret is that she wanted to 
make it in Nashville on her own and not with the help of Gordy's connections.
