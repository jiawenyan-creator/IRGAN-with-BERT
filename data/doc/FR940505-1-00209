As mentioned earlier, EPA is proposing to allow up to 25 percent of a manufacturer's 1999 model year MDV sales fleet
to comply with ``transitional'' standards that are less stringent than the enhanced in-use standards. The table
above also contains the proposed standards for such ``transitional'' vehicles. The proposed composite standards
for the transitional MDVs are roughly equivalent in stringency for MDVs as they are for LDTs. As with the enhanced in-use
compliance LDTs, EPA is proposing a single composite hydrocarbon standard (for each subclass of MDVs) that will apply
throughout the useful life of a transitional MDV.

California's definition of MDVs includes trucks which EPA includes in its definition of LDTs (i.e., those up to 8500
pounds GVWR), as well as trucks EPA considers heavy-duty trucks (i.e., those between 8501 and 14,000 pounds GVWR).
In its past rulemakings establishing HC, CO and NO

X

 standards for LDTs, EPA found no technological concerns that would limit the application of engine or catalyst technology
to only those trucks below 6000 pounds GVWR (50 FR 10651). EPA did find sufficient reason to limit catalyst technology
to only those heavy-duty trucks below 14,000 pounds GVWR, but this distinction coincides with CARB's split between
MDVs and heavy-duty vehicles. The primary means of meeting CARB's LEV standards will likely be an additional catalyst
which begins operation very quickly to reduce cold-start emissions (e.g., an electrically heated catalyst). EPA
is unaware of any evidence which would limit the use of this technology to only those vehicles up to 6000 pounds GVWR,
particularly given the fact that trucks up to 14,000 pounds GVWR already are catalyst equipped. EPA requests comments
on all of the proposed MDV standards, including the assumptions made regarding the levels of evaporative emissions
from MDVs.

As will be the case for LDVs and LDTs, manufacturers would continue to certify to CARB's certification MDV standards.
However, here, with regard to MDVs, the demonstration of compliance with the enhanced in-use standards would be more
significant, given CARB's standards for post-1998 MDVs. Manufacturers would be still be required to submit information
already required by CARB along with the calculation of composite NMHC emissions using the equation presented above
and a showing that composite NMHC and NO

 emissions comply with the enhanced in-use standards contained in the above table. The application would also include
such additional information as may be necessary to show that the vehicle engine family will meet these standards under
typical in-use conditions for its full useful life, which would be enforced through the enhanced in-use recall program.
Manufacturers would also have to demonstrate compliance with the enhanced in-use I/M standards. However, again,
this will be much easier than that with respect to the full-life certification and recall standards.

For the 1999 model year only, manufacturers will have to designate those engine families certifying to the less stringent
transitional enhanced in-use standards and monitor sales to ensure sales of these engine families stays at or below
25 percent of total sales. These standards would be applicable to all MDVs regardless of fuel type. As for LDVs and LDTs,
all post-1998 model year MDVs will be required to provide easy access for I/M pressure and purge checks. Comments are
requested on all these requirements and on the extent to which these requirements complement CARB's existing LEV
program for MDVs.
