FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank Austria forecasts
downturn in profits
Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, said its 1994 pre-tax profits
would fall by a quarter to Sch4.5bn (Dollars 405m) mainly because of poor
results from own-account trading, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Trading
income would be down 64 per cent to Sch650m, as results from trading
securities, currencies, precious metals and derivatives were all below those
of 1993.
The bank has also faced sharply increased employee pension charges this
year, after changes in a scheme for most of its employees.
Provisions for bad debts would ease slightly to Sch3.9bn from Sch4.1bn, the
bank said and dividends would be at least maintained. Assets are expected to
reach Sch630bn, up 5.2 per cent from a year ago.
