  [Text] Thursday, April 7 -- The general assembly of the 
Association of Estonian Newspapers (EALL) convened yesterday for 
an extra meeting concerning the conflict around the daily RAHVA 
HAAL. The assembly approved a statement recommending that the 
government terminated the publication of the daily in its 
present form as "harmful to the reputation of the Estonian 
printed media". The assembly also offered to mediate between 
the parties of the conflict. 
  The assembly considered it unsuitable for the Ministry of 
Culture chancellor Veiko Jurisson to continue at a responsible 
government post because of the harm done to Estonia's 
international reputation and the financial loss caused to the 
state by his actions. 
  Managing Director of the EALL Mati Eliste pointed out that 
the daily RAHVA HAAL, currently published by the private company 
Hommikuleht, is not being returned to the printing shop for lack 
of buyers and presents a criminal waste of paper and labour. 
The EALL had warned the Estonian Government against inevitable 
conflicts that would follow the attempts to privatise the 
newspaper against the will of the editorial staff, the statement 
read. However, the government had failed to consider the 
warning and the conflict came about as predicted. 
  The EALL also stated that the former editorial staff of the 
RAHVA HAAL should have made more efforts to regulate its 
relations with the state. 
  Chancellor of the Ministry of Culture Veiko Jurisson claimed 
that the negotiations concerning the new editor in chief of the 
RAHVA HAAL are likely to be concluded today. But he declined 
from disclosing the candidates' names.
