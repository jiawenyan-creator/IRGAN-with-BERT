YOUR BODY: ANNUAL VIRUS HITTING KIDS HARD AND EARLY 
A virus that leaves most adults with just a bad cold has sent hundreds of 
children to doctor's offices and hospitals around Southern California. 
Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, "comes around every winter," says Dr. 
Harris R. Stutman, director of pediatric infectious diseases at Memorial Miller 
Children's Hospital in Long Beach. "But this year it's very early and it's much 
more common, with about two times as many kids hospitalized as last year." 
Dr. Shirley Fannin, associate deputy director of communicable disease control 
programs for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, says the 
impact of the virus is cyclic. 
"The RS virus is not necessarily any worse than we expected this year," Fannin 
says. "We're having a heavy year this year, but that happens every two or three 
years." 
"It hits kids under 2 years the hardest," says Dr. Wilbert Mason, a 
pediatrician at Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles. In December, 192 cases of RSV 
were diagnosed there, twice the number diagnosed during last season's peak 
month. It seems to be leveling off, Mason says. 
First symptoms of RS virus are sniffles, sore throat and fever. 
"In adults, the symptoms often stop there," Stutman says. "But in children, the 
virus is more likely to move to their lungs and bronchial tubes." 
When to call the doctor? 
"If the child is having trouble taking in fluids, looks pale or is having 
breathing difficulties, seek help," says Stutman, who says children can worsen 
quickly. 
Children hospitalized with the virus are given breathing treatments and fluids, 
sometimes intravenously, for three to five days. 
A few need aerosol applications of ribavirin (Virazole), an antiviral 
medication administered for 12 to 18 hours a day via a hood or tent. 
"This virus is spread by hand to mucous membrane, so it's not good enough to 
turn your head away when you cough," Stutman says. "Parents and care-givers who 
have colds should be scrupulous about hand washing. Any good soap will do, but 
liquid is better. The virus can live on a bar of soap for a few hours." 
Adds Mason: "You don't catch it just by being in the same room with someone 
sick. But kids can pick it up by such activities as sharing toys in day care." 
"There are a lot of respiratory viruses circulating in the community right 
now," says Fannin, pointing out that it's often difficult for people who are 
not trained in medicine to distinguish between potentially serious viruses and 
minor ones. 
Her guideline: "If it's a simple cold virus, kids should be feeling better in 
one to three days." 
POINT/ COUNTERPOINT 
Diet Dilemma: Should You Seek Help or Go It Alone? 
OK, so you've been overeating since Thanksgiving. The average American gains 3 
to 8 pounds between November and January, according to some hospital surveys. 
But statistics don't make zipping your jeans any easier, so you've decided to 
take action. If you have 10 pounds or so to drop, is it better to go it alone 
or enroll in a formal weight-loss program such as Weight Watchers, Diet Center 
or Nutri/System? 
Here are two experts' views. 
GO IT ALONE. Henrietta Spencer, Los Angeles psychologist and weight-control 
specialist: 
"Going it alone isn't for everyone. Those most likely to succeed don't have 
compulsive overeating problems like binging and purging, have a small amount of 
weight to lose and perhaps have already participated in an organized 
weight-loss program where they learned good habits. Men are more likely to 
succeed if they go it alone than women are. 
"If you pick the do-it-yourself path, the best way to start is to consult a 
doctor, but figure at least 10 weeks to lose 10 pounds." 
* TURN YOURSELF IN. Jeanne Peters, Torrance dietitian: 
"None of these (formal weight-loss) programs are perfect, but they offer people 
group support. Some people just don't get that kind of support from family and 
friends when they try to lose weight on their own. Dieters with a group plan 
can be successful in a relatively short period of time. To boost the chance of 
success, look for programs that encourage exercise. 
"These programs have become more flexible in terms of their meal plans. 
However, some require you to eat their foods, which can be a drawback for 
people with allergies and high blood pressure. The sodium content may be too 
high." 
SHOP TALK 
Hair Removers on the Market Soon 
Women weary of shaving their legs might consider two new devices expected on 
the market next month. The Epilady Mini, small enough to fit in the palm of the 
hand, removes hair at the root, supposedly leaving legs hair-free for three 
weeks. It will retail for $29 in drug stores. A $39 version, which massages as 
it plucks, will be sold in department stores. Made by EPI Products, both 
devices are scaled-down versions of Epilady. 
Don't expect perfectly hairless legs, says Beverly Hills dermatologist Rhonda 
Rand, and there can be complications. 
She treats several patients a month for ingrown hairs, pimples around the hair 
follicles and itching.
