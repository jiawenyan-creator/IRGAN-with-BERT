FT  14 SEP 93 / After the flooding, town votes to move uphill
THE residents of Valmeyer in Illinois have voted to move, lock, stock and
barrel, to higher ground rather than risk another flood like the one which
swamped their town this summer.
More than half of the town's 346 homes suffered serious damage during this
year's record flooding in the Mississippi and Missouri basins, and officials
said the ebbing waters left behind a trail of devastation.
One official said about a third of the houses in Valmeyer were still
flooded, but those householders who had been able to enter their homes had
suffered 'extreme shock'.
'It's just totally destroyed,' she said.
The town will now start buying land to the east, and could start building
next spring. Valmeyer has entered a federal government buy-out programme in
which the government would pay homeowners whose properties have suffered
more than 50 per cent damage to relocate, rather than rebuild in the same
vulnerable place.
Valmeyer is not the first town to decide that it was not worth staying in
the flood plain. Soldiers Grove, in Wisconsin, moved after a devastating
flood of the Kickapoo River in 1978.
The administration has urged government agencies to consider other
approaches to limiting future flood damage than simply rebuilding flood
walls and levees. Such alternative approaches could include moving or
turning vulnerable farmlands into safety valve wetlands.
Environmentalist groups, such as American Rivers, have welcomed this new
approach, saying levees along the Mississippi forced it higher than it would
otherwise have gone.
Nevertheless, most of the flood-walls and levees built and managed by the
federal government, under the auspices of the Army Corps of Engineers, are
likely to be rebuilt.
