FT  08 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Royal engagement
improves mood in Tokyo
THE announcement of the engagement of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito improved
the mood of the market after several dull days, but could not prevent the
Nikkei average from slipping towards the close, writes Bethan Hutton in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished down 1.90 at 16,780.98. It reached a high of 17,058.19,
but a rush of selling in the last half-hour wiped out earlier gains to leave
the Nikkei not far above the day's low of 16,724.19.
Gaining stocks outnumbered losers for the first time this week, with 619
advancing against 316 declining, and 166 issues unchanged. Volume rose to an
estimated 200m shares from 178.6m. The Topix index of all first section
shares ended 6.38 up at 1,298.25, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost
1.50 to 1,054.84.
News of the royal engagement, to be confirmed later this month, lifted the
paper, printing and ink sectors, amid expectations of a boom in demand to
meet the expanded press coverage of the bridal couple as well as souvenir
issues to commemorate the wedding.
Mitsubishi Paper Mills rose Y23 to Y733, Takasaki Paper Y16 to Y276 and
Kanzaki Paper Y14 to Y619. Oji Paper, the sector leader, initially climbed
to Y879 but fell back to close at Y857, down Y1.
The prospect of commemorative coins boosted metal shares. Sumitomo Metal
Mining firmed Y3 to Y645 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting put on Y10 at Y462.
Mitsukoshi and Takashimaya, two of the most up-market department stores, saw
strong gains on hopes of a rush of wedding gift and souvenir sales.
Mitsukoshi closed Y23 ahead at Y733 and Takashimaya rose Y17 to Y876.
Consumer electronics also gained on the possibility of increased sales of
high-definition televisions and other audio-visual equipment ahead of the
ceremony, which is expected to attract large audiences. The marriage of the
present emperor in 1958 created a boom in sales of the then recently
introduced colour televisions. Victor was the principal gainer, appreciating
Y39 to Y809.
Hotel and restaurant operators rose on speculation that a copy-cat wedding
boom could follow the royal engagement. More general hopes of an increase in
consumer confidence as a result of the wedding announcement led to early
gains in most sectors, but some of these were lost in later profit-taking.
In Osaka the OSE average finished 111.96 up at 18,505.94 in volume of 74.2m
shares.
