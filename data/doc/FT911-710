FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Japanese securities houses face
downgrading
THE FOUR big Japanese securities houses have had their debt ratings placed
under review for possible downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the two
big US rating agencies.
The move puts at risk Nomura Securities' top AAA long-term debt rating,
although its top short-term A1+ rating is not under review. The current
long-term debt ratings of Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities are both AA,
while that of Yamaichi is AA-. The A1+ short-term debt ratings of all three
are also under review.
The agency said the review arose because of its concern about the future
profitability of the Japanese securities firms amid the deregulation of the
Japanese financial markets. This could threaten their market share and
profitability across the range of their business.
It also cited a less buoyant domestic market. Earnings reported for the
half-year to end-September were weak, while the full-year earnings, yet to
be reported, were unlikely to show much further improvement.
On top of that, the firms' ability to reduce expenses was hampered by their
high proportion of fixed costs.
