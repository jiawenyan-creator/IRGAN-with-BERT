FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banco do Brasil benefits from
debt repayments
BANCO do Brasil, the state-controlled commercial bank that is Brazil's
second-largest financial institution, announced profits of Dollars 446.8m
for 1992, up 77 per cent over the 1991 final figure of Dollars 252m, writes
Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
The bank attributed the improved performance primarily to a reduction in
non-performing domestic loans and interest payments by the Brazilian
government on its Dollars 44bn overseas debt. Banco do Brasil holds about
Dollars 6bn in Brazilian foreign debt, a figure roughly equivalent to its
entire net domestic assets, according to Mr Gil Garcia, the bank's chief
accountant.
Overdue domestic loans were gradually reduced in relation to overall loan
operations during the last three months of 1992, Mr Garcia said.
