VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA; 
OFFICIALS NAMED TO TAYLOR RANCH PANEL 
Ventura City Councilman Todd Collart and Community Development Director Everett 
Millais will represent the city on a Cal State University committee that will 
oversee the development of an environmental impact document for Taylor Ranch, 
the council decided Monday. 
The two were appointed after Cal State invited representatives from all 10 
cities in the county, area legislators and community groups that support or 
oppose the development of a four-year university at Taylor Ranch, a 450-acre 
hillside bluff west of the city of Ventura. 
Collart has remained neutral on the issue, which has brought a storm of 
protests from those opposing the additional burden on traffic and water. 
The university has so far received confirmation to participate on the committee 
from state Sens. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Ed Davis (R-Northridge), 
and Assembly members Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) and Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley), said John Smart, university vice chancellor.
