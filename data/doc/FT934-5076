FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Easier budgeting for elderly - Guaranteed income
bond
THE MEASURE
Introduction of a National Savings Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond for
pensioners, a five-year fixed rate investment which will pay a monthly
income.
IN DETAIL
The bond will be available to savers aged 65 and over. Interest will be paid
monthly, and gross, which has advantages for non-taxpayers on low incomes.
The bond is due to be launched in the new year with competitive interest
rates.
THE BACKGROUND
Elderly people largely dependent on income from interest on savings have
been hit by falling interest rates. This new National Savings product is
designed to provide a regular, predictable flow of income at a decent rate.
It could be seen as a replacement for 'Granny bonds'. These later became
generally available National Savings index linked certificates. In times of
low inflation a fixed rate may be more attractive.
