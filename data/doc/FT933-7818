FT  19 AUG 93 / Observer: Duty free
Having done his bit to help sort out the Gatt chaos, Arthur Dunkel could
have been expected to put his expertise to good use on the boards of one or
two companies in his native Switzerland.
But it seems that he did the Gatt members a bigger favour than they probably
realise by agreeing to extend his term by an extra six months while they
searched for his successor. The big Swiss companies hold their AGMs - at
which new board members are approved - in the first half of the year.
So Dunkel, who made way for Peter Sutherland at the end of June, may have to
kill time before he can join SMH, maker of the Swatch - one of several
companies said to be keen to have him on board. In the meantime, he is
keeping his hand in lecturing at Geneva University and chairing the School
of Arts in Lausanne.
