FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Grand Central little changed with Pounds 1m
Profits were little changed at Grand Central Investment Holdings in the year
to June 30 1992.
On sales up 27 per cent at Pounds 29.8m (Pounds 23.4m) the pre-tax result
was Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 994,000).
The group's interests in the Asia Pacific region include commodities, Kuril
Plantations and Cocoa Specialities, which suffered from the lowest cocoa
prices for some years and the weak pound. The company has decided to divest
itself of these assets.
However, increased profits were reported from confectionery manufacturing
and food distribution.
The dividend is unchanged at 0.45p on earnings per share of 1.47p (1.38p).
