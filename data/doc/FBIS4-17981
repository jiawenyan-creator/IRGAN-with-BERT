  [Text] Russia "resolutely condemns the senseless subversive 
activity of those, who seek to cast shadow on the elections to 
the first non-racial parliament in South Africa," said the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, Grigory Karasin, at Thursday's [28 
April] briefing in Moscow. 
  As he said, the reports arriving from South Africa "make it 
possible to hope that the elections to be concluded on Thursday 
will be a success." However the forces, which tried in vain to 
derail the negotiating process, are still resorting to 
sabotage," Karasin said. 
  The recent terrorist act -- bomb explosion in Johannesburg's 
airport -- injured 16 people, including two Russian diplomats. 
  "We believe that such actions will not break the will of the 
majority of South Africans, who voted for a democratic future 
and for a prosperous South Africa," the spokesman for Russia's 
Foreign Ministry concluded.
