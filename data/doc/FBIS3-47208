  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- A private forum between 
Japan and Britain will hold its meeting from Friday to next 
Monday in London and Newport, Wales, to discuss security, 
bilateral ties and cooperation on global problems, the Foreign 
Ministry said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  The Japan-UK 2000 Group, established based on an agreement 
reached in June 1984 between then Prime Ministers Yasuhiro 
Nakasone and Margaret Thatcher, will draw 12 participants from 
Japan and 19 from Britain, the ministry said. 
  Hisashi Owada, an adviser to the foreign minister, will also 
attend as a special guest, it said. 
  The participants will discuss security, bilateral economic 
relations, cultural and educational interchange, bilateral 
cooperation on common global problems, and future bilateral 
ties, and report the results of the discussions to the heads of 
government of both countries, it said. 
  The group has been holding meetings annually since 1985, 
alternately in each country. 
  To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of 
the group, a symposium will be cosponsored with the Royal 
Institute for International Affairs on January 17 and 18 in 
London, the ministry said. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd will deliver a 
keynote 
address at the symposium, while Owada will also give a speech on 
behalf of Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who was 
initially scheduled to attend.
