FT  08 NOV 94 / Floods death toll mounts
The worst rainstorms to hit north-western Italy for 80 years have killed 59
people and authorities fear the final death toll could be well over 100.
State television, in a report that spoke of a 'cataclysm' in the northwest
Piedmont region, said 5,000 people were homeless, 1.2m acres of land were
under water and 10 districts still cut off four days after the first rains
fell. Continuing bad weather is hampering rescue work.
Telephones, water, electricity and roads were also cut in hundreds of
villages across southern France, Spain and across the Mediterranean in
Morocco. In France, where seven people have died since the weekend, floods
forced the closure of Nice-Cote d'Azur international airport (whose
inundated car park is pictured below).
Weekend storms in which 60cm of rain fell in as many hours have turned
rivers into raging torrents and demolished houses beneath mountains of mud.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, touring the stricken
north-west, was jeered by angry residents in the flood-hit town of Alba
after hearing bitter criticism from local councillors and businessmen over
the speed of relief work. He is to chair an emergency cabinet meeting this
morning to draw up special measures for Piedmont, where scores of towns and
villages are without power and other utilities.
