FT  16 OCT 92 / Recession grips in Scotland
THE FULL effects of the recession have reached Scotland, the Fraser of
Allander Institute, Scotland's principal economic research organisation,
said yesterday.
It was commenting on the latest quarterly survey of Scottish business which
showed almost uniformly bad indicators of economic performance and business
confidence.
The survey, carried out by Scotland's chambers of commerce for the third
quarter of 1992, revealed that manufacturing companies were now experiencing
falls in sales and orders compared with a modest increase in the second
quarter.
Orders in the construction industry were declining at an even faster rate
than in the previous quarter. An upward trend in retail sales in the second
quarter had turned into a fall, and tourism businesses reported falling
demand.
Manufacturers in the survey were running down stocks, and most said they
were scaling down investment in new plant and machinery. A small majority in
the second quarter had been increasing investment.
Hopes voiced in the second quarter for an upturn in the next quarter had not
been fulfilled, and expectations for the fourth quarter were for a
performance little better than that for the third.
Mr Brian Ashcroft, director of the institute, said demand from the Scottish
market, which had previously held up while that from England had declined,
was tailing off.
