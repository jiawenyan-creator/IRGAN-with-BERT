FT  14 NOV 94 / Company News this Week: Go-it-alone group in profits
overdrive - Volvo
Volvo has never looked back since shareholders scuppered its plans to merge
with France's Renault, a fact that will be underlined when it presents
nine-month figures tomorrow.
Sweden's biggest industrial group is expected to report pre-tax profits of
more than SKr12bn (Pounds 1bn) for the period, compared with last year's
SKr1.06bn. Swiss Bank Corp in London forecasts a profit of SKr12.3bn for the
nine months and SKr15.5bn for the full year. The nine-month figures will
include around SKr5bn of one-off gains, mainly from non-core disposals.
Underlying profits have benefited from a big rise in car and truck sales.
Competitiveness has been enhanced by the weak krona and by productivity
gains after three years of cost-cutting.
In the third quarter, profits should exceed SKr3bn, including more than
SKr900m in gains from winding up Protorp, the investment group.
Investors will be hoping to hear more about the group's disposal plans. The
company has said it plans to sell SKr40bn of non-core assets before the end
of 1996 to focus on its core automotive businesses.
The big candidate on the list is BCP, the food and drinks group, which is
worth more than SKr20bn.
The priority on the car side remains model development, which will almost
certainly include deeper collaboration with other manufacturers.
