FT  05 APR 94 / Observer: Banana bash-up
Farce, rather than tragedy, from distant Athens. Ursula Barrow, Belize's
High Commissioner in London, was supposed to be there last week as an
observer to the 'San Jose ministerial', an annual binge where ministers from
the European Union and Central America talk about peace and stability.
Her presence less than delighted Guatemala's foreign minister, Gladys Ruiz
de Vielman. Guatemala still nurtures yearnings for Belizean territory;
Belize's privileged access to the EU banana market doesn't help much,
either.
Greek European Affairs minister Theodoros Pangalos, their host, first denied
he had invited Belize. Then he claimed the invitation had been withdrawn.
The Greek diplomat then tried to push her out of the group photograph and
hustle her out the meeting, while Britain's foreign office minister, David
Heathcoat-Amory, tried to stop him.
Yet again Greek diplomacy triumphed and Barrow left. In another age, such an
insult might have merited the dispatch of one of Her Majesty's gun boats.
