  [Text] Brussels, June 17 (A.A.) -- Former Democracy Party 
(DEP) deputies who had resigned from the party on Wednesday [15 
June] and left Turkey on Thursday, on Friday announced that they 
will not return and `will continue their fight abroad.' 
  They were speaking at a press conference in Brussel's DEP 
and 
International Solidarity Bureau. 
  They said that a demand for political asylum is among 
possibilities considered. 
  The Constitutional Court on Thursday decided to close the 
DEP, on the grounds that it was holding separatist activities. 
  It also decided to abolish the parliament membership of the 
DEP members on the date on which the legal action was launched. 
  The chief prosecutor of the State Security Court said after 
the decision that his office will continue its invstigations on 
the DEP members after the court's decision reaches parliament. 
  He told the Anatolian Agency that after the decision reaches 
parliament, the DEP members would become ordinary citizens. 
  As the members of DEP resigned from their party, one day 
before the decision, five of these went abroad. 
  DEP Deputy Sedat Yurtdas earlier said that Ali Yigit 
(Mardin), Remzi Kartal (Van), Zubeyir Aydar (Siirt), Nizamettin 
Toguc (Batman) and Mahmut Kilinc (Adiyaman) went to Belgium to 
participate in a meeting on the situation of the five DEP 
members and a former one, currently under detention.
