  [Text] Sidon today observed a general and total strike in 
protest over the Hebron Massacre and to mark the 19th 
anniversary of the martyrdom of leader Ma'ruf Sa'd [founder of 
the Nasirite Popular Organization]. There was a large 
demonstration in which thousands took part, including youth 
organizations and students. Deputy Musafa Sa'd and 
representatives of patriotic and Islamic Lebanese and 
Palestinian parties also took part. 
  Deputy Sa'd addressed the demonstrators, pledging loyalty to 
the ideas of Martyr Ma'ruf Sa'd and determination to defend the 
rights of the working and dispossessed classes against the 
monopolistic clique. 
  Sa'd also vowed that resistance will continue until the 
liberation of the south and Western al-Biqa'. He called on the 
international community to put an end to the brutal Zionist 
practices against the sons of Palestine.
