FT  25 OCT 94 / Bulgarian economy warning
Failure to privatise banks swiftly and halt large loans to loss-making state
enterprises threatens to wreck Bulgaria's fragile financial system, Mr Todor
Valchev, head of the national bank, warned yesterday. The BTA state news
agency reported him telling bankers that political infighting and lack of a
strong government 'paved the way for uncontrolled plundering of the
country's financial resources'. He added: 'The clandestine privatisation
that is under way is very dangerous.' Continued big loans to technically
bankrupt state enterprises were a direct result of the failure to privatise
the communist-era banking system. Among the biggest factors holding back
privatisation in banking itself was the dilemma of how to deal with 'the
huge amount of non-performing loans'.
