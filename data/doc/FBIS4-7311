  [Text] Kofu, April 23 KYODO -- Yamanashi Prefecture decided 
Saturday [23 April] to bar 508 construction firms from bids for 
prefectural construction works for two to three months beginning 
Sunday as a punitive action against their alleged involvement in 
bid-rigging, prefectural officials said. 
  The number of firms to be disqualified as a tender is the 
majority of the 564 companies affiliated with construction trade 
associations in the prefecture, they said. 
  As a result, the prefecture will be unable to call for bids 
for public works for two or three months, they said. 
  Cities, towns and villages in the central Japan prefecture 
may follow suit, the officials said. 
  Among the 508 firms, 422 cannot join tenders for two months 
and 86 for three months, they said. 
  The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) on April 8 asked all the 
eight construction trade associations in the prefecture to stop 
rigging bids for Yamanashi Prefecture's construction works, 
saying the organizations have systematically conducted such 
activities for 10 years. 
  The trade associations told the FTC on Thursday that they 
have accepted the advice. The FTC will calculate fines and 
impose them on member firms, FTC officials said.
