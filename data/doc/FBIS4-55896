  [Text] Sarajevo, May 23 (AFP) -- Sergio Vieira de Mello, 
the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] civil affairs director in 
ex-Yugoslavia, is scheduled to meet Monday [23 May] with Bosnian 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to discuss the application of UN 
Resolution 913 on Gorazde. Silajdzic, in a television interview 
Sunday, questioned the UN's credibility saying that "in terms of 
Gorazde, where everything had started off well with a NATO 
ultimatum, these UN measures were successful in delaying 
everything to the point where it has practically become a joke. 
If they are not capable of doing something in Gorazde, how 
could they on a larger scale," he said, adding that as a result 
the Bosnian government would cautiously enter into the next 
round of negotiations.
