  [Text] The issue of Ukraine joining the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty is not of great urgency, believes one of the closest 
advisers of President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  "At present, the Ukrainian parliament must first of all 
consider economic issues," leader of the presidential service on 
foreign policy Anton Buteiko declared in his interview with the 
agency INTERFAX-Ukraine Thursday [2 June]. 
  In his opinion, "Kiev fulfills the treaty's demands striving 
for a non-nuclear status" without joining the NPT Treaty. 
  On 1 June Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk submitted a 
draft decree on Ukraine joining the NPT Treat to the parliament 
for consideration. According to the project, "presence of 
nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian territory till its complete 
destruction does not contradict the Treaty." 
  In addition, Kiev intends to view "the violation of the 
territorial integrity and inviolability of its border on the 
part of any nuclear state" as a violation of the NPT 
[Non-Proliferation] Treaty. 
  Kravchuk is once more addressing the parliament with a 
proposal to join the treaty. On 3 February this year Ukraine's 
parliament expressed its intention to consider this problem in 
the future.
