FT  26 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Drive for credit cover to Russia
SOME 300-400 UK companies are this week examining whether planned projects
in Russia will win export credit insurance protection, aware that less than
one in 10 is likely to win support.
Industrialists welcomed news that Britain is to resume credit cover for
contracts in Russia. A Pounds 280m credit line for the former Soviet
republics, announced in January, has been blocked while the IMF has
negotiated an economic restructuring programme with the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has written to 300
companies and their bankers giving guidelines on what projects would win
support. Only those meeting the guidelines are invited to apply for cover.
The ECGD said priority would go to projects self-financing in hard currency,
involving continuing management support from the UK exporter, and having
appropriate backing from the Russian government. Projects worth Dollars
20m-Dollars 100m would be preferred.
Britain's Crown Agents have been appointed, on World Bank recommendation, to
advise Russia on a Dollars 350m programme to import urgently needed farm,
health, transport and energy equipment.
