FT  14 JAN 93 / Court told of Ward's role in takeover
MR THOMAS WARD, the US lawyer, was more responsible for the success of
Guinness's 1986 takeover bid for Distillers than anyone else involved, an
Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.
Mr Olivier Roux, the former Guinness finance director, said he had the
greatest admiration for Mr Ward's work during the takeover battle with
Argyll. He was the most important person in achieving the successful
takeover, Mr Roux said.
Mr Ward's payment for his role, however, was a matter for Mr Ernest
Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, Mr Roux told the court.
Mr Ward is accused of the theft of Pounds 5.2m from Guinness, one charge of
false accounting and another count of executing a valuable security in
connection with the alleged theft. He denies all the charges.
Mr Roux said that when, after the bid had succeeded, he authorised the
invoice for paying Pounds 5.2m from Guinness to Marketing and Acquisitions
Ltd he had no knowledge Mr Ward would be the beneficiary.
He said Mr Ward had told him the payment would go to third parties in the US
whose services had been used during the bid.
The trial continues today.
