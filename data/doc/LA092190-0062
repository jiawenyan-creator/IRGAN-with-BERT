ACCIDENT KILLS U.S. PARATROOPER 
A U.S. soldier was killed in Saudi Arabia on Thursday in an off-road accident 
in a Hum-vee, the successor to the jeep, a military statement said. 
Two others were injured. All were from the 82nd Airborne Division, based in Ft. 
Bragg, N.C. 
The death was the third among U.S. troops sent to the Persian Gulf after Iraq 
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The others also died in vehicle accidents.
