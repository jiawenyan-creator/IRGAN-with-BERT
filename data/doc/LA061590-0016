'THOSE WHO CAN'T' VS. THOSE WHO KAHN 
Re Alice Kahn's misinformed, vicious, morally offensive attack on scientific 
research ("Linking Sex and Oat Bran: That's Science," June 3): She writes, 
"Those who can, do; those who can't, teach; those who can do absolutely 
nothing, do research." 
Kahn refers to the information explosion in science as a "glut of hideous 
proportions." 
Coming from someone who makes no important distinction between lite ice cream 
and a vaccine for cholera, failure to appreciate the significance of this 
"glut" is understandable. 
Kahn condemns research on the "obvious." Is it obvious that the Earth is round, 
or that a virus causes polio or that schizophrenia can be managed with drugs 
that block dopamine receptors? Some time ago, it was equally "obvious" that the 
Earth was flat and that polio and schizophrenia resulted from spiritual 
weakness. Scientists do not simply believe the obvious; they do collect data 
that allow them to distinguish the "obvious and correct" from the "obvious but 
wrong." But for the most part, they study phenomena that are not the least bit 
obvious. 
Kahn should do some checking on how easy and lucrative a career in science is 
these days. After 11 years of higher education, I got an excellent job as a 
professor at Occidental College. I teach classes year-round and maintain an 
active research program. I typically work 10 to 12 hours a day, six or seven 
days a week; this work pattern is not unusual at colleges and universities. 
I am not complaining. I chose my work and I love it. My point is that it is 
absurd to characterize an academic career as "doing absolutely nothing" on a 
"free ride." 
Kahn should also get in the habit of using non-sexist language, even with 
respect to researchers.
