FT  09 SEP 92 / Australia sees skirmish over corporate crime
AUSTRALIA'S corporate watchdog is embroiled in a public brawl with the
country's top prosecutor over its record of bringing white collar criminals
to justice, Reuter reports from Sydney.
Australian Securities Commission (ASC) chairman, Mr Tony Hartnell, was
yesterday forced to defend his organisation against claims by the Director
of Public Prosecutions (DPP) that it was going soft on corporate crime.
'There must not be special rules for corporate criminals simply because they
wear white shirts and carry briefcases,' the DPP, Mr Michael Rozenes, told a
parliamentary committee on Monday.
He said the ASC appeared to prefer civil rather than criminal action in
corporate crimes and accused Mr Hartnell of using one rule for the rich and
another for the poor. 'What the corporate criminal is really afraid of is
going to prison,' Mr Rozenes said.
