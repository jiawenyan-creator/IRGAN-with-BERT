BEST BETS: AWARD-WINNING LECTURES AT CAMPUS 
California Lutheran University will offer students and the community the 
opportunity to meet two respected writers at the eighth annual Pulitzer 
Symposium on Monday and Tuesday in the auditorium. 
Featured lecturers will be poet Galway Kinnell and writer Shirley Ann Grau. 
Kinnell received a Pulitzer for poetry in 1983 for his work, "Selected Poems," 
and has won numerous other awards for works including "Body Rags," "Mortal 
Words" and "The Past." 
 Grau received the Pulitzer in 1965 for her spellbinding novel, "The Keepers of 
the House." Some of her other acclaimed publications include "The Black 
Prince," "Nine Women" and "Evidence of Love." 
Kinnell and Grau will speak at 5 p.m. Monday, but that's not all. Both will 
present readings of their work. Kinnell will read poetry at 8 p.m. after the 
lecture. Grau returns at 8 p.m. Tuesday. 
Both readings will be held in the Preus-Brandt Forum. The lectures and readings 
are free.
