FT  03 MAR 93 / Russia to join US in relief air-drops to Bosnian towns
RUSSIA said yesterday it would join the US in air-dropping aid into
Bosnia-Hercegovina, in a move which would mark unprecedented co-operation
between the two cold war adversaries.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, said he expected Russian planes to fly
to Bosnia from Nato airfields. There was no immediate indication of when the
operations might be launched or their scale.
US aircraft carried out a third air-drop over Bosnia last night but Mr Les
Aspin, US defence secretary, said the missions might be stopped temporarily
as more land convoys were being allowed to carry aid into the region.
In New York, meanwhile, UN and European Community negotiators deplored the
continuation of heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia while peace talks under
their auspices were taking place in the city.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen also deplored the fact that relief convoys were
still being blocked. They urged measures to enable the wounded to be
evacuated and expressed concern about new displacement of civilians.
Their statement was issued after President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia
raised the matter with the mediators at the outset of his first meeting with
them since the talks were transferred from Geneva. On Monday he told
reporters in Washington that he was bringing proposals to the UN for a US
role in a ceasefire and military disengagement, but no details were
available.
There was no indication if or when a negotiating session including all the
parties would take place in New York. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian
foreign minister, has been named to lead the government delegation when Mr
Izetbegovic leaves for home. He has said he would remain in New York only
two or three days.
Serbs yesterday lifted a week-long blockade of the River Danube which
stranded at least 22 ships in ports along the river and halted international
traffic, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
