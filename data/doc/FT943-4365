FT  09 SEP 94 / Snake venom may lead to new drugs
Venom from a deadly African snake, the green mamba, could lead to new drugs
to treat brain disorders, the British Association meeting was told.
Professor Alan Harvey of Strathclyde University's Institute for Drug
Research described his work on dendrotoxin, an extremely potent nerve poison
extracted from mamba venom.
Dendrotoxin selectively blocks 'potassium channels' that are an essential
part of the signalling mechanism in nerve cells. The Strathclyde scientists
are developing small molecules based on dendrotoxin with the aim of boosting
the activity of certain chemical pathways that are damaged by progressive
brain diseases.
'Although dendrotoxin-like compounds would not be a cure for these diseases,
they may provide temporary relief from symptoms,' Prof Harvey said.
Conversely, compounds designed to have the opposite effect of activating
rather than blocking potassium channels 'may be a novel way of reducing
abnormal electrical activity in the brain,' he said. 'Hence they may form
the basis of a new type of anti-convulsant drug for epileptics.'
Prof Harvey said that in addition to the Strathclyde research he knew of two
drug companies working independently on dendrotoxins.
If the research leads successfully to a drug - which would take several
years - mamba venom would not be the first natural poison developed for the
benefit of human health.
Curare, the South American arrow poison, led to several muscle relaxant
drugs. Venom from the Brazilian arrowhead viper led to a range of drugs,
known as ACE inhibitors, which have been introduced over the past 10 years
to reduce blood pressure in heart patients.
