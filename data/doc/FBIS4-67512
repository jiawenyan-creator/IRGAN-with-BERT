<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the rubric ``Panorama'': ``Will </F>
Azerbaijan Join UN Conventions?''] 
  [Text] As ANS-PRESS was told in the Azerbaijani State 
Committee for Ecology and Control Over Rational Use of Natural 
Resources [Goskomekologiya], there is still no official answer 
from the president's staff and the republic's Cabinet of 
Ministers on the Goskomekologiya proposal regarding 
authorization for this organization to conduct negotiations 
within the UN Ecological Biodiversity Program--UNEBP. This 
problem is aggravated even more by the fact that the Azerbaijani 
parliament has not ratified the UN Convention on Biodiversity. 
However, the agency learned that the republic's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs has requested through the UN temporary 
representation in Baku a package of international conventions on 
global ecological problems in order to submit them for the 
consideration of the National Assembly. It should be noted that 
in the event Azerbaijan does not join these conventions, this 
precludes the republic's participation in a number of programs 
of international ecological foundations.
