ACTION:

 Reopening of comment period.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document reopens the comment period for Notice No. 785, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in the


Federal Register

 on December 14, 1993 [58 FR 65295]. In Notice No. 785, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) proposed to
amend its regulations to liberalize the requirements for using a multistate appellation of origin on a wine label.
The current regulations provide that a wine may bear a multistate appellation of origin only where the wine is in conformance
with the laws and regulations governing the composition, method of manufacture, and designation of wines in all the
States listed in the appellation. The proposed amendment would provide an exception where State laws and regulations
do not authorize the use of a multistate appellation of origin which includes that State for wines sold within its boundaries.



The comment period is being reopened based on requests from two wine industry associations.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Written comments must be received on or before March 21, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On December 14, 1993, ATF published Notice No. 785, soliciting comments from the public and industry on a proposal
to amend 27 CFR 4.25a(d)(3) to make it more practical to use a multistate appellation of origin on a wine label. This
proposal was based on a petition by Stimson Lane Ltd., a company with wineries located in Washington and California.

ATF has received written requests from the Wine Institute and the American Vintners Association (AVA) for additional
time to review and analyze the issues raised in this rulemaking proceeding. Since the Wine Institute and AVA are directly
impacted by issues raised in Notice No. 785, ATF believes that reopening the comment period is justified. Therefore,
the comment period is being reopened until March 21, 1994.

Copies of this notice, Notice No. 785, and any written comments will be available for public inspection during normal
business hours at: ATF Public Reading Room, room 6480, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, Washington, DC 20226.
