LOCAL; 
KIDNAP VICTIM FLEES IN SHORTS 
A Valencia man escaped his kidnaper by hurling himself from his moving car 
while clad only in his underwear. 
The 53-year-old man, whose name was not released, was forced into his own car 
at gunpoint in front of the Newhall Post Office Tuesday afternoon by a man 
wearing a turban, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Dean Scoville said. 
The victim told deputies that the suspect took his wallet containing $20, fired 
four shots into the floor of the car near his feet, ordered him to strip to his 
underwear and hit him on the head with a gun. 
The hourlong ordeal ended when the victim opened his car door and hurled 
himself onto the street at the intersection of Rinaldi Street and Sepulveda 
Boulevard in Mission Hills. He was treated at Holy Cross Hospital for cuts on 
his face. 
The suspect fled in the car and was being sought today. 
"Basically it was a desperate bid for freedom" by the kidnap victim, Scoville 
said. "The car wasn't stopped."
