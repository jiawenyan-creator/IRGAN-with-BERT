The Employment and Training Administration and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment and
Training, Labor.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Labor is removing regulations for Veterans' Employment Programs authorized under title IV, part
C, of the Job Training Partnership Act, administered by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment
and Training. This action is necessitated by the diminishing number of states applying for state formula-allocated
monies, and the need to improve the delivery of services. This action allows for the establishment of a more competitive
process to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to title IV, part C, of JTPA, the Secretary of Labor conducts programs to meet the employment and training
needs of service-connected disabled veterans, veterans of the Vietnam era, and veterans who are recently separated
from military service. The programs are administered through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment
and Training, who conducts the programs through grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements with public agencies
and private non-profit organizations.



The Department of Labor (DOL) originally issued regulations at 20 CFR part 1005 to define specifically the manner
in which the funds from this program would be disbursed. See 54 FR 39354 (September 26, 1980); and 48 FR 49198 (October
24, 1983). They provided for formula-based grants to States and required matching funds. However, the number of States
applying for title IVC formula grants has diminished and the Department has determined that a competitive
methodology would more efficiently meet the needs of program participants. Program administration will be greatly
enhanced as the result of the elimination of those regulations, by increasing competition and lowering administrative
costs through larger grant awards. However, while this action removes those regulations, all specifications, special
conditions, 

etc

., that were in effect with the award of existing grants are binding until completion of the grant activity, including
information collection.
Part 1005 (1993 ed.) identified the process used to provide grant funds to states for Federal training programs for
veterans. A Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA) will be developed and disseminated to eligible applicants
for the title IVC program. The formula-based annual grants process is replaced by a multi-year competitive
grants process. This will result in fewer grants of greater dollar value, and will enable recipients of the grants
to provide expanded services to eligible veterans. By having larger, competitive grants, services can be targeted
to those eligible veterans most in need in areas of high impact, with greater customer satisfaction realized.
