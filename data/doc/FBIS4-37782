  [Text] United Torah Jewry [UTJ] Knesset Member Menahem 
Porush quit the Knesset today after 35 years of service. Porush 
sent his handwritten letter of resignation through his grandson. 
The letter to the Knesset speaker simply states: I hereby would 
like to inform you of my resignation from the Knesset. 
According to the rotation agreement in UTJ, Porush will be 
replaced by Avraham Verdiger.
