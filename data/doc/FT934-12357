FT  27 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television
THE Falklands and the Westland Affair provide the keenest points of interest
in the second part of Thatcher: the Downing Street Years (BBC1, 9.30). It is
preceded by one of the more sensible offerings in the weird Thatcherfest on
our screens. In The Thatcher Experience (BBC2 8.00), Peter Jay mulls over
the financial and economic aspects of those years.
With government playing so large a part in the schedules, it is pleasant to
turn instead to the breezy climate of Skye and Iona. In Screenplay: Boswell
and Johnson's Tour of the Western islands (BBC2, 9.25), Robbie Coltrane is
the choleric lexicographer in a play by John 'Tutti Frutti' Byrne.
The opposition fields its own heavyweight comic line-up with Stephen Fry in
Stalag Luft (ITV, 8.00). This daringly long play about a compulsively
escapologist POW is written by David Nobbs, author of 'The Fall and Rise of
Reginald Perrin'.
Quite a droll series is The Almost Complete History of the 20th Century (C4,
9.45) which dubs old film footage with historical issues. Tonight, post-war
rationing.
