FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Kiev gripped in Russian stranglehold -
Ukraine's economy will pay a heavy price for defying Moscow
72 per cent of trade within the old Soviet Union - is grinding to a halt as
the political link which sustained it breaks down.
For troubled Ukrainian enterprise directors, the tale told by Mr Viktor
Antonov, Ukrainian minister for conversion and the defence industry, is
distressingly familiar. He was asked this spring to produce 10 T-8 tanks for
the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence but found that Ukraine's mighty military
industrial complex, which Khrushchev once bragged was capable of 'churning
out rockets like sausages,' was unable to fill the modest order because
Russian enterprises would not supply the necessary parts. This was in spite
of the formal co-operation agreement signed in April by Mr Antonov and his
Russian counterpart.
The situation is likely to get worse. Like the Comecon countries which
shared Ukraine's dependence on heavily-subsidised Russian oil, Ukraine could
pay a heavy economic price for its determination to break out of the Russian
orbit.
According to Mr Evhen Baramikov, chief of the inter-republican trade
department in the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy, Russian experts have warned
Ukraine that the moment Ukraine introduces a separate currency Russia will
demand world prices for oil. This threat underscores Ukraine's structural
vulnerability in its trade with Russia. 'They can last a year without our
food, but Russia can halt Ukrainian industry in a day,' says Mr Baramikov.
'We will eat our sugar while freezing in the dark.'
Mr Baramikov said Ukraine was paying Rbs2,840 per tonne for Russian crude
supplied according to inter-governmental agreements. If Ukraine remained in
the rouble zone, Russia had offered to continue selling crude at between
Rbs2,820 and Rbs3,500 per tonne, well below the world rate.
However, that enticement to remain in the Russian economic sphere is less
attractive than it might seem because even today Russian oil sold to Ukraine
at the subsidised rate covers barely half of the requirements of Ukrainian
enterprises. Ukraine traditionally purchased 52m tonnes of oil from Russia
each year. This year that has been cut to 40m tonnes and in the first
quarter of 1992 Russia supplied Ukraine with only 7.4m tonnes at subsidised
rates.
Ukraine is suffering even more extreme shortages of the coal, gasoline and
lumber normally supplied by Russia. In the first three months of 1992,
Ukraine received only 14.7 per cent of the lumber and 19.8 per cent of the
coking coal Russia had pledged to deliver. The shortage of Russian fuel has
a knock-on effect: in the first quarter of this year, Ukraine supplied
Russia with only 13.8 per cent of the black metal and 35.4 per cent of the
tubing it had agreed to provide.
The mounting political hostility between Ukraine and Russia is one
explanation for the collapse in trade. Mr Baramikov describes negotiations
with Russia as acrimonious and emotional encounters in which 'the Russians
try to turn the thumb-screws on us'.
But trade is also jeopardised by the economic limbo in which the former
Soviet Union is trapped. 'The old system no longer works,' Mr Baramikov
says, 'but there is no new mechanism yet.'
Enterprises were responsible under the old system to central planners, not
to each other. The planners provided raw material, dictated how much they
should produce and disposed of their products. Today, the planners still set
guidelines - they are the men who draft the huge inter-state trade deals -
but, as the non-fulfilment of the agreements demonstrates, their word is no
longer law.
The hybrid system in operation today has bred some costly distortions. For
example, some Ukrainian enterprises have fulfilled or over-fulfilled their
obligations to Russian customers without being paid because they know their
national bank will make up any shortfall. Hence Ukrainian factories' shipped
2 1/2 times the eggs and twice the processed foods which Kiev had agreed to
supply to Russia.
The Ukrainian national bank hopes to put a stop to this costly practice by
abolishing the old payments system, but Ukrainian experts claim that
Ukrainian enterprises have amassed debt of up to a thousand billion roubles
owed by Russian enterprises which seem unlikely to repay it.
To avoid these sorts of loopholes Mr Baramikov thinks that 'we should open
our borders and not block our enterprises from trading directly.' But he is
worried that 'over 70 years Ukraine and Russia have created a structure of
mutual dependency. Neither we nor they are ready to immediately switch to
the market.'
