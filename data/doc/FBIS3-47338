  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 11 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The year 
of 1993 was a "bumper" year for owners of private running 
enterprises. The most important thing is that people are 
shifting from the commercial business to productive one. At 
present in Mongolia there are about 30 thousand of private units 
which is evidencing the establishing some grounds for the 
private sector to grow and establish in the country, senior 
secretary of the Mongolian association of owners of privately 
running enterprises B. Sembeejav said in his interview granted 
to the MONTSAME correspondent. 
  In spite of the little assistance and support given to those 
engaged in private businesses on the part of the state and 
government by their market oriented initiativeness such 
private-owned enterprises as "Altan Shagai", "Uldziyt" and 
others managed to find their feet and succeed.
