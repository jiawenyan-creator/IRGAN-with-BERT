FT  08 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Tort reform - Legal briefs
A more systematic approach needs to be taken to the reform of tort law
worldwide, according to a review of the economics of law reform published by
the Oxford Review of Economic Policy.
The movement towards strict product liability in the US and Europe, for
example, will have little impact on product-related accidents, it says. Tort
reform should be seen in the wider context of public policy towards
regulating the quality of products, workplace safety and environmental
damage, rather than as a response to events where victims are seen to be in
need of compensation.
