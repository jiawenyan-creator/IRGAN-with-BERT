  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the negotiating 
Palestinian team, has warned against the gravity of Israel's 
failure to honor the dates of withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
The withdrawal had been scheduled to take place yesterday, 13 
April. In a press statement published in London today, Dr. 
Sha'th attributed the recent events in the occupied territories 
to the stalemated peace process and the loss of its credibility. 
  Dr. Sha'th said these events signal the importance of 
expediting the peace process. He indicated that the longer the 
parties take to arrive at positive results on the ground through 
the peace process, the more acts of violence we will see between 
the two sides.
