FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Berlitz net income slips to
Dollars 4.4m in first quarter
BERLITZ, the US language instruction company, yesterday turned in
first-quarter net income of Dollars 4.4m, or 23 cents a share, against
Dollars 5.9m, or 15 cents, a year earlier.
Operating income in the quarter fell to Dollars 4.4m from Dollars 7m, while
sales rose to Dollars 68.3m from Dollars 64.8m.
Macmillan, the US publishing subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation
(MCC) owned 56 per cent of Berlitz shares. The ownership of this stake is
currently the subject of litigation.
Berlitz's interest income from affiliates fell by Dollars 3.9m to Dollars
1.7m, reflecting payment defaults of the notes from MCC and some MCC
affiliates in the 1991 fourth quarter. MCC has filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code.
Berlitz reiterated yesterday that preferred stock dividends have been
suspended and are not expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.
In the 1991 first quarter, the preferred stock dividend reduced net income
available to common shareholders by Dollars 3.1m.
