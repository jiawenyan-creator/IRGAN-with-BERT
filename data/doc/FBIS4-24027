  [Excerpts] Abidjan, 20 Jun (AFP) -- The vast majority of 
students enrolled at the University of Abidjan turned up for 
classes today in spite of a new strike call by the Federation of 
University and High School Students of Cote d'Ivoire [FESCI], an 
officially banned organization. About 400 combat-ready 
gendarmes and policemen took up position in the very early hours 
of the day in front of lecture halls and tutorial blocks, AFP 
noted. No incident was reported by 1000. 
  Several leaders of the FESCI, which is composed of the most 
radical students, were present on the campus but they answered 
questions with great caution. "The land is mined," they 
explained, refusing to comment further on the situation.

  Six students entered the second week of their hunger strike 
today at the country's second university town, Bouake, which is 
290 km north of Abidjan. They were transferred to Bouake 
central hospital on 16 June from the Burkina Faso Consulate 
where they began their strike. "They are still refusing food 
but they do accept water," the hospital director told AFP. "For 
the time being, their lives are not in danger. We cannot 
forcibly feed them but should their condition worsen we will be 
compelled to intervene," he stated. [passage omitted]
