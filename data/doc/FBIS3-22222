  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 08, BNS -- Leaders of the Estonian 
Greens Movement in a statement Tuesday [8 February] said the 
Estonian- Dutch company Pak-Terminal has failed to abide by the 
established regulations while building a fuel terminal in 
Tallinn. 
  The Greens were referring to a government ruling from 13 
November 1992, which requires all fuel terminal projects to be 
subjected to expert examination as to their environment 
implications. A building permit can be issued only after the 
plan has successfully passed the expert commission. 
  Pak-Terminal started work on its 57,000 cubic meter terminal 
facility for oil products of the 3rd risk class without expert 
examination of the project. The building permit was issued 
illegally and the expert report drawn up later, the council of 
the Greens Movement says in its statement. 
  They also say the company has started work on a second 
facility, this time for 70,000 cubic meters of oil products of 
the 1st risk class. 
  Building was started without expertise as to ecologic 
aspects, the Greens say. 
  The national construction inspectorate on Feb. 3 ordered 
work 
on the second facility suspended. It was only on Feb. 7 that 
the project was handed to the municipality's Environment Board 
and the Ministry of Environment.
