OVERCROWDING 
After six years of going slowly insane on Southern California freeways, I 
recently took a 20% cut in pay for the opportunity to walk to work every 
morning. During the same morning hours when I used to gnash my teeth, breathe 
carbon monoxide, and be appalled at the inconsiderate driving habits of 
pinheads in mini-trucks, I now read the paper over a leisurely cup of coffee, 
go for a bike ride and listen to the birds sing. 
I hold no illusions that my decision will have any impact on the commuter 
situation in general simply because the greed-head developers and the elected 
officials that they have bought and paid for will continue to throw up 
clone-home "neighborhoods" as quickly as people move here to fill them up. 
I know that this part of the country will never again be the beautiful, clean 
place that it was when I was growing up, but perhaps the aggravation and stress 
that I am avoiding with my job change will help delay my inevitable emigration 
for a few more years. 
P.S. If you love California, let your water run over the curb and into the 
gutter -- drought is the only force that can stop development!
