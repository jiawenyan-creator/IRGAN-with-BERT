FT  10 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Education adapting to skills needs
Sir, David Soskice's support for continued expansion of higher education
(Personal View, January 6) will be welcome to all those who believe the UK's
future lies in a high-skills, knowledge-based economy. However, he fails to
note the scale of recent and current change in higher education itself, both
in who participates and what is provided.
It is now three years since school leavers ceased to be the majority of
entrants to higher education in England and Wales: while the numbers of
young people entering higher education expanded in the 1980s by 28 per cent,
the expansion was in mature students (77 per cent), mature women (147 per
cent), and part-timers, notably part-time postgraduates (164 per cent).
This is a signal that many people are recognising the priority of lifelong
learning: we cannot afford to wait for young people with new skills to
replace those currently in the labour market.
The second point is that traditional forms of higher education do not
necessarily produce the kind of skills which the Employment in Britain
survey points to. Developing these reliably and economically in most
universities calls for change in what is taught and how it is taught. But
the government's Enterprise in Higher Education programme has invested for
the past five years in curriculum development aimed precisely at these kinds
of skills. Fifty-four universities, working with thousands of employers,
have introduced changes affecting the experience of a growing proportion of
their students.
There is a long way to go, but the UK may not be as far behind the US as
David Soskice fears. We certainly share the hope that the present
consolidation will prove to be a minor diversion from the long-term trend of
expan-sion.
