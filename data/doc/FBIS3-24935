  [Text] Ulundi Feb 3 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Thursday [3 February] the 
reported agreement by the African National Congress [ANC] to a 
two-ballot system does not address the bottom line demands of 
his party, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news reports. 
  Mr Buthelezi said at Ulundi that he hoped the ANC and the 
government would also agree to the IFP's remaining two important 
demands. He said it would be no use having regional elections 
if regions had no exclusive powers. 
  Canadian Secretary of State for Africa and Latin America 
Mrs. 
Christine Stewart met Mr Buthelezi on Thursday to try to 
persuade the IFP to take part in the election. She said she 
hoped the ballot paper issue would make it easier for the IFP to 
participate.
