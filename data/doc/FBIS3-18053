  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- On Monday evening [21 February], 
after a four-hour debate, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
congress in Hamburg adopted the principles "For Growth and 
Employment" with a great majority. The proposed measures are to 
safeguard Germany as a business location and increase its 
attractiveness. Essential parts have already been approved by 
the Bonn government coalition and have been presented to 
parliament. 
  Central points of the principles are: the promotion of 
investments; the privatization of tasks that have so far been 
carried out by the sate; the reduction of wages in job-creation 
measures to 80 percent of collectively agreed wages; and the 
restructuring of social benefits wanted by the CDU. In the 
paper, drawn up under the leadership of Environment Minister 
Klaus Toepfer and Christa Thoben, North Rhine-Westphalian 
economic politician, employers and employees are encouraged to 
show their own initiative and independence. Toepfer spoke of a 
cohesive concept that is to abolish "barriers to independence."
