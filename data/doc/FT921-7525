FT  21 FEB 92 / Observer: Ex-tax haven
President George Bush, the kinder, gentler president, now knows what it is
like to feel homeless.
Although he has lived in Washington for years and owns a holiday home at
Kennebunkport, on the Maine coast, his official residence for tax purposes
is a suite at the Houstonian Hotel in Texas. Unfortunately, The Houstonian
has now collapsed under Dollars 3m of debt and has filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
The big advantage of living at the hotel is that Texas levies no state
income taxes. According to Money magazine, the Bush family paid Dollars
99,241 in federal income taxes in 1990 on a presidential salary of Dollars
200,000 and investment income of Dollars 253,000. But the president paid
only Dollars 3,596 in state taxes, however, rather than the Dollars 29,000
he would have paid as a Maine resident, or the Dollars 30,000 that would
have been levied by the District of Columbia.
Thousands of Americans have written to the Texas state comptroller
requesting Texas citizenship after a Doonesbury cartoon strip urged its
readers to follow the president's example. 'I think this might help him get
the message. Most people understand economic problems when something
personal happens to them,' crows Ed Martin, the Democrat party's Texas
executive director.
