FT  04 APR 92 / Letter: Lloyd's - even-handedness of results and divine
rights
Sir, We fully endorse the point made by Keith Leonard (Letters, April 2)
concerning the proper way to compare the underwriting performance of
external and working Lloyd's Names.
Our own analysis of Names' results for the last three closed years of 1986,
1987 and 1988 shows a small difference in favour of external Names in the
first two years and in favour of working Names in the third. The pattern
appears to be that our external Names have fared better in years of good
profit (1986 and 1987) and worse in the poor year of 1988. This same pattern
was apparent in the Task Force Report.
The forecasts for our Names for the loss year of 1989 produce an
insignificant difference of 0.11 per cent between the two groups.
Members' agents should not favour working Names over external Names or vice
versa, and the evidence from the two leading Members' agents is that they
have been even-handed. What is needed in this debate is more light and
rather less heat.

From Mr G C Ranard.
Sir, Mr Keith Leonard, managing director of one of Lloyd's of London's most
substantial managing agents, has described as 'vocational' the occupation of
working in the Lloyd's insurance market.
The first definition given for the word vocation in the Concise Oxford
Dictionary is a 'divine call'.
I am aware that 'insider' names may be benefiting from privileged syndicate
selection, but I suppose it is natural that they also assume a divine right
to such woeful injustice.
