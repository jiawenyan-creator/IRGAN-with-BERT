  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 27 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- According 
to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture the preparations for the 
spring sowing campaign of the year 1994 are slowing down. As of 
today just about 4864 percent [figure as received] of the 
agricultural equipment and machineries are ready for 
exploitation. 
  Moreover in many farms of the Bayanulgii and Bayanhongor 
Aimags in the western part of Mongolia the repairing of such 
techniques and machineries is not being started yet. The delay 
in repairing tractors, combines and other agricultural 
machineries is connection with the lack of spare parts and 
financial difficulties.
