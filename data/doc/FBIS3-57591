  [Text] Riga, Jan 26, BNS -- Leonid Mayorov, the commander 
in chief of the Russian Northwest Army Group, failed to sign 
around 100 documents on military property handover to Latvian 
authorities, said Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the bureau monitoring 
the troops' withdrawal. 
  The Russian servicemen have already quitted the 
installations, Upmalis said. Responsible officers handed the 
property over to Latvia, according to takeover-handover 
statements. 
  Mayorov, however, declined to sign the papers with a pretext 
he was not authorized to do that. 
  From the Latvian party, the papers were signed by State 
Property Minister Edmunds Krastins. 
  Mayorov may sign the papers after coordinating the signature 
with the representative of the Russian State Property Committee, 
who resides in Latvia, the army group's press officers told BNS 
that. 
  The resolution of the problem may take much time because 
many 
army bases have proprietors other than the Defense Ministry, 
said the bureau's deputy head Ludis Pavilonis. 
  Pavilonis claimed that the issue should be brought to 
interstate talks. Otherwise, the signature of documents on 
every separate property unit depends on the political situation 
in Moscow or else considerations.
