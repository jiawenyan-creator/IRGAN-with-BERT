BRIEFLY 
Trade Complaints Over Microchips: The Semiconductor Industry Assn. said Sony, 
Matsushita, Sanyo and Sharp are among Japanese companies that aren't buying 
enough foreign chips to satisfy an existing agreement to expand the U.S. share 
of the market. The Japanese companies that came under fire responded that they 
are trying to increase their intake of foreign chips but that U.S. firms are 
not making the kind of products they want.
