CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTES; 
MANFULL TAKES LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM COACHING STAFF 
Cal State Fullerton offensive line coach Larry Manfull has taken a medical 
leave of absence and will miss the 1989 football season. 
Manfull, 48, has coached at Fullerton for nine seasons. He is the only 
remaining member of Coach Gene Murphy's original staff. 
Don Morel, who has assisted Manfull the past two seasons, will replace him as 
offensive line coach. 
"We look forward to having Larry back as soon as possible," Murphy said. 
Freshman quarterback Terry Payne injured his knee during workouts this week, 
but the extend of the injury is uncertain. 
Payne will be examined further Monday. Payne passed for 2,145 yards last season 
at Hemet High School. 
The Titans have been planning to red-shirt Payne. 
Titan veterans reported to camp Friday. The first day in pads will be 
Wednesday. ROBYN NORWOOD
