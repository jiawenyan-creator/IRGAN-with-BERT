FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Elections: Noboru Takeshita - The 'purified'
ex-pm / How candidates fared
Old ways die hard in the most conservative regions of Japan. Mr Noboru
Takeshita, former prime minister, was re-elected yesterday at the top of
Shimane's list of candidates, with over 100,000 votes.
For many Japanese, Mr Takeshita symbolises the corrupt ways of the country's
politics. He was forced out of office after being linked to the Recruit
stocks-for-favours scandal in 1989 and, more recently, public criticism
mounted after revelations of his links to gangsters.
However, among his electorate, he remains the pride of Shimane, a rural
prefecture in western Japan.
The region lacks any big industries and is sparsely populated but, thanks to
Mr Takeshita, has the most public works spending allocated per capita.
His supporters will consider Mr Takeshita's victory as a 'purification'
after all the scandals.
