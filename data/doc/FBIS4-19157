  [Text] Greece always desires good relations with Albania, 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said today and stressed that 
the Albanian side's reaction to the Gjirokaster incident does 
not help promote the good relations that both peoples desire. 
Mr. Papoulias described Tirana's reaction as unreasonable and 
said that there is an open invitation to his Albanian 
counterpart, Alfred Serreqi, for a meeting on neutral territory 
and to form a joint committee to investigate the incident; there 
has not been any response to the proposals. 
  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias denied reports about a 
new 
incident yesterday on the Greek-Albanian borders and pointed out 
that both police and military sources stressed that there is 
complete calm on the Greek-Albanian border. Mr. Papoulias 
added: The Greek Army has not been put on alert along the border 
with Albania.
