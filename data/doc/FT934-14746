FT  15 OCT 93 / Menem has heart surgery
ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem underwent emergency heart surgery
yesterday. Mr Menem's doctor said the operation was to clear a blockage of
the carotid artery which feeds blood to the head.
Mr Menem, 63, was on his way to the airport for a flight to Chile, where he
was to attend a summit of Latin American leaders, when his motorcade was
diverted to a clinic specialising in heart disease, local radio said.
Markets reacted to the news of the surgery with sharp falls in Argentine
securities overseas. Local markets closed minutes after the announcement
that he would undergo heat surgery. In New York, YPF, the privatised oil
company, fell 4 per cent on the news.
Doctors in Buenos Aires say Mr Menem's illness is serious but believe it was
probably caught early before it could lead to complications. However, one
doctor estimated that the president might require two months' rest. This
would be a severe setback for his attempts to change the constitution and
stand for re-election.
Argentina's Congress is to begin impeachment proceedings against the Supreme
Court a week after Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, publicly accused
two of the nine-member justices of theft and corruption.
