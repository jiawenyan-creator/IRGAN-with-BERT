FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Vimto production under way in Russia
JN Nichols (Vimto), the soft drinks manufacturer, yesterday said that local
production of its core product - the mixed fruit juice drink beloved in the
Midlands and north of England - had started in Moscow.
Exports have previously centred on teetotal markets such as Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, but thirst for the product in the Russian capital and St Petersburg
had been 'exceptional' since its launch in cans into the former Soviet
Union.
'This is the culmination of six months of strong export performance around
the world,' said Mr John Nichols, managing director.
The announcement accompanied results for the six months to June 30 showing
an 11 per cent expansion in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds
3.76m, on turnover from continuing operations up a commensurate amount at
Pounds 26.8m. Growth in international markets was backed by higher domestic
sales reflecting good weather and increased market penetration via the new
Vimto Soft Drinks division.
Mr Nichols added: 'We are delighted with the performance during a period of
change. Early indications are that the recent divisionalisation and the
commencement of production in Russia will reap further rewards in the
future.'
The interim dividend is 2.25p (2.16p), payable from earnings of 6.32p
(5.76p).
