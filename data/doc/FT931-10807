FT  06 FEB 93 / Patchy recovery for steel industry
THE recession-hit world steel industry can expect to see slow and patchy
recovery, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
forecast yesterday.
Overall output and consumption should rise slightly this year, reversing two
years of decline, according to the OECD's steel outlook for 1993. It
forecasts a 0.5 per cent rise in OECD-wide production this year, a
significant turnround from a 3 per cent per cent fall in 1992. It forsees an
even sharper improvement in consumption to 1.5 per cent from a 3.4 per cent
fall in 1992. Capacity was almost unchanged last year but will fall in 1993
thanks to cuts by several European steel makers.
The OECD thinks demand might rise sharply in the North American motor
industry, thanks to the upturn in consumer spending in the region, and in
construction in the US, Australia and Japan, helped by a rise in public
infrastructure spending there. Demand for consumer durables and domestic
appliances should also rise, especially in the US. Housing starts should
rise in North America, Australia and Japan.
By contrast, the OECD predicts that European Community steel demand will
fall by 2.5 per cent because of the low growth expected in the EC.
Stocks have been run down over the past year and US anti-dumping duties will
be a factor in curbing European steel production. This, plus the recovery in
US domestic steel demand should depress EC steel trade with the US by 3.5
per cent this year, says the report.
Japanese steel demand should also fall slightly, mainly due to falling sales
to manufacturing industry.
