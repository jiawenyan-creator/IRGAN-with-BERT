FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Nurdin moving into US style shopping clubs
 -Recession and Sunday trading hit 1992 sales
NURDIN &amp; PEACOCK, the cash and carry wholesaler, yesterday ended months of
speculation as it announced plans to introduce US-style shopping clubs in
the UK.
The company, which also announced a 9 per cent increase in annual pre-tax
profits to Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 27.6m), plans to open its first club
warehouse next spring, at a total cost of about Pounds 10m-Pounds 12m. A
second site is planned for later in the year.
Club warehouses are a popular retailing strategy in the US, where customers
pay a fee to become members and are entitled to discount shopping on items
such as food, clothes and electrical goods. Since 1986 total club sales are
estimated to have grown from Dollars 7.3bn to Dollars 34.7bn (Pounds 24.4bn)
last year, with more than 21m people holding membership cards.
Nurdin plans a similar format to that in the US. Mr David Poole, managing
director, said the group aimed to open two clubs a year. It could link up
with a joint venture partner to accelerate that programme but no party had
yet been approached.
Mr Poole said it was unlikely that Nurdin would link up with Makro, the cash
and carry business of Dutch company SHV, which holds 14 per cent of the UK
company. 'Any linkage with SHV would severely damage our reputation with our
retailing customers in the UK,' he said. However, some sort of sourcing
agreement for the clubs was not ruled out.
The new strategy comes as the group reported a 4 per cent decline in
like-for-like sales for the 53 weeks to January 1 1993. Overall, however,
there was a 5.5 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 1.44bn. This
included contributions from three new branches, for a total of 46. The
period compares with 52 weeks to December 31 1992; the three extra trading
days added 1 per cent to sales.
Mr Nigel Hall, finance director, said the decline in comparable sales
stemmed from the impact of recession and Sunday trading on independent
retailers - which account for more than 50 per cent of the group's turnover.
However, an improvement in operating margins from 1.7 per cent to 1.9 per
cent helped boost profits at the trading level by 14 per cent to Pounds
27.3m.
Mr Hall said he expected margins to improve further in the current year.
The final dividend is 4.16p for a total of 6.12p (5.56p). Earnings per
share, helped by a lower tax charge, rose from 15p to 17p.
