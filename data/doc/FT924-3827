FT  05 DEC 92 / German industrial orders fall again
FRESH evidence of Germany's slide into recession emerged yesterday with the
release of October's industrial order figures showing a fall for the eighth
consecutive month, writes Judy Dempsey in Bonn.
The federal Economics Ministry said industrial orders, after taking into
account seasonal and price adjustments, were down 5 per cent in October on
the previous month, and 9.7 per cent against October 1991. Domestic demand
for west German factory goods fell 4.7 per cent, and 6 per cent for foreign
orders.
Orders for capital goods declined by 7 per cent, or 12.4 per cent over the
same period last year. Domestic orders fell 7.4 per cent, and foreign orders
6.2 per cent.
