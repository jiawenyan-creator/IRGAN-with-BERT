FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
A FIRM opening on the FT-SE 100 future quickly dwindled into a weak trading
session as the market lost its enthusiasm of recent days, Christine Buckley
writes.
The mood shifted from one of optimism for early interest rate cuts to one
prepared for little immediate encouragement from chancellor Kenneth Clarke's
speech to the Conservative party conference.
In the main, institutions decided to sit out yesterday's trading session and
volume in the December contract on the FT-SE was a poor 5,347 contracts -
just over half the average amount. Much of the decline in the contract -
which went from a day's high of 3,041 to the session's low of 3,012 - was
done in transactions by independent traders.
With no large sellers evident, one trader saw the slide as a temporary blip
and felt the derivatives market was pausing to gather steam after its recent
buoyancy.
The contract started the day at 3,032 and soon after opening firmed up to
its peak before moving, along with the cash market, into reverse gear. It
closed at 3,122 - a premium of 31 points to the cash market and 10 points
ahead of the fair value premium to cash.
Busy trading was seen in traded options, particularly in the Euro FT-SE 100
which saw 10,795 lots traded. There was significant activity in call spreads
on the Euro FT-SE. Amstrad topped the stock options at 3,571.
