SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background




During the late 1980s, the credit reporting industry developed a product, called the ``risk score,'' to evaluate
a consumer's credit history for its clients. A risk score assesses the likelihood of a particular adverse event, such
as default or bankruptcy, based on various factors in a consumer report. The result of this evaluation is communicated
by means of a numerical score.

Section 609 of the FCRA requires a consumer reporting agency, upon receiving a request and proper identification
from a consumer, to ``clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer ... [t]he nature and substance
of all information (except medical information) in its files on the consumer at the time of the request.'' A consumer
reporting agency also must disclose, in most instances, the sources of the information in the consumer's file, as
well as the recipients of any consumer report on the consumer which the reporting agency has furnished six months preceding
the consumer's request (or two years, if the report is for employment purposes).

On February 11, 1992, the Commission amended its FCRA Commentary to state that, pursuant to section 609 of the FCRA,
``a risk score (or other numerical evaluation, however named) that is reported by a consumer reporting agency to a
client to assist in evaluating a consumer's eligibility for credit (or other permissible purposes) must be disclosed
(along with an explanation of the risk score)'' to a consumer requesting disclosure of his or her credit file from the
consumer reporting agency. 57 FR 493536 (Feb. 11, 1992). It noted that Congresswoman Leonor Sullivan, when
introducing the conference report on the bill that ultimately enacted the FCRA, had stated:




(The House conferees) stressed that the consumer should have access to all information 

in any form which would be relayed to a prospective employer, insurer or creditor in making a judgment as to the worthiness
of the individual's application for such benefits.*** It is not intended that the credit reporting
firm should have a free hand in excluding from the consumer's access information other than medical information it
just does not want to give him, but will give to a client-user.





116 Cong Rec. 36572 (October 12, 1970) (emphasis added)



After the Commission amended the FCRA Commentary, several industry representatives requested clarification of
the revision. As part of this process, some of these parties (as well as consumer representatives and other interested
parties) submitted informal statements of their positions that appear on the Commission's public record. Commissioners
and Bureau of Consumer Protection staff have discussed these issues with industry, consumer and state representatives.
During these discussions, the following three principal issues arose concerning the applicability of the FCRA to
risk scores: (1) When a consumer reporting agency must disclose a risk score; (2) what score(s) must be disclosed;
and (3) what type of explanation of the score, if any, must be provided as part of the disclosure.

In response to these inquiries, the Commission proposes to expand the discussion of risk scores in the FCRA Commentary
as set forth below.
