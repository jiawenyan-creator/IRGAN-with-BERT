FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union boost for Smith campaign
COHSE, the health union, yesterday agreed to remit a motion calling for no
change to the union's role in the selection of Labour MPs.
The move, recommended by the Cohse executive, was welcomed by supporters of
Labour leader Mr John Smith and means that the union will be free to press
the case for one-member-one-vote in the selection process. Only one other
large union, the AEEU craft union, has backed Mr Smith in his plan for
revising the party-union link.
Two civil service unions - the NUCPS and the CPSA - have started balloting
their Home Office members on a one - day strike against market testing,
contracting out and privatisation. The ballot ends on July 9 and a yes vote
would mean a strike on July 16.
