FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: NS cuts rates on savings
NATIONAL Savings has announced cuts of between 0.75 and a full percentage
point in the interest it offers on fixed-rate savings products. The Building
Societies' Association welcomed the move and said it would ease pressure
further on mortgage rates.
The launch in July of the First Option bond, which offers a fixed rate over
one year with tax paid, brought protests from societies, which said it was
impossible to match.
The initial rate for the bond, of 10.34 per cent gross, prompted the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester society to raise its mortgage rate. This was
followed by a cut in the bond's gross interest rate of 0.67 points.
The gross interest on the bond has been cut by a full percentage point to
8.67 per cent and no longer poses such a competitive threat to building
society deposits. Similar cuts were made to National Savings' more
traditional products.
The new 39th issue savings certificates guarantee a tax-free return of 6.75
per cent after five years; the 38th issue paid 7.5 per cent. Certificates
for the 39th issue will be sold in units of Pounds 100 rather than Pounds
25, a denomination in which certificates have been available since 1981.
This also should lessen the pressure on societies.
Series E capital bonds, which offered 10 per cent gross, have been withdrawn
and replaced by Series F bonds which offer 9 per cent. The new issue D of
children's bonus bonds will also see a cut of one percentage point, from
10.1 to 9.1.
The overall return on a five-year Yearly Plan will be 6.75 per cent,
compared with 7.5. No change has been made to index-linked certificates.
All these products will be available direct from National Savings from
Monday but they will not be obtainable from post offices until Thursday,
October 15.
