  [Text] Japanese Foreign Ministry analysts believe that 
North Korea is taking a tough stand in an attempt to win some 
kind of compromise to prevent United Nations' sanctions. Japan 
-- without responding excessively to North Korea's announcement 
to secede from the IAEA, and by maintaining ties with the United 
States, the ROK, and China -- wants to strengthen its effort to 
persuade North Korea to sit down at the discussion table with 
the international community.
