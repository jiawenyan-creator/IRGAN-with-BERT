FT  01 APR 92 / Observer: Last man off
Still on the subject of where are they now. I see that Peter Lucas has
finally abandoned the board of Bond Corporation, Alan Bond's old flagship.
Lucas, a lawyer, first joined Bond Corporation in 1971. Although he had a
long spell off the board between 1976 and 1985, he was one of the loyal
lieutenants who followed the great deal-maker around the world picking up
the pieces. However, he shot to prominence when he took over as chairman
following Bond's resignation in September 1990. His job was to calm the
company's creditors, and the anxious Australian regulators, while a
debt-for-equity swap was arranged with bondholders owed more than ADollars
1bn. It was his emollient approach, more than Bond's posturing, which kept
the group afloat long enough for the scheme to be put in place.
His departure removes the last link with Bond Corp's happier days. Bond
himself faces both criminal charges and bankruptcy proceedings, and Peter
Beckwith, his former right-hand man, died two years ago. Lucas's office says
there was 'nothing sinister or sensational' about his departure. He probably
has nothing left to do.
