 

The Government has also created a variety of informational services, such as the Department of Justice's toll-free
ADA Information Line, through which individuals can speak directly with an ADA Specialist or access recorded information
about the requirements of the ADA 24 hours a day. Information about the ADA may also be downloaded through the Department's
Electronic Bulletin Board. Similar services are available through other Federal agencies. 
Despite the existence of these materials, many of which are available free of charge from the Department of Justice
and other Federal agencies, many individuals at the local level are unaware of their availability and continue to
build or alter facilities that do not comply with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. 
The goal of Priority 2 is to develop a nationwide system to inform building contractors, construction tradespeople,
building inspectors and plan reviewers about the ADA and the availability of these informational materials and services
to ensure the dissemination of existing ADA materials to contractors and others at the local level. The project should
utilize existing channels, such as trade organizations, trade publications, meetings, and electronic media to
inform as wide an audience of contractors and others as possible of the availability of the material and to assist with
dissemination. In establishing this system, the project should seek to establish links between existing Federal
information resources and private dissemination channels and implement an approach through which the Department
can continue to disseminate new materials, as they are developed, on an on-going, long-term basis following the conclusion
of the grant period. Types of mechanisms that could be used to accomplish this might include the development of articles
for publication in trade journals, the distribution of sample or resource packets to libraries serving the target
population, the presentation of information about the ADA and the availability of Federal resources and materials,
and making the same available through computer networks and other electronic media. 
Priority 2 is an ADA informational materials dissemination project for building contractors, construction tradespeople
and others at the local, State, and regional level that shall include the following major components: 



_Identify and compile specific materials that have been or are being developed by the Department of Justice, its grant
recipients, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research's grant recipients, the Architectural
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board 
and other Federal agencies as appropriate that the applicant intends to publicize to the populations to be served
by the project; 

_Identify professional and trade organizations serving the targeted population with regional, State and local
affiliations through which information and materials could be disseminated; 
_Identify professional and trade journals and other publications through which the availability of materials can
be publicized at the local, State, and regional level; 
_Establish size of target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of
the project's activities; 
_Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including racial and ethnic minority communities;

_Develop a plan to effectively publicize and disseminate the availability of material available from Federal resources
and their grantees utilizing, to the extent possible, existing dissemination mechanisms for the targeted population
including professional and trade journals, regional and national conferences, etc.; 



Such a plan should ensure that dissemination will continue after the grant period has ended; 



_Develop, reproduce and disseminate marketing materials such as pamphlets, flyers, articles, ad slicks or other
products necessary to inform the targeted population of the availability of ADA materials; 
_Create articles on the requirements of the ADA for publication in media appropriate to target audience; 
_Coordinate with the Department to ensure that future new or updated materials will continue to be disseminated to
the targeted population at the local level following the conclusion of the grant period; 
_Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate
to what degree the project succeeded in meeting its stated objectives and reaching the targeted audience.
