TRAFFIC DEATH PLEA 
Heather Tolles of South Pasadena pleaded not guilty Thursday in South Bay 
Municipal Court to two counts of murder and three other felony charges stemming 
from a May 5 traffic collision in Manhattan Beach that killed a pregnant woman. 
Tolles, 19, is charged with the murder of Laura Obele, 26, and her fetus. 
The Manhattan Beach woman was scheduled to give birth to a baby boy three weeks 
after the accident. 
Tolles, who was allegedly under the influence of LSD, is also charged with 
vehicular manslaughter, driving under the influence of drugs and evading a 
police officer. 
She is scheduled to face a preliminary hearing June 12 in South Bay Municipal 
Court. 
Police say Tolles and a friend took LSD outside a Saturday afternoon Grateful 
Dead concert at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, then drove through 
Manhattan Beach. Tolles allegedly ran a red light while driving north on 
Highland Avenue and collided with Obele, who was driving east on Manhattan 
Beach Boulevard, just four blocks from her apartment.
