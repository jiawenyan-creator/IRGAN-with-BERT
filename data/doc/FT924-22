FT  31 DEC 92 / International Company News: Ames out of bankruptcy
AMES Department Stores, the troubled general merchandise retailer based in
Connecticut, has emerged from bankruptcy.
The company, which filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the US Bankruptcy Code in April 1990, had a reorganisation plan approved
by the courts earlier this month, and its formal emergence from corporate
purgatory means Ames shares will trade once more - this time, on the NASDAQ
over-the-counter market.
Ames problems stemmed mainly from its ambitious Dollars 800m purchase of the
Zayre discount stores in 1988. These stores made significant losses and Ames
was unable to make payments on the debt assumed to buy the Zayre business.
While operating under Chapter 11, Ames reduced its stores network to around
370, from 678. But it was still making losses when it reported third-quarter
results this month.
