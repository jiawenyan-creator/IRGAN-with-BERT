FT  20 OCT 94 / Rwanda minister arrest call
A Rwandan official said in New York last night his government proposed to
ask French authorities to detain Mr Jean-Marie Ndagijimana, Rwanda's foreign
minister. Mr Claude Dusaidi, director-general of the foreign ministry, said
he was informed Mr Ndagijimana had turned up in Paris, after disappearing
from his New York hotel 10 days ago. In Paris, Mr Ndagijimana denied
allegations that he had disappeared with funds intended for Rwanda's UN
mission. In a statement faxed to Reuters news agency, he said he was on a
private visit authorised by Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu. He claimed
'some Rwandan leaders are trying to push me towards the exit', for his
political stand, including his call to release thousands jailed for genocide
without proof.
