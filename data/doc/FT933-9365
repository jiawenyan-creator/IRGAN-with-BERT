FT  10 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: RTZ
RTZ's sale of a stake in the Lihir gold project to a little-known company at
a meagre price is curious. It may indeed be technically difficult to extract
gold from a volcanic island and politically awkward to cater to the demands
of Papua New Guinea's government. But Lihir remains one of the biggest known
gold reserves in the world. Moreover, it is hard to see what the new partner
brings to the party other than some scarcely-needed cash to help RTZ fund
the next stage and an added degree of complexity. Still, such concerns are
too peripheral to undermine RTZ's share price progress more than
momentarily.
