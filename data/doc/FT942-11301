FT  06 MAY 94 / Slow start made to energy saving
Government departments have made a slow start in meeting targets for energy
saving, says a report by the National Audit Office published yesterday.
On average, departments will need to save energy at the rate of 5 per cent a
year to meet their targets of saving 15 per cent of energy use during the
five years ending 1995-96, the NAO said.
The report also comments that while some 600,000 low-income households have
benefited from the government's Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, more than
three-quarters have used the benefits to improve 'warmth and comfort', and
that overall savings in energy will be limited.
