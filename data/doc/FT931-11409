FT  03 FEB 93 / UN stops travel near Jalalabad
THE United Nations yesterday suspended road travel for its staff between
northern Pakistan and the city of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan, after
four of its staff members were killed on Monday in an ambush by unknown
gunmen.
The road provides the most important land link for transportation of relief
goods from Pakistan to the Afghan capital, Kabul.
Rival groups of mujahideen tribesmen have recently exchanged fire to gain
control of the road, western diplomats and officials say.
The bodies of two of the UN's international staff members were brought to
Islamabad yesterday to be flown to their home countries.
