FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: New with-profit bond
Scottish Provident has launched a with-profits bond. It aims to avoid the
biggest drawback of these bonds, which is the freedom which offices allow
themselves to make downward 'market value adjustments' if market conditions
are bad when an investor encashes the bond.
Scottish Provident has guaranteed not to apply an MVA in any of the
following circumstances: on the death of the bondholder, or when drawing an
income of 7.5 per cent or less, or when withdrawing money on the fifth
anniversary of the bond. This also applies on each subsequent fifth
anniversary.
The rates being offered are slightly lower than those elsewhere. There is a
guaranteed bonus of 3 per cent annually, with a reversionary bonus on top,
currently 6.25 per cent, making a growth rate of 9.25 per cent. The
bid/offer spread is 5 per cent.
