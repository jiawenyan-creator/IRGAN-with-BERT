THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA 
Stephen Westfall, New York art critic, author and artist, has curated a show of 
New York sculpture called "The Milky Way." Gallery literature says, "this name 
conjures qualities of luminosity, cosmology, eroticism, delicacy and good 
humor." The idea is that these sculptures occupy that limbo land preserved for 
the Surrealist object: things of this world but not quite in the world. The 
artists appropriate or manipulate the everyday, jostling traditional 
associations and contexts so that objects become something new, strange and, in 
those works that hit their mark, intensely provocative. 
Timed to coincide with "The Dada and Surrealist Word-Image" at the County 
Museum of Art, Westfall's show implies a connective link between Dada 
progenitors and contemporary Surrealism. Sick of war's brutality, Dada's 
currency was the irrational, absurd and anarchistic. Later Surrealists cast off 
social and political aspects of Dada, fixing on the absence of reason in the 
subconscious where sex, mystery, violence and personal poetry prevail. The 
works in "Milky Way" mix and match both traditions. 
Duchampian spoofs nuanced with commentary about the foibles of the real world 
and the art world can be found in Lindsay Walt's wall-bound spinoffs of mute 
domestic bric-a-brac, in James Thomas' industrial metal gizmos with no function 
whatsoever, in Dan Devine's concrete slabs with machine parts embedded in them. 
Andrew Masullo's glass boxes holding old photos and loose metal letters invite 
you to pick them up, shake them like children's toys, and a final small group 
pulls in the lyrical side of Surrealism. 
Nancy Shaver assembles an aged found picture frame beside a statuette of a bird 
and nothing happens, while Bill Barrette's sensual, remarkably allusive 
construction and Patrice Caire's strange cast objects all but carry the show 
with their resonant readings. (Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 1454 5th St., to Sept.
