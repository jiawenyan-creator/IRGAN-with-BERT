FT  10 MAR 93 / Lottery may cost Pounds 500m
THE COST of setting up the UK's national lottery, the biggest in the world
so far, could be around Pounds 500m, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The scale of the project was set out yesterday by Mr Craig Watson, a
vice-president of GTEC, the US company which claims more than a 70 per cent
share of the world market for computerised lottery systems.
Mr Watson believes that many people in the UK have not yet realised the full
extent of the business opportunities that will arise from the setting up of
the lottery.
The computerised operating system which is likely to have something in the
region of 20,000 terminals to check and verify both details of purchase and
individual numbers could cost between Pounds 100m and Pounds 200m, Mr Watson
believes.
