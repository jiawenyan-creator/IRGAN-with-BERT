FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television
All the television companies are desperately seeking successful new comedy
sitcoms and most of their efforts in recent years have been, frankly,
desperate. Nice Day at the Office (times vary BBC1), has promising
credentials. It stars Timothy Spall, Anna Massey and John Sessions. But
there seems little confidence that this contender, with Spall a computer
whiz-kid stuck in the data department of a big corporation, is going to set
the world alight. Panorama (9.30 BBC1) hits a sensitive nerve with a report
into golden handshakes. Why should senior executives, whose only
contribution to a company has been to create losses, walk away with vast
pay-offs while the workers collect their P40s? Financial probity is
something of a theme this evening. World in Action (8.30 ITV) examines
Knight Williams, the retirement specialists, whose affairs have aroused
criticism. Benny Green's cockney burr is not a voice you expect to hear on
Radio 3 - he is pure Radio 2 nostalgia - but he turns up there at 9.30 with
the first of a series on the London music hall, starting with its early
19th-century origins in eating houses.
