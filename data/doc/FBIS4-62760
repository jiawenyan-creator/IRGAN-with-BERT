  [Text] Vladivostok May 18 -- The Pacific Fleet ammunition 
storage facility exploded on May 14 because of irresponsibility 
and negligence in guarding the facility, the local 
counterintelligence service reported, denying earlier rumours 
about an alleged act of subversion and the arrest of a suspect 
whose actions were motivated by pecuniary interests, and search 
for an accomplice. 
  According to Pacific Fleet counter-intelligence sources, a 
guard off duty found a discarded electric device, part of a 
rocket acceleration unit which incorporates a gunpowder charge, 
left unattended on the premises. He took the thing up an began 
to dismantle it with the help of a penknife, with another guard 
off duty watching him do it. The knight slipped and struck the 
charge which ignited on impact. The first guard hurled the 
burning unit aside where last year grass caught the fire at 
once, setting aflame a stack of jet shells. 
  The frightened soldiers fled from the scene without doing 
anything to extinguish the fire or notifying the unit commander 
of the incident. The first explosion followed within minutes. 
  The military prosecutor of the garrison has instituted 
criminal proceedings and the investigation continues.
