'FUTURE III' REIGNS OVER PRESENT-DAY BOX-OFFICE 
In the third installment of the adventures of time-traveling teen Marty McFly, 
the pint-size hero -- played by Michael J. Fox -- winds up in the Old West 
where he puts his sharp-shooting skills (honed on video games) to use against 
villainous varmints. 
At the weekend box office, the diminutive hombre also faced a square-off -- 
against an Apache attack helicopter. 
When the dust had settled, McFly -- and Universal Pictures' "Back to the Future 
III" -- was left standing. 
With ticket sales of nearly $25 million over the four-day Memorial Day Weekend, 
the sequel virtually blasted Touchstone Pictures' latest release, "Fire Birds," 
off the screen. 
Starring Nicolas Cage, Tommy Lee Jones and Sean Young as chopper pilots hunting 
a drug cartel, "Fire Birds" had receipts of about $6.7 million, for fifth place 
at the box office. 
Meanwhile, "Bird on a Wire" proved it had wings. In its second week, the Mel 
Gibson-Goldie Hawn action comedy had ticket sales of an estimated $13 million, 
for the No. 2 spot. The Universal Pictures' title, which was largely critically 
lambasted, has now grossed about $28 million. 
Third place went to Touchstone Pictures' still-formidable "Pretty Woman," which 
had receipts of about $8 million. It has now grossed nearly $120 million. 
In fourth, fueled by the star-power of Robin Williams, was the Orion Pictures' 
comedy, "Cadillac Man," which had ticket sales of about $6.8 million.
