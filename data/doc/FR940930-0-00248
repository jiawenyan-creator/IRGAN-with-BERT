 Final rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) commodity 
laboratory testing programs under the AMS Science Division were 
established in August 1993. In order to implement the testing programs under the new regulations, AMS codified the
agency reorganization of analytical testing services by consolidating and transferring functions from other Title
7 CFR parts related to testing to the AMS Science Division. An interim final rule to amend the regulations was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 10, 1994, and received one comment. The interim final rule provided for reduced laboratory testing fees for
certain dairy products based on various factors such as a decrease in minimum test times for certain products from
one-half hour to one-quarter hour, a decrease in expenditures for making some test preparations, and a decreased
number of procedural steps required for performing certain laboratory analyses. This final rule adopts as final
the interim final rule with one additional fee change.
