  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Relations between Spain and Argentina 
are entering a new phase. They have passed from cooperation and 
solidarity between a richer country -- Spain -- and another in a 
poorer economic condition -- Argentina -- to a trade 
relationship based on exchange between equals. This was made 
clear during the course of the visit that Argentine President 
Carlos Menem is paying to our country, at a time when our 
excellent bilateral relations are clouded by just one problem: 
Iberia's negotiations with Aerolineas Argentinas -- a report 
from Martin Meden. 
  [Begin Meden recording] Felipe Gonzalez recalled that in 
1989 
he backed the future of Argentina by recommending investment 
there, and today he congratulated President Menem on what he 
considers the success of his country. Argentina and Spain, 
Menem and Gonzalez agreed, are now on the same political and 
economic level, thereby favoring the European Union's 
understanding of the process of Latin America's integration with 
the United States. Gonzalez said that Spain supports the 
diplomatic and peaceful claim of Argentine sovereignty over the 
Malvinas [Falkland] Islands. [end recording] [passage omitted]
