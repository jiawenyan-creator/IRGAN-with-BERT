In 25 carries, Odoardi gained 124 of Century's 151 rushing yards. He completed

passing in the first half. The Eagles finished with 119 yards rushing and 94 
yards passing.

scored from the Centurions' 48 in the third quarter. 
Century scored the winning touchdown 11 plays later on Juan Garcia's one-yard 
run with 3:43 remaining in the third quarter. Garcia also recovered an Estancia
