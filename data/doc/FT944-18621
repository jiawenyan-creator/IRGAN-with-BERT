FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts (Openings): London Coliseum
Ever since Chaliapin first sang the role, every operatic bass has wanted to
play Don Quixote. On Saturday, for its second production of the season,
English National Opera brings Massenet's 'Don Quichotte' to London for the
first time since 1912. A popular story, plus a subtle blend of comedy and
sentiment, has made this opera one of the composer's most enduring
successes. The producer at ENO is Ian Judge and the conductor Emmanuel Joel,
with Richard Van Allan tilting at the windmills in the title-role.
