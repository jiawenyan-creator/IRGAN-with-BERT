FT  18 MAY 92 / S Korean challenger drops out
MR Kim Young Sam yesterday appeared assured of winning the presidential
nomination of South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP) after his
only challenger within the party dropped out of the race.
Mr Lee Jong-Chan, an MP from Seoul, said he was withdrawing from the
nomination race prior to the DLP convention because of pressure being
exerted on delegates by senior party officials to support Mr Kim.
The charges by Mr Lee are likely to damage the image of the DLP, which had
promised that this year's convention would be the first to allow delegates
to choose the presidential nominee freely.
Mr Kim Dae-Jung, of the main opposition Democratic party, and Mr Chung
Ju-yung, founder of the Korean business group Hyundai and head of the
Unification National party, are Mr Kim's likely opponents in the
presidential election.
