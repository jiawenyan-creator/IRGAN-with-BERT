<F P=106> [Interview with Fausto Garcia by correspondent Julio Gomez </F>
Yusia at Jose Marti International Airport -- live] 
  [Text] [Gomez] The meeting of the Confederation of Latin 
American Tourism Organizations, COTAL, recently concluded in 
Madrid. Fausto Garcia, secretary of the Cuban Tour Operators 
Association, was our representative in the meeting. 
  [Garcia] I just returned to Cuba. I come from the COTAL 
congress in Madrid, where Cuba's membership request was 
contained in point number 14 of the COTAL congress agenda. This 
is an important issue for Cuba, given our ongoing tourism 
development. For years, we had been unsuccessful in trying to 
become members of COTAL, until now. In the congress held in 
Madrid, Cuba achieved a resounding victory, with 14 countries in 
favor, one opposed, and one abstention. 
  [Gomez] This is important. Now you know: Cuba belongs to 
COTAL, as Fausto Garcia just announced to the Exclusivo program 
of Radio Rebelde.
