further flight, either accomplish the applicable terminating modification in accordance 
with paragraph (d) or (e) of this AD, or repair in accordance with a method approved by 
the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane 
Directorate.

 Detection of any discrepancy, other than cracking, necessitates 
appropriate corrective action in accordance with the provisions of part 43 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 43). 




(d) Prior to reaching the incorporation thresholds listed in either Table 2.1 [for 
Model DC910, -20, -30, -40, -50, and C9 (military) series airplanes], or Table 2.2 [for
