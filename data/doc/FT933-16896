FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier buys French publisher
REED ELSEVIER, the international publishing group, has acquired more than 96
per cent of Editions Techniques, the largest general publisher in France, in
a deal worth Pounds 77m.
In May the company announced an agreement under which it would have at least
a controlling interest.
Editions Techniques publishes Juris Classeurs and La Semaine Juridique and
the acquisition is part of Reed Elsevier's strategy to extend its
professional publishing interests in continental Europe.
Apart from owning a leading medical publication, Encyclopedie Medico
Chirurgicale, Editions Techniques holds a controlling interest in Jurisdata,
the legal database company, and a 40 per cent stake in Litec, the legal book
publishing company.
Mr Herman Bruggink, director of legal and medical publishing worldwide for
Reed Elsevier, will become chairman of Editions Techniques from July 2.
Mr Bruggink said yesterday: 'We are creating a powerful European base for
our legal publishing businesses by acquiring Editions Techniques.'
Together with Butterworths, Reed Elsevier's UK legal publisher, further
European expansion is planned.
The merged Anglo-Dutch group, owned by Reed International and Elsevier, is
also pushing ahead with its planned Dollars 425m (Pounds 283m) purchase of
Official Airline Guides from Price Waterhouse, the joint administrator of
Maxwell Communication Corporation.
