DRIVING HOME NEED FOR ALTERNATIVES TO CARS 
Many thanks for Connie Koenenn's inspiring story on people choosing to give up 
their cars for more sustainable and healthful modes of transportation 
("Shifting Gears," June 19). 
I tell folks quite regularly that switching to sustainable (non-fossil-fueled) 
transportation is going to be one of our next big movements for social and 
environmental change. 
Usually, people just laugh at that. After all, we are the car-consuming capital 
of the world. 
I'm pleased that now I'll have something in print proving that lots of ordinary 
folks are making the extraordinary choice simply to do what's sensible for 
personal and planetary health.
