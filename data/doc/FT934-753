FT  23 DEC 93 / ITC to allow lottery adverts
The Independent Television Commission has cleared the way for television
advertising for the National Lottery - something that would be prevented
under present rules.
Programmes designed as promotional vehicles for the lottery will not be
allowed and codes forbidding 'undue prominence' of goods and services will
remain. But the commission says it will be possible to incorporate a lottery
draw in 'suitable programming'.
