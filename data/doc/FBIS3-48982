  [Excerpts] Bihac, 2 January (TANJUG) -- Inter-Muslim 
clashes in Cazinska Krajina continued today along all 
demarcation lines, but were of somewhat less intensity than over 
the past few days, local Muslim information media report. 
  Muslim radio in Bihac reports that forces of the army of the 
autonomous province of Western Bosnia were in action today, 
using light weapons along demarcation lines in the immediate 
vicinity of Cazin; no mention was made of the killed or injured. 
The same source adds that during the day there were also 
clashes near Todorovo, Sturlic, and Trzacka Rastela. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Muslim media in the Bihac area report that there is real 
chaos in Bihac itself. Clashes between Izetbegovic's Muslims 
and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] are still going on, and 
relations between the HVO, commanded by Major General Vlado 
Santic, who is otherwise a follower of Fikret Abdic, and the 
Croatian Democratic Community, led by Dr. Ante Santic, are 
increasingly tense. The most distinguished people on the 
opposing sides are being liquidated in the town. There are an 
increasing number of incidents of shots being fired from light 
weapons and the town reverberates with the noise of explosions.
