FT  15 DEC 94 / Delays on defence projects attacked
About 80 per cent of important defence equipment projects are running behind
schedule and there are 'large cost overruns' on a significant number of
projects, the Commons public accounts committee said yesterday.
The date by which the projects were due to be in-service had slipped by 32
months on average, according to a committee report.
It added that the bill for the Eurofighter 2000 programme had spiralled to
slightly less than Pounds 1bn. The MPs warned that a cost overrun on any
project entailed cuts elsewhere in the programme.
They also expressed concern at a National Audit Office report on five
'mid-life update projects' by which equipment is modernised. All five missed
deadlines or ran over budget.
More than Pounds 500,000 has been spent on regimental swords, it was
disclosed yesterday. There have been 560 new swords bought in the past five
years at a cost of Pounds 365,700, and 576 swords have been 'refurbished' at
a cost of Pounds 156,700.
