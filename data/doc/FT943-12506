FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): The Lyric
Josette Simon takes the title role in Ibsen's 'The Lady from the Sea'. This
role, played by actresses from Duse to Vanessa Redgrave, is one of Ibsen's
most probing studies of femininity: a woman frigid within marriage, haunted
by the terrifying claims of a past lover, unable to give herself to the
husband she loves. The production comes to the Lyric, Hammersmith, from the
West Yorkshire Playhouse.
