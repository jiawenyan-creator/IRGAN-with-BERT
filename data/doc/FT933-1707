FT  22 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Opposing influences on
Daimler, VW
CONFLICTING influences on the automotive and banking sectors, and Nordic
worries over currencies and interest rates gave bourses a lively day, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose again as professionals shook their heads over its source of
strength - a three-day gain of 9.1 per cent in Daimler, which put on another
DM20.70 to DM766.70.
The DAX index climbed over a 7.2 per cent rise in August M3 money supply to
close 13.01 higher at 1,925.85. Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.4bn but Mr
Jurgen Rossa, at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that there would have been
little volume to speak of over the past three days if Daimler, Deutsche Bank
and Siemens had been excluded.
With Daimler, due to make its New York stock exchange debut on October 5,
there was a suspicion of window-dressing ahead of the event. Later in the
day, the sector was troubled by a further fall in August new car
registrations; and Volkswagen, up DM2 to DM360.50 on the official session,
dropped DM3 to DM357.50 in the post-bourse as Standard &amp; Poors put VW debt
on its watch list.
In the broad market, the aggression behind the Daimler share price was not
matched elsewhere. Siemens was just DM1.60 higher at DM663 and Deutsche Bank
was flat at DM787.50 in a bank sector studiously neutral apart from Dresder,
up DM4.80 to DM418.80 with a press conference on yesterday's schedule.
However, the defensive qualities of utilities brought out analytical support
which left Veba and Viag up by DM6.30 to DM424.80, and by DM6 to DM448
respectively.
PARIS reacted calmly to results from Michelin which reported a first half
loss of some FFr3bn, mainly due to the inclusion of restructuring
provisions. The results were more or less in line with brokers' forecasts
and the shares slipped FFr2.40 to FFr174.90.
The CAC-40 index drifted down 12.97 to 2,094.39.
Mr Eric Michelis of Kleinwort Benson in Paris commented that Michelin was
likely to improve in 1994-1995 as the expected recovery in the car sector
came through, and he maintained a hold recommendation on the stock.
Elsewhere in the sector, Valeo, the components manufacturer, added FFr8 to
FFr1,064 and Peugeot rose FFr6 to FFr652.
Eridania Beghin-Say was quoted FFr2 higher at FFr798 by the close:
afterwards representatives of Ferruzzi Finanziaria and Montedison said that
restructuring plans at Ferruzzi did not include the sale its majority stake
in the French group.
ZURICH moved higher, bolstered by bank stocks, on the view that the
continuing strength of the Swiss franc, particularly against the D-Mark, had
increased the likelihood that interest rates will continue to edge lower.
The SMI index rose 13.4 to 2.431.8.
UBS rose SFr18 to SFr1,198 and CS Holding by SFr40 to SFr2,895. Insurers
were also sought with Zurich Insurance SFr23 ahead at SFr1,225.
Bearer shares in SMH, the watchmaker, rose SFr17 toSFr1,107 in active trade
following a presentation to analysts by the company.
AMSTERDAM retreated slightly while the budget details failed to excite
interest. The government said that it was abandoning its target for cutting
the budget deficit because of slower economic growth and rising
unemployment. It also forecast that GDP growth this year would be flat, but
should return to 1 per cent growth in 1994. Some analysts commented that the
announcement of greater infrastructure spending was in line with
expectations, but noted that the medium term economic outlook remained
depressed.
The CBS Tendency index closed 0.9 lower at 124.5.
Among the risers Unilever advanced Fl 1.30 to Fl 200.60, Elsevier 70 cents
to Fl 139.40 and KLM 40 cents to Fl 36.40.
KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, surprised analysts with its
announcement of a rights issue to lift its stake in Austrian paper group,
Leykam, to 90 per cent. The shares lost 90 cents to Fl 34.30, but off the
day's low of Fl 33.30.
STOCKHOLM extended Monday's losses on further weakness in the currency and
higher domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 16.7 or
1.3 per cent to 1,245.4. Turnover improved to SKr1.1bn from SKr827m.
Ericsson, the telecommunications stock, resisted the trend with a gain of
SKr2 to SKr410, helped by a rise in the US. Elsewhere, banks bore some of
the steepest declines on currency weakness, S-E Banken A falling SKr4 to
SKr42, and Svenska Handelsbanken A slipping SKr3 to SKr93.5.
OSLO shared Stockholm's currrency and interest rate problems, threw in
weaker prices for North Sea oil and came to a similar conclusion, the
all-share index falling 6.30 to 551.39.
MILAN moved ahead although trading remained thin as the Comit index rose
6.69 to 597.54. Unofficial data showing a small, unexpected decline in
inflation helped the mood.
Fiat added L150 to L6,004, while speculative demand took Olivetti L65 or 3.5
per cent higher to L1,925, ahead of results soon from both groups.
