  [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (XINHUA) -- In analyzing our 
country's industrial economic efficiency last year, the State 
Statistical Bureau, the State Planning Commission, and the State 
Economic and Trade Commission recently drew the following 
conclusion: By and large, our country's industrial economic 
development still relies on extensive management, and the 
improvement in industrial economic efficiency is conspicuously 
characterized by "growth-based efficiency." In the new year, we 
should pay greater attention to improving the inherent quality 
of industrial economic operations while taking care to maintain 
moderate industrial growth in the economy. 
  Based on the analysis, it is not difficult to discern from 
the statistics that last year's industrial economic efficiency 
largely stemmed from an expanded production scale, more 
extensive management, and price increases. The general level of 
industrial economic efficiency remained low, with uneven 
development in different regions. These are the apparent 
factors leading to the difficulty in improving industrial 
economic efficiency: Additional factors behind increased 
expenses and reduced profits which were difficult for 
enterprises to absorb, heavy losses incurred by some 
enterprises, and excessive funds tied up by finished products in 
enterprises. More profound problems were the irrational 
industrial structure, poor efficiency in the distribution of 
resources, and the failure by industrial enterprises to change 
their operating mechanisms to keep pace with the market economy. 
Given the current general balance in total supply and demand, 
the irrational industrial structure is especially prominent and 
has a profound impact on the improvement of the general level of 
industrial economic efficiency. The main cause of this 
situation is the scramble among some localities in recent years 
to make investments and to start, indiscriminately arrange, and 
duplicate projects against the backdrop of an irrational 
investment structure and the diversity of the main sources of 
profits. 
  With regard to this year's industrial economic development, 
the three organs admonished all localities and industrial 
enterprises to truly shift the focus and basis of their economic 
work to the central path of improving economic efficiency; to 
abandon the traditional practice of chronically relying merely 
on increased investment, an expanded production scale, and 
extensive management; to accelerate industrial restructuring; to 
effect a genuine shift in industrial economic development from 
extensive management based on growth rates to intensive 
management based on efficiency; and to realize sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development in the industrial sector of the economy.
