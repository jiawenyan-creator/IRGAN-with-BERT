  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Land prices in Japan were 
continuing to fall as of January 1 due to Japan's prolonged 
economic slump, the National Land Agency said in a survey 
released Tuesday [8 February]. 
  The agency made a spot survey on 849 sites in residential 
and 
commercial districts of both big and smaller cities, including 
Japan's major centers of Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka. The survey is 
conducted once every three months. 
  Of 522 residential tracts, prices on 88 were down 
substantially, an increase from the 81 recorded in the previous 
three-month-period survey, while prices on 163 fell slightly, 
down from 139, and prices on 264 remained flat, up from 258. 
  Prices fell across the board on the 327 commercial sites.
