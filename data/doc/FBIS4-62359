  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG", "HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN" 
dailies), 05/13/94 -- Russian President's Special Envoy 
Kazimirov visited Baku, presented the Russian project of 
resolving the Karabakh conflict and met the journalists. The 
meeting was probably organized in order to respond to the Azeri 
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov's criticism regarding the new 
Russian project. 
  Gasanov disagreed with the Russian plan saying that after 
its 
implementation Azerbaijan will loose the control over military 
units in Karabakh. Kazimirov responded to this declaration with 
a rhetorical question: "Is Azerbaijan able to control the 
military operations in Karabakh?" 
  Kazimirov stressed, several countries are hindering the 
implementation of the Russian peace plan. 
  Yesterday evening Kazimirov and the CSCE Minsk group 
Chairman 
Jan Eliasson arrived from Baku to Yerevan. They were planning 
to leave for Stepanakert today. 
  RA [Republic of Armenia] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
accepted V. Kazimirov, J. Eliasson and Minsk Group's deputy 
chairman M. Mosberg on 13 May and discussed the problems in 
establishing a cease-fire in the conflict zone. 
  RA Minister of Foreign Affairs Vahan Papazyan, Special Envoy 
of the RA President David Shakhnazaryan, First Deputy Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Jirayr Liparityan participated in the meeting.
