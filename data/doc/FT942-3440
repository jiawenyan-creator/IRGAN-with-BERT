FT  15 JUN 94 / New union federation chief
Germany's Federation of Trade Unions (DGB), under which the country's 16
unions are grouped, at its congress yesterday elected Mr Dieter Schulte as
its new chairman in a move likely to usher in gradual reforms throughout the
labour movement. Although Mr Schulte, 54, comes from the ranks of IG Metall,
Germany's powerful engineering union, and the largest in the DGB, he is not
expected to push the unions towards open confrontation with the government
over its policies on unemployment.
Mr Schulte, considered a pragmatist, will have to decide how the DGB's 11m
members reconcile themselves with the slow shift away from centralised wage
bargaining to more power being devolved to the works councils in separate
enterprises. Of growing concern for the congress, which ends on Friday, is
how it might respond to the consistent decline in union membership.
