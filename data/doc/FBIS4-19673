  [Excerpt] Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis, National 
Guard Commander Lieutenant General Nikolaos Vorvolakos as well 
as other officials and National Guard officers will pay an 
important exploratory visit to Russia right after Easter. 
  According to our information, the visit by the Defense 
Ministry political leadership and the National Guard General 
Staff military leaders falls within the framework of checking 
out sources for the military strengthening of the National Guard. 
  The same sources also place the visit to Russia within the 
current government's efforts to purchase better weapons systems 
and other materiel for Cyprus' defense at the lowest possible 
prices now that the Government has decided to cease dealing with 
the French company SOFMA [French Weapons Equipment Company]. 
  It is further noted that the Cypriot side will primarily 
focus on gathering information. This will not be limited to 
some specific weapons which the National Guard has in mind, but 
will also cover the technical support to be given in the event 
there are some purchases. 
  We should also note that Russia and some other countries of 
the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc have informed the 
government that they would agree to payment through offset 
trade, that is, payment with Cypriot products. [passage omitted]
