FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
WITH most New York markets closed for Columbus Day, derivatives were left
firing on very few cylinders as the market missed the driving force of US
buying, Christine Buckley writes.
As the influx of US money has formed such an important part of recent
trading for FT-SE 100 futures, the December contract yesterday found itself
with few friends. Largely deserted by domestic institutional investors, it
opened shakily and fell victim to a period of mid-morning selling.
But, considering the small volume, the downward movement was felt to be more
of a drift than a positive judgment on the value of the contract.
The UK's trade deficit figures had some impact on market sentiment but the
slide was well under way by the time of their publication.
December traded within a 25 point range with its day's high at 3,145 and the
low at 3,120, with the latter mark emerging as a support level.
At the close, the contract was 3,128 - 7 points ahead of the fair value
premium to the cash market, although much of the day's trading had been on a
par with fair value.
Activity in traded options was moderate and at 29,658 lots was only slightly
down on the previous session's levels. The heaviest traded of the stock
options was Land Securities - a reflection of the positive sentiment moving
through the cash market for property stocks.
