ACTION:

 Notice of intent. BPA announces its intention to sign a billing credits generation agreement for the Wauna Cogeneration
Project located in Clatskanie, Oregon. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 BPA has previously signed other Billing Credits Generation Agreements, in addition to the contract described in
this Notice. The Wauna Cogeneration Project is located at the James River Wauna Oregon mill. The size of the Project
is based on thermally matching the mill's steam needs for the pulp and paper making process. The generator will have
an approximate nameplate rating of 36 megawatts. The incremental fuel used for electrical generation is natural
gas. The backpressure turbine installation will augment existing pressure reducing valves. The expected annual
energy production is estimated at 26.4 average megawatts beginning in January 1996. The Project will be interconnected
to the mill electrical system at 13.8 KV. 



BPA, pursuant to its Billing Credits Policy, as amended August 30, 1984, (49 FR 34395), and revised on January 29, 1993,
(58 FR 37918) has negotiated this Billing Credits Generation Agreement with Eugene Water and Electric Board (EWEB)
for the Wauna Cogeneration Project. 



Responsible Official:

 Mr. George Bell, Lower Columbia Area Office, is the official responsible for EWEB's Billing Credits contract and
the Administrative Record.

<DATE>
DATES:

 BPA will receive comments on the proposed Billing Credits Generation Agreement for 30 days, after which time BPA may
