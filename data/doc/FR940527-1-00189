 

Other significant changes that have not been isolated in the previous columns include the following:

&bull;A 1.1 percent higher level of outlier payments is estimated for FY 1995.

&bull;The increase in the DSH formula for FY 1995 results in approximately a 0.1 percent increase in total payments.

&bull;The effect of eliminating the MDH provision is a 3.1 percent decline in payments for this group of hospitals,
and a 0.2 percent decline for rural hospitals. The impact on total payments is essentially zero.

As a geographic group, hospitals in rural areas experience the largest payment increase, a 3.8 percent rise in payments
per case over FY 1994. The increase in estimated outlier payments over FY 1994 for rural hospitals is 0.4 percent, below
the 1.1 percent difference for all hospitals. As we noted in the discussion of Column 5, eliminating the rural amount
would be expected to reduce the numbers and effects of geographic reclassification. While the number of FY 1995 reclassifications
does not appear to have fallen, however, the payment effects are less than they would have been without eliminating
the rural amount. One sees this effect in Column 7 when examing the rows containing rural hospitals reclassified during
both FY 1994 and FY 1995 and rural hospitals reclassified during FY 1994 only. The 295 hospitals in the former category
experience an overall increase of 2.7 percent, closer to that of urban hospitals, and the 149 hospitals in the latter
category experience a 3.6 percent decline in payments per case.

Hospitals in large and other urban areas experience 2.9 percent and 3.0 percent increases, respectively. Urban hospitals
are affected the most by the change in outlier payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995, a 1.2 percent increase. They also receive
the bulk of the increase in DSH payments, a 0.1 percent increase. Urban hospitals receive a net increase due to FY 1995
geographic reclassifications relative to FY 1994 reclassifications. Again, examining the rows grouping hospitals
by their reclassification status for FY 1994 and FY 1995, urban hospitals reclassified for both years have payment
increases above those of rural hospitals, and urban hospitals reclassified for FY 1994 but not FY 1995 do not lose as
much as rural hospitals.

Among urban bed size groups, Column 7 shows changes in payments ranging from 2.4 percent for the smallest hospitals
to 3.4 percent for the largest hospitals. The relatively smaller increases for the smaller urban hospitals appears
to be due to the negative impacts of the new wage data, as shown in Column 3. Larger urban hospitals appear to benefit
from the large increase due to geographic reclassifications in FY 1995 for 4 hospitals that were not reclassified
in FY 1994.

The reverse occurs for rural hospitals. Among the smallest rural hospitals (fewer than 50 beds), the effects of changes
in reclassification from FY 1994 to FY 1995 are negated by similar numbers of hospitals gaining and losing reclassification
from one year to the next. The payment changes for larger rural hospitals are smaller primarily because they do not
benefit to the same extent from the elimination of the rural standardized amount. They do, however, tend to benefit
from geographic reclassification in FY 1995 compared to FY 1994.
