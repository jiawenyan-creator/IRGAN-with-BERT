FT  15 JAN 92 / US legal actions against PPI
THREE SEPARATE US legal actions against directors and auditors of Polly Peck
International have emerged, adding a further twist to the complex legal
disputes already surrounding the collapsed fruit and electronics group.
'We want the money we paid back plus damages,' said Mr Walton Bade, a lawyer
acting for Lindner Fund, a Louisiana mutual fund which lost Dollars 7m
(Pounds 3.9m) on investments in the group.
Mr Bade said that if successful, his action might have a direct bearing on
Polly Peck's main US asset, PPI Del Monte, the pineapple export business
bought by Polly Peck in 1989 and which the administrators are planning to
float on the New York Stock Exchange this year to raise funds to pay
creditors.
Lindner has brought actions against all the directors of Polly Peck
International and its auditors, under two separate sections of the US
Securities Act covering fraud and the filing of false or misleading reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is claiming punitive
damages.
Lindner Fund has also launched personal bankruptcy proceedings against Mr
Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, in a New York federal court. Mr
Nadir was declared bankrupt in the UK two months ago.
The Lindner action is not the first to be brought in the US. Last May,
Stull, Stull &amp; Brody, a New York law firm, launched a class action against
Mr Nadir and the company on behalf of other US shareholders.
In London yesterday the central bank of the internationally unrecognised
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus lost a High Court application to get a
freezing order on its assets relaxed to allow it to withdraw funds from
deposits held in the UK. The bank is one of seven defendants in an action
brought by the administrators of Polly Peck to recover company funds. Five
defendants, including the bank, have been served a freezing order on their
assets.
