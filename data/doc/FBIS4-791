  [Text] The Burundi Government is satisfied with the 
peaceful and dignified way the burial ceremonies for President 
Ntaryamira were carried out. In a communique issued 17 April, 
the government declares the following: A day after the funeral 
ceremonies of President Cyprien Ntaryamira, the Burundi 
Government once again thanks and hails the Burundi people for 
the good behavior, wisdom, and dignity they showed during the 
national mourning ceremony in honor of the late president of the 
Republic and Ministers Bernard Ciza and Cyriaque Ciza. 
  Burundi welcomes Burundians who took refuge in Rwanda and 
who 
are returning en masse, and it takes this opportunity to invite 
them to join other citizens with a view to strengthening peace 
and to take part in the country's reconstruction in a spirit of 
tolerance and reconciliation. 
  To the Rwandan people faced with the civil war, the Burundi 
Government reiterates the calls it made on the day of the 
funeral and on previous days, notably the call of 12 April which 
urged them to follow the path of dialogue. The Burundi 
Government once again calls on Rwandan brothers at war to lay 
down their arms. Burundi urges them to come together so that, 
through frank dialogue, they end the war immediately. The 
Burundi Government assures the Rwandan people, that in 
connection with the political crisis being experienced by 
Rwanda, Burundi observes and will continue to observe strict 
neutrality. It assures Rwanda, in particular, that no 
aggression against Rwanda will be perpetrated from Burundi 
territory.
