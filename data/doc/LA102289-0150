WAGE HIKE FOR TRANSIT DISTRICT MECHANICS 
How interesting to learn about the generous 12% wage boost afforded the 
mechanics and service workers at Orange County Transit District (Oct. 17) 
through auspices of the Teamsters Union. 
While the Teamsters are not yet in power as a representative of OCTD, they have 
negotiated a contract by simply ignoring the United Transportation Union, which 
is currently the bargaining agent with some months remaining on its contract. 
What is even more difficult to understand is the clause in this new contract 
that calls for pay bonuses for employees who meet attendance and productivity 
goals. 
Once again the OCTD management shows us how it "manages" the bottomless pit of 
money that taxpayers continue to throw at it. Strange as it may seem, I always 
felt that it was up to the management to see to it that the employees showed up 
at the job every day, otherwise they are fired. 
And as far as bonuses for productivity goals, again, they either produce as the 
standards require or, again, we fire them. 
I would like to have the OCTD explain the details of this $500 pay bonus plan 
to coerce employees to show up for their jobs and/or to perform to the work 
standards as established.
