MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . . 
The White House on Wednesday formally sent to the Senate the nomination of 
Portland, Ore., lawyer John E. Frohnmayer to be chairman of the beleaguered 
National Endowment for the Arts. Frohnmayer, whose naming to the top arts 
endowment job by President Bush was disclosed in early July, will be subject to 
confirmation hearings before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, 
chaired by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). A Kennedy spokesman said the hearings 
would be held within the next couple of weeks with a confirmation vote in the 
full Senate scheduled by the end of September. ALEENE MacMINN
