FT  23 OCT 93 / BSkyB blocks pirate card sales
BRITISH Sky Broadcasting yesterday won an undertaking from the Irish-based
Satellite Decoder Systems to stop selling its pirate decoder cards in the
UK, John Mason writes.
The undertaking covers all sales and advertising of the cards in the UK and
also requires Mr David Lyons, who controls the company, to disclose the
identity of his supplier to the court within 10 days. Satellite Decoder
Systems made the agreement prior to a High Court hearing at which BSkyB was
seeking an injunction to prevent the marketing of the cards in the UK. BSkyB
said afterwards that it was 'delighted with the outcome'. Pearson, owner of
the FT, has a significant stake in BSkyB.
