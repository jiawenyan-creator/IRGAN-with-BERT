FT  12 JAN 94 / Directors accused of Pounds 2m wine theft
Two directors of London wine dealer Green's stole Pounds 2m of fine wines,
vintage port and champagne being stored for customers, Inner London crown
court heard yesterday.
Mr Joseph Mankowitz and Mr Raymond Burroway, who bought the 207-year-old
company in 1990, engineered a bogus sell-off of the storage part of Green's
operations to cover their tracks, said Mr Paul Dodgson, prosecuting.
Mr Mankowitz, 47, of Earls Court, west London, and Mr Burroway, 52, of
Wandsworth, south-west London, deny conspiring to steal the wine. Mr Anthony
Boylan, 58, of Park Road, Dulwich, south-east London, also denies the
charge. He is alleged to have used a false name to remove some of the wine
from storage.
Mr Dodgson claimed the Crown could prove that Mr Burroway received Pounds
80,000 from the proceeds of the sale of some of the stolen wine. There was
no direct evidence Mr Mankowitz received any money from any sales.
The trial will resume today.
