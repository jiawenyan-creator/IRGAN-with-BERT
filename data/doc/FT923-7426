FT  18 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tentative recovery in
Nikkei as Pacific Rim slides
THE NIKKEI average broke back above 15,000 on early index-related buying
yesterday, but profit-taking subsequently eroded some of the gain, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed a net 109.30 ahead at 14,929.55 after opening at the day's
low of 14,854.58 and rising to a high of 15,122.84 in the morning session.
Advances outscored declines by 709 to 213, with 125 issues unchanged.
Volume, however, dropped to 140m shares from 282m. The Topix index of all
first section stocks gained 9.38 at 1,132.51, but in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 0.46 to 936.15.
Reports that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, had expressed his
'grave determination' to boost the economy triggered bargain hunting and
short-covering by traders. Mr Miyazawa met Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of
the Keidanren business federation, on Saturday to discuss measures to
counter the current economic slowdown.
The meeting, however, did not produce new proposals, and Mr Miyazawa
reiterated plans to implement an economic stimulus package this autumn. He
promised to study ways to reduce the tax burden on property and equity
investments, and to consider the government's purchase of land needed for
state projects.
Activity centred on position adjustment by dealers. Shares which were
previously hit by negative news rebounded on buy-backs. Nippon Housing Loan,
the most active issue of the day, advanced Y22 to Y140. The leading home
loan company faces mounting bad debts, and had been requesting a cut in
interest payments to its creditors. Reports that Nippon Housing Loan's nine
founder banks had agreed to its restructuring programme prompted buying.
High-technology issues gained ground. Toshiba rallied Y19 to Y564, rising
for the first time in eight trading days. Dealers said the issue was seen as
oversold, since it had declined 12 per cent during the previous seven days.
Hitachi appreciated Y7 to Y752 and Fujitsu put on Y5 to Y546. In contrast,
NEC lost Y9 to Y761 on fears that the company may drastically revise down
its annual earnings forecast.
Brokerage houses were weaker on concern ahead of the interim book closing.
The low turnover in the Tokyo stock market is hurting the industry, and most
brokers are expected to post losses for the first half.
Nomura Securities receded Y20 to Y1,210 and Daiwa Securities retreated Y14
to Y696.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 194.38 to 15,964.60 in volume of 10.8m
shares.
Roundup
FEARS of conflict between the US and Iraq were blamed for the relatively
heavy declines in some of the region's markets.
HONG KONG also reflected disappointment with results from domestic blue chip
companies. The Hang Seng index shed 154.74, or 2.7 per cent, to 5,667.85,
its biggest setback this year, in turnover down from HKDollars 4.47bn to
HKDollars 2.26bn.
Banks were among the hardest hit, HSBC and its Hang Seng Bank subsidiary
both sliding HKDollars 2, to HKDollars 51.50 and HKDollars 2 respectively. A
measure of the mood was that Hang Seng's 22 per cent profits rise, reported
last week, was among the 'disappointing' results.
TAIWAN added domestic political struggles to its international worries, with
an investigation into suspected corruption on a construction project
contributing to a fall of 141.90, or 3.6 per cent, to 3,784.48 in the
weighted index.
Turnover rose to TDollars 21.5bn from Saturday's two-hour total of TDollars
14.2bn. Local commentators believed that an investigation into suspected
corruption on a major highway construction project was linked to factional
disagreements within the ruling Nationalist party, and investors feared
instability if a power struggle resulted.
SEOUL's composite index tumbled 16.77, or 3.5 per cent, to 462.13. Continued
speculation on the formation of a new political party, led by the Daewoo
group and some politicians, added to the depressing effect of poor
first-half results and stringent monetary policy.
KUALA LUMPUR extended Friday's 1.7 per cent decline with a drop of 13.69, or
2.4 per cent, to 568.25 in the KLSE composite amid profit-taking.
BANGKOK fell through a strong support point, pressured by concern about a
jump in oil prices and weakness on other regional exchanges. The SET index
lost 8.13 to 756.35 in moderate volume of Bt5.1bn.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index rose 10 points to 1,559.0 in a technical
rebound after four consecutive days of losses. Foster's Brewing rallied 5
cents to ADollars 1.71, after a loss of 17 cents last week which prompted
the Australian Stock Exchange to query the fall.
NEW ZEALAND rallied as a bounce in Fletcher Challenge restored confidence.
The NZSE-40 Index closed 19.75 better at 1,491.06. The forestry and
resources conglomerate jumped 23 cents to NZDollars 2.56.
BOMBAY rose 3.4 per cent on bear-covering and speculative buying, the BSE
index ending 93.90 up at 2,889.08.
