  [Text] Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray says he has invited 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev for immediate talks but 
without "any mediators or bad advisers". In an interview with 
Interfax on Friday, he spoke of being vested with appropriate 
powers to hold such talks and having a constructive position to 
offer. 
  Shakhray denied any knowledge of Moscow's secret plans to 
throw weight behind the Chechen opposition as Dudayev said in a 
recent statement. "In keeping with a Duma resolution and the 
president's instructions to the government, we will negotiate 
with the Chechen government and mainstream political groups 
there", he said. 
  Shakhray, who will lead a Russian delegation in talks with 
Grozny, is to be vested with powers to try to clear the ground 
for a meeting between Presidents Yeltsin and Dudayev, government 
sources in Moscow believe. They also said that Shakhray had 
submitted a draft agreement for benefits to be paid in stages to 
old age pensioners in Chechnya. 
  "Instead of mutual accusations spread through the media, we 
must hold face-to-face talks to try to resolve the conflict", 
Shakhray said.
