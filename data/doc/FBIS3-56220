  [Text] Minsk, 13 Jan -- At a working meeting between 
Colonel General Pavel Kozlovskiy, Belarus defense minister, and 
U.S. Ambassador in Belarus David Swartz, possible ways of 
extending application of the Nunn-Lugar Bill were discussed. 
Under this bill, the United States can provide additional 
finance to Belarus -- which rigorously follows the course toward 
nonnuclear status, in keeping with international treaties on 
confidence-building measures and disarmament in Europe -- to 
compensate for its expenses connected with the reduction of its 
army to the necessary sufficiency level. 
  The cost of destroying excess military equipment is a burden 
currently being borne by the Belarus taxpayers. Any help in 
this area would be more than welcome. Discussion of this 
important issue is expected at the summit meeting when U.S. 
President Bill Clinton visits Minsk.
