FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (16): Network lined up for more severe cuts
 -Railways
Polish Railways (PKP) set great store by their plans to speed up the journey
time between Warsaw and Berlin by 85 minutes in 1997.
'It will be our visiting card,' says an enthusiastic Alexander Janiszewski,
the head of PKP, who is sorely constrained in his modernisation plans by
running losses which have to be covered each year out of the railways'
investment funds.
Seed money for the Ecu487m (Dollars 535m) Warsaw-to-Berlin project has come
from an ECU30m grant provided under the European Union's Phare (aid for
eastern Europe) programme. Further financing is to come from a European
Investment Bank Ecu200m loan which needs only Polish government guarantees
to be completed.
Talks are also advanced on an additional Ecu50m loan from the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development. Only the World Bank has doubts about the
plan which by bringing travel time down to 5 1/2 hours between the two city
centres would reduce the rail journey to within striking distance of
competing with flight time between Warsaw and Berlin.
'The World Bank thinks the project will divert resources from more pressing
needs elsewhere on our system,' Mr Janiszewski admits. But the PKP's overall
plans involve contraction rather than expansion. PKP is cutting lines as
economic changes of the past five years have brought a sharp fall in goods
and passenger traffic. The railways now carry less than half the goods
carried at their peak in 1980 when they moved 480m tonnes, compared with
214m tonnes last year, and carried 1.1bn passengers, compared with 530m in
1993.
Rail management estimates that the country only needs half of its 24,000km
network. Already 1,000km have been taken out of service since 1989 and
another 4,000km are slated for closure. Mr Janiszewski is hoping to hand a
further 3,000km to local governments.
The cut in traffic means that employees are having to be laid off in the
face of resistance led by the Solidarity trade union. Over 80,000 jobs have
been cut on the railways since 1989 leaving a total workforce of 252,000 at
the end of last year. A further 5,000 job losses are planned for this year.
At the beginning of the 1980s the railways employed some 450,000 people.
The cuts are also affecting rolling stock purchases and have hit the great
industrial suppliers - the Pawafag factory in Wroclaw and the Cegielski
works in Poznan. Cegielski has been especially vociferous in demanding that
PKP buy its Z-2 standard passenger cars which are not suited to the
high-speed line planned between Berlin and Warsaw.
The protests have, however, produced a deal with ABB Wagon Union in Berlin
under which Cegielski will co-operate in producing the first 50 modern cars
worth DM130m (Dollars 74m) and will also be handed the technology to produce
subsequent orders. Hermes, the German export credits agency, is financing
the deal which is backed by guarantees from Bank Handlowy and the finance
ministry.
Meanwhile, the factory has won a breathing space as PKP is buying 33 of the
older standard cars Cegielski makes to replace some of its 8,000 or so
existing stock at prices set at below production cost. Pawafag in Wroclaw
can only hope for orders from PKP to the extent of between 10 and five
electric locomotives a year as replacements for the 2,300 in service.
The privatisation ministry thinks that is enough to secure the future of the
factory which has just been put up for sale. Several leading western
companies, including Siemens, GEC Alsthom and ABB Henschel, have indicated
an interest in Pawafag which producedeight electric locomotives last year.
But Mr Janiszewski's priority is maintaining the level of the state budget
subsidy, set at 6,500bn zlotys for 1994.
Last year the subsidy amounted to 6,800bn zlotys which, with costs reaching
53,000bn zlotys and revenues of 44,000bn zlotys, still left a 2,200bn zlotys
deficit. Rail subsidies, he notes, are higher abroad and were they to be
further reduced then passenger services provided by PKP would have to
suffer.
