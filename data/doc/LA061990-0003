WOMEN DRIVERS; 
SAFE SEX 
The old jokes about women drivers have long been stale, but they've kept coming 
nonstop anyway. Now maybe a new survey will at least slow them down. 
Comics years ago would paint vivid pictures of a white-knuckled husband trying 
to teach a wide-eyed wife how to parallel park. In recent years, the jokes have 
become a bit more sophisticated: the smirking remark has been that women should 
be required during driving tests to simulate real driving conditions -- such as 
applying mascara and lipstick in traffic. 
A great woman political leader once said that while women are certainly no 
worse than men, "whether women are better than men I cannot say." Well, women 
now can say they are better when it comes to mastering driving in California. 
A Times analysis of nearly 179,000 California driver records during most of the 
1980s showed that women generally were much safer drivers than men their age. 
Sixteen-year-old girls had a violation rate one-quarter that of boys the same 
age. Although the worst drivers of both sexes tended to be 18-year-olds, it 
took women until only age 23 to arrive at the statewide accident average -- 
while men didn't reach that average level until they were in the age 35-39 
group. 
Could it be that after all this time, we've discovered what it is a woman 
wants? She wants to avoid moving violations and accidents. 
Sorry it's come to down to this, Dr. Freud. But you never had to drive in 
California.
