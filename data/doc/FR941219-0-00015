Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce, plc Spey Series Turbofan Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc Spey series turbofan engines,
that requires a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT)
disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. This amendment is prompted by a report of a stage 7 high pressure compressor
disk found cracked due to corrosion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an HPT or LPT disk burst
due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective February 17, 1995. 


The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of February 17, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc (R-R) Spey series turbofan engines was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1500). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure
turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disks for cracks and corrosion pitting once the disks have completed
at least 40% of their published Group ``A'' cyclic life limits as specified in the applicable overhaul manual. These
disks must be inspected in accordance with the applicable overhaul manual during the engine's next shop visit where
either the HPT or LPT disks are removed after the effective date of this AD. Accomplishment of this inspection will
allow stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks to complete the remainder of their current published cyclic life limits.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with R-R Service Bulletin No. Sp721044, dated
September 1992. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the one comment received. 
The commenter concurs with the AD as proposed. 
In addition, the definition of shop visit has been clarified to eliminate the reference to next scheduled disk inspection
and include next disk removal. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA estimates that it will take no additional work hours per engine to accomplish
the required actions to the HPT's as the inspection is performed during regular turbine overhauls. Approximately
80% of the engines will require an additional 25 work hours of extra access, inspection, and rebuild time to perform
the required LPT inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $189,750. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption
