FT  08 APR 94 / Crimea confrontation looms closer
Tension is rising in Crimea, the Ukrainian region with a Russian majority.
The peninsula's president has sharply attacked Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the
Ukrainian president, and reports in Moscow speak of more Ukrainian troops
being moved into the area, writes John Lloyd.
Mr Yuri Meshkov, elected as head of the Crimean 'state' on a ticket of
closer union with Russia, said in a statement read on TV on Wednesday night
that 'Ukraine is being led by the most dangerous government . . . in
Europe'. An apparently well-sourced report in the Moscow daily, Sevodnya,
yesterday claimed that extra troops and intelligence officers were being
drafted in to bring the strength of Ukrainian divisions there to over
50,000.
