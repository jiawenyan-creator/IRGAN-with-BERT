LOCAL; 
BODY FOUND IN SANTA ANA PARKING LOT 
The partially clad body of an unidentified man who was apparently stabbed to 
death overnight was found this morning in a parking lot of a small Santa Ana 
grocery store, Santa Ana police said. 
The body of the man, described as a Caucasian in his 30s, was discovered by a 
local resident at 6:30 a.m. as he was driving through the rear parking lot of 
the Santa Ana Food Market at 2133 South Main St., Santa Ana police spokeswoman 
Maureen Thomas said. 
"Multiple stab wounds appears to be the cause of death," Thomas said. 
Thomas said investigators were unable to immediately identify the man, who may 
have been a transient. Police officers arriving at the scene were unable to 
find the man's pants and wallet, Thomas said. 
Thomas said it was not known if the man died at the scene or was taken there 
later.
