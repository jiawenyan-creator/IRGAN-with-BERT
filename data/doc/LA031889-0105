COPPER FIRM ACCUSED OF TOXIC WASTE VIOLATIONS 
The government filed suit Friday charging Cerro Copper Products Co. of Sauget, 
Ill., with massive violations of the Clean Water Act in the discharge of toxic 
waste water that allegedly has polluted the Mississippi River. 
An Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman said the maximum penalties 
sought exceed $500 million. 
The Justice Department suit also sought a court injunction to halt the 
discharges. The suit charged that the copper processing facility has flouted 
three EPA regulations, dating from 1984, requiring pre-treatment of its 
discharges of copper, chromium, lead, nickel, zinc and total toxic organics.
