GUIDELINES FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
City and county officials who want to explore affordable rental housing for 
elderly and lower-income residents may find that working with a nonprofit 
housing development corporation like Corporate Fund for Housing (active in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties) is a way to 
build affordable housing. 
Here are some guidelines for officials: 
Do you need such housing? If you have completed a recent housing element or 
housing market study, you have a good source of data on local needs. 
If you have such local resources as surplus city land, community development 
block grant funds, tax increment funds from a redevelopment project, first-loss 
guarantees on a tax-exempt bond issue and/or would be willing to grant 
regulatory concessions to make a project feasible, you may be able to work with 
a nonprofit housing development corporation to produce an affordable housing 
project. 
There are several government programs that facilitate working with local 
nonprofits. Among theses are the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, Nonprofit Tax 
Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds, the Section 8/202 program and California's 
recently passed Propositions 77 and 84. 
If you put local resources into an affordable project or grant a developer 
concessions on parking, zoning, etc. as a trade-off for affordable housing, you 
may be concerned with keeping your units affordable over time. If you have 
older projects that used HUD programs which have subsidies or mortgages that 
are expiring soon, nonprofit ownership may be the way to keep these units 
affordable, according to Fred Kahane of CFH.
