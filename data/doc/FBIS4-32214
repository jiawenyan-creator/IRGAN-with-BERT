Officer"] 
  [Text] Kriva Palanka, 21 Jun -- An officer of the 
Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
Army was "invited" by some Serbian soldiers to come and talk on 
the border near Cupino Brdo, in the district of Kriva Palanka; 
he was then "kept" overnight at the Serbian army headquarters in 
the village of Surlica, on Serbian territory. This was 
unofficially stated by reliable sources in Kriva Palanka. On 
Sunday [19 June] morning the "captured" Macedonian officer was 
allowed to go back to the Macedonian side of the border. 
  The soldiers of the so-called Yugoslav Army who have taken 
over the strategic point of Mount Straza on Macedonian territory 
do not show any intention of leaving it, and in the meantime the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] observers moved their 
headquarters to a safer place than Cupino Brdo -- the village of 
Podrzikonj.
