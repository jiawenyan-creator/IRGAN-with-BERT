  [Text] Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius claims 
that Lithuania and Ukraine are entering a very important stage 
of developing and extending bilateral relations. Bearing in 
mind the overall situation in our neighboring eastern countries, 
the development of relations with Ukraine is very important both 
in the political and the economic sense. 
  This was stated in today's radio broadcast by the prime 
minister. He noted that economic instability in Ukraine causes 
many difficulties in settling accounts between states and he 
devoted a great deal of attention to this problem during his 
meeting with President Leonid Kravchuk on Tuesday. 
  Slezevicius expects that an agreement between the central 
banks signed in Vilnius will help the settlement of accounts. 
The contribution by the central bank should be very important, 
he noted, although, according to him, the part played by the 
commercial banks is also increasing. As is known, after his 
dismissal last autumn as chairman of the Bank of Lithuania, 
Romualdas Visokavicius was accused, among other things, of 
inability to introduce order in the settlement of accounts with 
CIS countries.
