FT  21 JAN 94 / Goldsmith aids Greenpeace
Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, has offered to back
Greenpeace, the pressure group, in its court battle to stop the Thorp
nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria.
The Goldsmith Foundation, set up by Sir James and his brother Edward,
yesterday said it would pay part of Greenpeace's legal costs if the pressure
group lost the case. The Goldsmiths have backed several anti-nuclear
campaigns. Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace UK, said Greenpeace could
call on 'more than Pounds 100,000' from the foundation if it lost the court
battle.
'I think he has backed us because he feels, as we do, that we have a strong
case and that it is possible to stop Thorp,' said Lord Melchett. Greenpeace
has raised Pounds 205,000 towards its costs from a special appeal to its
supporters.
The government announced its decision to give the go-ahead to the Pounds
2.8bn plant before Christmas. The licence came into effect on January 17,
but the plant is not expected to become fully radioactive until
mid-February.
Greenpeace will bring a High Court challenge to the decision on February 7.
The pressure group lost an earlier court attempt in September to stop
testing of the plant.
British Nuclear Fuels, Thorp's owner, said last night: that the news was
'not a complete surprise' as Sir James was reported to have backed other
anti-Thorp campaigns.
