  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea plans to 
provide 40 million U.S. dollars in an Economic Development 
Cooperation Fund (EDCF) to China this year, a government 
official said on Sunday. 
  "China last year asked Korea for 112 million dollars in 
economic cooperation. But, we have decided to furnish 40 
million dollars initially this year taking into account the 
projects the money would finance and the availability of EDCF 
funds," he said. 
  The official said the government had already completed the 
feasibility study of the projects by sending a fact-finding team 
to China toward the end of last year. The EDCF fund will help 
finance a bridge construction in Tianjin, harbor expansion at 
Longkou in Shandong Province, railroad facilities at Dongning in 
Heilongjiang Province, and airport communications and control 
facilities in Harbin, he said.
