FT  26 NOV 94 / US opens Cuba phone lines
Direct-dial telephone service opened last night between the US and Cuba for
the first time in 30 years. Both AT&amp;T and MCI were due to open telephone
lines to Cuba yesterday evening, offering a much easier and cheaper service
to Cuban exiles, who have had to resort to special services in Canada and
Italy to get around a bottleneck that restricted the number of calls to the
Caribbean island.
Telephone service is the one significant area in which the US has wanted to
ease its long-standing embargo against the government of President Fidel
Castro. The 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, which otherwise tightened the embargo,
offered new opportunities to improve telecommunications links.
Much of Cuba's telecommunications equipment dates from the 1920s, and only
an estimated 1 per cent of the 60m calls placed from the US to Cuba go
through. But upgrading the link has been complicated by disputes over how to
handle Cuba's share of the revenue from telephone calls.
