NIBBLES AND BITS 
Greg Mirken has taken over as host of a weekly folk music radio program on

specializing in traditional folk and bluegrass music, airs Sundays from 5 p.m. 
to 7 p.m. Mirken and his wife, Margie, have become focal figures on the Orange 
County folk scene, staging concert series at the Shade Tree Stringed 
Instruments shop they run in Laguna Niguel and performing every Sunday at the 
Old Dana Point Cafe.
