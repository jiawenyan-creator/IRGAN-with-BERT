  [Text] Competent sources in the security authorities have 
told O FILELEVTHEROS that a special "Psychological War Unit" 
stationed in Nicosia as part of the occupation forces and that 
has recently been reinforced appears to be behind some increased 
activity in the free areas. The National Guard General Staff 
has known from the start of this unit's existence and targets. 
  A senior officer (who was not authorized to reveal his name) 
told us the following: 
  First: This is considered to be an elite unit. It includes 
only specially trained groups and specially educated officers. 
  Second: It has its own structure and, although it comes 
under the [Turkish] General Staff, is commanded by its own Staff 
Office. 
  It is a "special war unit" and all the organized armies have 
the same or similar units. 
  The information available indicates that: 
  --The detachment sent to Cyprus has been reinforced and has 
its headquarters in Nicosia. Its ranking personnel and 
equipment are used, among other things, to conduct extensive 
monitoring of telephone conversations. 
  This is a known fact, which has led the government to make a 
decision on introducing "cryptophonic devices" [secure 
communications equipment]. 
  Doubtless, this psychological war unit will organize 
networks 
for espionage, provocation, or even for creating situations 
favoring the Attila [Turkish forces in Cyprus]. There are 
enough signs of such infiltration and attempts to undermine 
within the framework of the "war of attrition" or of creating 
pretexts that fall within the mission of this special force. 
  It is understood that some specific issues and evidence that 
have been collected are being reappraised carefully so that more 
effective (that is, more deterrent) measures may be adopted. 
  It is believed that the president will brief the National 
Council on all this along with other equally sensitive issues of 
national security. The briefing will take place after the 
conclusion of investigations that began following the 
assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis and those into some other 
cases.
