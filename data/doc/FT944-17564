FT  07 OCT 94 / Observer: Time please
Tim Martin's knack for turning ghostly shops into lively pubs has made him
plenty of friends among his shareholders and enemies among established
publicans. Almost every time his fast-growing J D Wetherspoon chain seeks a
licence for a new pub, the likes of GrandMet and Allied Domecq
go to court to try to stop him.
He generally wins and has just recouped Pounds 14,000 for the costs his
rivals had to foot when they said there was no demand for another pub in
Hornchurch, Essex. Indeed, he is thinking of naming his next pub the Good
Sheppard in memory of GrandMet's chairman and one-time outspoken free
marketeer.
