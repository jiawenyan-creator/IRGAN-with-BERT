FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: French insurers continue
expansion
THE leading French insurance groups are accelerating their international
expansion with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) agreeing terms to invest
in CAP, one of Chile's largest insurers, and Axa increasing its Asian
interests in a FFr165m (Dollars 32.35m) deal with Sime Darby of Malaysia.
UAP, the state-controlled company which is the biggest single force in
French insurance, has struck a cross-shareholding agreement with CAP. The
French group's Chilean subsidiary will take 51 per cent of La Australe, a
life insurance business formerly wholly-owned by CAP, and 35 per cent of El
Libertador, one of CAP's pension fund management companies.
CAP, which has industrial activities in steel and timber, will take a
minority stake in UAP's Chilean company. UAP has interests in Brazil,
Uruguay and Argentina.
The CAP deal comes at a time when UAP is trying to expand its European
network. The group has for some months been locked in negotiations with
Suez, one of France's largest industrial holding companies, over another
proposed cross-shareholding deal whereby UAP would swap part of its stake in
Victoire, a smaller French insurer, for a share of the latter's holding in
Colonia, a German insurance company.
Meanwhile, Axa, the private sector company which is France's second-largest
insurer, has concluded its second investment in Asia by agreeing terms to
take stakes in two companies owned by Sime Darby, a prominent Malaysian
insurance group. Axa is paying FFr165m for 50 per cent of Sime Shield in
Singapore and 30 per cent of Sime East West in Malaysia.
Axa, which four years ago made its first foray into Asia by setting up a
reinsurance subsidiary in Singapore, said it saw the Sime Darby deal as a
precursor to further investment in the region.
