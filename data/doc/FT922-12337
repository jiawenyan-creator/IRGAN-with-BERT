FT  18 APR 92 / Brown and Blair may take key policies role
MR GORDON BROWN, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, and Mr Tony Blair,
its employment spokesman, are likely to play an important role in
overhauling the party's policies if Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor,
wins the leadership.
Mr Smith, favourite in the contest, has brought in Mr Brown and Mr Blair to
help formulate his campaign manifesto, as he faces pressure to broaden the
debate on the future of the party.
Working with Mr Robin Cook, the campaign manager, they would take a
prominent role in an enhanced policy review after Mr Smith's victory. It is
part of a move to counter claims that Mr Smith would only continue reforms
started by the outgoing Labour leader, Mr Neil Kinnock.
Yesterday Mr Bryan Gould, Mr Smith's main rival, said candidates 'should not
deliberately exaggerate differences', calling for a debate between the
contestants and an agreement on 'ground rules'.
Mr Gould, who is also running for the deputy leadership, portrays himself as
a radical candidate. But his comments may also have been aimed at allaying
fears that Mr Smith could not work with him if he were to become deputy
leader.
Mr Brown and Mr Blair are expected soon to announce policy initiatives, with
Mr Smith, on issues including Scottish devolution and a bill of rights - but
not electoral reform.
Labour embarked on a new rolling programme of policy formulation at its
Brighton conference last year. But Mr Smith wants a streamlined,
forward-looking review, distinct from that following the 1987 election, to
prepare the party for a late 1990s election.
