FT  02 APR 93 / Observer: Bills of fare
The fact that Britain's Conservatives pride themselves on being the
value-for-money party lends added interest to two forthcoming events on
their programme.
April 22 - Conservative Group for Europe's gala dinner, guest speaker John
Major, tickets Pounds 55 apiece.
April 25 - Conservative Women's National Committee's blue ribbon dinner,
guest speaker Kenneth Clarke, tickets Pounds 75 each.
