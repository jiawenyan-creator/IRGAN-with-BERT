FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Net climbs at Portuguese bank
Banco Espiritu Santo, one of Portugal's top four retail banks, reports a
15.2 per cent rise in net profits, to Es20.2bn (Dollars 114.9m) for 1993,
compared with 1992.
The bank is paying a dividend of Es168, up from Es161 in 1992. Net assets
grew 19 per cent to Es2,005bn.
Mr Ricardo Espiritu Santo Salgado, president, said a 22.5 per cent rise in
earnings from banking services, to Es21.9bn, had helped offset a reduction
in the margin between loans and deposits, from 4.2 per cent in 1992 to 3.8
per cent. Earnings on bank lending improved by just 2.9 per cent to
Es66.8bn.
The amount of credit extended by the bank grew 11 per cent to Es836bn.
Provisions against credit risks were increased by 12.9 per cent. Following
the issue of Dollars 100m in preference shares in New York, and Es20bn in
domestic bonds last year, the bank's debt-to-asset ratio rose from 9.2 to
10.7 per cent.
