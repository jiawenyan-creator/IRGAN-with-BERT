FT  25 JAN 93 / Iraq may be moving missiles to no-fly zones
MR LES ASPIN, the new US secretary of defence, yesterday said there were
signs that Iraq was moving its surface-to-air missiles back into the no-fly
zones. The US would need to watch the missiles in the next few days.
Mr Aspin said it was too early to say if President Saddam Hussein had broken
his self-declared goodwill ceasefire. 'I think we're going to wait a couple
of days to make sure,' he said.
A US Navy jet bombed a radar site in southern Iraq on Saturday. US military
officials said they believed the aircraft had been fired on from the ground
but confirmed that Iraqi radar had not, as at first believed, locked on to
it. Iraq denied firing on the aircraft and said it remained committed to its
ceasefire declaration.
A United Nations team of nuclear weapons inspectors is set to fly into
Baghdad today on a delayed but routine mission. They are expected to examine
damage to the al-Rabiya site, south of Baghdad, which was attacked last week
by US cruise missiles.
The mission, the 17th by nuclear weapons inspectors to Iraq since the end of
the Gulf war, is led by Mr Maurizio Zifferero.
He said after the US raid that he was 'very keen' to log the damage caused
by the attack. The eight-member team will join about 70 UN inspectors who
returned to Iraq last week. A team of ballistic missile experts will also
fly into Iraq today.
