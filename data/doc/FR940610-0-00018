SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History



On April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
the Sandpoint, Idaho, Class E airspace area (59 FR 15669). This action is necessary to accommodate arrival/departure
aircraft transitioning between the enroute and terminal areas in western Idaho. The area will be depicted on aeronautical
charts for pilot reference. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting
written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. This action is the same as the proposal except for a typographical
error discovered (and corrected herein) in the coordinates of the airspace description for Fairchild AFB, Washington.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace is published in Paragraph
6006 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published
subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Sandpoint, Idaho. The FAA
has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent
and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
