The Cincinnati Bengals have decided they have no interest in bringing back 
Stanley Wilson, even if the National Football League does reinstate him from a 
suspension for cocaine use, Bengal General Manager Paul Brown said. 
Wilson, 27, a former University of Oklahoma player from Wilmington was 
suspended for drug use on the eve of the Super Bowl. 
The Bengals had accepted Wilson back after yearlong drug suspensions in 1985 
and 1987.
