FT  05 AUG 93 / Cuban ministerial shake-up
Cuba's government replaced four ministers yesterday in a shake-up of key
economic posts that signalled its determination to confront the island's
economic crisis with reforms, Reuter reports from Havana.
The ruling council of state, headed by President Fidel Castro, named Mr
Alfredo Jordan Morales, Mr Nelson Torres Perez, General Silvano Colas
Sanchez and Mr Jose Luis Rodriguez Garca as the new ministers for
agriculture, sugar, communications and finance respectively.
It was the most important shake-up of economic posts on the Caribbean island
for several years. Diplomats said the changes confirmed President Castro's
intention to tackle the island's economic problems.
