SUMMARY:

 The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of final antidumping investigations Nos. 731TA688
through 695 (Final) under section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)) (the Act) to determine
whether an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment
of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from France, India, Israel, Malaysia,
the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings,

 provided for in subheading 7307.93.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The Commission also
gives notice of the schedule to be followed in these antidumping investigations and the ongoing countervailing duty
investigations regarding imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from India and Israel (invs. Nos.
701TA360 and 361 (Final)), which the Commission instituted effective May 31, 1994 (59 F.R. 37054, July
20, 1994). The schedules for the subject investigations will be identical, pursuant to Commerce's alignment of its
final subsidy and dumping determinations (59 F.R. 32955, June 27, 1994).

</FOOTNAME>
 The imported products covered by the scope of these investigations consist of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe
fittings having an inside diameter of less than 14 inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished
condition. Such pipe fittings are formed or forged carbon steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems
where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of
fastening (e.g., threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). The subject pipe fittings come in a variety of shapes which
include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of the finished pipe fittings are beveled,
so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel
is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joints the fitting to the pipe.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background



The subject antidumping investigations are being instituted as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations
by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France, India, Israel,
Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela are being sold in the United States at
less than fair value within the meaning of section 733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The Commission instituted the subject
countervailing duty investigations on May 31, 1994 (59 F.R. 37054, July 20, 1994). Both investigations were requested
in a petition filed on February 28, 1994, by the U.S. Fittings Group, Washington, DC, an ad hoc trade association consisting
of five domestic firms: Hackney, Inc., Dallas, TX; Ladish Co., Inc., Cudahy, WI; Mills Iron Works, Inc., Gardena,
CA; Steel Forgings, Inc., Shreveport, LA; and Tube Forgings of America, Inc., Portland, OR. 



Participation in the Investigations and Public Service List 



Any person having already filed an entry of appearance in the countervailing duty investigations is considered a
party in the antidumping investigations. Any other persons wishing to participate in the investigations as parties
must file an entry of appearance with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in section 201.11 of the Commission's
rules, not later than twenty-one (21) days after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Secretary will prepare a public service list containing the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives,
who are parties to the investigations upon the expiration of the period for filing entries of appearance. 




Limited Disclosure of Business Proprietary Information (BPI) Under an Administrative Protective Order (APO) and
BPI Service List



Pursuant to section 207.7(a) of the Commission's rules, the Secretary will make BPI gathered in these final investigations
available to authorized applicants under the APO issued in the investigations, provided that the application is
made not later than twenty-one (21) days after the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. A separate service list will be maintained by the Secretary for those parties authorized to receive BPI under the
APO. 



Staff Report



The prehearing staff report in these investigations will be placed in the nonpublic record on December 5, 1994, and
a public version will be issued thereafter, pursuant to section 207.21 of the Commission's rules.
