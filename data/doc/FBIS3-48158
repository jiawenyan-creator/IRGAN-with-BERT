  [Text] A spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry on 
Friday reasserted Vietnam sovereignty over the Spratly and the 
Paracel islands groups. He said both groups of islands come 
under Vietnam sovereignty because Vietnam was the first to 
discover them in the 17th century, and has been exercising its 
genuine ownership over them in a continuous and peaceful manner. 
  The Vietnamese spokesman was speaking in an interview to the 
army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN following remarks made last Friday 
by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman who claimed Chinese 
sovereignty over these two islands groups while rejecting 
Vietnam's right over the land. 
  He said Vietnam has been trying to resolve the issue through 
peaceful means in keeping with international laws and with 
consistency, and will continue to do so in the future.
