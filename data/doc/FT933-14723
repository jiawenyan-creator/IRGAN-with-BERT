FT  13 JUL 93 / Observer: Stay young
Catch them while they are young, is one of the oldest marketing ploys
around. But keeping up with teenage mores is no easy task judging by the
latest intelligence from that estimable US trade publication Adweek.
Its latest issue includes a list of current youth crazes, as identified by
consultants BKG Youth Inc. They range from Al Gore, capital punishment,
mothers, intelligence, the environment, to taking big risks, lacrosse and
coloured denims.
No doubt the more entrepreneurial types will be able to devise a marketing
strategy by capitalising on the above fads, but Observer would welcome any
money-making suggestions.
