  [Text] Tokyo May 15 -- Russia will take part for the first 
time in a political summit of the G-7 countries scheduled in 
Naples on July 8-10. All G-7 members-states, including Japan 
and the United States, which had earlier objected to this, 
agreed to such a modification of the previous formula "seven 
plus one", under which the Russian leader met G-7 leaders after 
the programme of the G-7 summit was comleted, the TOKYO SHIMBUN 
said today with reference to sources from the Japanese 
Government. 
  The political discussion is expected to focus on the 
situation on the Korean peninsula, in connection with suspicions 
that North Korea is involved in the development of nuclear 
weapons, the Bosnian crisis, the progress of peaceful 
settlement in the Middle East, war in Yemen and the situation in 
South Africa following presidential elections. The problem of 
North Korea might be brought up in light of strengthening the 
regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons not only in asia, 
but in the whole world. 
  Russia's problem will be discussed only at an economic 
conference of G-7 leaders. The discussion is expected to focus 
on the expansion of the framework of aid to Russia as it 
switches over to the market economy. 
  Joint measures taken by the G-7 countries in combating 
organised crime in the world are expected to be high on the 
agenda of the economic conference, and in particular, preventing 
the practice of money laundering by drug dealers and drug 
trafficking. 
  The TOKYO SHIMBUN newspaper pointed out that Russia's 
participation would make some corrections in final documents of 
the Naples summit. "In respect of the stance taken by Japan and 
the United States" G-7 member-states decided not to adopt a 
traditional political declaration, but outline the course of the 
discussion in a brief statement made by Italy which would chair 
the summit.
