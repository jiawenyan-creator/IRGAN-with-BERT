  [Text] Kiev April 5 TASS -- A group of international 
experts visited the Chernobyl nuclear power station to check 
whether facilities of the nuclear power station meet the 
required safety standards. 
  Taking part in the inspection, organised by the 
International 
Atomic Energy Agency, were experts from Spain, Sweden, Great 
britain, the United States, Russia and a representative of the 
coordinative secretariat for nuclear security under the European 
Union in Brussels. 
  Experts studied the construction of the station from the 
point of view of safety requirements, the level of its 
maintenance and detected a number of faults. Among factors 
affecting the safety of the nuclear power station, experts 
mentioned the exodus of highly-qualified personnel, the shortage 
of modern equipment and spare parts and a technical condition of 
the "ukritie" (cover) installation covering the damaged reactor 
of the fourth block. 
  IAEA director, Hans Bliks, pointed out that the Chernobyl 
nuclear power station does not meet safety standards and 
suggested that the countries concerned convene a conference to 
work out measures to improve the condition of the Chernobyl 
nuclear station. "The IAEA is prepared to render assistance in 
arranging this conference in Vienna in the second half of 
April," the IAEA director said.
