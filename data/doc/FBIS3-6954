  [Text] Yala -- Helicopters from the Pattani-based 
Civilian-Police-Military [CPM] Command 43 yesterday began 
air-strikes against a camp of separatist bandits under Ma Sungai 
Batu of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) on Kudong Mountain 
in Yaha District. 
  Col Phongsak Ekbannasing, deputy commander of CPM-43, said 
the air attacks were launched on intelligence confirmed by 
aerial reconnaissance that about 30 separatists were at the camp. 
  Three helicopters from Sirinthorn Camp in Pattani's Yarang 
District attacked the camp twice yesterday with machineguns. 
  At the same time, troops were deployed at the foot of the 
mountain to intercept the bandits fleeing the air attacks which 
would continue for five days, he said. 
  Seven government soldiers were wounded last week when a 
government force activated two landmines on Kudong Mountain 
while patrolling the area. 
  Two of the wounded lost their left leg in the mine 
explosion.
