NIBBLES AND BITS 
Paid attendance at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company of Great Britain engagement 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, which ended Sunday, 
averaged 55.4% of capacity, Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said Monday. 
The eight-performance run of Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" and "The 
Pirates of Penzance" grossed $432,945, or 63.8 % of the potential gross, 
Kendrick said. 
Kendrick had told The Times earlier that paid attendance would have to exceed 
65% for the Center to break even. The engagement "will require subsidy," 
Kendrick said Monday.

at the restaurant's fifth annual grape harvest celebration, "Festa della 
Vendemmia," according to Prego manager Louie Salcito. More than 250 people
