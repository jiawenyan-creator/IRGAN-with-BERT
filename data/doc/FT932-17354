FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: Bureaucratic 'shilly-shallying' on jobs scheme
Sir, Sadly, just when the government seems to be coming out of a very
troubled period, there is evidence that some departments, at least, are
committed to a policy of determined vacillation.
How else can one explain the handling by the Department of Employment of the
benefits transfer programme proposed by Prof Dennis Snower (Personal View,
February 23) of Birkbeck College. While appearing to accept in principle
that it should be possible and permissible, in defined circumstances, for
some unemployed people to transfer their benefit to an employer in exchange
for a job, the Department of Employment, it appears, wants to run just four
small-scale pilot schemes, and to restrict very greatly the amount of
benefit transferable.
This is a classic example of bureaucratic shilly-shallying designed to kill
stone-dead a scheme which comes from outside the Civil Service.
The benefits transfer programme could, if adopted countrywide and
wholeheartedly, greatly reduce unemployment, according to Professor Snower's
calculations. Even if he is wrong what does the Department of Employment
have to lose by trying to make work a programme which attempts to do
something about unemployment. The benefits transfer programme does not
involve extra cost to government; in fact, it really cuts the cost of
benefits. It is not inflationary and gets people back to work so that they
start to pay income tax, National Insurance contributions, more VAT - so
what can possibly be wrong with that?
Why does not the employment secretary just get on with it instead of
fiddling about?
