  [Text] Leaving health in the hands of the private sector, 
increasing contributions and the number of weeks required for 
eligibility, and reducing the amount of the basic retirement 
pension are among the reasons why the country's major labor 
unions reject the Social Security reform plan passed by Congress. 
  The United Workers Confederation (CUT), the General 
Confederation of Democratic Workers (CGTD), and the National 
Federation of Government Workers (FENALTRACE) all reject the 
reform, calling it "ill-fated" for employers, workers, and the 
country in general. 
  "It is a mistake to turn health services over to the 
agencies. There is a danger that those most in need will no 
longer be served and that the overall health care that they 
formerly received at hospitals will be considerably diminished," 
CUT official Isaias Cristancho warned. 
  He also said that raising Social Security contributions from 
15 to 25.5 percent of wages and increasing the number of weeks 
that one would have to pay into private pension funds would have 
a negative impact. 
  Yesid Garcia, deputy secretary of the CGTD, said his union 
opposed the creation of pension funds and the fact that the 
financial sector would handle Colombians' savings. He proposes 
instead that procedures be put in place enabling the ISS to 
handle such resources as part of its investment portfolio. 
  The Confederation notes that the plan increases the number 
of 
weeks one is required to pay as well as the amount of 
contributions, raises the retirement age, and lowers the amount 
of the basic pension from 75 to 65 percent of wages, all of 
which points it rejects. 
  It also opposes the method of figuring the basic pension, 
which will henceforth be calculated based on wages earned for 
the last 10 years or the entire time worked. At present, only 
the last two years are considered.
