FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit returns to black
ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group which announced a large
investment in eastern Germany last week, moved back into the black in the
first four months. The group returned a profit after financial items of
FM86m (Dollars 16m), compared with a loss of FM76m last time.
Group sales were up 21 per cent to FM4.09bn, while operating profits rose
from FM496m last year, equivalent to 15 per cent of net sales, to FM964m, or
more than 23 per cent of net sales, in the first four months this year.
The improvement was attributed to the effects of the devaluation of the
Finnish markka in autumn, higher capacity utilisation, and improved
productivity.
However Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, warned it was unclear whether the
upward trend would continue. He said uncertainty had increased lately over
the key factors of economic conditions in Europe and price trends for
forestry products. Excess supply had so far kept markets tight, he said.
Enso spent almost FM1.8bn on capital expenditure in the first four months,
mainly on completing a pulp mill and a combined cycle power plant in
Finland. It said the emphasis would now switch to international operations.
