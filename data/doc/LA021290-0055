CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SAN DIEGO; 
PATROLS TRY TO STOP HARASSING OF WHALES 
Coast Guard and National Marine Fisheries Service agents began patrolling the 
San Diego coast to prevent weekend boaters from harassing migrating gray 
whales, officials said. The huge mammals, which are protected under the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act, travel down the coast on their journey from Alaska to 
their breeding grounds off Baja California. 
"I don't think anybody starts out their day by saying, 'Let's go harass some 
whales today.' I think they just want to get closer," Fisheries agent Ray 
Sautter said. "But when you start seeing boats that are making course changes 
to pursue the whales and whales making course changes to evade the boats, that 
is a violation." Sautter said he called for the patrols after observing boaters 
while he took a whale-watching cruise. Fines for harassing whales could be as 
high as $25,000, he said.
