FT  10 SEP 94 / International Company News: Union Carbide severs Indian link
Union Carbide, the US chemical company, is to cut its links with India 10
years after the world's worst industrial disaster at its pesticide plant in
Bhopal.
The group is selling its controlling 50.9 per cent stake in Union Carbide
India to McLeod Russell India, part of the Calcutta-based B. M. Khaitan tea
and engineering group, for Rs2.9bn (Dollars 92.3m).
Carbide, facing criminal proceedings in Indian courts for the disaster which
killed more than 2,500 people and seriously injured more than 30,000, had
been permitted by the Indian Supreme Court in February to sell its stake in
Union Carbide India to the highest bidder. McLeod Russell's bid of Rs175 per
share was the highest received.
The court said Rs650m of the sale would go to the Bhopal Hospital Trust for
the building of a hospital to treat the victims of the gas disaster. The
trust, headed by Sir Ian Percival, has received Rs188m from Union Carbide
India for the hospital. Another Rs500m would be due to the government as
capital gains tax. The rest of money would be held in an escrow account
until the criminal cases pending against Carbide were resolved.
The US parent was forced to sell some of its businesses worldwide to pay
Dollars 470m in compensation to the victims, after a settlement was reached
in 1989 between the company and the Indian government, following four years
of litigation.
The Carbide sale was negotiated by Bombay-based Creditcapital Finance
Corporation and the State Bank of India, India's largest nationalised bank.
Other bidders included Mr Nusli Wadia, head of Bombay Dyeing, the textiles
and chemicals group whose bid was made in conjunction with the UK-based
Eveready Battery company, a subsidiary of Ralston Purina, which bought
Carbide's battery business worldwide, except in India, after the gas
tragedy.
