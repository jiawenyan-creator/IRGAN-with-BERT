FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: Photos for a cause
This portrait of Marlene Dietrich by Cornel Lucas is on show at the Saatchi
Gallery in north London until September 30, but will be sold at Sotheby's on
October 5 with an estimate of Pounds 300-Pounds 600.
It is part of Positive View, a major exhibition of over 200 photographs,
many of which were donated by their creators and most of which will be sold
at the auction to benefit two charities favoured by the Princess of Wales,
DEBRA and Chicken Shed Theatre.
Among the photographers represented are Bill Brandt, Irving Penn and Annie
Leibovitz, and among the striking images are the last taken of Marilyn
Monroe, by Bert Stern; Naomi Campbell captured in 1990 by Herb Ritts; and
Gilbert &amp; George has seen in 1974 by Cecil Beaton.
Another opportunity to acquire a work of art and help a good cause at the
same time is available at Christie's until September 21. The Royal Academy
Schools want to establish a scholarship to commemorate a distinguished RA,
the late Peter Greenham.
Many artists, mainly RAs, have donated works to help raise Pounds 150,000.
You can buy paintings by Patrick Caulfield, Carel Weight, John Hoyland,
Peter Blake, Terry Frost and more at very reasonable prices. But hurry: they
are going fast.
