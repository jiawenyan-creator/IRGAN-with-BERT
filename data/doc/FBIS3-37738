  [Text] Kiev, 22 Feb -- Plenary sessions of the ninth 
session of the Ukrainian Supreme Council have resumed. It was 
proposed that deputies examine 55 issues in four days. On 21 
February, deputies proposed a draft law on the election of 
deputies and heads of rural, village, regional, municipal, and 
oblast councils for the agenda. 
  It was determined that the first issue to be examined on 23 
February will be information from the Cabinet of Ministers on 
the course of implementing the Supreme Council's resolutions on 
the state of the economy in Ukraine, on overcoming the payments 
crisis in the national economy, on the payment of salaries and 
stipends, and on the state of payments for agricultural products. 
  A working group headed by Vasyl Durdynets, the first deputy 
chairman of the Supreme Council, is working on a draft 
resolution on the conformity of laws of the Crimean Republic 
with the Ukrainian Constitution. This issue will be examined at 
the evening session on 24 February along with the participation 
of representatives of the Crimean Republic's power bodies. 
  Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch informed those 
present 
about a speech which Ivan Yemets, head of the Central Election 
Commission, made at a meeting of the Supreme Council Presidium. 
He said that because of the absence of many records, a final 
result of the registration of parliamentary candidates was still 
not available.
