  [Text] The Italian and British governments have signed a 
deal for provision of 24 Tornado F-3's to the Italian Air Force. 
The aircraft will be the air defense version. 
  The Tornado, which saw service during the Gulf War, is an 
aircraft capable of refueling in midair and, according to a 
statement released by the Air Force chief-of-staff, "it has 
well-equipped and modern radar and weapons systems, which are 
ideal for counteracting any kind of foreseeable threat."
