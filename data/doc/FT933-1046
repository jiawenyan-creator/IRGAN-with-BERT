FT  25 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Willis Corroon
Willis Corroon is not the first insurance broker to admit that its talents
do not extend to underwriting. The plan to offer a majority stake in
Gryphon, its US property and casualty business, should allow Willis to cut
debt and concentrate on what it does best. It must be taken as a mark of the
company's faith in the recovery potential of broking that it is prepared to
shed a profitable subsidiary at this stage of the cycle.
Floating the business on Wall Street is expected to net more than a trade
sale. US investors are especially eager to back insurance ventures with an
international flavour. At least two of the reinsurance companies established
in Bermuda this summer plan to raise additional capital by making public
offerings of shares. Sphere Drake, the leading London market insurer owned
by a consortium, recently returned to the public domain via the same route.
Yet the Sphere Drake example underlines how difficult it can be for past
owners to escape the shadow of insurance policies already written. Alexander
&amp; Alexander, the big US broker, sold Sphere to its present owners in 1987.
Indemnities given to the buyers as part of the deal were still eating into
profits last year. All credit to Willis if it can both raise cash and make
the clean break which it promises. Insurance brokers with less profitable or
less well-reserved underwriting operations will not be so fortunate.
