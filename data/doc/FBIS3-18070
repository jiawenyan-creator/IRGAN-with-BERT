<F P=106> [Statement by Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on the </F>
shooting down of four Serbian aircraft by U.S. jets in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina; in Brussels on 28 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] If events have occurred as they have been reported, 
it shows that monitoring the compliance with UN Security Council 
resolutions is now being taken seriously, and it would also show 
the Serbian side that such violations of the no-fly zone will no 
longer be tolerated. Of course, this would be the first NATO 
mission, if I see things correctly; but I do not think that it 
will lead to further such missions. [sentence as heard] It is, 
above all, also a mission that has to be seen separately from 
the measures that have been planned in and around Sarajevo, and 
all those -- at least theoretical -- deliberations as to whether 
what was stated in connection with the NATO Sarajevo ultimatum 
could also be applied to Tuzla and other comparable areas.
