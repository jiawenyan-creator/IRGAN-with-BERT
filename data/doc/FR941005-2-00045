During the week of July 4 through July 8, 1994, the proposed decision and order summarized below was issued by the Office
of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy with regard to an application for exception. 

Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR Part 205, Subpart D), any person who
will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection
within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be
the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first.


The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time
period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in
final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in a proposed decision and order must also
file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In
the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in
any further proceeding involving the exception matter.

Copies of the full text of this proposed decision and order are available in the Public Reference Room of the Office
of Hearings and Appeals, Room 1E234, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20585,
Monday through Friday, between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., except federal holidays.

Petroleum Products, Inc. Charleston, WV, Lee0087 Reporting 
Requirements



Petroleum Products, Inc. filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement
that it file Form EIA782B, the ``Resellers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering this
request, the DOE found that Petroleum Products was a certainty firm and therefore could only be granted relief if it
were experiencing extreme hardship. The DOE determined that it was not. Accordingly, on July 5, 1994, the DOE issued
a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied.
