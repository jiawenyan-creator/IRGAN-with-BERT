Finlay
JAMES FINLAY, the overseas trading and financial services group, lifted
pre-tax profits by almost 13 per cent from a restated Pounds 8.95m to Pounds
10.1m in 1992, thanks in large part to the performance of the plantations
side.
The division lifted operating profits from a restated Pounds 4.28m to Pounds
8.78m.
Turnover climbed to Pounds 165.2m (Pounds 143.7m).
Operating profits rose to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.9m), after operating
expenses of Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 26.3m) and a deficit on currency exchange
of Pounds 967,000 (Pounds 144,000).
Associated undertakings brought in losses of Pounds 636,000 (profits Pounds
300,000); investment income and interest receivable accrued Pounds 1.32m
(Pounds 1.19m); the flotation of 25 per cent of James Finlay &amp; Co (Colombo)
made Pounds 893,000; while interest payable grew to Pounds 3.67m (Pounds
3.43m).
The tax charge leapt to Pounds 5.32m (Pounds 4.07m), resulting in lower
earnings per share of 4.7p (4.9p).
A second interim dividend of 2.15p keeps the total for the year unchanged at
4.15p.
Apart from plantations, the only division to lift operating profits was oil
