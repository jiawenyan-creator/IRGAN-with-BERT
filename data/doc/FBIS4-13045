  [Excerpt] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, along with Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member of the Presidential Council, 
today received brother Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Jordanian 
Royal Hashemite Court and envoy of His Majesty King Husayn 
Bin-Talal of the fraternal Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 
  The Jordanian envoy conveyed to the brother chairman a 
message from his brother, His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal, on 
issues of interest to brotherly relations between the two 
fraternal countries, as well as the efforts [words indistinct] 
made by the brothers in Jordan to bring views closer, contain 
the political crisis, and promote efforts to implement the 
accord document signed in the Jordanian capital, Amman. This is 
meant to safeguard Yemeni unity and democracy. 
  The message stressed the need to preserve unity, since it is 
a national and pan-Arab achievement and a gain for the Yemeni 
people and all the sons of the Arab nation. Yemeni unity is 
also an outstanding achievement amid pan-Arab divisions. The 
message stressed the importance of resorting to dialogue on all 
levels, stopping military and media developments, and activating 
official agencies so they exercise their duties to implement the 
accord document. The message further asserted Jordan's 
willingness to continue to make brotherly efforts and all that 
can help [words indistinct]. [passage omitted including
