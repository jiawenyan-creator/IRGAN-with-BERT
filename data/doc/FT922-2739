FT  16 JUN 92 / French success on inflation continues
FRANCE'S inflation advantage over its main trading partners continued in
May, official data showed yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
For the fifth consecutive month, the consumer price index (CPI) published by
the national statistics office INSEE rose 0.3 per cent, for a year-on-year
rise of 3.1 per cent.
Cumulative inflation in the first five months of 1992 was 1.3 per cent. The
figures were in line with private economists' forecasts.
Finance Minister Michel Sapin 'noted with satisfaction' that inflation was
well below that of France's main trading partner, Germany, traditionally the
champion of monetary rigour in Europe. West German prices rose 4.6 per cent
in the year to May.
His ministry described the French figure as a good result, achieved despite
higher oil prices and charges by doctors.
Prices rose 3.1 per cent last year and 3.4 per cent in 1990.
