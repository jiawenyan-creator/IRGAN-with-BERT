  [Text] Belgrade, 22 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Serb republic, told SRNA today that "the Serbs 
are ready to start negotiations on the cessation of hostilities 
immediately and without any preconditions" but that they would 
"favors a permanent and not a temporary peace." 
  Commenting on the appeal issued to the Serb and Muslim sides 
last night by Yasushi Akashi, UN secretary general's special 
envoy in former Yugoslavia, calling on the warring sides to 
begin negotiations on a global cessation of hostilities, 
Karadzic said that the Muslim forces ar launching major 
offensive operations along the entire front. 
  "We want the international community to warn the Muslim side 
to stop the attacks because if this does not happen the Serbs 
have a legitimate right to defend and to counterattack," 
Karadzic told SRNA. Karadzic said that he does not know the 
details of Akashi's draft plan for an urgent cessation of 
hostilities, but he added that an earlier draft made by Akashi 
and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin represent a 
good basis for further negotiations.
