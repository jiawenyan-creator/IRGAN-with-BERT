DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KERN COUNTY DROPS ANIMAL CRUELTY CASE 
Kern County prosecutors on Thursday declined to file animal cruelty charges 
against a former San Fernando Valley woman who faces trial in Los Angeles on 
charges that she duped pet owners into giving away dogs and cats that were 
later sold to medical laboratories. 
Kern County Dist. Atty. 
Ed Jagels said authorities believed Barbara Ann Ruggiero, 27, ran a similar 
enterprise in Bakersfield but decided not to file charges because she already 
faces six years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed under state law for 
nonviolent felonies, if convicted in Los Angeles. 
Ruggiero, whose trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 13 in San Fernando Superior 
Court, faces two misdemeanor and 13 felony counts of theft and conspiracy. Even 
if convicted in Bakersfield on similar charges, Ruggiero could not receive 
additional prison time because it would exceed the state sentencing limit, 
Jagels said. 
Animal control officers from Kern and Los Angeles counties on Monday raided a 
kennel Ruggiero operated in Bakersfield called the Puppy Pavilion and 
confiscated 80 dogs, which will remain in protective custody. Officers said the 
animals were held in substandard conditions. 
Jagels said Kern County prosecutors reserve the right to file charges against 
Ruggiero if she is acquitted in Los Angeles.
