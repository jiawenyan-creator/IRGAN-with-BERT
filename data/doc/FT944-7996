FT  22 NOV 94 / Observer: Phillip Thorpe - viticulteur
Regulating the UK fund management industry is not an occupation typically
seen as long on fizz, so Phillip Thorpe, chief executive of the
self-regulatory body Imro, must count as an exception.
It seems he is the proprietor of about 1,000 cases of last year's Cremant de
Loire, a sparkling wine made from a mixture of Chenin and Grolleau grapes
which emanates from just outside Saumur in the Loire Valley. It has recently
appeared on the list at The Alba restaurant in the City of London - thanks
to the efforts of Thorpe and his wife Melinda Lowis, from whose vineyard it
hails.
Appropriately enough for this New Zealand lawyer, Thorpe is applying
antipodean techniques and has hired a New South Wales winemaker to produce a
tipple - retailing at Pounds 6.50 a bottle - which he describes as
'recognisably Loire with touches of fruit and oak'.
The vineyard he and his wife bought four years ago, and which was last in
production some 40 years previously, now turns out 5,000 cases a year - of
the sparkling wine, a still red (Cabernet) and a still white (Chenin). So
Thorpe, who spends weekends in France in his capacity as 'chief financier,
odd job man and unqualified taster', reckons he has enough to permit the
first tentative steps into the UK.
Observer hears he has yet to make purchase of two cases of the Cremant a
condition of Imro membership.
