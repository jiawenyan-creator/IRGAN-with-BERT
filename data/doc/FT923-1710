FT  22 SEP 92 / Career vouchers at Sainsbury
SHOPFLOOR employees at 10 branches of J. Sainsbury, the food retailer, are
being offered career guidance vouchers worth Pounds 36 each.
The project is a joint initiative with the Department of Employment, which
recently launched 'Gateways to Learning'. This provides adults, particularly
those in low-skill jobs, with vouchers for career and training advice.
J. Sainsbury is the first employer to take up the scheme.
