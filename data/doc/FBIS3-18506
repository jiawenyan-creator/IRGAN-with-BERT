Adolf Ogi To Explain the `Yes' To the Alps Initiative, British 
Support"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 2 Mar (ATS) -- The talks between Federal 
Councillor Adolf Ogi and John MacGregor, British secretary of 
state for transport, in London on Wednesday [2 March] focused on 
the Alps initiative. Mr. MacGregor showed great understanding 
for the Swiss `yes' to the initiative. However, according to 
Mr. Ogi, the Federal Council still has to decide how to explain 
the consequences of this popular decision abroad. 
  Mr. Ogi's two-day visit to Great Britain had been scheduled 
for several weeks, before the 20 February vote, said the head of 
the Federal Department of Transport, Communications, and Energy 
(DFTCE). However, the `yes' to the initiative is now forcing the 
Federal Council to come up with explanations to foreign 
governments, Mr. Ogi told ATS. Between now and the year 2004, 
all traffic of goods passing through Switzerland in transit must 
switch from road to rail. 
<H5>  British Support </H5>
  Mr. MacGregor and Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory, minister of 
state of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, assured Mr. Ogi of 
their understanding of the decision by the Swiss people. The 
British Government is willing to support Switzerland within the 
European Union [EU]. Nonetheless, its representatives have 
brought it to the attention of Mr. Ogi that the Swiss situation 
in the bilateral negotiations with the EU is now more difficult. 
  On 18 April, the EU transport ministers intended to adopt a 
double mandate to negotiate with Switzerland on road transit and 
aviation. Now, the `yes' to the initiative has forced the 
European Commission to reassess the situation. 
<H5>  Sporting Metaphor </H5>
  "Just short of the tape, we have been forced to run another 
lap," stated the federal councillor. The promise of British 
support merely represents one single voice within an institution 
of 12 members, he went on. 
  The Federal Council must now decide how to explain the new 
situation to its foreign partners. It will have to guarantee 
that the transit agreement signed with the European Community 
will be respected, without discrimination. 
  The head of the DFTCE will have further opportunities to 
explain the Swiss position, especially at the pan-European 
conference of transport ministers, which will take place in 
mid-March on the island of Crete. One week later, Mr. Ogi will 
meet with European Commissioner for Transport, Mr. Abel Matutes.
