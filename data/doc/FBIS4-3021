  [Text] Moscow, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev said today that he has changed his 
assenting stance toward Russia's participation in NATO's 
"partnership for peace" plan after the Western military bloc 
launched air raids on Bosnian Serbs without consulting Moscow. 
  Grachev told the INTERFAX News Agency that he has been an 
enthusiastic supporter for Russia's participation in NATO's 
partnership program and has explained its necessity to officers 
of all ranks. 
  However, he added, NATO's air strikes indicated that the 
idea 
of the "partnership for peace" plan is only in words. 
  Grachev's remarks came a day after Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said Moscow has dropped plans to immediately join 
the program. 
  On April 10 and 11, NATO staged two air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions southwest of the Muslim enclave of 
Gorazde. 
  After the NATO strikes, Russia's Foreign Ministry, Defense 
ministry and parliament issued statements accusing NATO and the 
U.S. of violating the UN Charter by unilaterally ordering the 
operation without consulting other permanent members of the UN 
Security Council, especially Russia. 
  The statements said that NATO regards Russia as its equal 
partner in words, but treats the country as an unimportant 
"little partner" in deeds. 
  As NATO's actions are not in keeping with its promises, 
Grachev said, the definition of the "partnership for peace" 
plan, the principles for Russia's participation and the 
country's role within it should be reviewed. 
  NATO's partnership plan offers limited military cooperation 
to former Soviet-led Warsaw Pact members by allowing them to 
take part in peacekeeping missions, military exercises and other 
NATO activities without becoming its members.
