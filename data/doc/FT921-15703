FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: ASE may trade options on
index of biotech stocks
THE American Stock Exchange (ASE) has unveiled plans to trade options on its
recently developed index of biotechnology stocks, writes Patrick Harverson.
The ASE has developed a niche offering investors opportunities to trade a
range of index-based derivative products, and yesterday it asked the SEC for
permission to trade options on its Biotechnology Index.
The index, made up of 15 established biotech companies, including Amgen,
Immunex and Centocor, was created last year to allow investors to trade a
basket of stocks in what was the best performing sector in the US equity
markets of the past year.
Biotech stocks have proved popular among speculative investors because the
companies operate in a rapidly developing industry where technological
advances can lead to dramatic increases in share prices, market value and
earnings.
