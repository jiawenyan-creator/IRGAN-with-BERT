FT  19 MAY 94 / People: General Cable encompasses Cleaver
Sir Anthony Cleaver (above), a former chairman of IBM UK, has been appointed
a non-executive director of General Cable, the fast-growing telephone and
cable TV company, which is planning to float its shares on the stock market
later this year.
Sir Anthony, who is chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, is one of
three new directors joining the board of General Cable. It was founded in
1989 to develop the UK cable communications interests of France's Compagnie
Generale des Eaux. It has interests in nine cable franchises and has a
presence in three of the UK's biggest markets - suburban London, Birmingham
and Yorkshire - covering 1.6m homes and 102,000 businesses.
General Cable and its partners have invested Pounds 275m in the cable
franchises and claim to account for 19 per cent of all residential cable
telephone subscribers and 14 per cent of all cable TV subscribers in the UK.
General Cable is believed to be one of the first of a group of cable
companies coming to the stock market to raise funds for expansion.
Apart from Sir Anthony, the other new recruits to the General Cable
boardroom are George Gray, chairman of Serco, and Nigel Walmsley, chairman
of Carlton Television.
Philippe Galteau, General Cable's managing director, says Sir Anthony has
been recruited for his knowledge of international information technology;
Gray's expertise lay in the service sector and complex high level software.
Walmsley has been brought on board for his broadcasting background.
