FT  01 MAR 94 / Industrial unrest hits transport
Striking transport workers disrupted German cities yesterday as industrial
unrest spread from the engineering industry to the public sector, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt.
Bus and train drivers in the industrial heartland of North-Rhine Westphalia
prevented thousands from getting to work on time. Protest stoppages lasted
for several hours.
The action against calls by the employers for a wage freeze and benefit cuts
was the latest in a series of disputes over pay and job security which are
hitting the German economy as it struggles to emerge from recession.
