  [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, Jan 7 (AFP)--Israeli-backed 
militiamen opened fire at two tanks manned by Finnish 
peacekeepers in south Lebanon without causing casualties, a UN 
officer here said Friday [7 January]. 
  He told AFP that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon 
(UNIFIL) protested to Israel over Thursday's incident, which he 
said involved militiamen of the Israeli-trained and financed 
South Lebanese Army (SLA). 
  The tanks were crossing the al-Hamra' bridge, in the western 
sector of Israel's "security zone," on their way to UNIFIL in 
al-Naqurah, south of Tyre, when gunshots were fired in their 
direction, the officer said. 
  Israel told UNIFIL that the SLA forces were aiming at three 
unidentified commandos in the region, he said. 
  A Lebanese police spokesman reported that anti-Israeli 
forces 
late Thursday fired four rocket-propelled grenades at an SLA 
position on the bridge, prompting an immediate retaliation. 
There were no casualties. 
  Last month Israel suspended an Israeli tank commander who 
mistakenly opened fire in south Lebanon, killing a Norwegian UN 
officer and wounding another. 
  Norway and the United Nations lodged official protests with 
Israel over the incident.
