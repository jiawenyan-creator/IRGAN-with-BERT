  [Text] A responsible source in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen [DRY] has issued a statement to the ADEN NEWS AGENCY, in 
which he reported that the forces of the Sanaa rulers today 
continued their savage, iniquitous aggression against our people 
and Republic, the DRY. The source stressed that the aggression 
against our country and people, and its constant escalation, 
represented a naked violation of international legitimacy. The 
source also stressed that the Sanaa rulers were ignoring all 
appeals calling for an immediate cease-fire put out by worldwide 
well-wishers, who are anxious to see an end to bloodshed and the 
restoration of security and stability in Yemen, and in the 
region.
