FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thames returns
The return of Thames Television to the dealing screens produced wild price
swings as traders struggled to estimate a takeover price and to come to
terms with provisions that were worse than feared.
The shares shot up 32 earlier this week on reports that Pearson, the media,
banking and industrial conglomerate, was in talks with Thorn EMI, parent of
Thames. Subsequently, trading in the shares was suspended at 221p.
When dealing began again today the shares opened at 155p as Thames announced
that it was passing the dividend because of provisions of between Pounds 35m
and Pounds 42m, relating to its US arm and losses in property.
There was also reassessment of earlier estimates that an offer from Pearson
would be worth 250p a share. However, analysts still feel Thames could
command 200p a share and by the close the stock had rallied to stand 33 off
at 188p. Turnover was very thin at only 100,000 shares.
Pearson added 2 at 412p while Thorn dipped 5 to 880p.
The market's reaction to Pilkington's Pounds 80m five-year bond issue was to
switch out of the ordinary shares and into the bond/warrant issue. Dealers
said the new issue meant that buyers of the bond could convert into the
ordinary shares at 120p a share. Pilkington slipped 9 1/2 to 115 1/2 p on
heavy turnover of 16m shares.
The suspension of Queens Moat Houses shares on Wednesday led to a worrying
time for the banks sector.
Barclays was said to have been the worst affected, the shares sliding 6 to
413p after hints in the market that the bank's exposure to the company could
run to around Pounds 165m.
Royal Bank of Scotland added 7 at 271p, still boosted by recent profits
upgrades.
Results from Next were well received and prompted analysts to upgrade
sharply. Analysts came away reassured that the company was not planning any
major acquisitions.
The shares responded by jumping 11 to 172p on large turnover of 12m.
Analysts returned from a two-day visit to Hazlewood Food reassured and the
shares rose 5 to 184p.
Mining group RTZ rose 7 to 703p on good demand for gold, higher copper
prices and the lingering effects of RTZ's increased scrip alternative to its
final dividend.
Gloom around construction equipment company BM Group, which announced a fall
in interim profits and a restructuring plan earlier this week, intensified,
causing a slide in the stock. The shares dived 13 to close at 18p, an
eight-year low, in heavy trading which saw turnover rise to 9.2m. British
Building &amp; Eng Appliances, in which BM has a majority stake that it has put
up for sale, eased 3 to 285p.
The market was cheered by improved results and an acquisition from
Spirax-Sarco and the shares improved 8 to 357p. TI Group added 6 at 305p on
news that German group Mannesman raised its holding to 7.7 per cent.
Talk of an impending order for Airbus aircraft boosted British Aerospace,
which holds a 20 per cent stake in the Airbus consortium. The shares
hardened 8 to 283p.
Speculation of further disposals lifted international trading group Lonrho
ahead of today's annual meeting. The shares gained 3 to 85p.
Shares in Vickers shed a penny to 129p after brokers Hoare Govett and
Cazenove placed the rump of the recent rights issue, which had a 92.6 per
cent take-up. The outstanding block of 2.4m was placed at 127p.
