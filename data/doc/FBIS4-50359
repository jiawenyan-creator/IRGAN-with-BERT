  [Text] Dalian, China, May 17 KYODO -- A large industrial 
complex for Japanese enterprises has been completed in Dalian, 
Liaoning Province, northeastern China. 
  About 70 manufacturing enterprises, mostly Japanese, will be 
invited to build production facilities in the 
2.2-square-kilometer complex in the city's economic and 
technology development district, officials said. 
  Seventeen firms, including auto parts, steel and towel 
manufacturers, have already signed contracts to secure space. 
  About 3,200 foreign firms, including 591 from Japan, had 
established offices or plants in the quickly developing city as 
of last August, they said. 
  As a result, the city's Japanese population doubled to about 
2,000 in the last one and a half years, they said. 
  China and Japan began the joint 3.5 billion yen project in 
October 1992.
