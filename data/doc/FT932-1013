FT  25 JUN 93 / Observer: Changed address
Oh the problems of living in a pluralistic democracy] Senior Russian
military officers booked for a course on the topic in London next week have
already had their programme altered.
One of the scheduled speakers has succumbed to an attack of the self-same
problems and resigned. He is Michael Mates, who was to have addressed them
on 'the Northern Ireland experience'.
Brief as his experience as Northern Ireland minister may have been, Mates
could have drawn for material on other personal recollections of the
province. The former lieutenant colonel started his army career with the
Royal Ulster Rifles, a regiment that has since . . .er . . . disappeared.
Even so, the sidelined speaker might still wish to attend the course. One of
its declared aims is 'to address problems of retraining the large numbers of
officers made redundant'.
