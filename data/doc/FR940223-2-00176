SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Chapter Nineteen of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for replacing
judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from Canada, Mexico,
or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously
review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty
law of the importing country. 




In instances in which one of the Parties to the Agreement alleges, pursuant to Article 1904.13 of the Agreement, that
(a)(i) a member of a panel materially violated the rules of conduct, (ii) the panel seriously departed from a fundamental
rule of procedure, or (iii) the panel manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction, and that (b) any
of the actions set out in (a) has materially affected the panel's decision and threatens the integrity of the binational
panel review process, that Party may request formation of an extraordinary challenge committee (``ECC''). Extraordinary
challenge committee review is therefore not a routine appeal. Rather, as the name suggests, Canada, Mexico, or the
United States may have recourse to an ECC only in extraordinary cases. 




Title IV of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103182, 107 Stat.
2057, amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement. 



The 

NAFTA Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules 

are intended to give effect to the ECC provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement by setting forth the procedures
for commencing, conducting, and completing extraordinary challenge proceedings. These rules are the result of
negotiations among Canada, Mexico, and the United States in compliance with the terms of the Agreement, and are derived
in large part from the 

Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules 

under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
