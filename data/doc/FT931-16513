FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tobacco family takes the wheel at Thwaites
UNCERTAINTY over the future of Thwaites, the dumper truck maker, has been
resolved in a deal that switches control from executors of the founder, the
late Mr Basil Thwaites, to the Wills tobacco family.
The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, follows an announcement a year
ago by Thwaites that it was exploring a possible sale of the company.
Along with all UK construction equipment companies, the company has been hit
by a sharp fall in demand and takeover by a Far Eastern-based group looking
for a European manufacturing base initially seemed the most likely outcome.
However, as conditions worsened throughout last year the sums offered failed
to meet with shareholders' expectations. In June, a proposed purchase by BM
Group was withdrawn after it was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The transaction announced this week will transfer full ownership of Thwaites
to Lord Dulverton of the Wills family and his brother Mr Ian Wills. The
family has been a substantial minority shareholder for more than 20 years.
Mr John Webb continues as managing director. Lord Dulverton becomes deputy
chairman, and Mr John Given has been appointed non-executive chairman.
Although the deal is very different from what many observers had originally
predicted, it is a significant boost for Thwaites. In the three years since
Mr Thwaites died, the company has been in limbo, said Mr Webb, and the
transaction would restore a 'clarity of direction.'
However, the priority for Thwaites remains to clinch a joint manufacturing
deal with a foreign company, enabling the company to broaden its product
range and provide more work for its under-utilised plant.
Thwaites incurred a deficit in the year to last August, on sales of about
Pounds 10m. Sales in the current year should be slightly higher, said Mr
Webb.
'We think the UK market will recover, but France and Germany are extremely
iffy.'
