RAMS' BRASS NEEDS A NEW BATTLE PLAN 
The way I see it, when the general isn't too smart, the army isn't going to 
win. 
John Robinson used Curt Warner for more than two quarters and thoroughly messed 
up the whole Ram offense. General John should have realized that Curt no longer 
had the magic touch, nor is he likely to regain it in the future. If Robinson 
ever realizes that Cleveland Gary is the man of the future, then we might start 
winning the war again.
