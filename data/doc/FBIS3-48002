  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- An 11-man North 
Korean delegation led by Hwang Chang-yop, a secretary of the 
Worker's Party Central Committee and chairman of the Supreme 
People's Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee, has spent the last 
three days in the special economic zone [SEZ] in Zhuhai, 
Guangdong Province, collecting information on Chinese economic 
reforms, a city official said Friday. 
  The North Koreans arrived in the southwestern port on 
Wednesday and spent the following day touring factories in an 
industrial complex. 
  Hwang expressed deep interest in industrial development in 
the area on meeting Zhuhai Party Committee Secretary and Mayor 
Liang Guangda, the Chinese official told YONHAP in a telephone 
interview. 
  The North Koreans left the city early Friday with material 
on 
economic reforms, the official said. 
  Beijing was trying to keep the visit secret in respect for 
Pyongyang's position. 
  "The three-day visit to Zhuhai is noteworthy because of the 
status of Hwang Chang-yop," a Western diplomat in Hong Kong 
said. "It is interesting to see North Korea so interested in 
Chinese-style economic reform."
