SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN MARINO; 
TREE RECYCLING PLAN SET UP 
For the first time, the city will recycle residents' Christmas trees. 
"For San Marino, this is a start," said Keith Till, acting city manager. "Every 
little bit helps." 
Residents can take trees to Lacy Park from 9 a.m. to noon on Thursday. Workers 
will run the trees through a "chipper," grinding them into recyclable material. 
The service is part of the community's new comprehensive recycling program. 
Residents, who may be asked to show driver's licenses, are asked to remove 
nails or other protrusions from trees.
