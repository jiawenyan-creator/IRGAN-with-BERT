THE SIDELINES; 
CHARGERS FIRING REPORT DENIED 
Chargers owner Alex Spanos denied a report that General Manager Bobby Beathard 
talked him out of firing Coach Dan Henning after the team lost three of its 
first four games. 
Beathard also denied the report by Gary Myers on the Home Box Office program 
"Inside the NFL" program before it was broadcast Wednesday night. 
"Believe me, there is absolutely nothing to it. He (Spanos) has never mentioned 
anything like that," Beathard said during the Chargers' practice Wednesday. 
"The only thing he said is, 'I want to do well and I hope Dan can pull us out 
of it,' but nothing like this." 
Spanos, who also attended the practice, was equally emphatic. "This is all 
(nonsense)," he said. "I don't know where these things come from. It drives me 
crazy."
