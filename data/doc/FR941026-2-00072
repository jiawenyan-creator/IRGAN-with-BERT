<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 29, 1994, IC Corp, ICRR, Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. (KCSI), and the Kansas City Southern Railway
Company (KCSR) (collectively applicants) filed a notice of intent to file an application seeking Commission approval
and authorization for: (1) IC Corp's acquisition of control of and merger with KCSI; and (2) the resulting common control
of ICRR and KCSR by IC Corp. Applicants have submitted a proposed voting trust agreement/management plan for which
they seek an informal opinion stating that the proposal effectively insulates IC Corp (the settlor of the trust) from
any violation of 49 U.S.C. 11343. The Commission here seeks comments on that issue and other related issues.

<DATE>
DATES:

 Written comments must be filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and served on applicants no later than November

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In this transaction, IC Corp will acquire 100% of the stock of KCSI. The acquisition will occur as a part of a transaction
in which: (1) KCSI will effect a reorganization in which it distributes complete ownership of its financial services
and information processing operations to the holders of KCSI's common stock; and (2) IC Corp will place its stock in
its subsidiary, ICRR, rather than the carrier to be acquired (KCSR) or its parent (KCSI), into an independent voting
trust. 



IC Corp proposes to acquire KCSI, which controls KCSR, without Commission authority. Section 11343 (49 U.S.C. 11343),
the provision governing consolidations, mergers, and acquisition of control, requires that Commission authority
be obtained for the acquisition of control of a carrier by any number of carriers or the acquisition of control of at
least two carriers by a person that is not a carrier. After IC Corp places its shares of ICRR stock into trust, the holding
company will immediately acquire control of KCSR. Applicants state that, while awaiting approval of the transaction
by the Commission, ICRR and KCSR will be operated independently. The parties anticipate that the independent voting
trust will terminate upon approval of common control by the Commission. 


In connection with the placement of ICRR stock into the voting trust, certain major personnel changes will be effected:
(1) IC Corp's and ICRR's current chairman of the board, president/Chief Executive Officer/director, and chief financial
officer will resign their positions with ICRR and assume identical positions at KCSR, but will retain their positions
with IC Corp; (2) their positions at ICRR will be filled, respectively, by ICRR's current senior vice president_marketing,
senior vice president_operations, and controller; (3) all ICRR officers who will remain with ICRR, and who presently
occupy positions with IC Corp, will resign from their positions with the holding company; and (4) several outside
directors will resign their positions on the IC Corp board and will become directors of ICRR. 

Certain shippers and labor interests have identified concerns associated with applicants' proposal. For this reason,
and because of the uniqueness of the proposal, we have decided to review it ourselves rather than delegating the matter
to agency staff. To assist us in that review, we seek public comment on: (1) whether the proposal sufficiently insulates
IC Corp from controlling ICRR prior to Commission approval of IC Corp's common control of KCSR and ICRR; (2) whether
certain conditions should be imposed on the trust arrangements; and (3) whether KCSR employees are entitled to labor
protection. Interested parties are also invited to comment on any other issues or concerns they deem relevant to the
voting trust/management plan. 

We invite interested persons to submit written comments on applicants' proposal. Comments must be filed by November
15, 1994. Applicants may reply by November 25, 1994.





Decided: October 19, 1994.





By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, and Commissioners Simmons, Morgan, and Owen. Vice
Chairman Phillips recused herself in this proceeding.
