  [Text] The Indonesian Government's decision to allow seven 
East Timorese students to leave for Lisbon should not be 
questioned. Susilo Sudarman, coordinating minister for politics 
and security affairs, said this to reporters after attending a 
coordinated meeting on politics and security in Jakarta 
yesterday. The seven students, who had tried to obtain 
political asylum at the Swedish and Finnish Embassies on 23 
June, left the country for Portugal via Jakarta's Sukarno-Hatta 
Airport yesterday. The students received travel arrangement 
assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
  As for the letter smuggled out of Jakarta's Cipinang prison 
by Xanana Gusmao, leader of East Timor GPK [Security Disturbance 
Movement], Susilo Sudarman said relevant authorities are now 
investigating the matter. The letter, which had been published 
in Portuguese media, called on the Portugese Government to help 
release him from jail.
