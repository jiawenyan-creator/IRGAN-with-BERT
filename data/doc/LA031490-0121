ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COAST PANEL STAFF BACKS MOLA PLAN 
The staff of the California Coastal Commission is recommending approval of a 
developer's restoration plan for 41.4 acres of wetlands in northwest Seal 
Beach. The commission is scheduled to vote on the plan today. 
Mola Development Corp. is financing and coordinating the $4-million, five-year 
program in exchange for approval of the company's planned development by the 
commission and city. Mola wants to build a $300-million, 329-unit residential 
development on the Hellman Ranch property, adjacent to the wetlands. 
The commission conditionally approved the development earlier this year and 
asked Mola to revise and resubmit the restoration plan. 
Commission staff had asked Mola to obtain an endorsement of the plan from 
California Department of Fish and Game and to modify the plan to include an 
additional two acres of low marsh habitat. 
Mola has complied with the requests and should have no problem getting approval 
for the plan, staff analyst Larry Simon said. 
The 41.4-acre wetlands will include nine acres of open water and 31 of high and 
low marsh habitat. 
"This is a very exciting restoration project," said Mola project director Kirk 
Evans.
