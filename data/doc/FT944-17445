FT  08 OCT 94 / Commuter anger explodes
Stranded Indian commuters went on a rampage yesterday, burning railway
carriages, looting shops and attacking buses after a derailed train halted
peak-hour traffic into Bombay. Irate commuters attacked railway property at
about 11 suburban railway stations, beating up railway staff, burning
furniture and stealing cash from ticket offices. At least 34 people were
taken to hospital, including 20 railway staff. Police opened fire at
Bhayandar to quell angry mobs, and used batons elsewhere to try to maintain
order. Police said at least 70 buses were damaged, while 10 carriages of a
train were set ablaze. Passengers pulled out the seats from another train
and made them into a bonfire.
More than 500 suburban trains were cancelled because of the day-long
violence. Hundreds of commuters squatted on the tracks blocking trains into
the evening. Railway staff said train services would be disrupted for at
least 48 hours because of the violence and damage. It was the fourth time
since July that violent commuters had attacked railway property following
the disruption of services. Bombay's suburban railways carry more than three
million commuters a day into the banking and commercial centre.
