FT  20 OCT 93 / Air France strikers bring Paris airports to standstill
STRIKING Air France workers brought chaos to the two main airports in Paris
yesterday, blocking runways and forcing flights to be cancelled for much of
the afternoon.
The protests are the most serious to be launched against the lossmaking
airline's recovery plan, which was announced last month. The plan involves
the loss of 4,000 jobs by the end of next year and the implementation of
economy measures, including reduced overtime pay.
Both Charles De Gaulle and Orly airports were paralysed by the protests,
although Orly was reopened in the afternoon after three hours. However,
Aeroports de Paris, the airport authority, said the situation remained very
difficult at Orly because of the backlog of disrupted flights, while Charles
De Gaulle remained closed.
Air France said it was unclear what the situation would be today. But he
said it was likely that flights serving destinations in Europe, Turkey and
Israel would be cancelled. Air France said that between five and 10
long-haul flights were expected to operate from Charles De Gaulle tomorrow.
Mr Bernard Attali, Air France chairman, condemned the protests, spearheaded
by two union federations, Force Ouvriere and the leftwing Confederation du
Travail. He said the cancelled flights yesterday would cost the airline
about FFr70m (Dollars 12.4m).
Mr Attali has argued that the recovery plan is the only way to ensure the
survival of Air France, which lost FFr3.8bn in the first half of the year.
He said the protests would not affect the implementation of the plan and
that involuntary redundancies would be kept to a minimum.
'One can understand the worries of our personnel, but nothing can excuse the
damage to the company,' Mr Attali said in a statement to employees. 'These
actions will weaken the company and deal it a serious blow at the worst
time.'
