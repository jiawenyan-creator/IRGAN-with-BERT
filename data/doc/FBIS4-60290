the Ministry of Health announced today the following: After the 
conclusion of the Hajj rites by the pilgrims of God's holy 
shrine and their departure from Mina to holy Mecca for their 
homebound journey and, after having taken note of the daily 
statements on the number of those who have suffered sun stroke, 
have fallen victim to heat exhaustion, or have died during the 
period between 1 Dhi al- Hijjah 1414 H. and yesterday, Monday, 
12 Dhi al-Hijjah 1414 H, he said: 
  1) The number of cases of sun strokes were 646; sufferers 
were treated immediately. 
  2) The number of those who suffered from heat exhaustion 
were 
5,754; victims were transferred to hospital for treatment. 
  3) The number of deaths caused by old age, heart attacks, 
and 
other causes were 829, including the number of deaths that took 
place during today's stone-throwing ceremony [at Mina], which

  The source concluded his statement by beseeching Almighty 
God 
to bless the souls of the pilgrims who have died as they were 
performing the ordinance of Hajj. May God's mercy be upon their 
souls and may God look upon them as martyrs. God is all-hearing 
and all-answering.
