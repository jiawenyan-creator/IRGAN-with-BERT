FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon shows 10% dip
Shares in Willis Corroon Group, one of the UK's leading insurance brokers,
fell 47 1/2 p to 191 1/2 p yesterday, after the company surprised analysts
with a decline in profits for the first quarter of 1994.
A sharp fall in contributions from its US businesses resulted in pre-tax
profits falling by 10 per cent, from Pounds 47.1m to Pounds 42.2m, for the
three months to end-March.
The first quarter contributes a substantial portion of profits, and brokers
immediately marked down their full-year forecasts by up to Pounds 25m - to
between Pounds 70m and Pounds 75m.
The company said that April had been 'another difficult month', with
continuing problems in the US, but a satisfactory performance elsewhere.
Turnover fell by Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 192.5m, but revenues from continuing
operations rose by just 2 per cent to Pounds 192.2m.
Interest and investment income fell Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 10.1m, as a result
of falling interest rates; the company, however, was a net beneficiary of
currency movements to the tune of Pounds 2.2m.
Operating profit from the UK showed an increase to Pounds 37m (Pounds
34.8m), but Willis was hit by a Pounds 6.7m decline in US contributions to
Pounds 200,000.
The US business was affected by the loss of 70 construction risk brokers to
a competitor, which could result in the loss of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) of
revenue for the full year, although a replacement team is now in place.
In addition, Willis has suffered from falling business and reduced rates on
its substantial US casualty insurance business.
In the UK, reinsurance renewals in January were 'satisfactory', and total
revenues from reinsurance and specialist business grew by 4 per cent in the
first quarter.
Earnings per share fell by 1p to 6.1p. A second interim dividend of 1.65p is
declared, maintaining the total to date at 3.3p.
