Background 



On June 8, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by Maui Pineapple Company,
Ltd., Kahului, HI, and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, alleging that an industry in
the United States is materially injured by reason of LTFV imports of canned pineapple fruit from Thailand. Accordingly,
effective June 8, 1994, the Commission instituted antidumping investigation No. 731TA706 (Preliminary).


Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30951). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on June 29, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 

The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on July 25, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2798 (July 1994), entitled ``Canned Pineapple Fruit
from Thailand: Investigation No. 731TA706 (Preliminary).''
