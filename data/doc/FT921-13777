FT  20 JAN 92 / Appointments: Financial moves
John Holmes, once head of one of the City's biggest integrated securities
operations at Morgan Grenfell Securities, has returned to basics: the small
institutional broking business of Credit Lyonnais Laing.
For the French-owned broking firm, Holmes is a significant catch; his move
underlines CLL's progress over the past year (market share in UK equities
has risen by around half - though it is still modest). For Holmes, the move
represents a return to what he considers his main strengths - research and
sales. From today he is heading the firm's 25-strong institutional sales
team.
Having become a managing director of another integrated house in London  -
Morgan Stanley - after the demise of Morgan Grenfell Securities, Holmes left
to start an agency broking firm with Peter Quinnen, former head of James
Capel, last year. That, though, came to nothing because of the pair's
inability to attract enough research and sales 'stars' from other houses.
'We did raise enough capital,' Holmes says. 'Sadly, in the current economic
conditions very few people were prepared to take the risk and start up in
business themselves.'
