FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Dow Jones in sponsored videos
move
The world of public relations and corporate sponsored videos is joining the
multimedia revolution. Medialink, the international video public relations
company and the Multimedia Division of Dow Jones will announce today plans
to deliver sponsored videos to the desktop computers of professional
investors.
Under the deal, business organisations will be able to transmit information
on new products, corporate announcements or annual meetings to subscribers
of the new Dow Jones Investor Network.
The video network launched last September is aimed mainly at research
analysts and portfolio managers and according to Dow Jones is already
available to 'more than 300 professionals'.
Reuters, the news and information group is launching a similar service in
Europe next month aimed at the foreign exchange and debt markets.
Like the Reuters service, the Dow Jones Network only offers a burst of video
when there are events that are potential market movers.
Medialink is paying Dow Jones Investor Network to broadcast its video
information, subject to the normal rules of decency and legality.
'This is a way for companies to get specific messages to the investment
community without any outside editorial control,' said Mr Simon Langdon,
director of business operations for the DJIN.
The president of Medialink, Mr Laurence Moskowitz, yesterday described the
exclusive deal as 'an historic event for the public relations and investor
relations industries.'
