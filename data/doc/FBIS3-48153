  [Text] Acting Australian foreign affairs minister Gordon 
Bilney has confirmed North Korea has approached Australia about 
resuming normal diplomatic ties. Mr. Bilney says informal talks 
have been held recently in Southeast Asian capitals. Mr. Bilney 
says Australia has some requirements that must be met before 
relations can be resumed. 
  [Begin Bilney recording] There are a number of conditions 
which the North Koreans would have to meet before we move any 
further along this track, including, explicitly, adherence to 
IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards with (?at 
the moment) of course the chairman of the IAEA board of 
governors, a resolution of the political [word indistinct] talks 
with the South Koreans, and progress in its relations with the 
United States. Those are three things. We are not acting alone. 
We are not going solo on any particular initiative with this 
and the DPRK. [end recording]
