  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has stressed that, for 
the salvation of Cyprus, he is pursuing what he considers to be 
the proper policy, on the basis of his own judgment and 
considering all positions, and that he does not judge what he 
must do according to the views expressed by each political 
leader. Mr. Kliridhis said this to correspondents this morning 
when commenting on the opposition of the Democratic Party and 
the socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] to 
the confidence-building measures. Asked to comment on the 
statement by EDEK Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis that any measures 
that are not direct would be disastrous, President Kliridhis 
said this is just the view of Mr. Lissaridhis. 
  President Kliridhis made these remarks today while visiting 
the Maronite community on the occasion of the holiday for St. 
John Maronas, the patron saint of the Maronites. In an address 
at a gathering of the Maronites, President Kliridhis said any 
Cyprus solution that does not provide for the freedoms of 
return, movement, and settlement would not be acceptable either 
to him personally or to anyone who struggles for the true 
freedom of the island.
