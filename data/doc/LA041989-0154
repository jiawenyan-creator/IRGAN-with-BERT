MEDIA EXECUTIVE IN TEXAS TO BUY PASADENA PAPER 
William Dean Singleton has agreed to buy the Pasadena Star-News and a group of 
smaller affiliated newspapers in California from Knight-Ridder Inc. for $55 
million, the communications company said today. 
Singleton, who has interests in 22 other dailies, including the Houston Post 
and the Denver Post through MediaNews Group Inc. of Houston, will form Pasadena 
Newspapers Inc. to purchase the properties, an assistant said. 
The sale to Singleton, who is vice chairman and chief executive officer of 
MediaNews, includes four semiweekly newspapers in Southern California -- the 
Arcadia Tribune, the Duartean, the Monrovia News-Post and the Temple City 
Times, Knight-Ridder said. The four newspapers are part of Foothill Intercity 
Newspapers and have a combined circulation of 23,600, Knight-Ridder spokeswoman 
Lee Ann Schlatter said.
