FT  07 MAR 92 / Heseltine blocks housing plans
PROPOSALS to build 3,000 houses in the A45 corridor near Cambridge have been
rejected by Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary.
He also rejected plans for a business park of more than 1m sq ft which was
part of the scheme. He said the business park ran counter to the planning
polices for the Cambridge area.
