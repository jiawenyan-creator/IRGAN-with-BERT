BFN 

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda the Rwandan Patrotic Front [RPF] is 
advancing toward Gitarama, south of Kigali. [passage omitted] 
  The RPF would be happy to see a humanitarian force which 
would be tasked with establishing security zones in the east and 
south of the country, but the Front rebels will not hear of an 
intervention force to halt the fighting. 
  Faustin Twagiramungu, a Hutu member of the opposition, who 
should have become prime minister in the framework of the Arusha 
peace agreement, agrees with this. He was the guest on our 
magazine programme at 0820. Francois Rijkmans asked him what he 
wants from the West: 
  [Begin Twagiramungu recording] They can do a lot. For 
example, first by stopping the massacres, by putting pressure on 
the clique which is currently massacring people. And second, by 
giving substantial aid to the survivors, to the refugees. And 
third, by helping to ensure that (?this force can come), with a 
[word indistinct] redefinition of its mandate, as part of 
humanitarian aid, because aid is needed both in the zones 
occupied by the RPF and in the zones that are not occupied by 
the RPF. There are unfortunate victims everywhere in both these 
cases. [end recording]
