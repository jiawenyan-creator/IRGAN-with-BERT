  [Text] Belarusian leader Stanislav Shushkevich has put his 
signature to the Treaty on Collective Security of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
  CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya told INTERFAX 
Shushkevich had done so since, as he said in a note to 
Korotchenya, Belarus's previous form of joining the treaty had 
been given "ambiguous interpretations." 
  Several months ago, Shushkevich sent out letters to the 
Commonwealth heads of state saying that the legislature had 
instructed him to sign the treaty. He told parliament he 
considered the letters to be a formalization of Belarus's 
membership in the CIS collective security system.
