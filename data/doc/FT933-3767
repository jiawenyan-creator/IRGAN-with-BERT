FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonds to browse through
GILTS ARE not the only kind of sterling bonds. Below Michael Dyson, director
of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Capital Markets describes some other fixed
interest instruments which might be useful to the private investor (with
details in the table). BZW is a market maker and cannot deal with private
clients direct so those interested in buying bonds should approach a broker.
THERE are many hundreds of sterling bonds to choose from and a growing
number of stockbrokers and advisers are making excellent use of direct bond
holdings. Nevertheless, UK investors are still a long way behind investors
on the continent and in the US.
The income and final capital value of a bond will be known at the time of
purchase and will not change. In addition, any capital gains that arise on
the following instruments will not give rise to a CGT liability (except in
the case of zero dividend preference shares, which are not bonds, but are
effectively fixed rate securities).
The following illustrations highlight several diverse investor demands and
the sterling bonds we would recommend as a possible solution.
The retired investor who wants a very high income but does not want to
surrender his capital to an annuity.
A portfolio of perpetuals (fixed income instruments which will never be
repaid) would be ideal for this investor.
Our recommendations would include Coventry Building Society PIBS, currently
paying an income of 9.19 per cent and the Birmingham Corp's 3.5 per cent
bonds, priced at 43.25 to yield 8.09 per cent.
The latter were originally issued in 1881 and are redeemable at 100 at any
time on one year's notice.
An investor who wants to retire in 2002, and as a higher rate taxpayer, does
not want to receive any further investment income before retirement.
Zero dividend preference shares could be appealing for this investor as they
produce no taxable income and the capital gain is deferred until after
retirement, at which point the investor will have a lower overall tax
liability from other sources.
In this instance, we would recommend the Schroder Split Investment Trust
Zeros, where the price will rise from the current level of 108.5 to 202.76
on repayment in 2002. The gain equates to a gross redemption yield of 7.57
per cent, equivalent to a net return of 6.96 per cent, assuming inflation at
5 per cent and CGT of 25 per cent. The nearest comparable gilt offers 6.95
per cent gross and 3.44 per cent net.
Also attractive for this investor would be the Henderson Eurotrust zeros at
the slightly lower, but better covered, yield of 7.45 per cent. The
Henderson zeros will rise from the current level of 36 to 70 in 2002.
Another zero which we find attractive (although it is not a solution for
this particular problem) is the Sphere Investment Trust issue. The wind-up
date of the trust is the end of October 1995. The repayment price of the
zeros at that date is 107.5, giving a yield to redemption of 7.33 per cent
gross on the current price of 92. (The net figure in the table is based on
the same assumptions as for the Schroder zero.)
The beauty of a share such as the Sphere zero is that there are already
sufficient assets to repay the final price in full. In other words, even if
the investment trust fails to grow, the zero's repayment is safe.
An offshore investor seeking a long term high income.
The Royal Bank of Scotland 9.5 per cent Eurosterling bond trades at 108.375
and will provide a gross income of 8.75 per cent per annum until at least
2018 (when RBS has the right to repay the bond). This is equivalent to a
gross redemption yield of 8.5 per cent.
The investor may wish to balance his investment with a purchase of another
bond such as Woolwich's 7 per cent 1998 Eurosterling bond at 100 to give a 7
per cent income yield for five years (GRY of 6.89 per cent).
The investor who is concerned that inflation will rise again.
The second Severn Bridge, currently under construction, was funded by the
issue of Severn River Crossing 6 per cent index-linked debenture.
Trading at 119, this issue offers a very high real return of 4.66 per cent
over and above the rate of inflation, compared to 3.24 per cent from the
equivalent index-linked gilt.
