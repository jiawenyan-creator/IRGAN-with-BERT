FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bethlehem splits two steel
plants into separate units
BETHLEHEM Steel, the second-largest US steel manufacturer, announced
yesterday that it was splitting its two large plants into separate business
units in order to make them more financially accountable and to bring them
closer to their customers.
The move is a significant departure for a company which has a reputation as
one of the more conservative of America's integrated steel manufacturers.
It is one of the first initiatives by the company's new chairman, Mr Curtis
Barnette, who was formerly Bethlehem Steel's senior vice-president.
Mr Barnette took over as chairman late last year on the retirement of Mr
Walter Williams.
The new units are based on the company's two flat rolled steel plants at
Burns Harbor, Indiana, and Sparrows Point, Maryland.
The two plants together produce some 7.5m tons of steel a year.
Each plant will now be responsible for its own marketing, operations and
financial performance.
As part of the move, Bethlehem's product marketing operations, which are
currently run from group headquarters in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, will be
split between the two units.
The move will make Bethlehem's structure similar to that of low-cost
mini-mills.
The mini-mills, which make steel from scrap metal, have made substantial
inroads over the past 20 years into markets that were once dominated by the
integrated manufacturers.
Mr Barnette said that 'major benefits of the business unit structure include
improved customer focus, responsiveness, speed of decision-making, employee
commitment and business awareness.
'It places the responsibility for the success of the business in the hands
of those at the division level.'
