 

A third commenter on a previous version of the CIPI 
recommended that we investigate the effects on interest rate 
changes of changing structures of hospital bond ratings. If 
bond ratings are deteriorating, hospitals incur higher 
interest rates; if bond ratings improve, hospitals incur 
lower interest rates. Our CIPI currently recognizes only 
changes in pure interest rates and does not recognize 
changes in effective interest rates due to changes in bond 
ratings. 
We examined a hospital municipal bond data base from 
Securities Data Inc. to examine this issue. This data 
showed that serial bonds dominated short-term bonds and term 
bonds dominated long-term bonds (Figure 4). We classified 
all bond amounts by ratings found in the data base for the 
years 1980 to 1992. We defined bonds rated as Baa1 or above 
as ``Investment Grade'' bonds; all others were ``Non-Investment 
Grade''. The percentage distribution of the issuance-amount-rated bonds in Figure 5 (percentage amounts applied
to 
dollar amount of debt issuance) indicates no discernible 
trend in upward or downward ratings over the period. We 
conclude that there is no evidence to justify a component 
for deteriorating bond ratings in the CIPI.

E. Projection of the CIPI for Fiscal Year 1995 


We project a 0.9 percent increase in the CIPI for FY 
1995 (Table 3 and Figure 6). This is the outcome of a 3.1 
percent increase in projected weighted depreciation prices 
in FY 1995 offset by a 3.6 percent decline in vintage- 
weighted interest rates in FY 1995. 


F. ProPAC Input Price Index 


1. Introduction 


Three major differences distinguish ProPAC's CIPI from 
HCFA's CIPI: 
&bull;The ProPAC CIPI measures changes in capital asset 
purchase prices in the year the asset is purchased. HCFA's 
CIPI is designed to measure changes in a vintage-weighted 
composite of capital asset purchase prices. 
&bull;The ProPAC CIPI uses capital asset purchase price 
proxies that differ from HCFA's.
