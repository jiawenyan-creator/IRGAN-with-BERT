FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Philips offer to Super Club
holders
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to offer minority shareholders in
Super Club, its loss-making Belgian-based video rental chain, BFr150
(Dollars 4 1/2 ) per share for the 49 per cent of the company which it does
not already own, writes Ronald van de Krol.
Instead of cash, Super Club shareholders may also choose to receive warrants
on Philips shares worth BFr225 each, the liquidators of Swiss-based Super
Club Holding said.
They said that the price of BFr150 had been agreed with leading minority
shareholders, but it is not yet clear whether all shareholders will be
prepared to accept Philips' offer.
If all the minority shareholders choose the cash alternative, Philips will
have to pay BFr1.26bn to take full control over Super Club.
