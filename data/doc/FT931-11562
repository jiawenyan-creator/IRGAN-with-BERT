FT  02 FEB 93 / Observer: Key to spying
Controversy always surrounds America's number one spy. So when Jim Woolsey
appears before the US Senate today for confirmation hearings on his
suitability as the next head of the CIA, he can expect a third-degree
interrogation.
Liberals will want to know whether he is a cold war warrior in disguise
while the conservatives will want to be reassured that he is hawkish enough
for their tastes. Like his new commander-in-chief, the 51-year-old Woolsey
started in the sticks - Oklahoma - before climbing that well known path to
power: Stanford, opposition to the war in Vietnam, a Rhodes scholarship to
Oxford and Yale Law School.
But Jim Woolsey is not as buttoned-down as he seems. Just as his president
seeks relief with the saxophone, Woolsey is a fiendish ballroom dancer, a
one-time instructor at the Arthur Murray school. He is also a deep devotee
of baseball, and not above drawing lessons from the game that are applicable
to intelligence-gathering.
One thing he will have to come to grips with, however, is a change in
life-style. After a particularly good party a few weeks ago, Woolsey
received a late night call from the CIA. Would the director-designate please
close his front door and, while he was at it, kindly stop leaving the key
under the mat.
