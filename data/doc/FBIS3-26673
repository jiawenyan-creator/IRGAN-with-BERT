  [Text] Pyongyang, February 12 (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said here today 
that his country did not change its position on settling the 
nuclear issue through dialogue and called on the United States 
to stop putting pressure on DPRK. 
  The spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry said since the 
U.S. had violated the agreement between the two countries, DPRK 
will not put much hope on its dialogue with the U.S. and will 
not bind by its previous promises. 
  He said the U.S. has recently told the DPRK that the nuclear 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
should be carried out with the sole aim of ensuring the 
continuity of the nuclear safety agreement and that the U.S. is 
willing to continue the talks between the two countries. 
  At the same time, the IAEA has also indicated that they 
would 
give up the demand for a comprehensive inspection and will only 
conduct those necessary for ensuring the continuity of the 
nuclear safety agreement, the spokesman said. 
  If these attitudes of the U.S. and IAEA are true, it will be 
a matter for rejoicing, the spokesman said.
