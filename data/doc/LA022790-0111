ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 
FIRM TO HELP WEIGH HIGH-SPEED RAIL BIDS 
An Anaheim engineering and consulting firm has been selected by the 
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission as one of five companies that 
will evaluate bids for building and operating a 300-m.p.h. rail system between 
Las Vegas and Anaheim. 
Willdan Associates has been selected, along with corporations from Southern 
California, Nevada, Colorado and Canada. 
Proposals to privately build and operate the train system are expected from 
Bechtel International of San Francisco, Morrison-Knudsen Co. of Boise, Idaho, 
and Bombardier Corp. of Canada. 
The bistate commission is scheduled to choose a proposal in October. 
Construction is scheduled between 1993 and 1997, although skeptics have said 
the train system cannot be built for the $4-billion estimated so far. 
Meanwhile, the Anaheim City Council on Tuesday will discuss giving the 
commission $200,000. Although state law mandates that the train be privately 
financed, public funds may be used in developing the project. 
The commission's executive director asked the city for funding this year to 
help identify the most attractive contractor for the job. 
Las Vegas and Clark County, Nev., are expected to give $85,000 each to the 
commission this year, and the Las Vegas Convention/Visitors Authority is 
expected to provide another $250,000. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN and LISA MASCARO
