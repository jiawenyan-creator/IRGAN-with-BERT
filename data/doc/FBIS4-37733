  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], state of 
Palestine president and PLO Executive Committee chairman, has 
issued instructions to set up committees to run municipal 
affairs in every city and village in the West Bank expected to 
come under the control of the Palestinian National Authority in 
the next few months, in accordance with the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements. 
  News reports cite a Palestinian source as saying that before 
his expected arrival in the occupied territories in July, 
Brother President Abu-'Ammar wants to resolve several matters 
which are considered remnants of the Israeli occupation, 
particularly the issue of municipalities, which are estimated at 
100 big and middle- sized municipalities, as well as 250 village 
councils. 
  The source added that Brother President Abu-'Ammar, who 
believes these municipalities and councils will have a basic 
role to play in the development process, and even in the 
political process, has given instructions to a number of 
specialized committees, set up during meetings of the 
Palestinian leadership, to contact qualified people to establish 
such committees.
