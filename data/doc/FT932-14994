FT  15 APR 93 / Pasqua stance on crime dismays Mitterrand
THE first serious split emerged yesterday between France's Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand and the new centre-right government when the
president objected to a report on law and order by Mr Charles Pasqua, the
hardline interior minister.
Officials close to the president said Mr Mitterrand had 'expressed
reservations' about Mr Pasqua's presentation at a cabinet meeting of
proposals to crack down on France's rising crime rate.
The president is believed to have been concerned about Mr Pasqua's failure
to refer specifically to last week's incidents when French police killed
three youths suspected of petty crimes.
The controversy over the deaths was stoked yesterday when two police
motorcyclists in Cherbourg fired shots at a 15-year-old boy suspected of
driving a stolen car. The boy was seriously injured when one policeman,
claiming to have aimed at a car tyre, shot him in the back.
The policeman was last night under guard pending an investigation. Last
week's police killings triggered violent riots in Paris and the northern
town of Tourcoing.
Mr Pasqua, one of the most vociferously right-wing members of the new
cabinet, last weekend issued an official apology to the victims' families.
The police have begun an official inquiry into the tragedies.
However, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, government spokesman, said that the interior
minister referred implicitly to the incidents at yesterday's cabinet meeting
by saying that the police must 'respect individual rights'. Mr Pasqua then
stressed the need to give police the means to curb the rise in crime.
Mr Pasqua later sought to calm the controversy. Speaking in parliament, he
repeated his apology to the bereaved families and described the police
action as 'unjustifiable'.
