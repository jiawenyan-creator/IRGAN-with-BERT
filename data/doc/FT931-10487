FT  09 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling
Sterling's inability to hold early levels around DM2.41 yesterday suggests
that, this time round, exchange markets were disinclined to believe the UK
Sunday papers. Reports that the Treasury and Bank of England do not want any
further rate cuts are not particularly convincing in the light of the
authorities' actual behaviour since sterling left the ERM. The over-riding
message is that the government is aiming for a resumption of growth, which
could well mean lower base rates around budget time. It is difficult to
avoid the implication that sterling must have further to fall.
Of course, the government cannot admit this. Sterling's violent lurch down
to DM2.37 at one stage yesterday underlines how quickly such a policy could
get out of hand. But a lower exchange rate would help exports, which would
be useful given the balance of payments constraint to consumer-led growth.
As long as there is no visible inflation threat, which might force another
U-turn, the government has no immediate reason to talk the exchange rate
back up. The debate over spending cuts remains theoretical for financial
markets. Actual measures to deal with the budget deficit are probably still
some way off. The problem will have to be addressed eventually, though, if
Mr Major wants the UK to avoid Sweden's humiliation of being downgraded by
Moody's credit rating agency.
