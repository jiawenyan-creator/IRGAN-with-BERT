YOUR BOOKSHELF: WATER AS CURE FOR ARTHRITIS PAINS; 
PAIN-FREE ARTHRITIS BY DVERA BERSON WITH SANDER ROY (S &amp; J BOOKS, P.O. BOX 
31, GRAVESEND STATION, BROOKLYN, N.Y. 11223: $16.95 POSTPAID) 
When she reached her mid-60s, Berson had just about given up hope of a normal 
life. For years, she had struggled with crippling osteoarthritis, the most 
common form of arthritis. Her classic symptoms, caused by inflammation of the 
joints, were "excruciating pains in my neck, back, hands and lower body." Yes, 
she had "doctored" a lot and tried traditional medical treatment: eight 
Bufferins a day, orthopedic surgery, traction, even shots of cortisone. 
By chance, while vacationing in Florida, Berson began exercising in a large 
swimming pool. Slowly, she devised a series of hydrotherapeutic techniques that 
changed her from a semi-invalid into a tolerably active woman. 
Her "programme," forming the heart of this resourceful book, involves relaxing, 
stretching and strengthening muscles in a pool of about 80-85 degrees. Though 
Berson typically covers many laps during her sessions, she floats rather than 
swims. Photos make her regimen look balletic, but she makes it clear that 
moving painful joints is never easy. 
Among specific suggestions for arthritis sufferers are reassessing prescribed 
drugs and exercise. An expensive club membership isn't necessary; to try 
hydrotherapy on your own, you might contact your local YMCA. The book must be 
ordered direct from the publisher. Also queries about a videotape of the 
exercises should be sent to the publisher. ROSELLE M. LEWIS
