ON THE FRITZ; 
AFTER TWO YEARS OF HEADY GROWTH, COMPUTER FIRMS HAVE HIT HARD TIMES, WITH NO 
RELIEF IN SIGHT 
The first inkling of bad news came last August from W. Jerry Sanders, chairman 
of Advanced Micro Devices. In a pronouncement reminiscent of Chicken Little's 
"the sky is falling," the flamboyant high-tech entrepreneur said an abrupt 
slowdown in semiconductor orders from personal computer manufacturers signaled 
nothing less than a downturn for the entire industry. 
Sanders' predictions were immediately dismissed as preposterous and hysterical. 
Few in the computer industry wanted to hear, let alone believe, that the future 
could be any less glorious than the previous two years. 
But Sanders has proven to be remarkably prescient. Not since the severe slump 
of 1985-86 has the computer industry been hit with such a stream of plant 
closings, large-scale employee layoffs, evaporating profits and disappointing 
sales. 
And crystal ball gazers are finding few reasons to be any more hopeful about 
the immediate future. 
"Generally speaking, we are looking at a slowdown," said Robert Charlton, an 
analyst with Dataquest, a high-tech market research firm. "All companies are 
going to feel some effects." 
In the last six months, chip makers National Semiconductor and Intel, computer 
manufacturers ranging from IBM and Apple Computer to low-end clone-maker 
Leading Edge and software publishers such as Microsoft all have reported 
financial setbacks. Unisys became the latest to chime in when it said late last 
month that it expects to post a loss of up to $80 million due to an 
"aberration" in its business operations. 
Although many industry executives still argue that these developments reflect 
problems at individual companies rather than an industrywide slump, a rising 
chorus of analysts is beginning to suggest otherwise. 
Their assessment: The market for computers and related office automation 
systems, which enjoyed explosive growth for the last two years, is now 
expanding more slowly because of creeping inflation, worries about the economy 
among corporate purchasing managers and a natural pause in buying while 
software programmers and customers alike catch up with the latest technology 
advances. 
Michele Preston, a personal computer market analyst with Salomon Bros. in New 
York, sees some striking similarities between the current climate and that of 
1985-86. 
As in the previous slowdown, Preston noted, the industry is coming off a 
tremendous boom that lured scores of new companies and products into the 
market. Not surprisingly, she added, "We now have too many companies again and 
there is another shakeout under way. The plain fact is that there are some 
companies that aren't going to be around for much longer." 
Already, Leading Edge has filed for bankruptcy protection. And last week Wyse 
Technology revealed that its lenders agreed to waive some their loan 
requirements because the company's recent losses have eroded its assets. 
Compounding the problem for some companies are earlier-laid plans to launch new 
products into what they thought would be a red-hot market. Despite the cooling, 
the product introductions continue at a boggling rate, in large part, analysts 
say, because companies want to protect their market shares and technology 
know-how. In the last two months alone, virtually every major computer 
manufacturer has introduced new products, ranging from entirely new systems to 
relatively unexciting product upgrades. 
Nevertheless, International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market research 
firm, predicts that sales of all types of computers in the United States will 
grow by just 3% this year, compared to 7% last year. The Commerce Department 
also is predicting slower growth. Commerce, however, is predicting a 10% 
increase in U.S. computer industry shipments this year, to about $67 billion, 
compared to a 14% increase in 1988. 
Even though sales continue to rise, analysts say the slower growth rate means 
that companies can't get away with some of the missteps they could in the past. 
"The last two years have been boom times," said Stewart Alsop, publisher of a 
personal computer newsletter in the Silicon Valley. "A lot of sins were hidden 
by that." 
So far, the slowdown, which has invaded most segments of the computer industry, 
has been most apparent in the personal computer market. Analysts say the 
industry's relative immaturity and heavy competition, as well as rapid advances 
that quickly make products obsolete, make PCs among the most vulnerable segment 
of the technology market when consumers' purse strings suddenly tighten. 
Another important influence is the growing supply of low-cost PCs imported from 
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. These systems are competing head-on with 
comparable machines produced by several U.S. companies, notably Wyse 
Technology, AST Research and Dell Computer. 
When the entire market was rapidly expanding, the additional competition wasn't 
so troublesome. But as buying slows, the fighting over market share 
intensifies. 
According to Dataquest, PC sales growth in the United States, which has 
averaged more than 25% for the last two years, should remain under 10% for at 
least the next three or four years. 
However, as disturbing as the trend might be to those in the industry, 
consumers should be pleased. Price competition, analysts say, has reached a new 
peak, making 1989 one of the best years in recent times to find a personal 
computer bargain. 
Sadder, Wiser 
"I would think this would be a very good year to buy," said Dataquest's 
Charlton. 
Last year, booming demand and a shortage of all-important dynamic random access 
memory chips led several computer makers to raise prices substantially. But 
almost all of them have been forced in recent months to lower prices to pump 
sagging sales. 
"A year ago we were enthusiastic about our sales prospects and we raised 
prices," said a sadder-but-wiser Thomas Yuen, co-founder and marketing vice 
president at AST Research, the Irvine personal computer maker. "We learned our 
lesson." 
In the ensuing year, the company has twice cut the prices of its systems. 
Still, it was not enough to repair all the damage. The company laid off 120 
workers earlier this year and announced its first-ever quarterly loss. 
AST isn't alone is resorting to layoffs. Advanced Micro Devices recently has 
laid off more than 2,000 workers; National Semiconductor has dropped about 
2,000 employees, and Unisys is eliminating the jobs of 2,500. 
Even where the price cuts have sparked some increased buying, analysts say they 
do nothing to solve two far more fundamental problems: the ongoing customer 
confusion over competing technologies and the growing gulf between the 
technological capabilities of a computer and the available software to operate 
on the machines. 
For example, industry pundits note that Intel's newest and fastest-ever 
microprocessor, the model 80486, will make its debut in personal computers 
later this year. Yet very little software exists today that takes full 
advantage of the technological innovations Intel built into its 80286 chip that 
was released a full five years and two generations of PCs ago. 
Analysts say it will take some exciting new software to draw customers, 
particularly corporate buyers looking to increase office productivity, back 
into the market. They note how the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program spurred 
early sales of the IBM personal computer. And it was the whole new field of 
desktop publishing and related graphics programs that fueled the eventual surge 
in sales of Apple's Macintosh computers. 
"They need new software now to create the same kind of customer demand," said 
Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco 
brokerage. 
Customers Confused 
Added Kenneth Flamm, a computer industry analyst for the Brookings Institute: 
"The growth in demand in this industry has always been lumpy, but I think the 
market is now waiting for new technologies. Once they come along, there will be 
a flood of demand." 
HOT DEALS IN A COOL MARKET 
It can hardly be considered a fire sale, but prices of many personal computer 
models have dropped steadily in recent months as manufacturers have tried to 
spur sales. The price cuts also reflect the declining prices of dynamic random 
access memory chips, a key memory component that was in short supply last year. 
Although declining prices of older model computers have been a regular feature 
of the industry over the years, analysts say the recent price cuts stem in 
large part from softening demand.
