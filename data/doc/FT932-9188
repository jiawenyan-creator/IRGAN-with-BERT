Australia's finance minister Ralph Willis said yesterday the sale of the
government's international airline, Qantas Airways, will be completed in the
fiscal year ending June 30 1994, AP reports from Canberra.
'There has been considerable progress this financial year,' he said.
'Although Qantas will not be fully sold this financial year the sale will be
completed in the next financial year,' Mr Willis told parliament in response
to a question about the progress of the sale.
