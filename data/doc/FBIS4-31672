  [Text] Zagreb, June 13 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) confirmed on Monday that Moslems and Croats had 
on Sunday shelled the Serb town of Brcko in the north of 
war-shattered Bosnia, wounding a number of people. A statement 
released at the UNPROFOR command in Zagreb, Croatia, said that 
Brcko had been hit by six shells fired from Bosnian Croat and 
Moslem positions. Authorities in Brcko said on Sunday that the 
town had been hit at 12:02 local time (10:02 G.M.T.) by eight 
shells fired from 128-mm multiple rocket launchers, and that six 
people had been wounded -- five civilians, a child among them, 
and a soldier. 
  The attack was on Monday condemned also by U.N. envoy to 
former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi as a violation of the ceasefire 
agreement signed at Geneva on June 8, all the worse for 
endangering the lives of Brcko's civilians. Akashi said that 
the shells appeared to have been fired from Orasje in northern 
Bosnia, where Bosnian Croat and Moslem troops were now deployed. 
Representatives of the Moslem-Croat federation and Bosnian 
Serbs undertook under the terms of the truce, which took force 
at noon on Friday, to refrain from offensive operations for the 
period of one month. 
  Seven people have died and 46 have been wounded in the eight 
artillery attacks on Brcko in the last month, launched in an 
effort to cut off a corridor which links the eastern and western 
parts of the Bosnian Serb republic and which is at its narrowest 
at Brcko.
