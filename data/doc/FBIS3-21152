  [Text] From FY94, MITI will begin developing technologies 
to store carbon gas (CO[.sup]2[/]) in the ocean as part of 
its plan to develop technologies for fixing and effective use of 
CO[.sup]2[/]. This will entail liquefying CO[.sub]2[/] by 
using water pressure in the deep seas, then using the property 
of being heavier than water to store it in the ocean. This will 
be an 8-year project with about &yen;6 billion in funding. The 
project will begin with demonstration testing in an experimental 
pool and ultimately, the CO[.sup]2[/]will be transported from 
power plants by pipeline or tanker and stored in large volume in 
deep seas over 3,700 meters (m) deep. In the past, the 
mainstream of CO[.sup]2[/] fixing technology was in 
biotechnology, for effective uses such as the production of 
activated physiological substances, but the same technology will 
make large-volume processing of CO[.sup]2[/] possible. 
  In the preliminary survey stage, it was found that 
CO[.sup]2[/] becomes liquid under the pressure of water at 
depths of over 3,700m. Thus the focus of future technological 
development surveys will be on how to apply pressure to the gas, 
which will be transported by pipeline or tanker, and convey it 
to deep-sea areas, and how CO[.sup]2[/] behaves in the ocean. 
  It also is said that liquefied CO[.sup]2[/] reacts with 
water in the ocean and forms a film called ``CO[.sup]2[/] 
hydrate,'' which will act as a barrier to diffusion. The chief 
project implementer will be decided by the New Energy and 
Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) by public 
subscription. The Research Institute of Innovative Technologies 
for the Earth (RITE) has been cited as a likely candidate. 
  CO[.sup]2[/] fixing also has been mentioned as a theme for 
international development of energy and environmental 
technologies because of its urgency in connection with the 
framework treaty on climate change, which is scheduled to become 
effective at the beginning of 1994. The goal of the treaty is to 
stabilize the volume of CO[.sup]2[/] emission to 1990 levels 
by the year 2000. MITI wants to realize large-volume processing 
of CO[.sup]2[/] by attaining practical application of this 
technology.
