FT  27 JUN 94 / Executives 'prefer more pay to perks'
Most executives value salary increases far more than perks when changing
jobs, says a survey carried out by a leading recruitment company.
Responses from 146 job applicants canvassed in a survey of recruitment
trends carried out by KPMG Search and Selection, a recruitment services
company, found that 63 per cent of them said they would prefer to have the
equivalent increase in salary instead of some or all of the perks on offer.
The benefits they considered most important were non-contributory pensions,
company cars and healthcare. Those they thought least important were longer
holidays.
Subsidised mortgages, once considered an important benefit among banking
employers, were considered of no great value, reflecting the lower mortgage
interest rates.
Mr Tony Saw, a search and selection specialist and author of the report,
said: 'Perceived changes in the taxation of benefits have meant that perks
have lost some of their appeal. Where once the company car was considered
all important, there has now been a shift to pensions.'
The survey also found that 82 per cent of the respon-dents believed that
their sector was still suffering from the recession.
Just over half of them did not have private pension schemes and most thought
legislation should be introduced to ensure that companies contributed to
personal plans if they were offering non-contributing schemes.
Two-thirds of the respondents said that they had received unsolicited
approaches from search consultancies and on average each had received four
approaches.
The most important factor influencing decisions by people to join a company
was its prospects.
