FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS CLOSED 
With cruel, deft strokes Gov. George Deukmejian has signed off on a policy of 
punishing poor women that exemplifies his lack of compassion, sensitivity to 
human rights, common sense and logic (Part A, Oct. 31). 
As the family planning clinics targeted for closure begin diverting patients to 
alternate facilities that are even more crowded and less accessible, the 
quality of fundamental health-care services provided to needy women will 
decline dramatically, resulting particularly in increased numbers of unwanted 
pregnancies, incidences of sexually transmitted diseases and cancer. The 
health-care professionals have provided the numbers; the reality of the 
closures is about to be felt throughout Los Angeles County, yet Deukmejian 
insists on ignoring the facts and supporting his "only slightly" misguided 
notion that should a program not report a 100% effective rate for one aspect of 
its function, it therefore does not merit continued funding. To extrapolate his 
theory, why should we bother with public health care at all; people still get 
sick. 
The final analysis goes like this: Deukmejian, a staunch anti-choice advocate, 
equates women's general health services with "the taking of human life." 
It has been noted by several prominent social theorists that increased abuse of 
women and the status of women, be it rape, battery, denial of equal rights, 
denigration by the media, and so on, signifies an imminent, large-scale 
breakdown in the integrity and stability of the social organization within 
which such abuse occurs. 
We may thank George Bush, and, more locally, George Deukmejian, for their 
extensive contributions to the abuse of women.
