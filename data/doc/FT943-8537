FT  17 AUG 94 / Major to visit South Africa
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, will visit South Africa from September
20 to 22, the first visit to the republic by a British prime minister for 34
years, Reuter reports. Mr Major's office said yesterday he would meet
President Nelson Mandela and other members of the South African government
on a trip covering Cape Town, Pretoria and Johannesburg. Mr Harold Macmillan
was the last British prime minister to visit South Africa, in 1960. In a
landmark speech in Cape Town, Mr Macmillan warned the then-Nationalist
government that the 'winds of change' were sweeping the African continent as
colonies were granted independence by European powers and that its policy of
apartheid was out of date.
