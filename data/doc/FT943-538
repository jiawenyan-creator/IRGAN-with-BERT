FT  29 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Swiss consumer prices stable
Switzerland's September consumer price index was unchanged after a 0.4 per
cent gain in August, giving an annual inflation rate of 0.6 per cent, the
Federal Statistics Office said. The rise in year-on-year inflation reflected
the so-called basis effect, namely that prices were stable in September this
year while they fell by a month-on-month 0.1 per cent in September last
year. Compared with September 1993, Swiss-made goods rose by 1.0 per cent in
price this month, while imported products fell by 0.5 per cent. Prices for
food, drink and tobacco products increased 0.4 per cent in September from
August, while rents and energy prices declined 0.1 per cent. Transport and
telecommunications prices, meanwhile, also fell 0.1 per cent.
Belgian September year-to-year inflation edged up to 2.46 per cent from 2.44
per cent in August, provisional official figures showed.
Finland's preliminary current account was in balance in August after a
revised FM2.9bn (Pounds 360m) surplus in July, according to figures released
by the Bank of Finland. July's surplus was revised down from a FM3bn surplus
reported last month.
