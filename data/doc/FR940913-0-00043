Drafting Information



The drafters of this notice are LCDR T.V. Skuby, project officer for Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound, and LCDR
J. Stieb, project attorney, First Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Regulatory History



On July 13, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Safety Zone; Widmann Wedding
Fireworks Display, Sheffield Island, CT in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 35661). The deadline for the submission of comments was August 12, 1994. Accordingly, there is insufficient
time available to publish this final rule 30 days in advance of the event. The Coast Guard received no letters commenting
on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held. The Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound has
decided to publish the final rule as proposed.



Background and Purpose



The sponsor, Jim Widmann, President of CT Pyro Display Company, South Norwalk, CT has requested that a fireworks display
be permitted in the port of Norwalk in the vicinity of Sheffield Island, Norwalk CT. This safety zone is required to
protect the maritime community from the dangers associated with this fireworks display. The zone covers all waters
of Sheffield Harbor within a 1200 foot radius of the fireworks barge C33.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

The safety zone will last approximately 45 minutes. The area affected by this event receives infrequent commercial
traffic. Because of the short duration of the event, and the extensive advisories which will be made, commercial entities
will be able to adjust to any disruptions. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal
that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.




Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).



For the reasons addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612, and has determined that these regulations do not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.e.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket.
