FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs warned over BR privatisation
BRITAIN'S railway equipment manufacturing industry is 'staring annihilation
in the face' because of the government's plans for the privatisation of
British Rail, MPs on the cross-party transport committee were told
yesterday.
Mr David Gillan, director of the Railway Industry Association, said 30,000
jobs might go between the middle of next year and the end of 1995 as orders
for rail equipment tailed off.
'It's not scare-mongering. It's not being alarmist. It's fact,' he said.
Mr Robert Adley, the Conservative backbencher who chairs the transport
committee, wrote to Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday,
urging the government to rethink its privatisation plans 'before more harm
is done'.
There was more gloomy news concerning both jobs and BR's investment plans as
a result of British Coal's proposed closure of 31 pits. The Engineering
Employers' Federation estimated that 15,000 engineering jobs will be lost if
the mines close.
Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, later told the employment committee, which is
inquiring into the employment consequences of the pit closures, that
Trainload Freight (TLF), BR's bulk freight subsidiary, was a big contributor
to BR's cashflow, enabling the company to reinvest in other areas.
He hinted that the change in TLF as a result of the closures could mean fare
rises, saying that to continue to invest 'we would have to find other ways
of cutting costs or increasing prices'.
TLF would lose 1,150 jobs directly, he said, with further losses to come
from the 'downsizing' of the business and the need to cut overheads.
Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation,
told the MPs that even taking into account the benefit from a greater
emphasis on gas to those of the organisation's members producing gas turbine
equipment, about 15,000 jobs in the engineering industry would go, leaving
perhaps fewer than 7,000 jobs.
