  [Text] Riga, Apr 08, BNS -- Latvian Interior Minister 
Girts Kristovskis, commenting on an open letter by the Press 
Publishers and Editors Association and the Media Foundation, 
said Friday [8 April] that his ministry is ready to put guards 
in the Press House in case of necessity. 
  The letter to Kristovskis and Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, 
published by several day newspapers recently, complained of 
attempts by organized criminals to control the press. 
  Last month, people were beaten up publicly in the Press 
House 
and offices of newspapers and the Press House administration 
threatened, according to the letter. 
  The authors of the letter demand that the Interior Ministry 
ensures the security of the 20-storey Press House, which houses 
offices of numerous editions, as well as a large printing 
office. Kristovskis said that he had heard about the events in 
the Press House but received, so far, no claims as a minister. 
In addition, the publication of the open letter may have create 
wrong impression that the Interior Ministry refuses to perform 
its duties, Kristovskis said. Kristovskis says he read the 
letter only in newspapers but never received it himself.
