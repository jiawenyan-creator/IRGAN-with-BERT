OUTTAKES: MOVE OVER, ELVIRA! 
Ozzy Osbourne hosting horror films? Cannon Home Video has hired the heavy metal 
madman to perform two-minute introductions to each of eight horror films. The 
first four -- "Dracula's Last Rights," "Crucible of Horror," "Beast in the 
Cellar" and "Blood on Satan's Cloth" -- are due on video shelves April 26. 
Kristina Hamm, assistant to the director of Cannon Home Video, told us Osbourne 
will provide a plot summary and "tell a couple of jokes." 
"We've discovered that the prime horror video renters also listen to heavy 
metal music," explained Hamm. "That's why we felt Ozzy was a logical choice." 
Meanwhile, European metal head King Diamond -- recently featured on Geraldo 
Rivera's notorious Satan special -- has landed a role in the fright flick 
"Boggs," about a not-quite-human televangelist, which begins filming next month 
in Florida. Sources tell us King Diamond will play a priest in a church lottery 
sequence where two lucky people win . . . entrance to hell. Marc Shapiro
