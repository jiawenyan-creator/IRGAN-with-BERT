  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa called Friday [27 May] for further economic 
deregulation to give foreign firms greater access to Japanese 
markets. 
  Kakizawa told a meeting of the government's task force for 
administrative reforms held at the official residence of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata that Japan should promote deregulation in 
response to growing calls from overseas. 
  He noted that Japan and the United States have agreed to 
drop 
discussions on so-called "numerical targets" for Japanese 
imports of American products in resumed negotiations on a new 
framework for bilateral trade. 
  Kakizawa said deregulation should also be implemented in the 
expanding information and communications industry to promote 
competition on the market. 
  He said Cable News Network of the U.S. and the British 
Broadcasting Corp. are building up their footholds in Asia and 
Japan should join them in the race.
