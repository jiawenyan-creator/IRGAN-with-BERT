LOCAL; 
ANAHEIM STORE SMASH-GRAB TARGET 
In another of a series of smash-and-grab jewelry store robberies, two men 
stormed into an Anaheim store this morning, shattered a display case with 
hammers and fled with an unknown amount of jewelry. 
The episode unfolded shortly after 11 a.m. when three men in their 20s entered 
Kay Jewelers in Anaheim Plaza, 500 N. Euclid, and broke into the display case, 
police said. Witnesses saw the three fleeing with two other men in a car, which 
officers later discovered abandoned a few blocks away, Lt. John Haradon said. 
Police were checking for fingerprints in the car, which they believe may have 
been stolen. 
The heist was among more than a dozen such robberies in Orange County in recent 
months.
