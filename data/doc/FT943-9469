FT  11 AUG 94 / Labour to meet Scots companies
The Scottish Labour party is to meet leading Scots companies to help
formulate an economic strategy for Scotland.
The party will also use the meetings to reassure leading companies about its
plans for a devolved Scottish parliament.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, has said that if the party comes to power
it will include early legislation to create a Scottish parliament.
Mr Jim Devine, chairman of the Scottish Labour party, said: 'We are seeking
a frank, constructive and substantive dialogue with key players in the
Scottish economy.
'We're trying to provide a channel for the voice of industry and business
direct into the formulation of Labour's economic policy in Scotland.'
Meetings have been arranged with companies including the Guinness subsidiary
United Distillers; ScottishPower; the life assurance company Standard Life;
and International Business Machines, which has a large personal computer
plant at Greenock, Strathclyde.
Mr Henry McLeish, deputy shadow Scottish secretary, said: 'Industry has
nothing to fear and much to gain from the creation of a Scottish
parliament.'
Before the 1992 general election several leading Scottish financial
institutions, including Standard Life, voiced anxiety about the effect that
a Scottish parliament with the power to raise taxes would have on their
business. Labour's response was to ignore or deride such statements.
Mr Ian Preston, chief executive of ScottishPower, said the company 'welcomed
the chance to talk to the Labour party, as we do with all other political
parties'. ScottishPower said it would be concerned about a Scottish
parliament that disadvantaged Scottish companies.
