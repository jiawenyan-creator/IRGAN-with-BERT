'KING' TO CLOSE EARLY IN LONDON; PUBLICITY BLAMED 
A $5-million London stage musical about assassinated black civil rights leader 
Martin Luther King Jr. is to close on June 2 after only six weeks, its 
producers said today. 
They blamed damaging reviews and publicity about problems affecting "King" 
before it opened. 
The show started its run in London's West End almost three weeks late. 
King's widow, Coretta, endorsed the production in March after earlier 
complaining that the music trivialized her husband's memory and threatening 
legal action to try to stop it. 
The producers claimed that the production was receiving nightly ovations but 
had taken only $170,000 in advance bookings. 
Daily Mail critic Jack Tinker said "King" had taken an exciting subject and 
"driven it into the ground under the weight of good intent."
