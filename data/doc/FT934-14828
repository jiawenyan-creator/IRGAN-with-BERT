FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu unit sale raises
Dollars 129m
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, has raised Dollars 129m from
the sale of OM Group, its US speciality chemicals unit.
It had been hoping to raise as much as Dollars 170m from the disposal, but
this was before poor market conditions forced it to postpone the sale,
planned for last April.
OM Group is being bought by US, European and Asian investors through a
public offering. The transaction has been underwritten by a group of US and
international investment banks led by Lehman Brothers, Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette and Goldman Sachs at Dollars 14 a share.
Outokumpu said earlier this year that OM Group was not a core business. The
disposal will strengthen its equity-to-assets ratio by 2.5 percentage points
to 23.5 per cent, taking it nearer its 30 per cent target.
OM Group's finances have been strengthened by a simultaneous primary issue
of shares, which raised Dollars 17m.
The unit, based in Cleveland, is one of the world's leading producers of
metal-based speciality chemicals, with manufacturing facilities in the US,
Finland and France. Sales in 1992 amounted to Dollars 201m and it has about
300 employees.
