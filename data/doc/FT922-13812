Peter Craven has been appointed finance director of Aitch Holdings, the
clothing manufacturer and importer with plant in Northern Ireland, which
agreed a financial restructuring with its banks in February.
Craven, a lifelong friend of Michael Green, the chief executive, was working
in Saudi Arabia for the grandson of the late King Faisal until he joined
Aitch earlier this year to help restructure the group.
Later this week Aitch is expected to send shareholders details of the
restructuring, which includes new loans from the Industrial Bank of Northern
Ireland and has left Hill Samuel with a 9 per cent stake.

John Miners, director of accounting at Beazer, has resigned. When Hanson
acquired the construction company last autumn, it put three of its own
directors on to the board including chairman Anthony Cotton, but Miners, a
41-year-old accountant who came on to the Beazer board in 1990, was retained
to smooth aspects of the transition. Last month Hanson said it had sold
Beazer to one of its own US offshoots as part of a refinan-cing effort.
Beazer says it does not know where Miners is going.
John Stanion has resigned as md of Beazer Kier; his responsibilities are
being taken over by Colin Busby, also md of Beazer Construction.
