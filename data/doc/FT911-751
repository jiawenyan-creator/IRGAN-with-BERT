FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Drug traffickers get fingered
A FINGERPRINT technology, already in use with the US secret service, has now
been licensed for wider use in the US, in particular in the hunt for drug
traffickers.
The technique, developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New
Mexico, uses gold and silver filaments to mark out the print. It should
prove particularly useful on materials from which fingerprints cannot be
detected using more traditional fingerprinting methods. These include
plastic tape, often used by traffickers to bundle up cash or drugs.
The fingerprint detection process, which is being marketed by ODV, of South
Paris, Maine, can also be used on materials after other detection methods
have failed.
The object is soaked in a solution of citric acid that contains particles of
gold, each about one-hundred millionths of an inch in diameter. The gold is
electrically attracted to the protein in the fingerprints and binds to it.
The object is then bathed in a silver-based solution. The silver sticks to
the gold and produces well-defined prints - light on a dark surface and dark
on a light one.
