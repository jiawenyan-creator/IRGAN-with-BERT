<DOCTITLE>Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.; Notice of Filing</DOCTITLE>



July 22, 1994.



Take notice that on July 18, 1994, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NMPC) tendered for filing with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission an executed Service Agreement between NMPC and LGE Power Marketing (LGE). This
service Agreement specifies that LGE has signed on to and has agreed to the terms and conditions of NMPC's Power
Sales Tariff designated as NMPC's FERC Electric Tariff, Original Volume No. 2. This Tariff, approved by FERC on April
15, 1994, and which has an effective date of March 13, 1993, will allow NMPC and LGE to enter into separately scheduled
transactions under which NMPC will sell to LGE capacity and/or energy as the parties may mutually agree.

NMPC requests an effective date of July 18, 1994. NMPC has requested waiver of the notice requirements for good cause
shown.

NMPC has served copies of the filing upon the New York State Public Service Commission and LGE.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules
211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions
or protests should be filed on or before August 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing
to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available
for public inspection.
