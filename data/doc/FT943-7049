FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Costain in early pref redemption
Costain Group is to redeem, at the full issue price of Pounds 5,000 each,
the outstanding 7.5 per cent guaranteed redeemable convertible preference
shares 2003 issued by Costain Finance.
The early redemption reflects the board's belief that administrative costs
to comply with the terms of the issue are disproportionate to the
outstanding number and value of the shares.
