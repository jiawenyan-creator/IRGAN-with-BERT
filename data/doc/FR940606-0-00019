National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Category: Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants
From the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Other Processes Subject to the Negotiated Regulation
for Equipment Leaks; Determination of MACT ``Floor'' 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On December 31, 1992, the EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of certain organic hazardous air pollutants
from synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry (SOCMI) production processes and seven other processes
which are part of major sources under section 112 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (the Act). This rulemaking is
commonly called the Hazardous Organic NESHAP or the HON. In the final action regarding the December 31, 1992 proposal,
which was signed on February 28, 1994, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 22, 1994, EPA deferred taking final action regarding provisions applicable to medium storage vessels due
to the need to resolve an issue of statutory interpretation of section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Act. On March 9, 1994, EPA
reopened the comment period to request additional comment on the appropriate interpretation of this statutory provision
and the effect of that interpretation on the appropriate control requirements for medium storage vessels at facilities
subject to the HON. 






This action announces EPA's final decision regarding the interpretation of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A) for
purposes of the HON and the final decision regarding control provisions applicable to medium storage vessels in SOCMI
facilities subject to the HON. The decision announced in this action regarding the interpretation of Clean Air Act
section 112(d)(3)(A) for purposes of the HON will be presumptively followed in subsequent MACT rulemakings, but
it will not be binding. Although EPA believes that Congress intended one interpretation_referred to as the ``Higher
Floor Interpretation''_in Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A), EPA also believes that the Agency retains discretion
in important respects in setting Floors for MACT standards. EPA intends to exercise its discretion, within the statutory
framework, to promulgate MACT standards that best serve the public interest.
