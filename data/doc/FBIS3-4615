  [Text] Dear Listeners: A cease-fire agreement was signed 
yesterday between the Burmese Government and the Kachin rebels. 
KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] spokeswoman Sam Raw 
expressed the KIO's view on this matter to the BBC by telephone: 
  [Begin Sam Raw recording] The KIO believes that all armed 
organizations who advocate the non-disintegration of the union 
will be able to cease fighting in the same way the KIO has 
ceased fighting against the SLORC [State Law and Order 
Restoration Council]. The participation of all these 
organizations is indispensable if the political problems are to 
be resolved at the table through discussions. That is why a 
nationwide cease-fire is necessary, as I have just mentioned -- 
to allow these organizations to participate in the discussions. 
We also strongly believe that, in resolving the political 
problems at the table through discussions, the problems can be 
resolved one by one if all organizations, all political 
organizations, and all national ethnic groups approach matters 
with good intentions and genuine goodwill. [end recording]
