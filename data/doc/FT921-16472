FT  03 JAN 92 / International Company News: Wesfarmers in hostile bid for
Bunnings
WESFARMERS, the Western Australian farming and commodities group, yesterday
announced a ADollars 163m (USDollars 124m) hostile bid for Bunnings, a
timber, hardware and metal products company in which it has a 19.9 per cent
stake.
The offer follows indications that BTR of the UK is seeking to dispose of a
24.6 per cent stake in Bunnings acquired as part of its recent Pounds 1.5bn
takeover of Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group.
Mr Dolph Zink, Bunnings' chairman, said the offer price valued the company
at only 10 times forecast profits in the current year.
The success of the offer is likely to be decided by the attitude of three
shareholder groups - BTR, the Bunning family and other directors, who hold
24 per cent, and the AMP Society, with 10 per cent.
