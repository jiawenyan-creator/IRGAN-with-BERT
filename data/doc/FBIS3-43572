  [Text] The leader of the breakaway Somaliland republic, 
which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, said today in 
Nairobi that the United Nations should leave Somalis to settle 
their own problems. President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, addressing 
supporters after lengthy talks with faction leader Mohamed Farah 
Aidid, said the United Nations should not portray Aidid as a 
monster. He said the United Nations does not understand the 
complexity of the Somali problem. 
  UN troops last year clashed with supporters of General 
Aidid, 
the strongman of southern Mogadishu, and he was declared a 
wanted man for murderous attacks on Pakistani peacekeeping 
soldiers. The hunt for him has subsequently been called off.
