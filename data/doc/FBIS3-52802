  [Text] Israel and the PLO agreed over the weekend that the 
Taba talks will be held continuously, until an agreement is 
reached. The talks will be held in a special wing [of the Taba 
Hilton Hotel] which will be closed to the media. Political 
sources said this evening that if the PLO brings up for the 
discussion the issue of border crossings, Israel will be willing 
to deal with only cosmetic matters, and not with Israel's 
responsibility in principle over the crossings. 
  The prime minister's bureau this evening made haste to deny 
the remarks of Tzomet Knesset Member Eli'ezer Zandberg that the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip will 
begin on 22 February.
