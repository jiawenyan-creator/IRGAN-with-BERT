  [Excerpt] Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana has said 
that truth must be the golden rule in politics as well as public 
administration and added that this principle, which should be 
part of this electoral campaign, has not been respected by all 
the presidential candidates. 
  Without naming names, but clearly alluding to them, Pastrana 
criticized Liberal candidates Ernesto Samper Pizano and Humberto 
de la Calle for their alleged sudden changes of opinion and 
attitude. 
  "One cannot trust someone who in June 1980 signed the ANIF 
[National Association of Financial Institutions] report 
supporting the legalization of marijuana and later reiterated 
this support at a meeting at the presidential palace on 13 May 
1993 and today changes his mind and rends his garments when what 
he so staunchly supported has been legalized," Pastrana said 
when referring to Samper. 
  "One cannot trust someone who today supports what he denied 
yesterday; one cannot trust someone who yesterday said `I will 
never accept' and today accepts it," Pastrana said in reference 
to De la Calle. 
  Pastrana spoke on Monday night at the Tequendama Hotel 
during 
an event to honor him sponsored by the Future Foundation. 
Several reporters were also invited to attend the event. 
  During his speech Pastrana insisted that his actions have 
been in accord with his way of thinking and that he is not lying 
to the country nor is he contradicting himself before the 
Colombian people. [passage omitted]
