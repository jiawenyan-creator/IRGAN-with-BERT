Warns Italy on Intervention"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Brussels, June 23 -- The Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, the armed Tutsi opposition in Rwanda, has warned Italy 
against participating in the French-led intervention in that 
African country. 
  "If Italy, as it would appear, does send 400 men to 
reinforce 
the French invaders, then it will do so on its own risk," Jam 
Rwego, a spokesman for the Patriotic Front said here on Thursday 
[23 June]. 
  "In any case," he added, "Italy must make certain that the 
aim of the French intervention is truly and uniquely 
humanitarian. Should this not be the case, we will be forced to 
consider the Italian soldiers as enemies with all the military 
consequences this would apply." 
  Italy has yet to make an official decision on whether to 
join 
the French-led effort which was given a green light by the 
United Nations Security council last night. The conditions 
which the Rome government has set for Italy's eventual 
participation include that the mission be only for humanitarian 
purposes, that the command be above any national interest and 
that other nations also take part, especially from Africa.
