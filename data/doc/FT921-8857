FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bergesen pessimistic after peak
results
BERGESEN, Norway's leading shipowner, yesterday revealed record profits but
warned that 1992 figures would be substantially reduced due to higher taxes
and lower tanker rates.
Group net profits rose to NKr952m (Dollars 151.6m) in 1991 from NKr925m, but
the increase was helped by better performing shipping operations, unlike
1990 when profits were improved by a NKr424m gain on the sale of securities.
The dividend is to be increased to NKr1 a share from NKr0.85.
Group operating revenue rose by NKr673m to NKr3.12bn, while operating profit
was 66 per cent higher at NKr857m. Net financial income dropped to NKr40m
from NKr433.
Based on tanker developments so far in 1992, Bergesen expects operating
profit for tankers to decline.
