<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Luis </F>
Glueck; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Glueck] Mr. Vranitzky, how do you assess the 
state of talks with the European Union? 
  [Vranitzky] I assess the state of talks with the European 
Union in a realistic manner -- that substantive progress has 
been achieved in some areas whereas positions still clash 
severely in other spheres. However, I am confident that it will 
be possible to narrow the differences. 
  [Glueck] Are you optimistic? 
  [Vranitzky] I am realistic. I have attended numerous 
negotiations of this kind. The current developments are nothing 
new. We not only want to conclude talks, but we want to 
conclude them by safeguarding Austria's interests. Other 
countries have different goals and different interests that do 
not -- or do not yet -- correspond to ours. Thus, talks must 
continue. 
  [Glueck] Will Austria continue the poker game until Monday 
evening [28 February]? 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, I think so. This is to be expected. I do 
not really think that one should compare negotiations with a 
poker game. But if you use this comparison, I believe that we 
should not be nervous. We will try to avoid becoming nervous. 
  [Glueck] Mr. Chancellor, the Austrian People's Party 
suggested recently that the referendum be postponed until the 
fall. 
  [Vranitzky] It is much too early to make a final statement. 
I believe that we should concentrate our efforts on the current 
negotiations and results. Once talks are concluded, there will 
still be time to think of other dates.
