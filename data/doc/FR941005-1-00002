Federal Employees Retirement System_Computation of the Basic Employee Death Benefit for Customs Officers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing regulations concerning the use of overtime and premium pay
in determining the final annual rate of basic pay of customs officers under the Federal Employees Retirement System
(FERS). These regulations would establish the methodology (similar to the one that OPM uses for other flexible schedule
employees) that the employing agency will use to compute customs officers' ``final annual rate of basic pay'' for
determining FERS ``basic employee death benefit.'' The regulations are necessary to implement the changes in the
statutory definition of basic pay under FERS made by section 13812 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

Comments must be received on or before December 5, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 13812 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 10366, amended section 8331(3) of title
5, United States Code, the definition of basic pay under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), to include, as
basic pay for CSRS computations, certain overtime pay for customs officers. Section 8401(4) of title 5, United States
Code, provides that the CSRS definition of basic pay in section 8331(3) applies to the Federal Employees Retirement
System (FERS). For customs officers, basic pay will include the regular pay under the general schedule, any applicable
locality pay, and allowable overtime pay up to $12,500 per fiscal year. Basic pay is used to compute final salary for
the basic employee death benefit under FERS.



For determining final salary, the employing agency will use a methodology similar to the one used for determining
the ``final annual rate of basic pay'' of intermittent employees for the FERS basic employee death benefit established
in 843.102 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. The employing agency will determine the total number of
hours for which the employee was paid two-times-hourly-rate overtime and the total number of hours for which the employee
was paid three-times-hourly-rate overtime during the 52-week workyear ending the pay period before separation.
The employing agency will then determine the amount of overtime pay that the employee would have received during the
52-week workyear if that overtime were paid at two or three times the employee's hourly rate (regular general schedule
pay rate plus locality pay) at the time of death. The amount of allowable overtime is the lesser of the amount that would
have been paid during that 52-week workyear using the employee's hourly rate (times the appropriate multiplier)
at the time of separation or $12,500. The final salary is equal to the allowable overtime computed under the previous
sentence, plus the final annual general schedule pay, plus locality pay. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation will only affect Federal employees and agencies and retirement payments to retired Government
employees and their survivors.
