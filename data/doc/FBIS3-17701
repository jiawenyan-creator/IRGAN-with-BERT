  [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar -- The eight-page draft Agreement on 
Achieving Civil Accord in Russia was handed over today for study 
by Boris Yeltsin. Work on completion of this document could 
take "a week or more," since the president attaches great 
importance to it in stabilizing society. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told this by the president's press secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov. 
  After it has been worked on, the document will possibly 
become more compact. The president will evidently include his 
own observations, delete minor points, and send the draft for 
correction by a working group, the press secretary reported. He 
added that Boris Yeltsin "would not want the Agreement on 
Achieving Civil Accord to appear as an abbreviated version of 
the Constitution." 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov reported "the document will also undergo 
approval in political circles. In particular, Boris Yeltsin 
discussed the draft agreement today with Federal Council Speaker 
Vladimir Shumeyko." 
  We remind you that the text of this document, on the 
instructions of the head of state, has been worked on since 10 
March by a working group composed of representatives of the 
administration of the president, the government, parliamentary 
factions, political parties, and trades unions.
