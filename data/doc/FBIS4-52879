  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- Kang Song-san, Politburo 
member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of 
Korea and premier of the Administration Council, met and had a 
friendly talk at the Mansudae Assembly Hall Friday with a 
delegation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) led by 
Jyoti Basu, Politburo member of the Party Central Committee and 
prime minister of the West Bengal State, on a visit to the DPRK. 
  The head of the delegation said that the Korean people, who 
defeated the two imperialisms under the wise guidance of the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, have made great achievements 
in the building of socialism, which is an encouragement to them. 
  He said the U.S. imperialists are raising a hue and cry over 
the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, but an absolute majority of the 
world's people are not believing it. 
  "We are convinced that whatever plot the imperialists may 
hatch up they cannot block the socialist progress of the Korean 
people who are united in one mind around the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il," 
he added.
