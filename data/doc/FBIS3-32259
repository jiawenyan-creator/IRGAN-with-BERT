  [Text] More than 8,600 professional state employees began 
a progressive strike on 1 February to pressure the government 
and protest its noncompliance with the agreements signed in July 
1992, Lionel Ardon Rodriguez, president of the University 
Professionals Coordinating Board [Coordinadora de Profesionales 
Universitarios Coligados], announced on 1 February. 
  The decision was announced following the failure of more 
than 
six months of talks with Finance and Labor Ministry officials. 
Ardon said the government contended that it could not comply 
with the agreement due to a lack of budget funds. 
  Ardon added that the government failed to comply with five 
points of the agreement: the problem of underemployment of 
professionals, wage scales, establishment of a promotion list 
based on seniority, promotions by academic level or degree 
and/or positions occupied, and discussion and approval of a 
salary increase for 1993.
