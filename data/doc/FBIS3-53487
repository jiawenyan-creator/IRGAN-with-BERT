  [Text] The political and economic situation in Algeria, the 
forthcoming national conference, Algerian-European cooperation, 
and the AMU [Arab Maghreb Union]-EU dialogue have all been the 
subject of an interview our Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah 
Dembri gave to the Portuguese newspaper DIARIO DOMINICAL. 
  Mohamed Salah Dembri reaffirmed on this occasion that 
Algeria 
is currently following two courses: political reforms and 
economic reforms. 
  About the awaited national conference, Dembri said he 
expects 
the participants in this conference to define the measures of 
the transitional period on the basis of the prepared action 
program. 
  Dembri added that presidential and legislative elections 
will 
be organized following the interim period, which will last three 
years or possibly less. 
  Concerning the participants in the national conference, 
Dembri said this conference will be open to all those who do not 
use violence for political aims and to all those who respect the 
elements that constitute national identity. 
  In the second part of the interview, Dembri discussed the 
economic situation. He touched on negotiations with the IMF, 
noting that Algeria's move to a market economy should not be 
accompanied by great social upheaval.
