  [Text] Belgrade, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Only hours after NATO 
issued an air strikes ultimatum, the Bosian Serbs had agreed a 
ceasefire in the embattled Gorazde, UN Special Envoy Yasushi 
Akashi said here today. 
  Akashi told reporters that the Serbs had agreed to withdraw 
their heavy weapons from Gorazde and allow UN peacekeeping 
troops to deploy in the area after more than nine hours of talks. 
  The truce was to take effect at midday local time (1000 
GMT). 
"Dr Karadzic has expressed his agreement for this ceasefire to 
take effect at 12 O' Clock tomorrow", Akashi said. 
  In the NATO ultimatum statement issued earlier today, NATO 
warned Serbs to stop offensive and withdraw their forces three 
kilomiters from the center of Gorazde by 001 GMT on Sunday or 
face allied air raids to protect the UN designated "safe haven." 
  Serb political leader Karadzic said to reporters that 
relations had been repaired with the Unprofor after nearly 
collapsing following NATO air raids against Serb positions near 
Gorazde on April 10 and 11. 
  "This agreement has put our relationship with Unprofor fully 
back on track," Karadzic said. 
  Although making no specific reference to the NATO ultimatum, 
Karadzic said the model used to bring a ceasefire to Sarajevo in 
February had been applied to Gorazde. 
  Akashi had brokered a ceaseifre agreement for Gorazde 
earlier 
in the week but Serb shelling attacks continued unabated.
