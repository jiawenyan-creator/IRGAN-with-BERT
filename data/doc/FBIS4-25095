<F P=106> [Report: "Student-Police Confrontation in Front of XINHUA </F>
Office Gate"] 
  [Text] After hustling and bustling for some time in front 
of the gate of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Office 
Building last evening, many members of the Hong Kong Students 
Union scuffled with the police who were on the alert on the 
spot. Some persons even rushed through the roadblocks put up by 
the police to the sealed-off area. At 2230 [1530 GMT], 13 
members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Democratic 
Patriotic Movement in China, the Alliance of Employees Trade 
Unions, the 5 April Action, and the Chinese Liberal Democratic 
Party arrived at the spot. Again and again they scuffled with 
the policemen in an attempt to climb over the roadblocks to 
reach the sealed-off area. During the scuffle, seeing such a 
situation, the driver of a passing taxi was quite dissatisfied 
with the troublemakers's doings and loudly shouted at them, 
accusing them of being "troublemakers." Hearing the accusation, 
a member of the Chinese Liberal Democratic Party, whose surname 
was Cheng, fiercely rushed out to the street and hurled an 
umbrella at the taxi. Consequently, the police arrested the 
troublemaker.
