QUOTABLE 
"My colleagues . . . are all moaning about the high prices for works of art and 
the changes in the tax laws that have had a great impact on museums and the 
building of collections. But I don't think it's totally negative. What does a 
museum do? It rethinks priorities. Where will it put its attention if this 
continues? On younger artists -- a very good thing because the works are still 
reasonable in price." 
 -- Richard Koshalek, director of Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art, in 
Artweek.
