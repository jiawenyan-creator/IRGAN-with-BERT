RECORD RACK: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A 
CLASSIC). 
** 1/2 
CALLOWAY 
"Calloway" Solar/Epic 
Brothers Reggie and Cino-vincent Calloway, formerly of Midnight Star, have 
produced a debut album that sounds as if they've been influenced by the 
catalogues of platinum-selling crossover acts like Lionel Richie and Atlantic 
Starr. "I Wanna Be Rich" -- currently a staple on pop radio -- is about as tame 
and mainstream as you can get. 
It's the type of record that's typically slammed by sneering critics and bought 
with wallet-waving abandon by pop audiences, and it's pretty obvious whose 
favor Calloway is courting. Those who like "I Wanna Be Rich" should be equally 
won over by "You Are My Everything," a ballad so unbelievably bland that it's 
hard to imagine its being performed by two guys who used to churn out funky 
fare like "Freak-a-zoid" and "Operator." CONNIE JOHNSON
