  [Excerpts] During a routine briefing given by the Russian 
president's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian and 
foreign journalists were briefed on the main issues the 
president will tackle in the near future. [passage omitted] 
  Journalists were informed that over the last few days B.N. 
Yeltsin has signed a number of edicts appointing 250 generals 
and senior officers of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
[FCS], and that this most important department is fully staffed. 
The Statute on the FCS has been published in ROSSIYSKIYA 
GAZETA, the press secretary stressed. This is all the more 
gratifying in that such documents were strictly classified in 
the past. [passage omitted]
