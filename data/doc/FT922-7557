FT  18 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Groupe Suez
It was touching last Friday to hear Suez group chairman Mr Gerard Worms
single out shareholder satisfaction as one of his chief priorities for the
next few years. Suez, after all, has been as guilty as any French company of
treating investors with disdain - useful in so far as they stump up new
capital when asked, inconvenient to the extent that they demand information
and an adequate financial return.
Sceptics will say that they have heard the pious promises before, but it
could just be that the company now means what it says. Mr Worms is clearly
conscious of the group's poor rating, and even acknowledges that its
sprawling structure may be partly responsible. Under his leadership there
seems a renewed and welcome commitment to financial assets - the area Suez
knows best - and a determination to shake off peripheral industrial
interests which came with the headlong expansion of the late 1980s. Some
FF8bn of disposals have been completed in the past 18 months, and, though no
target has been set, there is clearly more to come. Suez is under no
particular financial pressure, but is anxious to take advantage of
privatisations in France when opportunities arrive.
The signs are that Acec-Union Miniere, the highly cyclical non-ferrous
metals subsidiary which so distorted last year's results, is getting to
grips with its problems. Confusion over the insurance strategy will be ended
when negotiations with UAP over Victoire's Colonia stake are finally
settled.
