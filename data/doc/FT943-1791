FT  22 SEP 94 / Growth forecast for company earnings cut
Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK merchant banking and securities house,
has sharply reduced its forecast for UK company earnings growth next year,
and says City analysts are suffering from 'money illusion' in their profit
forecasts.
The firm is cutting 1995 earnings forecasts from 10 per cent to 8 per cent -
the lowest target in the market and barely half the consensus among UK
market analysts. Kleinwort is trimming forecasts for this year for UK
non-financial company profits from 17 per cent to 15 per cent.
Mr Edmond Warner of Kleinwort points to the turn in the interest rate cycle,
and to the likely impact on British companies of cost pressures and pricing
difficulties. Disappointment in company earnings could impact across the
range of a UK stock market which has focused on profits and dividends as the
driving force now that the interest rate outlook has become uncertain. Mr
Warner expects profit forecasts by City analysts to turn increasingly
towards downgrading of expectations following an interim reporting season
less robust than hoped.
He urges clients to target the UK bond markets for investment ahead of UK
equities, commenting that domestic conditions favour a rally in gilts.
