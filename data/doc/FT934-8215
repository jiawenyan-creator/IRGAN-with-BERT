FT  17 NOV 93 / Japan's trade surplus grows more slowly
JAPAN'S TRADE surplus widened to Dollars 11.09bn (Pounds 7.4bn) last month,
showing for the third month running a slower growth rate, or even a decline
if measured in yen.
The trend continued by yesterday's figure augurs well for Prime Minister
Morihiro Hosokawa's meeting with US President Bill Clinton in Seattle on
Friday, at which the Japanese government expects Washington to seek evidence
of how it plans to narrow the politically troublesome trade gap.
The October dollar surplus rose by 1.7 per cent from the same month last
year, the 34th monthly increase running, but a far slower rate of increase
than the 3.8 per cent year-on-year rise in September, said the finance
ministry.
Japan's bilateral surplus with the US was Dollars 5.2bn last month, up from
Dollars 4.94bn in the same month last year. Japanese exports to the US rose
by 3 per cent, while imports rose by a mere 0.2 per cent.
In yen terms, Japan's overall trade gap shrank by 11.2 per cent to Y1,156bn,
the same amount as in September. Imports declined by 11.8 per cent, because
of weakness of domestic consumption, while exports slipped in yen terms by
11.6 per cent.
Yesterday's trade figures intensified dissent from Japanese business groups
over the government's continued resistance to US calls for numerically
targeted reductions in the trade and current accounts surpluses.
'It would be easier for Japanese companies to adjust if they had a specific
target, such as a certain percentage of gross national product,' said Mr
Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation.
The government believes such targets are neither desirable nor possible in a
free market economy. However, industrialists believe a concession to the US
would help reduce the value of the yen, so reducing exchange rate losses and
restoring price competitiveness in export markets.
