  [Text] Government Major Eduardo Lauchande says no consensus 
has yet been reached with the Mozambique National Resistance 
[Renamo] regarding the latter's withdrawal from Salamanga. 
Speaking at the end of a tripartite meeting attended by the 
government, Renamo, and UN Operations in Mozambique officials in 
Maputo today, Maj. Lauchande said Renamo agreed to inform the 
chairman of the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] by tomorrow morning 
about the area where its men will be deployed. 
  The government has rejected Renamo's suggestion that its 
forces withdraw up to 700 meters from where they are stationed. 
CCF chairman Colonel (Sitela) says the dispute could be 
resolved if Renamo accepts the proposals that have been made. 
Renamo is supposed to withdraw 30 km south of Salamanga or 10 
km northeast of the town, instead of 700 meters.
