METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
USE OF STEEL PIPES SUGGESTED FOR PIER 
A marine engineering consultant has recommended that plastic-coated steel pipes 
be used instead of wood pilings to reconstruct the Redondo Beach Pier. 
The steel pilings under a concrete deck would provide greater resistance 
against the kind of storms and fires that destroyed most of the pier last year, 
the consultant said. 
Jim Crumpley, project engineer for Long Beach-based firm Moffatt &amp; Nichol, 
told the Redondo Beach City Council that construction and maintenance costs for 
a pier using the steel pipes would also be lower than costs for four other 
options studied by the firm. 
He said a Japanese company, Nippon Steel, has developed a plastic pipe coating 
that effectively resists salt-water corrosion for up to 70 years. In the 
recommended design, the pilings would connect through steel caps to a concrete 
deck. 
Up to half of the $6-million pier reconstruction project will be financed by 
the state under the Natural Disaster Assistance Act, City Manager Tim Casey 
told the council.
