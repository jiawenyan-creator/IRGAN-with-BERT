FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Markets divorced from real world
Sir, Any doubts that the stock markets are discon-nected from planet earth
were laid to rest by the astonishing headline on the front page of your
edition of November 30, 'Big surge in US consumer confidence alarms
markets'.
Would someone please explain to these idiots in the City and on Wall Street
that surging consumer confidence is good news for those of us scrambling to
sell real products and services, and for those who invest in our
enterprises.
If our success is bad news for speculators and gamblers - which is what
these City and Wall Street types mostly have become - then I for one hope
they all go bust and make room for professionals who understand the
importance of consumer confidence to growth, and the importance of growth
not merely to make the rich richer, but to create new jobs for those who
need them.
