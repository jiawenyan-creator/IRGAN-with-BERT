The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5)
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission
finds that the proposal may serve to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market by encouraging
the creation of New Units and by encouraging those New Units to maintain tight markets for New Options Classes in order
to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Commission believes the proposed rule change is a reasonable attempt by
the PHlx to enhance the ability of New Units to compete for order flow in the environment of multiply-traded options
classes. In addition, the protection of investors and the public interest is maintained because the Committee can
refuse to extend the Enhanced Parity Split for an additional six months if the performance of the New Unit does not warrant
an extension. Further, the proposed rule change provides the Enhanced Parity Split cannot disadvantage a public
customer order that is on parity with a New Unit.

The Commission agrees with the Exchange that in order to attract order flow to the Exchange, the Phlx needs to be able
to attract and retain well capitalized specialist units that are willing to trade New Options Classes, as well as existing
options classes. Further, the Commission disagrees with the commenter that the proposed rule change will disadvantage
public customers. On the contrary, the proposed rule change eliminates any direct injury to public customers by providing
that customer orders on parity may not receive a smaller participation than any other crowd participant, including
the specialist.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, because the proposal may serve to add liquidity to the market by encouraging New Units to maintain tight
markets in order to attract order flow to the Exchange, the Commission believes that public customers could benefit
from the proposed rule change.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the proposed rule change will
disadvantage public customers.

The specialist may waive the Enhanced Parity Split in these circumstances. See

The Commission notes that contrary to the commenter's contention, ROTs may in fact benefit from the Enhanced Parity
Split if the New Units are successful in attracting order flow to the Exchange.
 
</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also acknowledges that specialists have responsibilities that ROTs do not have and that these responsibilities
have certain costs associated with them, such as the staff costs associated with continually updating and disseminating
quotes. As a result, the Commission believes it is reasonable for the Exchange to grant certain advantages, such as
the Enhanced Parity Split, to New Units in order to encourage New Units to register as specialists for New Options Classes.
Accordingly, as long as these advantages do not unreasonably restrain competition and do not harm investors, the
Commission believes that the granting of such benefits to specialists is within the business judgment of the Exchange.
Therefore, even though the proposed rule change could arguably have some negative impact on ROTs, for the reasons
stated above, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act.

Further, the Commission disagrees with the commenter that ROTs may be disadvantaged by the fact that New Units are
not required to accept the Enhanced Parity Split in those instances where it applies. In those cases where a New Unit
determines to waive the Enhanced Parity Split, the Exchange's normal parity rules will apply and the ROTs involved
will be no worse off than they would on any other parity trade. 
 
</FOOTNOTE>


Finally, the Commission agrees with the Phlx that the lack of quantifiable standards for the Committee to apply in
determining whether to extend the Enhanced Parity Split for an additional six month period does not make the proposal
unreasonable. Even if the Phlx proposed such standards, some time period would be necessary in order for the New Unit
to establish a trading history in the New Option Class in order for such a review to have any validity. In addition, the
Committee still will review the performance of the New Unit in determining whether to extend the Enhanced Parity Split
for an additional six months for particular New Options Classes. Because the Enhanced Parity Split can be in effect
for at most one year for each New Options Class, the Commission believes that the lack of such standards does not prevent
a finding that the proposal is consistent with the Act. 
 
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. First, Amendment No. 1 limits to one year the maximum time period during which the Enhanced Parity Split can exist
with respect to any New Options Class and provides that the proposed rule cannot disadvantage customer orders. The
purpose of the Enhanced Parity Split is to encourage New Units to maintain tight spreads in New Options Classes, which
is a benefit to investors. The Commission believes that providing such an incentive to specialists is appropriate
for New Options Classes for the period during which the market for such options classes is being established as long
as safeguards exist to ensure that customers are not harmed. As a result, the Commission believes these amendments
accomplish these goals consistent with the Act. Secondly, Amendment No. 1 also clarifies certain aspects of the proposed
rule change. The Commission believes that these amendments strengthen the proposed rule change by minimizing any
confusion that may arise as to the applicability of the rule. As a result, the Commission believes it is consistent
with section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Phlx's proposal on an accelerated basis.
