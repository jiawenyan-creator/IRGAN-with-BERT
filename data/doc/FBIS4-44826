  [Text] Frankfurt. French scientists were recently 
successful in developing a silicon-germanium alloy which can be 
used for bipolar transistors with a limiting frequency of more 
than 50 gigahertz. According to the journal SEMICONDUCTOR 
INTERNATIONAL (Vol. 17, 1994, No. 1, p. 18), the laboratories of 
the National Center for Telecommunications Studies (CNET) of 
France Telecom have already exceeded a value of 100 gigahertz. 
Pierre Noblanc of CNET explains that the high frequency output 
is said to equal that of gallium arsenide transistors. The alloy 
of about 70-percent silicon and 30-percent germanium is used as 
a base for Bicmos products with structural widths of 0.25 
micrometers. Production is to begin in 1996. Advantages are 
anticipated for bipolar, Mosfet and Bicmos products. He said 
that in Great Britain the company GEC Plessey Semiconductor in 
Swindon is likewise working on silicon-germanium alloys, but 
with the proportion of germanium 10 to 20 percent.
