IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
SMOG AND THE RISE IN ASTHMA 
The incidence of asthma is rising dramatically in the United States and 
pollution is a major reason, researchers reported last week in a large 
nationwide study. 
"There is no question that the number of office visits to physicians for asthma 
is increasing tremendously," said Claude Lenfant, director of the National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. "We are faced with a tremendous health 
problem." 
In the study, the largest of its kind, nearly half of the pediatricians 
surveyed said they are treating more asthmatic children today than they were 
five or 10 years ago. Nearly 30% of these doctors said they are now treating 
more than 10 asthma patients per week. 
Pollution was cited as the major reason for the increase in asthma, and nearly 
half of the parents of asthmatic children felt their children suffered 
emotionally from the condition. Many of the parents also viewed their child's 
condition as life-threatening.
