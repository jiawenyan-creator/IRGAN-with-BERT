FT  13 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo
Japanese government bond prices soared following Friday's release of the
tankan quarterly survey of business sentiment. The benchmark 10-year bond
yield fell to 4.130 per cent, 10 basis points below the previous Friday's
close.
On Friday morning, before the release of the tankan, bond prices fell on the
belief that the report would paint a bright picture that would rule out
interest rates falling much lower. But when the report, released that
afternoon, showed that business expectations were improved but still weak,
dealers swung back on the buy side, sending bond prices higher to the close.
Bonds started the week with prices continuing to slide, following the
previous week's falls in world markets. On Tuesday, Mr Masaru Hayami, who
heads the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said the economy would
improve by autumn without any need for fiscal measures. This triggered an
avalanche of selling, but on Wednesday, a rise in the yen triggered by US
threats of trade sanctions caused bonds to rebound after eight days of
declines.
The market's renewed strength is tempered by the increasingly worrisome
North Korea nuclear stalemate. On Thursday, prices fell on reports that the
North had been testing a 1,000km range missile, but regained ground near the
close.
