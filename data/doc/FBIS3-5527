  [Begin Prasong recording in progress] ...that there should 
be 
no problem. As far as I have discussed this issue with 
authorities of other ASEAN member countries, they do not want 
Burma to be isolated. They wish to see Burma constructively 
join activities in this region. They all share the same view. 
However, I will have to consult with all other ASEAN friends.
