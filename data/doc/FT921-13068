FT  23 JAN 92 / Hong Kong 'kingpin of rapid growth' in Asia
HONG KONG is set for strong growth through the 1990s, propelled by its role
at the heart of south China's economy, and as a driving force behind
fast-growing intra-Asian trade and investment, according to a leading Hong
Kong economist.
Professor Edward Chen, head of the Centre for Asian Studies and a member of
the territory's Legislative Council, told a conference in London that China
'could not possibly revoke' its commitment to economic reform. He said the
Chinese economy 'already has a high degree of openness', with 20 per cent of
its GNP accounted for by exports, and 16 per cent by imports - a development
over the past decade that has made it the world's 15th largest exporter.
Prof Chen challenged rather simplistic models for the creation of an Asian
trading bloc focused on Japan by foreseeing Hong Kong as the driving force
within one of four interlocked economic zones in Asia, all of which can
expect dynamic growth. These are:
'Greater Hong Kong', or the South China Zone, comprising Guangdong and
Fujian provinces in China, as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Yellow Sea zone, focused on north-east China around Dalian, including
Shandong province, and driven by investment from South Korea.
Greater Indochina economic zone, driven by Thailand, and including Vietnam,
Laos, Kampuchea and Burma.
A zone focused on Singapore, including Indonesia and the southern part of
peninsular Malaysia.
The increasing interdependence of these regions was underscored by the
rising volume of intra-regional trade.
Hong Kong's pivotal role was highlighted by the fact that it was the world's
leading investor in China.
