FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Aegon ahead and sees further
growth
Aegon, the second-largest insurance company in the Netherlands, posted a
10.5 per cent increase in net profit in 1993, and predicted an improvement
in operating profit for 1994, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
Net profit rose to slightly more than Fl 1.0bn (Dollars 526m) from Fl 909.0m
in 1992, on turnover up nearly 45 per cent at Fl 22.1bn.
Operating profit, which does not include realised gains on investments, was
up 10.3 per cent at Fl 865.5m.
The 1993 dividend is to be raised to Fl 4 from Fl 3.75 in 1992.
The sharp increase in turnover was heavily influenced by the acquisition in
February last year of Amex Life's portfolio in the US and its link-up in the
fourth quarter with Scottish Equitable.
Excluding acquisitions, turnover would have risen by 12.5 per cent.
Aegon said the Scottish Equitable acquisition had no effect on 1993 profit
but should make a contribution in 1994. The acquisition trebled European
turnover at Aegon, which generates most of its business in the US and the
Netherlands. The company is active in Spain and Hungary but recently
announced its withdrawal from Belgium.
