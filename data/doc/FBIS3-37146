  [Text] Moscow February 14 TASS--Sergey Filatov, head of the 
Russian president's administration, said that "All I's have been 
dotted and all T's have been crossed" in relations between 
Russia and Tatarstan. 
  Commenting on the situation on the eve of the signing of the 
Russian-Tatar treaty on relations due to take place on Tuesday, 
Filatov said that "the new Constitution, not ultimatums, has 
changed the situation in relations between Russia and Tatarstan." 
  He believes that the treaty will allow Russia "not to force 
the republic to sign the federal treaty, but conclude a 
bilateral agreement with it which would take into account the 
specific features of Tatarstan." 
  By saying this, Filatov has admitted the possibility of 
signing bilateral agreements between Russia and its constituent 
republics, which, as he believes, will not run counter to the 
Constitution. 
  "No one intends to prevent Tatarstan from raising the level 
of management in the republic to a higher level than in other 
subjects of the federation," Filatov said. 
  He expressed the hope that the signing of the treaty will 
promote trust between society and power and "people will be able 
to realise that there are no unsolvable deadlocks or situations." 
  Tatar President Mintimer Shaymiyev arrived in Moscow on 
Monday to take part in the signing ceremony.
