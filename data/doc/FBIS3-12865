  [Text] Beirut, Feb 25 (AFP)--The head of a former Lebanese 
Christian militia was sentenced in absentia to seven years of 
hard labour by a military court here for allegedly collaborating 
with Israel, a court source said on Friday [25 February]. 
  Etienne Saqr was accused of "collaborating with the Israeli 
enemy," the source said. 
  One of his aides, Samir Philippe Nasr, who has been jailed 
for the past six months, was also sentenced to two years of hard 
labour on the same charges. 
  Saqr, who headed the Guardians of the Cedars militia, was 
accused of having told Nasr to ask renegade army general Michel 
'Awn to cooperate with "Zionist circles" and the Jewish lobby in 
the United States. 
  'Awn, who lives in exile in France, turned down the request, 
according to the military prosecutor's findings. 
  Saqr denied the charges against him in November, but said he 
was in favour of establishing good relations with Israel. 
  Since 1989, Saqr has lived in his home village of Sabbah, in 
the Jazin district of south Lebanon, an area controlled by 
Israel's proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA). 
  The Lebanese authorities have cracked down on several people 
alleged to have supported normal ties with Israel, including 
Miss Lebanon Ghada Turk, accused of deliberately posing with 
Miss Israel at an international beauty contest in Johannesburg 
late last year.
