FACES FOR THE NINETIES; 
WHO WILL BE THE FACES TO WATCH IN THE PERFORMING ARTS IN THE 1990S? NOTHING'S 
FOR CERTAIN, OF COURSE, BUT BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS WORK, CALENDAR'S CRITICS 
AND WRITERS HAVE SELECTED THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE AREAS OF MUSIC, STAGE AND 
DANCE, AND PERFORMANCE:; 
STAGE; 
BILL BUSHNELL 
Bill Bushnell's Los Angeles Theatre Center has become, in two important ways, 
the Los Angeles theater center. 
No other theater is more in tune with the multicultural quality of emerging Los 
Angeles. 
With its array of ethnic labs and its consistent production of plays by Latinos 
and blacks, as well as its international imports, LATC is the most 
heterogeneous theater in town. 
Furthermore, it's the most prolific theater in the area -- offering more fully 
staged productions per year (16 in 1988, 14 in 1989) than the Mark Taper Forum 
(11 in 1988, 10 in 1989) or South Coast Repertory (12 in 1988, 13 in 1989). 
Though Bushnell's taste certainly hasn't proven infallible, more than 233,000 
paying theatergoers (plus 10,000 students) saw shows at LATC's rejuvenated bank 
building on downtown's Spring Street during the last fiscal year. 
As the new decade begins, Bushnell will be able to concentrate on artistic 
direction more exclusively than before. 
Rather than running the entire theater, he is now one of three supposedly equal 
administrators, and new managing director Robert N. Lear is taking over many of 
the fund-raising and housekeeping responsibilities that have occupied Bushnell 
in the past. 
Although LATC is still in its perpetual financial crisis, the board is taking 
steps to shore up its $7.3 million budget. These efforts may result in less 
money -- but more time -- for Bushnell to flex his creative muscles in the 
'90s. DON SHIRLEY
