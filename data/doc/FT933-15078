FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: Oce slide continues in second
term
OCE-VAN der Grinten, the Dutch photocopier and office equipment maker, saw
net profit fall by 47 per cent in the second quarter of 1992-93, virtually
matching the 49 per cent decline posted in the first quarter of the year.
Net profit in the second quarter ended May 31 was Fl 15.9m (Dollars 8.4m),
just over half the Fl 30.1m posted in the same quarter of 1991-92.
This took first-half net profit to Fl 26.7m, against Fl 51.0m a year
earlier.
Oce-van der Grinten blamed the downturn on lower margins caused by a drop in
sales in Europe and the appreciation of the Dutch guilder. However, US sales
and results improved in the second quarter, the company said.
Overall second-quarter sales declined by 8 per cent to Fl 642m while
operating profit including interest income from financial leases fell by 28
per cent to Fl 42.1m.
