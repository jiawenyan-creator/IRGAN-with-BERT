  [Excerpt] Warsaw, Nov. 30 -- The 2nd national conference on 
AIDS, held on World AIDS Day, on Tuesday mapped out the 
directions of actions to prevent and fight the disease. Sexual 
education was recognized as the most important task. 
  Summing up the conference Krzysztof Dziubinski, the health 
minister's commissioner for AIDS said the promotion of healthy 
lifestyle and education for health should be conducted not only 
by the Ministry of Health, but also educational authorities, the 
church, media and television. The National Coordinating Bureau 
for AIDS Prevention was created recently to help training 
specialists for health education. 
  The conference pointed to the need to immediately amend the 
old laws on drug abuse of 1985, and on combatting infectious 
diseases of 1963. [passage omitted]
