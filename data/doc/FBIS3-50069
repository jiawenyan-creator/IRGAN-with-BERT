  [Text] Belgrade, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- Andras Agoston, leader 
of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians [DZVM], said 
after today's meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
that he supports the idea of setting up a government of national 
unity. After the 20-minute meeting with the Serbian president, 
Agoston said he would be "pleased if someone from the oppostion 
became president of the Serbian Assembly." The DZVM cannot be 
the weight to "tip the scales," Agoston said, repeating his 
party's earler stand. "Given our demands for a three-degree 
autonomy [local, cultural, and personal autonomy], even the 
opposition is, to us, like a ruling party," stressed Agoston. 
None of the opposition parties support our idea of a 
three-degree autonomy."
