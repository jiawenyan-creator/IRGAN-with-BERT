BUSH ABANDONS VOW, CALLS FOR TAX INCREASE TO REDUCE DEFICIT 
So, President Bush has finally gone back on his "no new taxes" promise, and the 
only decision to be made is who must pay them. I propose that we wipe out the 
federal deficit by imposing on each American who voted for Bush in 1988 a 
onetime luxury tax, the luxury in this case being naivete. 
In addition to its eminent fairness, my scheme is educational: An electorate 
forced to pay a cash price for its gullibility will eventually stop falling for 
campaign promises that are obviously impossible to keep.
