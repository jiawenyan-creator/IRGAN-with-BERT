FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Can rebates be capital?
IS AN income tax rebate classed as capital?
I am entitled to a life interest under my late husband's will and the
capital is for the children on my death. My late husband died in August
1991. In June 1992 the Inland Revenue returned Pounds 937.90. My solicitor
has kept this and maintains it is capital.
You are entitled to the income which arose from your husband's assets after
his death (and to the benefit of the tax credits etc. carried by that
income), but the tax refund in June 1992 presumably related to income which
arose during his lifetime. That being so, it does indeed form part of the
capital of the trust established by his will, so what the solicitor did is
correct.
