POP MUSIC REVIEW; 
BODEANS SHINE AT THE WHISKY 
You don't have to hail from the heartland to hate heartland rock, but it helps. 
It's gotten so it's hard for a Midwestern boy to enjoy the simple pleasures of 
a small-town gas station or a desert sunset without having the scenery spoiled 
by all the myth-making perpetrated on the landscape by the Men Who Would Be 
Bruce. 
The BoDeans indulge in their share of that, and can slip into melodramatic 
cliche, but their fun, casual intelligence makes them refrain from turning 
real-life three-minute songs into rootsy rock operettas. 
At the Whisky on Tuesday, the hard-working Milwaukee group once again proved 
not only tolerable for the genre but terrific, even while further reinforcing 
their move away from likable, loping country touches toward a rock-radio-ready, 
anthemic style. They sang of lost love and parched land with none of the 
self-seriousness of a Mellencamp. With these guys, you would willingly visit 
the land of drought and hard drink. 
The credits for their third album, "Home," indicate that it was cut "live" in 
the studio. You can figure then that in concert you're due for something at 
least as good, which in this case is pretty good indeed. In addition to old 
favorites, the 105-minute set included all of the songs from the current LP 
(plus one of the CD bonus tracks), from the Springstone-age rave-up "Good Work" 
to the accordion-accompanied waltz "Beaujolais." 
Dueling lead singers Sam Llanas (once described by Robbie Robertson as sounding 
like an old woman -- but a soulful old woman, mind you) and Kurt Neumann 
actually both sounded less ravaged than they do on the album, where they were 
probably trying to sound ravaged. By the time their voices soared together on 
the closing refrain of "You don't get much without giving," they had put their 
money where their mouths were. CHRIS WILLMAN
