  [Excerpt] Last week THE CRUSADER took issue with the Prime 
Minister for his Independence Message Statement that "we have no 
hostile borders to defend." We were also very concerned at the 
Prime Minister's announcement that off-shore banking was poised 
to become the ``fourth leg'' of the St. Lucia Economy. Surely 
the track-record of offshore companies in the Caribbean is 
chequered enough to indicate the need for circumspection and 
caution in entertaining the idea of offshore Banking Services in 
St. Lucia. The sudden and precipitous manner in which St. 
Lucians received the news that the government had already 
decided that offshore services would be the "Fourth Leg" of the 
economy, was enough to generate anger about the lack of 
consultation in such matters. 
  This month St. Lucia features prominently in a scandal in 
which US$23 million in drug money was laundered through an 
offshore bank by the name of Commerce Clearing Trust Company 
Limited International. This Bank is based in St. Lucia. It was 
chartered on April 3, 1992 and listed a registered office at 37 
Jeremie Street, Castries St. Lucia. [passage omitted]
