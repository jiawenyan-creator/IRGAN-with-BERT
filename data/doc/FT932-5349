FT  04 JUN 93 / Barclays staff to ballot on strike
MORE THAN 1,000 computer staff of Barclays, the UK's biggest bank, are
voting on whether to take industrial action over pay.
Bifu, the banking union, said the ballot followed Barclays' refusal to
improve a pay offer 'worth less than 1.5 per cent'. Options being considered
are a three-day strike at computer centres and an overtime ban. Any action
would affect cash machine operations, cheque clearance and computer-based
transactions.
