  [Text] Washington, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
called today for the deployment of UN peacekeepers in the 
Bosnian town of Gorazde as soon as possible. 
  "A contingent of UN forces should soon be on its way to 
Gorazde," President Bill Clinton's National Security Advisor 
Anthony Lake said in a policy speech at the John Hopkins 
University in Baltimore, Maryland. 
  Meanwhile, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the 
presence of UN peacekeepers in the Muslim enclave, under 
increasing Serb attacks in recent days, "could be a basis for 
possible air strikes." 
  Christopher told the Public Broadcasting Service that NATO 
could threaten air strikes if the UN forces, expected to be from 
Ukraine, Britain and France, were attacked. 
  Lake stressed that "neither the president nor any of his 
senior advisers rules out the use of NATO power to help stop 
attacks such as those against Gorazde." 
  "We must make clear to the Serbs and to the Serbs of Bosnia 
that the costs of continued intransigence are high," he added. 
  At the Pentagon, Spokeswoman Kathleen Delaski said the U.S. 
was ready to help transport the Ukrainian soldiers to Gorazde. 
  There were 15 peacekeepers in Gorazde, reports said.
