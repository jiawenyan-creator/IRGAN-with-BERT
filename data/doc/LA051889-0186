SLAVES TO ART TO STAGE SALE 
The Alternative Repertory Theatre, which has lost so much of its audience that 
it is on the verge of disbanding, apparently hasn't lost its sense of humor. 
The 2-year-old troupe in Santa Ana has organized a support guild of about 30 
volunteers called Slaves to ART in its effort to raise $7,000 by mid-June, the 
amount that the troupe's founders have said is needed to survive a 
financialcrisis. 
"The response has been wonderful," ART spokeswoman Amy Larson said Wednesday. 
"All kinds of people have been calling to ask what they can do to help." 
Larson said the troupe has set a fund-raiser for June 10 at the theater, 1636 
S. Grand Ave. near Edinger Avenue. "It will be a parking-lot sale," she said. 
"Basically we're interested in having people donate items to sell. And, of 
course, we need people to come and buy them." 
The sale will be held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Meanwhile the Slaves to ART volunteers will conduct "a telemarketing campaign" 
tonight and Friday to remind the 1,723 playgoers on the theater's mailing list 
of the current production, "Slow Dance on the Killing Ground" by William 
Hanley. 
"We're grateful for all the calls offering help," says Larson, "but we've still 
got to get people in the doors to see the show." JAN HERMAN
