FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to answer on party funds
CONSERVATIVE party officials will appear to answer questions from MPs
investigating the funding of political parties, Mr John Major said
yesterday.
The cross-party home affairs committee announced its inquiry into the
question of state aid for political parties earlier this week.
The prime minister had been pressed on the point by Mr George Mudie, a
Labour MP, who said he hoped the Tories would co-operate fully with the
inquiry, including the disclosure of 'such items as the Pounds 17m secretly
paid to the Conservatives to cover the cost of the last general election'.
Mr Major's promise of co-operation will be welcomed by the committee, which
has no power to force MPs or peers to attend.
