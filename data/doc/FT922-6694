FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Los Angeles riots cost insurers
Dollars 775m
THE recent riots in Los Angeles have cost insurers an estimated Dollars 775m
 -making the events of early May by far the most expensive civil disorder
ever seen in the US, writes Nikki Tait.
According to the Insurance Information Institute, the LA losses easily
exceeded those resulting from the 1965 Watts riots, also in Los Angeles.
At the time, the Watts riots caused Dollars 44m in insured losses. After
allowing for inflation, this would equate to about Dollars 183m today.
The latest LA riots rank fifth in terms of catastrophic losses for the
insurance industry. The worst damage came from Hurricane Hugo, which cost
insurers about Dollars 4.2bn.
This was followed by the Oakland fire disaster last year (Dollars 1.26bn).
