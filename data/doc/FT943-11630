FT  29 JUL 94 / Hartlepool launches historic quay
An '18th-century' seaport, built in just 10 months on formerly derelict land
in Hartlepool, Cleveland, has opened to the public this week.
Hartlepool Historic Quay, built around the dry dock of Gray's Shipyard, is
part of the town's drive to turn itself into a tourist attraction to help
replace the jobs lost in traditional heavy industry.
The quay, a Pounds 17m Teesside Development Corporation scheme, is part of
its Hartlepool marina project. It estimates total public-sector and
private-sector investment in the marina development will reach Pounds 170m.
Some of the new buildings - reconstructions based on historic architectural
styles along the north-east coast - are recreations of premises which were
occupied two centuries ago by chandlers, gunsmiths, naval architects and
instrument-makers and other traders and craftspeople.
HMS Trincomalee, the world's second oldest floating warship, being restored
nearby, will next year be moved into the dry dock. The development
corporation hopes that 1m visitors will eventually come to the town each
year.
