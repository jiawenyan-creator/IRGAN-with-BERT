Cedar River Railroad Co._Directed Service Order_Charles City Railway Lines Inc.



The Charles City Railway Lines, Inc. (CCRY), a 3.6 mile railroad in Charles City, Iowa, with connections to the Cedar
River Railroad Company (CRR) and the Soo Line Railroad Company (SOO) was shut down by its management effective with
the close of business February 24, 1994, due to a lack of operating funds, and has been out of operation since that time.
CCRY, based on its letter to shippers dated February 4, 1994 announcing cessation of operations effective February
24, 1994, placed Embargo No. 194, dated 2/14/94, which was effective 2/24/94. There are two principal shippers
located on the CCRY.

The Commission was first contacted about the impending shutdown of the CCRY on February 10, 1994, by shippers on the
line, and on February 16, 1994, by the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) indicating their concerns for the
possible shutdown of the railroad and requesting that the Commission consider issuing a directed service order (DSO).
IDOT's petition of February 16, 1994, requested the Commission to initiate voluntary directed service over the CCRY
lines and indicated that the CRR was willing to operate the CCRY lines as a ``Directed Rail Carrier'' (DRC). However,
it was not until February 28, 1994, that the CRR indicated its willingness to provide the uncompensated directed service
operations sought by IDOT and the two affected shippers.

Section 11125(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act authorizes the Commission to act in situations where it finds that


a rail carrier cannot transport traffic offered to it because_(1) its cash position makes its continuing operation
impossible; (2) transportation has been discontinued under court order; or (3) it has discontinued transportation
without obtaining a required certificate under 49 U.S.C. 10903

 (emphasis added). The initial period for the directed service order may not exceed 60 days. However, the order may
be extended for an additional period not to exceed 180 days.

Under a directed service order from the Commission, a directed carrier may voluntarily choose to provide directed
service without any subsidy or compensation to which it may be entitled from the Commission, as CRR has done here. See
St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co_Directed Service_Chicago, 363 I.C.C. 1 (1980), and Directed Service Order No. 1504, The New
York, Susquehanna and Western Railway Corporation_Directed Service_The Delaware and Hudson Railway Company,
(not printed) served June 22, 1988.
