  [Text] Kragujevac, 6 Mar (TANJUG) -- Djordje Bjegovic, 
prime minister of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], has 
described the Washington agreement on the Muslim-Croat 
federation as tendentious and as a signal to continue attempts 
to bring down the republic of Serb Krajina or to bring it back 
into Croatia. 
  Bjegovic told Kragujevac radio's "Hallmark of the Times" 
program today that the agreement has given a green light to 
Croatia to regulate some matters in the way it finds most 
suitable. 
  Therefore, according to Bjegovic, great caution is needed, 
primarily concerning defense matters, because this is a time 
when crucial issues are being resolved. 
  The Washington agreement would also be crucial because now 
is 
the time to show our strength, and the European Union must be 
reminded of the facts again: that the RSK has existed for four 
years and it's future lies in joining with the Srpska republic 
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  Commenting on reports that the four downed planes had taken 
off from Udbine airport in the RSK, Bjegovic said this is "yet 
another international game and a way to get in for those who 
want to get into the region and get involved, with the objective 
of serving their own interests." 
  There will certainly be more such games and the RSK has no 
interest in any confrontation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
It is therefore necessary to thoroughly probe the affair of the 
planes and to provide proper evidence, for only in that way can 
the truth be established, Bjegovic said. 
  He said it is necessary to achieve peace in order to begin 
with production and to reestablish traffic and infrastructure, 
because institutional matters have already been resolved [as 
received].
