FT  08 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK life assurance
The latest round of bonus cuts on with-profits policies was overdue. Big
annual bonuses paid out in the lean years - particularly 1990 - were always
difficult to justify. Even allowing for healthy investment returns last
year, many life company balance sheets were creaking under the strain. That
was bad for new business. A free asset ratio in low single figures - even if
above the legal minimum - is hardly an encouragement to independent
financial advisers to sell a company's products.
A weak balance sheet equally demands a more cautious investment strategy.
That is bad for investment returns. At the time of its much-vaunted switch
from equities to bonds in 1991, Norwich Union had a free asset ratio of 6
per cent. The company has since made a Pounds 100m profit on the trade. It
might legitimately argue that the decision was prompted by virtue as well as
necessity. But policyholders would surely prefer their investment managers
to have a free hand.
Even so, anyone who bought a with-profits policy last year must find it
galling to have their reversionary bonus cut to make up for past mistakes.
There could be more bad news to come. Following the latest chop, a 10-year
with-profits policy from Norwich Union is expected to yield around 13 per
cent after tax. The company expects to earn little more than 12 per cent on
investments over the same period - before both tax and expenses. Unless the
industry is over-compensating for past optimism, one can only conclude
bonuses are on a downward trend.
