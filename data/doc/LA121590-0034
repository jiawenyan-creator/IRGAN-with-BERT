BEILENSON SAYS IRAQ FOES WELCOME MILITARY THREAT 
Following meetings with Saudi Arabian, Israeli and Egyptian officials in the 
Middle East, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) said Friday that Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein's neighbors agree that neither economic sanctions nor 
negotiations will persuade him to withdraw from Kuwait. 
"They feel strongly that the only thing that will have any effect is a 
creditable military threat," Beilenson said by phone from Jerusalem. 
Beilenson, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, is 
the co-leader of a 19-member congressional delegation that met with U.S. 
military commanders and troops in the Saudi desert for two days before flying 
to Israel Thursday evening. 
The group was scheduled to return to Washington today. It also includes Rep. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
Beilenson said he was deeply impressed by the American troops, particularly 
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces, and other senior officers. 
He said morale was generally high and became higher the closer lawmakers got to 
the front lines. 
"On the one hand, you almost hope they have an opportunity to prove 
themselves," Beilenson said of the young soldiers. "On the other hand, having 
met them personally, you come away feeling so strongly you don't want to lose 
one single one of them." 
In Israel, the legislators met with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens and 
Foreign Minister David Levy.
