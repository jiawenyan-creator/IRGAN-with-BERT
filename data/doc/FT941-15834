FT  13 JAN 94 / Labour left tries to oust Brown
Labour left wingers are targeting Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, in
a re-emergence of the guerrilla war between the party's traditionalist and
modernising factions.
They want to see him replaced by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
secretary, who topped last year's shadow cabinet poll.
The first sign of this initiative to shift Mr Brown may come early next
month when a strong challenge to Mr Peter Mandelson, a key Brown ally, is
expected for the secretaryship of the party's backbench Treasury committee.
Some MPs say there has been a rush of colleagues signing up for membership
of this normally obscure body in order to qualify to vote in elections for
officers on February 1.
Internecine rivalry between traditionalists and modernisers has flared up
repeatedly under Mr John Smith's leadership, but it has been overshadowed by
the government's problems.
The Labour left suffered a big blow in November when Mr Peter Hain, MP for
Neath, south Wales, lost his position as Tribune Group secretary.
Mr Brown's star has waned markedly over the past year with Mr Tony Blair,
shadow home secretary, overtaking him as heir apparent to Mr Smith. His
showing in last year's elections for the National Executive Committee and
the shadow cabinet was down from a year earlier.
The left has little direct influence over the allocation of shadow cabinet
portfolios, which are in Mr Smith's gift. Nonetheless, a continued
deterioration in Mr Brown's performance in this year's polls would increase
pressure on the Labour leader to move his shadow chancellor.
