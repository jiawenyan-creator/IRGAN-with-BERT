FT  01 MAY 93 / Study criticises US operation in Somalia
OPERATION Restore Hope, the US-led intervention in Somalia last year, has
done more harm than good, claims a 60-page report published today.
The document by the London-based African Rights is timed to coincide with
the handover today of Washington's leadership of the international force to
the United Nations.
The authors say fighting and banditry have become worse in some areas, and
claim aid workers are unanimous in describing the security situation as
having deteriorated since western intervention.
The report maintains that the overall food supply problem had been overcome
as early as October 1992, before the US troops landed.
Over-supply of food has damaged the agricultural sector, says the report.
Efforts at disarmament of rival factions have been 'sporadic and
half-hearted', and both the UN and the US have failed in the peace process
by giving warlords an 'unwarranted legitimacy' and not consulting a
cross-section of civil society.
The highly critical analysis is by Ms Rakiya Omaar and Mr Alex de Waal,
co-founders of African Rights. The small, UK-charity funded organisation was
formed last December after they resigned from Africa Watch, part of a
US-based international network of human rights monitors.
The experience of the authors in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa will give
weight to their analysis. Their judgment is also likely to be backed by
several of the charities working in Somalia.
The report calls for a UN commission of inquiry into the operation,
disarmament of warlords, and greater attention to long-term economic
rehabilitation and the peace process.
