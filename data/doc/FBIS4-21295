  [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, 20 March--The PGR's [Office 
of the Attorney General of the Republic] local representative, 
Roberto Soltero Acuna, announced today that federal agents 
seized $110,000 from two presumed drug traffickers as they were 
negotiating the sale of 50 kg of cocaine. He reported the arrest 
of Reynaldo Gumaro Garcia and Eliseo Hernandez Guerra in the 
Cola de Caballo tourist area, where both had gone, apparently to 
close a deal. 
  Based on the investigation, Gumario Garcia, who had the 
money 
in his possession, in packets of $5,000 bills, arrived on that 
site in a vehicle with Texas license plates; while his contact, 
Hernandez Guerra, came in a white pickup truck. 
  When the agents noticed their meeting, they started 
questioning the two subjects, who appeared nervous. Therefore, 
they were subjected to a thorough search, resulting in the 
discovery of the money. 
  One of them confessed that, last February, he had brought 
$280,000 into the country, a sum also resulting from drug sales. 
He claimed to have been engaged in carrying money from the 
United States to Mexico, and vice versa, hired by a man known to 
him only as Gerardo Torres. 
  As for Hernandez Guerra, the police chief said that he was 
placed at the disposal of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office 
to make his statement.
