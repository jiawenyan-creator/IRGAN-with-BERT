LOCAL; 
GIRL STRANGLED; 14-YEAR-OLD HELD 
Seven-year-old Sara Nan Hodges of Newhall was strangled and her body stuffed 
into an 18-by-18-inch space beneath the headboard of a 14-year-old neighbor's 
water bed, apparently before she was reported missing last Thursday, Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies said this morning. 
The girl's body was found Sunday afternoon in a house five doors from her own 
home on Alderbrook Drive. (Story, Part I, Page 3.) The 14-year-old, who had 
lived with his mother in the house about two months, was arrested on suspicion 
of murder and was being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
Deputies said the suspect, who moved to Newhall from Florida after being 
involved in burglaries there, slept at night on the bed where the body was 
hidden until it was found Sunday by the owner of the home. 
The cause of death had not yet been determined. Deputies said the decomposition 
of the body led them to conclude that the girl was killed sometime after she 
was noticed missing at 2 p.m. Thursday, but before she was reported missing to 
the Sheriff's Department six hours later.
