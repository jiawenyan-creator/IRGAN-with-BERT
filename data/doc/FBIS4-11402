  [Text] Buenos Aires, April 21 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus today informed Argentina's President Carlos Menem about 
his proposal to create a free-trade zone between the two 
countries which is embedded in the governmental memorandum of 
understanding signed on Tuesday night. 
  The two statesmen also discussed Menem's initiative to 
create 
"white helmets" within the United Nations to fight hunger in the 
world, similar to the peace-keeping blue helmets. 
  Later Klaus ended his three-day official visit to Argentina 
and left for Chile, a second stop on his ten-day tour of South 
America which will also take him to Brazil.
