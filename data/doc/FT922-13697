FT  10 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Formula One in the fast lane
RACING DRIVERS need to monitor continuously their vehicle's performance
during a race, but until now this has meant diverting their gaze from the
road ahead.
GEC Avionics has developed helmet mounted displays, based on the latest
military pilot's equipment, which will be evaluated for potential use during
the current World Championship Grand Prix season by two Team Lotus Formula
One drivers - Johnny Herbert and Mika Hakkinen.
The 46mm x 18mm light emitting diode (LED) display fixed to the helmet shows
information such as engine revs per minute and gear selected, plus
temperature, pressures and fuel levels. GEC Avionics: UK, 0634 844400.
