FT  28 OCT 94 / Minister disputes petrol criticisms
The government yesterday reaffirmed its advice to motorists to use unleaded
petrol in spite of criticism in a report by the Commons transport committee
on air pollution in London, Charles Batchelor writes.
It also said there was no evidence that super-unleaded petrol contributed
significantly to levels of benzene, which can cause cancer, although this
would be kept under review.
This sets the government in conflict with both the select committee and the
Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which reported on Wednesday.
Both urged bans on the use of super-unleaded because it contained high
levels of benzene.
The government and the two reports all draw different conclusions from the
scientific research carried out into the impact on health of the constituent
parts of unleaded fuel.
