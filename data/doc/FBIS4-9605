  [Excerpt] Warsaw, 28 Apr--After Thursday's meeting of the 
heads of the Council of Ministers Economic and Sociopolitical 
Committees, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz told 
journalists that "the government will not give in to trade union 
demands expressed in the form of a diktat" because the 
government is responsible for observing the rules of a 
democratic state. 
  Cimoszewicz stated that he knows nothing about the drawing 
up 
by the government of a timetable for implementing Solidarity's 
demands, with the intention of presenting it to the trade 
unionists, as the strikers are demanding. 
  "Any kind of serious negotiations on any kind of demands in 
circumstances when strikes are continuing are hard to imagine," 
Cimoszewicz stressed. He announced that Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak will put forward the government's position on the strikes 
in the Sejm on 29 April. [passage omitted]
