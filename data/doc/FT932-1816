FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Carlton plans move into Asian television
CARLTON Communications, the broadcasting and television services group is
planning an expansion into the Asian television market.
Mr Nigel Walmsley, managing director of Carlton Television, the weekday ITV
company for the London region, has recently returned from exploratory talks
with leading broadcasters in the region.
The company, already well known to Asian broadcasters through Quantel, its
broadcasting equipment division, is now keen to explore everything from
equity stakes in Asian broadcasters to joint ventures on new channels.
Mr Walmsley had talks in Hong Kong with Star TV, the Asian satellite venture
which claims more than 45m viewers in 38 countries and with the Hong Kong
domestic broadcasters Television Broadcasts (TVB) and Asia TV.
Earlier this month, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation signalled its
intention to become a significant force in the region with an agreement to
pay HKDollars 1.85bn (Pounds 161m) for a 22 per cent stake in TVB.
Star has been talking to a number of potential investors while making it
clear that it is mainly interested in joint ventures on the programming side
rather than equity investments in the holding company.
Carlton has been looking at the potential of television investments in
Singapore and mainland China.
