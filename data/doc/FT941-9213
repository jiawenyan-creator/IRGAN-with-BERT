FT  16 FEB 94 / HSE criticised by audit office
The Health and Safety Executive has been criticised by the National Audit
Office for having too few inspectors working on preventing
accidents.
The report by Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, says that in 1992-93 430
people died as a result of work-related accidents. Accidents cost industry
and individuals Pounds 10bn a year.
The NAO suggested that 132 of 331 health and safety assessments were still
incomplete when the report was researched.
