WOMAN ARRESTED AFTER COLLISION WITH POLICE 
A Burbank woman was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving after her car hit a 
police car in Sunland, injuring herself, two police officers and two women who 
were riding with her, Los Angeles police said Thursday. 
Christina Schirmeister, 20, was given a blood-alcohol test at the time of the 
accident about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to Officer Douglas Burns of the 
Valley Traffic Division. 
Officers Joseph Napolitano, who was driving the police car, and Ron Calhoun 
were treated for minor injuries at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills 
after their car was rear-ended by a 1986 Subaru driven by Schirmeister, police 
said. Schirmeister and her two passengers were also treated for minor injuries, 
authorities said. 
The patrol car was making a U-turn on Foothill Boulevard at Wentworth Street 
when it was hit, said Officer Brad Peters. Both cars suffered major damage, he 
said.
