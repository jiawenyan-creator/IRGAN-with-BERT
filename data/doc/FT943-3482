FT  14 SEP 94 / Labour raps NHS 'image-building'
Nearly 150 health trusts set up by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, spent an average of Pounds 200,000 each on new logos and
image-building, Labour said yesterday.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the 143 trusts set up in
the government's fourth round of health administration reforms spent a total
of Pounds 37m on start-up costs.
He said the total cost of setting up all four rounds of trusts was more than
Pounds 100m - enough to provide 120 modern health centres.
He said: 'Millions of pounds have been spent - with no obvious benefit in
most cases - on setting up the new trusts with their new logo and image. We
need to restore common sense to the NHS, so that patients again come before
image-building.'
Mr Blunkett said examples of image-building costs included the Pounds 25,000
spent by the Priority Healthcare Wearside NHS Trust on 'changing signposts,
stationery, (and) identity badges'. Portsmouth Healthcare NHS Trust was said
to have spent Pounds 10,000 on a logo and stationery in addition to Pounds
85,000 on internal and external signs.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, accused Mr Blunkett of making 'yet
another petty attack on a huge programme of reform which is delivering
vastly improved healthcare all round the country'. He said the 'one-off
investment' in setting up NHS trusts had enabled hundreds of thousands more
patients to receive operations.
Mr Alun Michaels, a Labour home affairs spokesman, launched the party's
Partners Against Crime programme, just days after Mr John Major unveiled the
government's Partnership Against Crime crusade.
Labour's plan involves a partnership between the police, local authorities
and business, backed by a statutory framework to give a high priority to
crime prevention. It would not increase the number of police.
