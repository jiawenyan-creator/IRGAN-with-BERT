FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Johnston Group slides into
losses
JOHNSTON GROUP, the specialist civil and mechanical engineer, has slid into
losses, another casualty of over-ambitious 1980s investment in the property
sector.
Pre-tax profits collapsed from Pounds 5.86m to losses of Pounds 1.09m, after
a Pounds 4.34m exceptional charge covering the write-down on three property
developments. Sales were 5 per cent lower at Pounds 119.9m.
Losses per share were 14.18p (earnings 30.43p) but the company is to pay a
reduced final dividend of 4.5p, giving a total for the year of 9p, down 31
per cent on the previous 13p.
Mr Brian Deller, finance director, said Johnston had now bitten the bullet
with the 25 per cent write-down in property values. 'Property development
served us well in the 1980s until 1988,' he said. 'We thought it had a great
deal of potential but we stayed in too long.'
The property diversion blighted a result which was otherwise relatively
sound, given the depth of the recession in its markets.
Engineering saw a profit of Pounds 1.38m turn into losses of Pounds 1.91m on
sales that fell 20 per cent. The figure included the cost of redundancies
and consolidating a number of companies in single operating units.
Construction and contracting, on the other hand, benefitted from development
work done for the water companies. The division increased profits from
Pounds 1.66m to Pounds 2.2m. Construction materials fell slightly to profits
of Pounds 4.38m.
