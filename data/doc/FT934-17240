FT  01 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Fed rules on commodity
derivatives
THE Federal Reserve Board has granted the Bank of Montreal powers to deal in
commodity derivatives. The decision is expected to apply to other banks,
writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
The Fed ruling will extend competition between banks and broker-dealers to
non-financial futures and options.
Prior to the Fed decision, banks were allowed to trade financial instruments
on US futures and options exchanges, but were barred from clearing or
servicing customer needs in exchange-traded energy or agricultural
derivatives.
The Fed said Chicago-based Harris Futures Corporation could execute trades
and clear non-financial transactions at the US's three largest futures
exchanges. However, Harris will not be allowed to trade commodity futures
and options for its own account, trade the physical commodities or offer
commodities advice.
