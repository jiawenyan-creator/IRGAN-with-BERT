The Applicants represent that the Chevron paper, unlike all the other commercial paper involved in the CNA Transactions,
is referred to as ``coupon paper'' which sells at its principal face amount, rather than at a discount, and has a stated
interest rate. Interest accrues at the stated interest rate, and the principal amount plus the accrued interest is
returned at maturity or on prepayment. Thus, when the Trust acquired $65,900,000 principal amount Chevron paper
with a maturity of December 3, 1992 and a 3.125 percent stated interest rate, the Trust had paid $65,900,000. When the
Trust sold this position back to Chevron on November 2, 1992, the Trust received $65,928,614.85, including five days'
interest at the paper's stated rate of 3.125 percent. The Applicant represents that the remainder of the commercial
paper involved in the CNA Transactions is referred to as ``discount paper'', for which the purchaser pays a price below
the principal face amount and is paid the face amount upon the paper's maturity. The Applicants state that approximately
one-half of Chevron's commercial paper is issued as discount paper, and the remainder is issued as coupon paper. The
Applicants represent that investors typically preferring to invest in U.S. Treasury bills, which are issued only
in discount form, are likely to invest in discount paper, while coupon paper is a more likely investment for investors
which typically invest in interest-bearing securities.
