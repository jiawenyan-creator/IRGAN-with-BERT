  [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to step down will not affect 
Japan's ties with the Republic of China [ROC], a Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs official said Saturday [9 April]. 
  The official, who requested anonymity, said the Japanese 
Government has been reluctant to develop official ties with 
Taiwan for fear of offending Communist China, with which Tokyo 
has diplomatic relations. 
  "Since relations between the ROC and Japanese Governments 
have been cool, I don't think our ties will worsen simply 
because of Hosokawa's resignation," the official in charge of 
Japan affairs said. 
  Although many countries, including the United States, 
Germany, Britain and France, have sent ministerial-level 
officials to visit Taiwan, Japan has declined to follow suit. 
  "I think the Japanese Government will continue to ban 
exchanges of visits of high-level officials between the two 
countries, no matter who will assume the premiership," the 
official said. 
  Hosokawa on Friday announced his decision to resign to take 
responsibility for failing to clear up questions about 
controversial financial dealings and for provoking a four-week 
opposition boycott in parliament.
