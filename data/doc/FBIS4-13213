  [Text] Goat, Apr. 16 (MAP) -- Morocco and Russia concluded 
two accords providing for the creation of an intergovernmental 
commission for economic, scientific and technical cooperation 
and for a new frame of trade exchanges. 
  Under the first accord, a joint intergovernmental commission 
is to be set up to examine issues linked to bilateral 
cooperation, explore ways to develop and promote economic, 
scientific and technical relations and extend assistance to the 
two countries' enterprises concerned. 
  The renewable five year accord stipulates that the 
commission 
will meet al least once a year alternately in Rabat and Moscow. 
  The second accord sets a new frame governing trade exchanges 
between the two countries with a view to strengthening economic 
and trade relations between the two sides. In 1992, 
Moroccan-Russian trade exchanges amounted to 876 million dirhams 
and are expected to increase under the accord. 
  The two accords were initialled on the Russian side by 
Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov and on the 
Moroccan side by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and 
Cooperation Taib Fassi Fihri and Minister of External Trade, 
Foreign Investments and Handicraft Mourad Cherif.
