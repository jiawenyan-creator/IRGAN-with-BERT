FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder sells holding
GOODMAN FIELDER, the Sydney-based food and bakeries group, is to sell its
remaining stake in Ridley Corporation, Australia's largest commercial stock
feed miller, raising approximately ADollars 60m (USDollars 40m) in the
process.
Goodman currently holds around 32.1m ordinary shares in Ridley and 26m
convertible notes - which will be converted into an equivalent number of
shares before the sale takes place.
The total holding sold amounts to a 29.7 per cent interest in the stock feed
company, which also has large salt operations.
Yesterday, SBC Dominguez Barry, which is underwriting the offering at
ADollars 1.03 a share, said that it expected approximately half the shares
to be sold to institutional investors. The other half will be reserved for
priority applications from Goodman Fielder shareholders. Full details of the
offering are promised shortly.
Like many Australian companies, Goodman Fielder has been pruning back its
business recently and concentrating on core operations.
