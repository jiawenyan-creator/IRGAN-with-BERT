FT  19 AUG 92 / Briton held by Iraq after disappearing in Kuwait
A BRITON who disappeared in the Kuwaiti desert in unexplained circumstances
seven weeks ago was understood to be 'well' in a Baghdad jail, the Foreign
Office said yesterday, writes David Owen in London.
Mr Paul Ride, 33, vanished in June while travelling between two of his
employer's offices in northern Kuwait. At the time of his disappearance, he
had nearly completed his contract with Taylor International, the catering
group.
The Foreign Office said yesterday it had made representations on Mr Ride's
behalf to the Iraqi authorities, requesting full particulars of why he had
been detained.
It was 'still awaiting' details of charges laid against him, as well as an
explanation of why he had been arrested.
