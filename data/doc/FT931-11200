FT  04 FEB 93 / Travellers count the cost of pounds in their pockets
BRITISH travellers changing pounds at hotels and foreign exchange dealers in
the US and Europe yesterday may wish they had stayed at home, writes Michael
Skapinker, Leisure Industries Correspondent.
Travellers to France who last summer divided French franc prices by 10 to
reach their rough sterling equivalent were yesterday being offered FFr7.73
to the pound at the George V hotel in Paris.
That was for travellers' cheques. Anyone rash enough to visit Paris with
sterling notes would have received FFr7.62 to the pound. That would buy a
bar of chocolate, with a little change, or a double espresso in a boulevard
cafe.
Britons in Germany with recent memories of dividing local prices by three
were in for a similar shock. At the Dom hotel in Cologne, holders of
sterling were being offered DM2.18 to the pound for either cash or
travellers' cheques.
Thomas Cook's bureau de change in Frankfurt was offering DM2.31 for
travellers' cheques and DM2.29 for cash.
But unlike the aftermath of Black Wednesday, when the pound left the
European exchange rate mechanism and some establishments refused to accept
sterling, most hotels said they would exchange pounds at the rates quoted.
Thomas Cook said it always advised British tourists to buy dollar
travellers' cheques before visiting the US as it was often difficult to
change foreign currency there.
UK travellers could get Dollars 1.35 for their pounds at Thomas Cook's
central New York branch, but the company said: 'They're not keen.'
