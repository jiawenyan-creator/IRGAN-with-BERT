FT  02 FEB 93 / People: Gottlieb - aiming to prick the rent balloon
Michael Gottlieb, owner of two London restaurants, has been elected joint
chairman of the Property Market Reform Group, an organisation campaigning
for changes to British property leases.
Gottlieb, 45, is a fierce critic of several 'iniquitous' aspects of the
commercial lease system, namely its lack of transparency, its biased
arbitration procedures, its upward-only rent review clauses and privity of
contract, which makes original tenants liable if a subsequent tenant
defaults.
'Rents are now becoming the main cost factor for all retailers and the
simple fact is that rent increases are forcing businesses into bankruptcy,'
he says. 'That is not the way to foster economic growth.'
Gottlieb is the proprietor of Smollensky's Balloon and Smollensky's in the
Strand. He became convinced of the need for reform of the commercial
property system after writing an article in a trade magazine about his own
experience. This generated a huge response from the restaurant industry; he
is vice-chairman of the Restauranteurs Association of Great Britain, which
is a member of the Property Market Reform Group. This was launched last
summer with the intent of persuading parliament to legislate against
practices such as upwards-only rent reviews.
