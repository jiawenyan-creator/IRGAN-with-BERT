Pentaerythritol, Mixed Esters with Carboxylic Acids; Revocation of a Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to revoke a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances
Control Act (TSCA) for pentaerythritol, mixed esters with carboxylic acids based on receipt of toxicity data. The
data indicate that for purposes of TSCA section 5 the substance will not present an unreasonable risk to health. 

</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Written comments must be received by EPA by September 6, 1994.




</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 All comments must be sent in triplicate to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ATTN: OPPT Document Receipt Office
(7407), 401 M St. SW., Rm. EG99, Washington, DC 20460. Comments that are confidential must be clearly marked
confidential business information (CBI). If CBI is claimed, three additional sanitized copies must also be submitted.
Nonconfidential versions of comments on this proposed rule will be placed in the rulemaking record and will be available
for public inspection. Comments should include the docket control number. The docket control number for the chemical
substance in this SNUR is OPPTS50601A. Unit III. of this preamble contains additional information on submitting
comments containing CBI.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of September 23, 1992 (57 FR 44050), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for pentaerythritol, mixed
esters with carboxylic acids (P911250). Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance,
EPA is proposing to revoke this SNUR. 


I. Proposed Revocation 


EPA is proposing to revoke the significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substance
under 40 CFR part 721 subpart E. In this unit, EPA provides a brief description for the substance, including its PMN
number, chemical name (generic name if the specific name is claimed as CBI), CAS citation (if assigned), basis for
the revocation of the section 5(e) consent order for the substance, and the CFR citation removed in the regulatory
text section of this proposed rule. Further background information for the substance is contained in the rulemaking
record referenced in Unit IV. of this preamble. 


PMN Number P911250 




Chemical name:

 (generic) Pentaerythritol, mixed esters with carboxylic acids. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of revocation of section 5(e) consent order:

 December 7, 1993. 


Basis for revocation of section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was revoked based on test data submitted under the terms of the consent order. Based on the Agency's analysis
of the submitted data, EPA has sufficient information to determine for purposes of TSCA section 5, that the manufacture,
processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the PMN substance will not present an unreasonable risk
to human health. Accordingly, EPA has determined that further regulation under section 5(e) is not warranted at this
time. 


Toxicity testing results:

 A mouse micronucleus assay of the substance was negative. In a 28day dietary study the No Observed Adverse Effect
Level (NOAEL) was 1,000 ppm (parts per million) (approximately 110 mg/kg/day). Toxicity at higher doses of 5,000
and 12,500 ppm consisted of mild anemia and liver effects. 


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.5660. 


II. Background and Rationale for Proposed Revocation of the Rule 


During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this proposed revocation, EPA
concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient
to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and that the substance is expected to be produced
in substantial quantities and there may be significant or substantial environmental exposure. EPA identified the
tests necessary to make a reasoned evaluation of the risks posed by the substance to human health. Based on these findings,
a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. EPA reviewed testing
conducted by the PMN submitter pursuant to the 5(e) consent order for the substance and determined that the information
available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance. EPA concluded that,
for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and consequently revoked the
section 5(e) consent order. The proposed revocation of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is consistent
with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is proposing a revocation of SNUR provisions
for this chemical substance. EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or
process this substance. In addition, export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required.



III. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information 


Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a public version of the comments that EPA can
place in the public file. 

IV. Rulemaking Record 


The record for the rule which EPA is proposing to revoke was established at OPPTS50601A (P911250).
This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing the rule and includes the test data that formed
the basis for this proposal.



V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


EPA is proposing to revoke the requirements of the rule. Any costs or burdens associated with the rule will also be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).
