  [Text] Harare Feb 15 SAPA--Zimbabwe Foreign Affairs 
Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said on Tuesday [15 February] the 
government was not aware of any application by the Ethiopian 
Government to extradite former dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, 
the ZIANA News Agency reported. Mr Shamuyarira said in an 
interview that if an application was made, the government would 
consider it. 
  "We have not seen the application yet. The position is that 
we are still unhappy about statements made by (Mr) Mengistu. We 
expressed our displeasure about it to him," he said. However, he 
said he did not know of any statute that would compel Zimbabwe 
to hand over Mr Mengistu to Ethiopia. 
  Ethiopian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Fantahum Michael on Monday 
said his government was processing a formal application to 
Zimbabwe to extradite Mr Mengistu. This has been sparked off by 
recent statements by Mr Mengistu in which he defended his rule 
in Ethiopia and blamed unnamed members of his ruling circle for 
his overthrow, claiming they had been paid by "imperialist 
circles".
