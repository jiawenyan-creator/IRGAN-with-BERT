FT  25 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo strong on bid talk
OIL EXPLORATION group Lasmo was the strongest performer in the FT-SE 100
index yesterday, the shares surging 26 to 233p - a rise of more than 12.5
per cent. Rumours of a possible bid by Total of France and also disposals
prompted particularly heavy turnover of 7.3m in the underlying market. It
also saw busy trading in options with 2,887 contracts traded - equivalent to
just under 3m shares.
Analysts tended to be sceptical about a full scale bid, but suggested that
Total might be interested in Lasmo's Californian refining operation,
inherited when it took over Ultramar last year.
Lasmo has around Pounds 1bn in debts and is known to be keen to reduce its
gearing. Mr Keith Morris at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said that between Pounds
200m and Pounds 300m may be raised by disposing of the Californian refining
division and that this would be regarded as a key to getting Lasmo's gearing
back down.
MEPC in demand
Talk that Hongkong Land is eyeing MEPC, the UK's second biggest property
group, pushed the shares 12 higher at 351p. The rally in the property
sector, which started after the Easter holiday, was thought to be a delayed
reaction to the election result and perceived improvement in consumer
confidence over the vacation period.
However, the return of the Hongkong Land rumour - an old favourite which
reached its height a year ago, this time with Hammerson in the frame - has
helped to fuel the revival.
Hongkong Land is known to be looking for a UK vehicle to extend its property
interests and lessen its reliance on the colony for its asset base. Land
Securities, ahead 10 at 434p and British Land, up 6 at 213p, rose in
sympathy.
Eurotunnel falls
Eurotunnel bucked the market trend, the shares tumbling 18 to 368p, making
it the day's biggest fall in percentage terms.
The company did not make a cash call as some had feared but the market was
dissappointed by a 9.5 per cent increase in costs to Pounds 8.1bn.
Sentiment was also hurt by news that the company is prepared to offer up to
12 per cent of its equity to TML, the channel tunnel constructor, as a part
of a settlement in the current dispute between the two parties, though only
after shareholder approval. Turnover reached 2.5m with the usual support
from French investors said to have been absent.
Brisk turnover in Cable &amp; Wireless helped push the shares 15 higher at 574p
as fresh talk appeared that the telecoms group might be about to sell part
of its stake in Hongkong Telecom. Most in the market discounted the old
rumour, which this time had Cables selling an 8.3 per cent portion (taking
its share down to 50.1 per cent) to US Sprint, the US telecoms operator,
raising HKDollars 580m.
Another version had the Chinese state telecoms group Citic as the proposed
purchaser. A more likely reason for the strength was improved market
sentiment towards the stock, underpinned yesterday by a buy note from
securities house Hoare Govett.
BP lost 2 1/2 to 247 and Shell slipped 3 to 464p, following disappointing
first quarter results from the US oil majors, including Exxon on Thursday.
BP's first quarter figures are due on May 7.
Banks were actively traded as the market waited to see whether Lloyds would
top the offer for Midland from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. Midland rose 8 to
375p with 13m shares traded while Lloyds gained 13 to 429p as it appeared
that Bank of Scotland, 2 up at 118p, was not about to smooth Lloyds path.
The Scottish bank denied that it had held talks on buying up to 500 bank
branches if Lloyds decided that this would help prevent the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission from blocking a bid for Midland.
A report that Sir John Quinton might step down as chairman of Barclays
boosted the shares 19 to 352p, although market observers were somewhat
doubtful that this will be announced at the AGM next Thursday. Some were
also less than sure that the market would be enthusiastic about any likely
replacement for Sir John, but said the shares had the biggest yield among
the clearing banks and were due for a recovery.
Talk that Smiths Industries could emerge as a white knight for Dowty Group,
fighting off a hostile bid from TI Group, was again doing the rounds.
However, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew sent out a note to clients yesterday arguing
that the bid was a 'full and fair offer unlikely to prompt a counter bid.'
Smiths followed the market up to end 2 firmer at 310p after an initial
decline. Dowty had a quieter session and closed unchanged at 177p. TI was
steady at 669p.
Siebe continued to benefit from switching out of TI and the shares added 11
to 697p having briefly touched 700p for the first time. Bid speculation in
the wake of Dowty continued to lift APV. The shares added another 7 to 126p.
Takeover speculation continued to surround Tarmac - with Minorco again the
favoured predator. In a buoyant building materials sector, Tarmac jumped 9
to 157p on heavy turnover of 7m shares. Other stocks on the move included
Blue Circle, also perceived to be a bid candidate, which climbed 9 to 275p,
RMC Group, ahead 8 at 666p and Redland, 6 stronger at 559p. Marshalls,
basking in the speedy take-up by institutions of Ibstock Johnsen's 4.2 per
cent stake, rose 8 to 96p.
The hangover from Wall Street's shunning of drugs stocks again affected
Glaxo Holdings, the shares shedding 7 to 721p, and Medeva, off 9 at 229p.
However, SmithKline Beecham strengthened on reflection of its results, the
shares jumping 27 to 827p.
Expectation that Union Carbide's upcoming presentations in the UK will
contain good news and reflect well on the gases section of BOC prompted the
latter to firm 14 to 705p.
Interest in the leisure sector again focused on hotel stocks, with both
Queens Moat Houses and Forte in demand. Queens Moat has been heavily tipped
as a good recovery stock. The shares rose 3 to 87p on turnover of 7.5m.
Forte gained 4 to 259p in brisk volume of 2.2m.
