FT  23 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Essential that clearers heed
governor's call (1)
Sir, The governor of the Bank of England is right to be worried that the
economic upturn could be stifled ('Bank governor calls in clearers',
September 21). Our company's experience illustrates the problem well and
also points the way to one possible solution.
As a manufacturer with a high export ratio we were well looked after by our
bank for many years. Then, under increasing pressure from head office, our
local manager told us he was no longer allowed to include export debtors in
our total balance sheet for the purpose of calculating our lending facility.
He offered his bank's own Export Credit Guarantee Department scheme as an
alternative, but even he recoiled when he realised that this equated to an
interest charge of 24 per cent] In order to maintain our export momentum we
were forced to look for an alternative supplier of banking services with a
more enlightened attitude to exporters. We found this in Credit Lyonnais, a
leading French bank, which is progressively developing a branch network
throughout the UK. This bank makes no distinction between a debt in Hamburg
and a debt in Huddersfield.
It will be interesting to see whether the governor's initiative succeeds in
provoking a positive response from the UK clearers or whether the paralysis
which grips them has set in too deeply for that. If the latter is true,
other businessmen facing the same problem may like to know that they are
free to go beyond the UK for their banking just as for their car or their
refrigerator.
