Title:

 Questionnaires for Operations and Maintenance (OM), Biosolids Use (Biosolids), Storm Water (SW), and Combined
Sewer Overflow (CSO) Management Award Nominations Under EPA's Environmental Excellence Awards Program (EPA ICR
No. 1287.04; OMB Control No. 20400101).


Abstract:

 This ICR is an extension of an existing information collection request in support of the Environmental Excellence
Awards Program. Established under section 501(e) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), the program
recognizes municipalities and industries that demonstrate outstanding technological achievements; or innovative
processes, methods or devices in their waste treatment and pollution abatement programs. The program provides a
positive incentive for compliance with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination system and supports sound
environmental management practices at water treatment facilities.
As part of the process for selection, candidates must complete and submit relevant questionnaires (Biosolids, CSO,
OM, SW) requesting: (1) Identification information; (2) planning and process reports; (3) general plant design
and layout information; (4) flow/output data; and (5) financial and management information. 
The questionnaires are screened initially by the State or EPA Region, then forwarded through headquarters to the
EPA-sponsored National Panel (consisting of EPA, professional associations and States) for the awards selection.
A national awards ceremony is held each fall in Washington, DC to honor those facilities that are selected. 


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 14 hours per response including
an average of 8 hours per response for facility Owner/Operators reviewing instructions, gathering the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the questionnaire; and 6 hours per response for State agencies screening applicants,
and reviewing and forwarding questionnaires to the EPA. 


Respondents:

 Owners/operators of municipal or private wastewater treatment facilities, and State agencies involved in the awards
process, as appropriate. 


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 200 owners/operators and their respective State agencies, where appropriate.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Frequency of Collection:

 On occasion of submission of questionnaire. 


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents

: 2800 hours.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
