THE SIDELINES; 
47 HURT IN YUGOSLAV SOCCER CLASHES 
At least 47 people, including 17 policemen, were hurt in clashes between rival 
fans after a Yugoslav first division soccer match, Belgrade police said today. 
Fans fought among themselves and threw lumps of concrete at police after a 
match Sunday between Belgrade rivals Red Star and Partizan. Twenty-three people 
have been charged in connection with Sunday's clashes. 
The Yugoslav Soccer Assn., faced with growing hooliganism at matches, today 
urged fans of the Croatian first division club Dinamo Zagreb not to attend a 
match in Belgrade next Sunday between their team and Partizan. The country's 
highest soccer authority fears a repeat of clashes that occurred between 
Partizan and Dinamo fans at a match in Zagreb earlier this year, the official 
Tanjug news agency said.
