FT  26 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Taiwan link for Hicks, Muse
HICKS, MUSE, a Dallas-based private investment company, yesterday became the
latest foreign concern to sign a strategic alliance with Taiwan's ministry
of economic affairs.
Other companies which have done so include: AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications
giant; Motorola, the communications and electronics company; General Motors,
the vehicle maker; and GE, which makes aero-engines.
These alliances are intended to bring together foreign companies seeking to
cut costs and Taiwanese manufacturers eager to acquire new skills.
At least five more companies, both US and European, are preparing to sign
similar deals with the ministry, according to Mr Paul Hsu, a lawyer involved
in the alliances.
Taiwanese companies 'are good at making components but bad at integrating
them (into products)', he said. However, Taiwan offers high productivity and
rapidly growing local markets.
