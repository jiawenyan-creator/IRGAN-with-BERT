  [Text] Provincial Secretary Yan Haiwan concluded his 
four-day investigation of the work to combat drought and 
undertake spring plowing in Dingxi Prefecture today. He 
stressed the need to consolidate and develop the accomplishments 
of Dingxi and Longxi Counties and quicken the pace in getting 
rid of poverty and becoming comparatively well-off. 
  Yan Haiwan indicated that it was necessary to consolidate 
and 
develop the accomplishments of Dingxi and Longxi Counties, 
continue to spread their good experiences and practice, widen 
the train of thought on building Dingxi and Longxi under the new 
situation of quickening the pace to realize the goal of becoming 
comparatively well-off, deepen rural reform, and develop 
enterprises in townships and towns in a big way. He said it was 
necessary to accelerate the export of labor so that Dingxi could 
steadily resolve the problem of acquiring sufficient food and 
clothing in the next few years, with some of its populace 
achieving the goal of becoming comparatively well-off, while 
getting rid of poverty in a comprehensive way. 
  In addition, Yan Haiwan required doing a good job of 
tackling 
key projects in supporting the impoverished by focusing efforts 
on resolving a number of key projects by fully relying on the 
masses. Key projects such as water conservancy work, road 
building, and energy resources should be determined accurately 
and grasped firmly. As soon as projects are determined, efforts 
should be exerted to have them completed in a down-to-earth way. 
In tackling key projects in supporting the impoverished, 
attention should be paid to education in science and technology, 
bringing up rural qualified people in doing practical work, 
spreading rural applied science and technical know-how in a big 
way, and developing rural education.
