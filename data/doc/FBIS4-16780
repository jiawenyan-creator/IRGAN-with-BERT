  [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the parliamentary group 
Russia's Choice, believes the country's budget expenditure on 
defense should be cut. In an interview for DELOVOY MIR, he 
noted that 37 trillion rubles have been earmarked in the draft 
budget for military spending; in other words a fifth of the 
budget. Yegor Gaydar believes it necessary for the Russian Army 
to be tailored to the new conditions and new possibilities that 
exist in the country.
