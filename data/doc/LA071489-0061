MAN WHO ROBBED FOR DRUG MONEY GETS 7-YEAR TERM 
Despite his emotional pleas for mercy, a Reseda man who was charged with 
robbing seven San Fernando Valley convenience stores to support his drug habit 
was sentenced Thursday to seven years in state prison by a San Fernando 
Superior Court judge. 
According to court documents, Gabor Frank Magyari, 30, stole more than $1,600 
from seven small convenience stores between October, 1988, and this January. 
Under an agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to five counts of 
robbery. Two other counts were dismissed, prosecutors said. 
Judge John A. Major rejected pleas by Magyari, his mother and stepfather and 
his lawyer, who asked "in the name of mercy" that Major "punish the sin and not 
the sinner" by placing Magyari in a long-term drug rehabilitation program 
instead of prison. 
Magyari told the judge he began smoking marijuana at age 13 and was hooked on 
drugs by 20. Choking on tears, Magyari said he now wants to get a fresh start 
on life by kicking the habit. 
But Major said Magyari had exercised his "free will" in using drugs and robbing 
stores. "You have to be punished. You have to learn that you cannot go through 
life sticking a gun in someone's face, robbing them of their hard-earned 
money," Major said. 
Magyari probably will be paroled in about three years, Major said.
