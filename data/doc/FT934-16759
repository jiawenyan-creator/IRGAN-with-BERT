FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Bottomley denies threat
to health service
MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, will signal a new offensive on
Thursday to rebut the accusation that the government's reforms threaten the
National Health Service.
In a speech redefining the government's duties towards the NHS she plans to
say: 'Perverse critics of the internal health market say that the economics
of the market place are inappropriate to caring. They rely on a jaundiced
view of markets and an inadequate sense of caring.'
Instead, she argues that the internal health market is a mechanism of
ensuring that patients have choices in the way services are provided,
benefiting both people and the NHS.
'It is the proper function of government to ensure equal access to the NHS.
It does not follow, however, that the government should insist on how that
service is delivered.'
However, Mrs Bottomley makes it clear that the government's reforms do not
amount to support for a total free market in health and she is at pains to
emphasise that she has no plans to introduce one.
'We do not, and cannot, operate an entirely free market in health. That has
never been our objective. The NHS is what it says - national.'
The Labour party is accused of misrepresenting the Conservatives' health
reforms, which is why Mrs Bottomley says the health service has been the
source of such dissent between political parties.
'The difference between the parties' she says, 'is on how best a national
health service should be delivered.'
