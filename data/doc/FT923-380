FT  29 SEP 92 / Rival of Iliescu issues a warning
ROMANIA'S democratic opposition parties, shocked by the strong showing of
former communists and hardline nationalists at the weekend elections,
yesterday pledged to intensify the political struggle before presidential
run-off elections on October 11.
Mr Emil Constantinescu, presidential candidate for the 18-party Democratic
Convention (DC), who will oppose President Ion Iliescu in the run-off, said
that Romania now more than ever needed a strong president who would respect
the law, unite the country and restore Romania's tarnished image abroad.
He warned that exit polls indicated that extremist parties, such as the
Socialist Labour party and Romania Mare, the Greater Romania party, an
openly anti-Semitic and xenophobic organisation, could find a place in a
governing coalition alongside the Democratic National Salvation Front, which
supports Mr Iliescu. The DNSS, staffed largely by former communists and
ex-secret policemen, retains widespread support in working class and rural
areas and looks set to emerge as the largest party in parliament.
Official results in the parliamentary elections and the first round of
presidential voting are not expected until later this week.
But partial official results last night indicated Mr Iliescu was leading
with 46.5 per cent against 30.9 per cent for Mr Constantinescu.
Mr Ion Raciu, vice-president of the National Peasants party, the dominant
force behind the fractious DC, said yesterday that Mr Constantinescu, a
hitherto little-known academic and ex-communist party member, had faced 'an
impossible task'.
Teenage pop hysteria came to Romania yesterday as fans of American star
Michael Jackson greeted him with tears and shrieks when he flew to Bucharest
aboard a private jet for a charity concert, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
The Jackson concert has sparked more excitement among the young than
Sunday's elections.
