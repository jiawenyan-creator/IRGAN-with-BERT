Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality 
Implementation Plans; Louisiana; 
Alternative Emission Control Plan for Dow Chemical, U.S.A., 
Louisiana Division, Plaquemine, LA 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is announcing final approval of the alternative emission reduction (bubble) plan for the Dow Chemical Plaquemine
facility as a revision to the Louisiana State Implementation Plan (SIP). The bubble plan uses the emissions reduction
credit (ERC) from a process modification at the Glycol II expander unit in lieu of controlling emissions from four
volatile organic compounds (VOC) storage tanks. The bubble plan was reviewed for consistency with the final Emissions
Trading Policy Statement (ETPS) published by the EPA in the 

Federal Register

 on December 4, 1986. The ERC is determined to be valid for emissions trading.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This final rule is effective on November 3, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On October 19, 1983, the Governor of Louisiana submitted a request to revise the Louisiana SIP to include an alternative
emission reduction plan for the Dow Chemical facility located in Plaquemine, Iberville Parish. The State submittal
contains verification that adequate public notice was given and a public hearing was held for the bubble plan. The
EPA proposed to approve the bubble plan in a rulemaking document published on June 21, 1991 (56 FR 28509). Brief background
information about the bubble plan is provided in this final rulemaking notice; see the proposed rulemaking notice
for a more comprehensive discussion of relevant issues and details. 
In June 1977, a process modification instituted at the Glycol II expander unit reduced actual emissions of VOC from
a waste gas vent by 455.1 tons per year (TPY), from 595.7 to 140.6 TPY. The modification involved adding an additional
reactor to the process that reduced the amount of VOC entering and being emitted from the incinerator. The bubble plan
uses the emissions reduction from the waste gas vent to offset uncontrolled emissions from four VOC storage tanks.
Louisiana Administrative Code requires emissions from the four VOC storage tanks be controlled. Allowable emissions
from the four tanks are 0.45 TPY, and total actual emissions from the tanks are 42.33 TPY. The actual emissions from
one of the methanol tanks (8X) is 0.69 TPY greater than what was presented in the proposal (1.35 TPY as proposed versus
2.04 TPY as approved), due to an increased turnover rate reported by the Dow Chemical Company after publication of
the proposed rulemaking notice. Of the 455.1 TPY ERC generated from the waste gas vent, 41.88 TPY is utilized to offset
the noncompliance emissions from the four storage tanks and 5.7 TPY is utilized for improvement in air quality, leaving
407.5 TPY of ERC remaining. The 5.7 TPY improvement in air quality is a State requirement imposed on Dow Chemical. The
entire trade as approved is summarized in the following table.
