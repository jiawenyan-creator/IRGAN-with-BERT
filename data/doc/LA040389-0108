IN BRIEF; 
MAJERUS QUITS BALL FOR UTAH POST 
Rick Majerus has resigned as Ball State's basketball coach to take the head 
coaching job at the University of Utah, Ball State's president announced today. 
"We wanted him to stay. We made a strong counter offer, and we are disappointed 
he is leaving. But we will continue to compete successfully at the national 
level," said Ball State President John E. Worthen. 
Majerus, 41, had a 29-3 record in Ball State this season. He had two years 
remaining on his contract at the school, but Ball State Athletic Director Don 
Purvis previously had said the university would release the coach from his 
obligation. 
Majerus will succeed fired Ute basketball Coach Lynn Archibald.
