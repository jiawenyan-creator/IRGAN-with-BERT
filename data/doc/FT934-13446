FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Burger King reviews US
advertising
BURGER King, the fast-food restaurant chain, is reviewing its main US
advertising account, handled by the New York office of D'Arcy Masius Benton
&amp; Bowles since 1989.
The business, which according to industry estimates has a budget of Dollars
170m a year, is one of the world's most lucrative advertising accounts.
Burger King, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan, said it was 'seeking a
fresh approach' to a 'back-to-basics' marketing strategy, initiated by Mr
James Adamson when he was appointed chief executive last July.
DMB&amp;B's first television campaign for the group since Mr Adamson's
appointment was launched this month. It highlights prices and puts less
emphasis on quality.
The fresh approach by Burger King, which operates about 7,000 restaurants
worldwide, comes as packaged goods marketers are increasingly concerned over
the willingness of US consumers to buy lower-cost alternatives to brand-name
products.
Burger King said it would continue to stress value for money in its
advertising.
Burger King's advertising budget is Dollars 250m a year, which includes
international billings, special projects and advertising directed at
consumers from American US minority groups.
