FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Bangkok Land to develop rail link
Bangkok Land, the Thai capital's biggest property company, has been picked
by the government's Metropolitan Rapid Transit Authority to negotiate and
build an elevated mass transit system.
The MRTA's consultants, De Leuw Carther International, said Bangkok Land
offered the best scheme for building the planned 20km loop of elevated
railway at a projected cost of about Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 880m). Two other
companies, Tanayong and Thanachart Holding, are ranked second and third.
Bangkok Land's turnkey contractors will be Thai Leighton and Bouygues Thai,
associates of Australian and French groups respectively. The US-German AEG
Westinghouse group is to supply equipment. Ironically Leighton and AEG, as
the Euro Asia Consortium, bid for this contract in the 1980s when it was
known as the Skytrain project.
Skytrain's original concessionaire, Canada's Lavelin-SNC group, was fired
last year nearly two decades after the project was conceived.
Mr Anant Kanjanapas, chairman of Bangkok Land, joins the long-running game
of trying to beat the political infighting and planning inertia which has so
far prevented one metre of mass transit track being laid to relieve
Bangkok's appalling traffic.
However Mr Anant is unusually ambitious and confident: he surprised the
financial community in October by announcing a Dollars 600m convertible bond
issue in the international market to fund the MRTA project before he had
even won it.
