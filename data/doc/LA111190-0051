KENYA LUXURY CAMPING 
Getting there: We traveled to Kenya independently, although many safari tour 
operators can arrange package trips in luxury accommodations such as the ones 
we experienced. We flew to Nairobi via Amsterdam (there are no direct flights 
from the United States); it's about $2,000 round trip per person. 
Our safari arrangements were booked through Kenyan friends by Rhino Safaris: 
Box 48023, Nairobi, local telephone 28102. Total cost of our trip (excluding 
Amsterdam stopover) was approximately $8,500 for 15 days, including air fare.
