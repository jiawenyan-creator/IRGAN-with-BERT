  [Text] On Tuesday [10 May], Edouard Balladur did not rule 
out "a possible resumption of nuclear testing." 
  "France never accepted linking the suspension of nuclear 
testing to the negotiations" on a treaty which would ban testing 
forever. 
  The prime minister has thus signalled that he has a 
different 
position from that of Mitterrand. 
  The president said on Thursday that those who succeed him 
will not resume nuclear testing.
