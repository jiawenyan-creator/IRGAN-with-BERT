FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: AP Moller to take over rival's
shipping business
AP MOLLER, the Danish shipping and oil group, yesterday agreed to take over
the shipping operations of the East Asiatic Company, a long-term rival in
liner shipping and one of the oldest Danish shipping companies.
AP Moller will acquire nine large container-carrying liner vessels, which
will continue in service, said APM.
EAC suffered a group loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars 188m) in 1992, when its
equity capital was cut to DKr2.8bn, only 17.4 per cent of assets. Turnover
last year was DKr17.3bn, much of it from extensive trading operations in
eastern Asia.
The sale price was not released, but EAC said the agreement would result in
'a very considerable strengthening of EAC's cash position' and an
appreciable reduction in its debt.
The group began a programme of disposals last year in order to strengthen
its financial position, including the sale of the Plumrose food processing
operations in the UK, Germany and the US.
But the sale of the shipping operations was forced on it when negotiations
with American President Lines for a partnership in EAC's Europe-Far East
liner shipping operations fell through last week. The service was operated
jointly by EAC and the UK's Ben Line until the middle of 1992, when Ben
pulled out.
APM already operates a fleet of over 50 liner vessels and its stock of
containers is over 150,000 units. In addition to a liner service between
Europe and the Far East, EAC has operated a liner service between Australia
and the Far East and inter-Asian liner services.
Although Moller has said it will try to offer jobs to officers on board EAC
ships, EAC said that relatively few of the group's 1,300 shipping staff
could expect to be offered employment by Moller.
