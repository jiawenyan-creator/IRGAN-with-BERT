  [Excerpt] Cairo--Arab political sources in Cairo have 
revealed that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are working to foil any 
mediation to end the political crisis in Yemen. 
  The sources, which refused to be identified, told AL-SAFIR 
that a Saudi-Kuwaiti coordinated effort recently sought to abort 
the Document of Pledge and Accord even if this required 
arranging a military coup in the north that would destroy 
support for unity. 
  The sources added that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are providing 
some Yemeni parties with suspicious reports about the mediation 
efforts of Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and are accusing him of working 
for the Iraqi intelligence service and of receiving regular 
financing to exploit the differences between the Yemeni sides in 
favor of augmenting the role of Yemen's Ba'th Party. 
  The sources stressed that the hot lines between Saudi 
Arabia, 
Kuwait, and Aden are constantly busy and that financial aid sent 
to Yemen during the crisis reached $500 million. 
  The sources referred to the hasty return of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary general of the 
Socialist Party, to Aden from Washington in 1993 and to the 
subsequent eruption of differences. 
  The sources said that al-Bid was originally scheduled to 
travel to France and Jordan for treatment but actually visited 
Washington to meet with U.S. Vice President Al Gore. They added 
that the meeting between al-Bid and Gore was held in Washington 
in the absence of the Yemeni ambassador and that al-Bid returned 
directly to Aden, where he adopted the policy of seclusion. 
  The sources linked Saudi-Kuwaiti efforts to abort Yemeni 
reconciliation to Saudi Arabia's insistence on continuing joint 
meetings with Yemen on demarcating the borders. They said that 
Saudi Arabia wants to negotiate with an unstable party to obtain 
as much as possible. [passage omitted]
