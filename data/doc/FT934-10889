FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Capital House buys bring funds to near
Pounds 5bn mark
CAPITAL House Investment Management, a division of Royal Bank of Scotland,
said it had acquired Brown Shipley Unit Trust Managers, which has Pounds 70m
in assets.
Capital House has also acquired Pounds 100m of Brown Shipley's institutional
funds, bringing its total of funds under management to just under Pounds
5bn. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
The acquisitions are part of Capital House's strategy of growing through
acquisition. Earlier this year it acquired the fund management businesses of
two UK life insurance companies.
Capital House will retain three of Brown Shipley's unit trust staff,
including its two leading fund managers, Mr Christopher Bomford and Mr John
Cornes. The company said that in line with the recent trend in the unit
trust industry, it would merge some of Brown Shipley's existing unit trusts
into its own funds.
