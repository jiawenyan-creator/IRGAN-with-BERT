  [Text] Tashkent, 26 Apr -- The situation in Tajikistan and 
Afghanistan was one of the main subjects discussed during talks 
between President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan and President 
Francois Mitterrand of France, who is paying a state visit to 
Tashkent. 
  The Uzbek leader drew the French side's attention to the 
need 
to focus the efforts of the world community on earliest possible 
settlement of the crisis in this part of Central Asia. 
  "I believe that the situation in Tajikistan and Afghanistan 
is turning into one of the main problems affecting world peace," 
Francois Mitterrand said in his turn. He stressed that the 
leadership of Uzbekistan has every opportunity to "use its 
influence on the various sides" involved in the conflict, so 
that the process "enters the realm of talks."
