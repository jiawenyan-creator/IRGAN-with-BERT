  [Abstract] The quality of GaAs layers grown by the 
atomic-layer epitaxy method from a gas phase of metal-organic 
compounds at different substrate temperatures (435-600C) 
was analyzed based on measurements of Raman light scattering, 
low-temperature (4.5 K) photoluminescence, Hall coefficient and 
electroconductivity. It was determined that because of the 
presence of carbon acceptors, the examined layers exhibit hole 
conductivity. As the precipitation temperature is increased, a 
gradual improvement is observed of the layers' quality, 
accompanied by a lower concentration of holes and their 
increased mobility. The high degree of purity and the film 
quality, grown at T=600C, is confirmed by the results of 
the analysis of the photoluminescence exiton band spectrum. A 
comparison was also made of the layers' characteristic obtained 
with GaAs and Ge substrates in a single technological process. 
It was demonstrated that the properties of the GaAs/Ge layers 
significantly differ from the properties of the homo-epitaxial 
layers. Figures 5, references 11: 1 Russian, 10 Western
