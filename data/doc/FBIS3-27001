  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 17 (CNA) -- Two-way trade between 
Taiwan and Europe totaled US$26.44 billion in 1993, up 0.1 
percent from the previous year, the Taipei-based Euro-Asia Trade 
Organization (EATO) reported Thursday. 
  Taiwan's exports to Europe fell 7.5 percent to US$12.88 
billion, while imports grew 8.7 percent to US$13.56 billion, 
thereby resulting in a deficit of US$680 million for Taiwan. 
  This is the first time in two decades that Taiwan has 
registered a trade imbalance with Europe. 
  Officials said that economic sluggishness in European 
countries last year adversely affected Taiwan's trade promotion 
there. Increasing purchases by Taiwan companies were also to 
blame for the deficit, they added. 
  Europe, however, remained one of Taiwan's major trading 
partners, with the island's shipments to Europe in 1993 
accounting for 15.2 percent of Taiwan's aggregate exports and 
European imports making up for 17.6 percent of the total. 
  EATO statistics show that trade with Germany, Britain, 
Holland, France, and Italy made up 70.4 percent of Taiwan's 
total trade with Europe. 
  Taiwan's trade with Germany rose 2.7 percent to US$7.72 
billion last year, but trade with Britain fell 5.7 percent to 
US$3.34 billion. 
  The officials pointed to closer trade ties between Taiwan 
and 
Europe, noting that cooperation between the two sides will 
certainly be strengthened as Taiwan enterprises have been 
seeking to enter into strategic business alliances with their 
European counterparts. 
  In 1993, strategic alliances with Europe were signed with 
Philips Co. of Holland and ABB of Sweden.
