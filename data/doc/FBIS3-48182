<F P=106> [Report by Ho Yong-pom from Taegu from the "News Behind the </F>
News" column] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In a meeting with reporters in 
Taegu, Democratic Party's [DP] Executive Chairman Yi Ki-taek 
said: "No one can restrain my will to visit North Korea." He 
thus drove a wedge in the criticism being made by the people 
within the DP. When reporters commented that there is a 
possibility that his visit to the North may be used by North 
Korea, he said: "From my political statesmanship point of view, 
I firmly believe that by no means will I be embroiled in North 
Korea's reunification front strategy. I believe that anyone, 
including government officials, can work to dissolve the current 
stalemate existing between the South and North." Executive 
Chairman Yi, who has been trying to visit China, postponed his 
visit because no substantial results were achieved by his 
special envoy who visited China recently.
