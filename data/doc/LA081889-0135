BRIEFLY 
Famous Amos Moves Headquarters: Famous Amos Chocolate Chip Cookie Corp. has 
moved a "lean corporate staff" of fewer than 20 employees to San Francisco from 
Torrance, according to Keith R. Lively, chief operating officer. Famous Amos, a 
pioneer in the premium cookie business, will maintain a two-person regional 
office in Southern California and will continue to produce its cookies in the 
area on a contract basis. Last year, Famous Amos was bought by the Shansby 
Group, a San Francisco-based buyout fund. Lively said nearly all the corporate 
officers were from the San Francisco area and "wanted to return."
