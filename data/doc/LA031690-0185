SHORT TAKES; 
HERZOG TO DIRECT MOZART OPERA 
West German film director Werner Herzog's career is hitting a different note: 
He's planning to direct a new production of Mozart's "The Magic Flute" for the 
Metropolitan Opera. 
Herzog's version of "Die Zauberflote" is to open Jan. 10, Met officials said. 
It is to be conducted by James Levine and features Kathleen Battle as Pamina, 
Francisco Araiza as Tamino, Kurt Moll as Sarastro, Luciana Serra as the Queen 
of the Night and Manfred Hemm as Papageno. 
"Die Zauberflote" is one of four Mozart operas the Met is presenting in its 
1990-91 season as part of the Lincoln Center's Mozart Bicentennial series, 
marking the 200th anniversary of the composer's death. The Met plans to perform 
seven Mozart operas in 1991.
