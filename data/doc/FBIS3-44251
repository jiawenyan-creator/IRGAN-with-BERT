  [Text] Windhoek Jan 27 SAPA--African National Congress 
[ANC] Deputy President Walter Sisulu arrived in Windhoek on 
Thursday [27 January] to launch an ANC solidarity and fund 
raising campaign organised by Namibia's ruling SWAPO [South-West 
African People's Organization] party. 
  Accompanied by ANC Election Commission Chairman Popo Molefe 
and other senior officials, Mr Sisulu is scheduled to address a 
rally with Namibian President Sam Nujoma on Thursday night. He 
returns to South Africa on Saturday, leaving the other officials 
to address rallies and meetings across Namibia next week. 
  SWAPO, which has been at pains to stress the campaign is 
organised by the party and not the government, said it was 
supporting the ANC as the only way towards regional peace and 
stability. 
  SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said Namibian 
independence rested on peace in South Africa, and that this 
could only be attained under an ANC government. He appealed to 
all South Africans in Namibia to register and vote in the April 
elections.
