  [Text] Ciego de Avila farmers who have just received a 
message of praise from Commander in Chief Fidel Castro for the 
efforts being made in the current harvest have expressed their 
commitment to meet the sugar production plan despite current 
difficulties. 
  During a visit by the commander in chief's Coordination and 
Support Staff, headed by Elida Valle, the fulfillment of the 
plan in several complexes, as well as the high spirit of 
production of the workers, was noted. Measures being implemented 
to stabilize the grinding were also noted, and it was reported 
that equipment from other provinces will arrive shortly to 
bolster the harvest effort in Ciego de Avila Province.
