FT  11 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cut down on PC power
consumption
Computers consume more than 5 per cent of all industrial energy. Now, Korean
electronics company Samsung has developed a range of screens that, the
company says, reduce energy use by 70 per cent.
The screens, the most power-hungry element of the PC, include a power
management system operating at four levels: on, standby, suspend and off.
When the machine is not used it moves into standby mode and the screen is
switched off, reducing power consumption by up to 30 per cent. If unused for
longer, the machine moves into suspend mode, when the main components also
switch off, reducing power consumption by 85 per cent. This could prove
particularly effective with people who forget to switch their PCs off
overnight. Samsung: Korea, 822 727 7114; UK, 081 974 2782.
