FT  19 APR 93 / Appeal for talks on Timex dispute
The AEEU engineering union last night appealed for talks to settle the
bitter Timex dispute, and warned the row could scare potential foreign
investors away from Scotland.
The union issued its plea on the eve of the Scottish TUC congress in
Glasgow, where the dispute, now in its third month, is to be debated on
Tuesday.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEEU national executive member for Scotland, said the union
was willing to negotiate a settlement on the sole precondition that the
sacked workers must be reinstated.
