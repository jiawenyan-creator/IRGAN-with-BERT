FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Maunders rises 62% as margins improve
Modestly higher house selling prices and reduced incentives for purchasers
helped John Maunders, the Manchester-based housebuilder, report a 62 per
cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits.
The pre-tax figure for the year to June 30 jumped to Pounds 6.21m (Pounds
3.84m) on turnover ahead 11 per cent to Pounds 66.1m (Pounds 59.8m).
Operating profits increased to Pounds 6.92m (Pounds 5.3m) while interest
costs were halved at Pounds 740,000 (Pounds 1.54m).
Mr John Maunders, chairman, said: 'While, in general, selling prices did not
substantially increase, we were able to reduce various forms of purchaser
inducements, which coupled with modest price increases contributed to
healthier margins and helped offset material and labour cost increases.'
The group, which sold 949 houses, up from 904 the previous year, said
average selling prices rose from Pounds 66,000 to Pounds 69,000, due mainly
to a more expensive mix.
The landbank stood at 2,100 plots at the year-end, with a further 650 plots
under contract, and had a book value of Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 26.6m).
However, Mr Maunders noted that 'a worrying feature of the return to normal
trading has been the sharp escalation in land prices since the beginning of
the year'.
Despite press reports of sluggish house sales, Mr Maunders expected the
group's targets to be met to the end of December, and that half-year trading
results would be satisfactory.
Earnings per share increased to 16.72p (10.3p) and a 3.05p final dividend is
recommended, making a total of 5.5p (5.15p) for the year, a 6.8 per cent
increase.
At the end of June borrowings stood at Pounds 2m, representing gearing of 7
per cent.
The shares closed 2p higher at 222p.
Sir Eric Pountain, who stepped down as non-executive chairman of Tarmac in
March, has joined the Maunders board as a non-executive director.
