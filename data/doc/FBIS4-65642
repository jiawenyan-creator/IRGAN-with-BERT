  [Text] Greece has not been accused of violating the embargo 
on Serbia and Montenegro, according to the Foreign Ministry. 
While the U.S. House of Representatives is safeguarding the 
7:10 ratio in military aid to Greece and Turkey, according to a 
proposal, it must first be established that the embargo is not 
being violated. 
  The Greek Government, the Foreign Ministry says, has taken 
all the necessary measures to maintain the sanctions against 
Serbia and Montenegro. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos noted that Greece 
and Serbia have no joint territorial border. He reiterated that 
Greece is not violating the embargo against Serbia and 
Montenegro and noted that the 7:10 ratio in U.S. aid to Greece 
and Turkey continues.
