Background 



Under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 36003619), the Department is authorized to investigate complaints alleging
discrimination in housing. (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act
of 1988, is cited as the ``Fair Housing Act.'') Section 810(f) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Department to refer
complaints to State and local agencies that have ``substantially equivalent'' fair housing standards, as determined
and certified by the Department. 

Part 115 of the Department's regulations (24 CFR part 115) contains the certification standards and the procedures
for certifying State and local fair housing laws that provide substantive rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory
housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing Act.
