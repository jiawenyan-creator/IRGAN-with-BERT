SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

There will be a total of 12 province advisory committees in northern California, Oregon and Washington working with
federal agencies to implement the President's Forest Plan on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest. ``These advisory
committees will help us work with the people as we move forward with ecosystem management,'' said Pacific Northwest
Regional Forester John Lowe who is coordinating the effort for national forests in northern California, Oregon and
Washington. ``These committees will supplement our regular public involvement efforts to help us make decisions
that serve people and care for the land. We're eager to begin the dialogue.''


Each advisory committee will provide advice to the respective Province Interagency Executive Committee (PIEC)
regarding implementation of a comprehensive ecosystem management strategy for federal lands within the province.
While boundaries of the provinces include whole river drainages for broad ecosystem planning, the purpose of the
advisory committees is to assist in implementing the President's Forest Plan, which is limited to federal lands within
the range of the northern spotted owl. Therefore, preference for positions on the committees will likely be to individuals,
agencies and groups most directly associated with those federal lands involved with the northern spotted owl. Map
for geographic boundaries of each province included in nomination packet information.
Each advisory committee will consist of no more than 29 members from the following entities.



State, local and tribal governments.
Public interest groups: to include representatives of environmental interests; different sectors of the forest
products industry; and the recreation and tourism sectors.



The committees may also include representatives of the following interests: fish, wildlife, forestry conservation
organizations, special forest products, mining, grazing, and commercial fishing or charter fishing boat industry.
All advisory committee meetings will be open to the public. Interested citizens may request time on the agenda to address
the committee. All papers and documents used by the committee, including meeting minutes, will be available to the
public.
Applicants must be United States citizens, at least 18 years old, and will be recommended for appointment based on
their personal knowledge of local and regional resource issues, and understanding of public land uses and activities;
willingness to work toward mutually beneficial solutions to complex issues; respect and credibility in local communities;
and commitment to attending advisory committee meetings held for the province.
Advisory committee members must be willing to travel to meetings held throughout the provinces. Members will serve
without pay, but reimbursement of travel and per diem is allowed for attendance at meetings called by the Chairperson
of the advisory committee.
Regional Forester John Lowe will consult with other agency leaders to decide who will be on the 12 province advisory
committees. The first meetings of the advisory committees will be held early in 1995 and the frequency thereafter
will be determined by each committee.
Advisory committee recommendations are not legally binding and will not supersede the legally established decision
authority granted to the federal agencies involved.
