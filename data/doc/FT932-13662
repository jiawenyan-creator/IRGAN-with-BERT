FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: BTR sells its 17.2% stake in Meggitt
BTR, the industrial holding company, yesterday severed a six-year
relationship with Meggitt, the acquisitive engineering company, by selling
its 17.2 per cent stake.
The shares were placed at 98p by Smith New Court, Meggitt's brokers, at a
tight 2 1/2 p discount to the level at which the shares closed on Tuesday
night. Meggitt's share price rose  1/2 p to close at 101p yesterday.
BTR has held the stake since it supported Meggitt's 1986 bid for Bestobell,
the electronics and mechanical component company. BTR had a 29 per cent
stake in Bestobell following its failed bid the previous year.
Last week Meggitt reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds
23m but earnings per share fell. Mr Ken Coates, Meggitt's chairman, said at
the time of the results that the company would be entering a period of
relatively quiet corporate activity.
While BTR has held its stake, Meggitt's sales have grown from Pounds 28m to
Pounds 327m but in the past five years earnings have barely increased. Mr
Coates said BTR had never commented on this.
'Right up to this week it has been a very good relationship with BTR,' Mr
Coates said.
Since a putative effort to take over USH in 1991, the company has also
suffered, and is now trading at a significant discount to its sector.
Mr Coates, said the company had grown into an international engineering
group and had considerable opportunities for further growth.
BTR's stake was never seen as hostile and the two were always likely to part
company, one analyst said.
Sir Norman Ireland, chairman elect at BTR, is a non-executive director on
the Meggitt board.
Sir Owen Green, BTR chairman, said Meggitt had become 'an engineering group
of international dimensions with strong management and a clear sense of
direction'.
