 

After reviewing all available scientific and commercial information on the spikedace and loach minnow and their
status and after consideration of other listing actions and their priorities, the Service finds that the reclassification
of spikedace and loach minnow to endangered is warranted, but is precluded by work on pending listing actions of higher
priority on which expeditious progress is being made.
