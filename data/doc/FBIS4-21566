  [Text] Israel is holding secret contacts with North Korea 
in a bid to prevent it from supplying Iran with long-range 
missiles. These contacts are being held against the wishes of 
the United States and contrary to Israel's promise to coordinate 
its relations with North Korea with the United States. Our 
political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  Several weeks ago, Israeli diplomats met with senior North 
Korean representatives in Beijing in the framework of secret 
contacts between the two countries. The contacts are designed 
to secure an agreement that would prevent North Korea from 
supplying Iran with Nodong missiles. These missiles, which have 
a range of 1,000 km, can carry chemical and nuclear warheads. 
In exchange, Israel is proposing to help raise approximately $1 
billion among American Jewish businessmen for civilian projects 
in North Korea. 
  The contacts between the two countries are mainly 
coordinated 
by the Israeli Embassy in Beijing. The secret talks are being 
held against the wishes of the United States, which is currently 
conducting a campaign against North Korea in view of the 
latter's refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  The Israeli-North Korean connection started approximately 
two 
years ago. One of the main mediators is an American Jewish 
businessman whose identity is being kept secret for fear that 
the U.S. authorities will harass him. Following preliminary 
contacts, Eytan Bentzur, deputy director general of the Foreign 
Ministry, left for North Korea among a group of geologists. 
Once there, he held secret meetings with North Korean 
officials. Bentzur prepared a visit by Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres to North Korea, but at that point the United States 
intervened. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with 
Peres in Vienna and protested Israel's contacts with North 
Korea. Peres promised that all future contacts would be 
coordinated with the United States. 
  A senior political source in Jerusalem said the present 
contacts between Israel and North Korea are not necessarily 
being coordinated with the United States. We are dealing here 
with an Israeli security interest, and if we do not take care of 
it, nobody else will do it for us, the source claims.
