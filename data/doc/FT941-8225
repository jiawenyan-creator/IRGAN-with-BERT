FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Granada rejects LWT argument in bid battle
Granada yesterday dismissed LWT's defence against its hostile Pounds 800m
bid as 'strong on presentation but weak on content'.
In a final letter to LWT shareholders, Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman of
Granada, rejects LWT's argument that the offer undervalues the company
compared with the agreed takeovers of Central Independent Television and
Anglia.
Mr Bernstein says that Granada's offer represents 27.6 times LWT's estimated
1993 earnings, while the recommended offer from Carlton for Central
represented 25.1 times brokers' estimates for the target's 1993 earnings.
As for the price paid by MAI for Anglia, Mr Bernstein said that this was
justified because of Anglia's particularly valuable investments and because
it has much higher operational gearing than LWT.
He added that 'moreover, in 1993 Anglia's share of net advertising revenue
continued to increase, whereas LWT's share fell compared with 1992.'
Granada says that LWT bases much of its argument on one year's estimated
profits and Mr Bernstein warns LWT shareholders: 'You should question how
sustainable the rate of increase shown by LWT in its 1993 profits will prove
to be.'
The offer closes this Friday.
