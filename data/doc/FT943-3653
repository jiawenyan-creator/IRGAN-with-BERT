FT  13 SEP 94 / Observer: Dotty Lotty
The lure of the DM42m jackpot, the largest in the 40-year history of the
German lottery, has elicited some pretty strange behaviour. Take the
33-year-old man from Erlangen who presented his bank with a lottery slip
with the six numbers correctly crossed and a forged letter from the lottery
organisation confirming he had won (a positively modest) DM2m. The bank
extended a DM30,000 loan. By the time it sniffed a swindle and caught the
man he had spent DM29,000 on trips to Paris, London and Leipzig.
