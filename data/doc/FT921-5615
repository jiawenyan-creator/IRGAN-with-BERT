FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC ministers renew bid for common Gatt
stance
EUROPEAN Community agriculture and trade ministers yesterday renewed their
attempt to arrive at a common stance on the Uruguay Round world trade
negotiations, following failure of EC and US negotiators to make significant
headway on their differences over farm subsidy cuts last Friday.
The ministers were still in a closed meeting last night, and believed to be
still divided on what priority to give the numerous differences the EC has
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) formula for
concluding the Round.
The EC is split into two main camps. The UK, France, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Belgium wanted to renegotiate the Gatt prescription that the
volume of subsidised farm exports be reduced by 24 per cent over the next
six years, in addition to a 36 per cent cut in export subsidies.
The others, a slight majority going into yesterday's meeting, emphasise
instead that compensation to farmers for subsidy cuts under both the Round
and EC farm reform should be included in the 'green box', for subsidies
which do not distort production and trade.
EC negotiators last Friday made some progress with the US on the 'green box'
issue, with the Americans seeking further clarification on the effect direct
compensation payments would have on production.
But the question of restraining export volumes 'is still untouched,' a
Commission official said.
The US is said by some officials to be seeking to take the matter to the
Group of Seven industrialised nations for resolution, and the US delegation
that was here last Friday is understood to have continued to Bonn.
Germany is the current president of the G7, and has openly mooted a special
summit to conclude the Uruguay Round.
