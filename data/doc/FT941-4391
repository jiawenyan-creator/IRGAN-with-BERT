FT  11 MAR 94 / People: Non-executive directors
Francis Mackay, chief executive of the health care and catering company
Compass Group, once remarked that a typical non-executive director takes up
the job 'to create maximum embarrassment with the least amount of effort'.
The grain of truth concealed in that quip is unlikely to be much felt with
his latest recruit, John Thomson (left), 65. Thomson's appointment as
chairman follows the retirement of Ingram Lenton on grounds of ill-health,
in January. Lenton had been with Compass since 1987.
Thomson's cv demonstrates a breadth of financial and corporate experience.
Having taken degrees in classics and law, he started his professional career
as a banker with Lazard Brothers, moving on to Manufacturers Hanover.
From thence he joined the Brooke Bond group, spending 18 years with a
company which in the UK is probably most famous for a particular brand of a
caterer's essential ingredient - tea. He became deputy chief executive
there.
Thomson's other corporate interests have included a directorship with the
brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle and, in June 1985, the chairmanship of the
insurance group London and Manchester. He is now a director of Thames Water
and also chairman of food flavourings manufacturer, Borthwicks.
