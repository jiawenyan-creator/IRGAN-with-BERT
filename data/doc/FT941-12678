FT  28 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
The wool market price rise gathered pace this week. Finer Merinos in
Australia and South Africa were again in the lead, but all the other wools
were tending dearer. At least as important in the processing sectors was an
improvement in demand, presumably as buyers came to the conclusion that
prices were likely to move higher. Resistance to the rise remains strong,
and prices for tops and yarn do not reflect replacement costs, but at least
movement is in the right direction. In the British wool sector prices for
merchanted wool and tops were dearer as a result of further buying from
manufacturing sectors in the domestic market, in anticipation of enhanced
competition for wool at next week's British wool auction. The official
market indicator closed at 522 cents a kg, in Australia yesterday, a new
peak for the season.
