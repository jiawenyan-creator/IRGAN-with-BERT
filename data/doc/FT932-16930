FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: German deal as Whatman rises 9%
WHATMAN yesterday reported a 9 per cent increase in profits for 1992 and
announced it would take control of a German company specialising in
molecular biology for up to DM9.6m (Pounds 4.06m).
The specialist paper and filtration equipment maker is buying 60 per cent of
Biometra Biomedizinische Analytik and has an option to increase its stake to
80 per cent after three years.
It will pay for the stake through the issue of about 750,000 new shares.
Whatman's pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 10m (Pounds 9.21m) in the year
to December 31, helped by strong sales growth. At the interim stage, profits
were 3 per cent ahead at Pounds 4.5m.
Turnover increased 26 per cent to Pounds 62.6m, helped by currency factors.
Excluding these factors, the company said margins remained steady. Trading
profits increased 5 per cent to Pounds 10.1m.
Earnings increased 9 per cent to 29.08p (26.66p). The company said it would
increase its dividend in line with earnings, and proposed a final dividend
of 6.4p to make a total of 9.5p (8.7p).
