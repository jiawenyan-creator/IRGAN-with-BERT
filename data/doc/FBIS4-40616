  [Text] Berlin June 18 TASS -- "There should be one and not 
101 variants of privatization of former state enterprises," 
believes Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin currently here as part of his 
official visit to Germany. 
  The Duma delegation has visited the Berlin Kvo cable plant 
that belongs to British investors and supplies half of its 
products to Russia. The guests were especially interested in 
the plant's transition to the market. The plant heads said that 
the main thing is to adopt marketing as a new production 
philosophy. 
  Rybkin told ITAR-TASS that the visit to the plant and a 
meeting with Berlin Burgomaster Eberhard Diepgen informed the 
deputies about privatization aspects. The deputies will take 
this information into account. 
  "Russia has some 1,500 plants which may become bankrupt. We 
need a comprehensive approach to this problem and I agree with 
the stand of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and experienced 
businessmen," said Rybkin. 
  The Duma speaker laid a wreath to the memorial on Unter Der 
Linden and the monument to Soviet soldiers in the Berlin borough 
of Tiergarten.
