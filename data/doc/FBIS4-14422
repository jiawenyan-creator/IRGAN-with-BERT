  [Text] The leasing agreement on the Baykonur space center 
that Moscow and Alma-Ata [Almaty] recently signed may be 
ratified in the next four weeks and take effect thereafter, a 
senior official of the Russian Space Agency [RSA] told Interfax. 
  He said the deal would enable Russia to go ahead with its 
space programs for the next 20 years. It will also be able to 
comply with its obligations to maintain and develop the facility. 
  More importantly, he said, the two sides had agreed that the 
facility should include all of its infrastructures, the adjacent 
town of Leninsk and related property. The official said that 
General Aleksey Shumilin would remain in charge of the space 
center. 
  On Russia's payment of an annual $115 Mn to Kazakhstan, he 
said this would be done in the form of compensation as part of 
account settling between Moscow and Alma-Ata. The deal brings 
an end to the dispute over the future of a launch pad for Zenit 
boosters. Earlier, Ukraine and Kazakhstan were planning to sign 
a separate deal because of Kiev's claim to the facility. 
  However, Moscow challenges this, saying the Zenit booster is 
80 percent Russian contribution, the RSA official said. All the 
same, he said, it will make no sense to turn down cooperation 
with Ukraine in the development of that environmentally safe and 
advanced booster. 
  "We will continue to work together with Ukraine as before, 
he 
said, but Russia is not going to cede the booster to Kiev." 
  "Russia will cooperate with Ukraine and other CIS states 
within the framework of the CIS space program," he said.
