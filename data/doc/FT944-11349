FT  07 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Hyatt-Internet
Hyatt Hotels is to offer guests the chance to book rooms in its North
American properties through the Internet, the worldwide computer network,
writes Michael Skapinker. Personal computer users can already request
details of Hyatt rooms, restaurants and leisure facilities over the
Internet, and view colour photographs of the hotels. By the end of next
month they will be able to book rooms at 103 Hyatt hotels and resorts in the
US and Canada. Hyatt plans to extend the facility to travel agents. Thisco,
the company which is setting up Internet booking for Hyatt, said it plans to
add other hotel companies to the network eventually.
