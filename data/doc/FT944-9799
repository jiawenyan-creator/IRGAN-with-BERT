FT  14 NOV 94 / Company News this Week: Anxious wait to read the runes on
rent rises - UK Property
The London stock market will be anxious for signals that rents are rising
and occupiers are taking additional space when Land Securities and Great
Portland Estates, which together make up almost one-third of the quoted
property sector, report interim results next this week.
Neither company revalues its property portfolio at the half-year stage, but
for property values to increase in the long term it is necessary for rents
to rise.
Unless investors see signs of stronger demand for business space, property
shares will remain in the doldrums.
The sector has under-performed
the wider equity market by 15 per
cent since its peak in December last year.
As the UK's largest quoted property company, Land Securities' figures on
Thursday will be especially important for sentiment.
In the first half of last year the company reported rental income of Pounds
192m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 118.9m, including a contribution from
sales of investment property.
Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 118m this time
around.
Great Portland, which cut its dividend in June for the first time in its
35-year history, is expected to show a marked improvement over last year's
Pounds 40m rental income when it announces figures on Tuesday.
In 1993, Great Portland raised Pounds 95m through a rights issue and has
since made a string of acquisitions. Last week it announced the purchase of
seven freehold properties located in Cardiff and Plymouth from a private
company for Pounds 18.9m.
Analysts expect pre-tax profit of around Pounds 17.6m, against Pounds 16m in
the first half of last year.
Both Great Portland and Land Securities are expected to increase interim
dividends by up to 10 per cent.
