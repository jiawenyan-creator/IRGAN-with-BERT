FT  11 MAY 91 / International Company News: Pirelli profit fall reflects
troubles in tyre industry
PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, suffered a sharp drop in net
profits to L153bn (Dollars 120.18m) last year from L320bn in 1989,
reflecting the difficulties facing the world tyre industry.
Although the group hived off its tyre activities into a separately-quoted
company, Pirelli Tyre Holding (PTH) in 1989, its earnings have been hit by
last month's decision by PTH not to pay a dividend for 1990.
Last year, PTH, which is registered in Holland, paid shareholders a dividend
of Fl 2 a share on its 1989 earn-ings.
As a result of the shortfall, the Pirelli group is cutting its own dividend
by a third to L70 and L90 for ordinary and savings shares respectively from
L110 and L130 the previous year. The dividend cut, which has been widely
expected, is less than some analysts had feared.
Group turnover last year slipped by 2 per cent to L10,130bn from L10,342bn,
largely as a result of exchange rate factors. The company pointed out that
sales in volume terms remained unchanged.
Confirming that its non-tyre activities had performed broadly in line with
1989, Pirelli's earnings at parent company level actually rose marginally to
L123.1bn from L119.6bn in 1989.
Results this year had already been affected by increasingly difficult
economic circumstances, particularly in the tyres sector. The company said
that the present conditions would, in general, continue during 1991, with a
possible improvement in the second half.
