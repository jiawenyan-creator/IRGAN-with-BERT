  [Text] South African business leaders are more optimistic 
about South Africa's economic future this year than last year. 
However, almost half of the executive officers of the top 100 
industrial companies expected the political situation in the 
country to deteriorate. The survey conducted by Unisa's 
[University of South Africa] Bureau for Market Research showed 
that business leaders were optimistic that unemployment would 
not rise this year, but would stabilize. They expected the 
economy to grow by just more than one percent this year.
