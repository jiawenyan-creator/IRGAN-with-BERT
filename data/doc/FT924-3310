FT  08 DEC 92 / Move to save talks on Heathrow BR link
MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, is to meet British Rail and BAA, the
airports group, on Thursday in a last-ditch attempt to rescue the Pounds
300m Heathrow Express project.
Plans for the 16-mile rail link between Heathrow airport and central London
are on the brink of collapse amid a bitter dispute between British Rail and
BAA over the funding of the scheme.
If Mr MacGregor cannot persuade the two sides to reach an agreement in the
next few weeks, the project is likely to get caught up in the government's
plans for the privatisation of British Rail and may be postponed
indefinitely.
The Heathrow Express, intended to speed passengers between central London
and Heathrow in 16 minutes, is being developed jointly by BAA and British
Rail.
The plan is for BR to carry trains on its existing tracks for three quarters
of the journey. A private-sector consortium headed by BAA would build and
operate a spur taking the trains from BR's tracks to the airport.
BAA yesterday maintained that British Rail was undermining the commercial
viability of the project by demanding too high a price for the use of its
tracks.
'The bottom line is that if the operating costs are too high, then it simply
won't be possible to get third parties involved in putting their money into
the railway,' BAA said.
British Rail said the sum it was asking - about Pounds 6m a year -
represented only 11 per cent to 12 per cent of forecast revenues, whereas
other rail users typically faced track costs equivalent to 50 per cent of
revenues.
If BAA was serious about proceeding with the project, British Rail said, it
would have to make a contribution to the operating costs from its own
resources.
The outlay would easily be recouped by increased profits at Heathrow,
British Rail suggested.
