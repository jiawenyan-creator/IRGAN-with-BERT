  [Text] Chairman of the All-Russia Union "Renewal" Aleksandr 
Vladislavlev believes that in principle Yegor Gaydar made the 
right choice. He noted, however, that Gaydar had explained his 
move by "wrong reasons." He told Interfax that Gaydar's real 
problem was disagreements with the people, not with the Cabinet 
members. 
  "The people had their say during the election and the 
president heeded the people's voice," said Vladislavlev. As the 
only guarantor of social stability and further reforms, the 
president must propose a more reasonable and acceptable rate of 
reforms," he said. 
  The withdrawal of an "architect who built the future of the 
country on the sand of naive beliefs will make it possible to 
put the reforms on a more stable footing," he continued. He is 
also convinced that the president and the prime minister will 
carry out the reforms in the interests of the state and the 
people. 
  Vladislavlev favors the idea of forming up a new team of 
realistic-minded reformers capable of leading the country out of 
the crisis.
