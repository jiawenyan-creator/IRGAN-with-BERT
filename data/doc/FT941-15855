FT  13 JAN 94 / Liability hampers coal sell-off
Prospective purchasers of coal mines are warning the government that
privatisation of the industry is being severely hampered by requirements
that the new owners of mines must take on historic liabilities for
subsidence.
The liabilities could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds. In 1992-93
alone British Coal paid Pounds 46m for subsidence damage.
Potential purchasers say that past liabilities may outweigh the likely
business benefits of mining coal in some of the five areas for sale.
The liabilities issue is adding to the problems of a difficult
privatisation, with large companies such as Hanson and RTZ showing scant
interest, and smaller companies that are considering bids warning that there
are limits to what they can offer for a business with an uncertain future.
Potential buyers are pushing for a redrafting of the coal industry bill. It
is likely to get a second reading soon in readiness for royal assent in
July.
Prospective purchasers argue that the liabilities should be taken on by the
Coal Authority which will be established to license pits and supervise the
industry.
The coal industry bill introduces the concept of an area of responsibility
through which the 'responsible' party will be either the holder of the
licence to mine if it occurs in his or her area of responsibility or, in all
other cases, the Coal Authority. Prospective buyers are concerned about the
definition of the word 'area'.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that requiring coal
operators to assume responsibility for all subsidence liabilities would
simplify the process for people claiming for damages against subsidence.
