  [Text] The Plateau State Government has imposed a 
dusk-to-dawn curfew in Jos metropolis. The curfew which comes 
into immediate effect begins from 7:00 in the evening to 6:00 in 
the morning. In a broadcast to the people of the state this 
evening, the state administrator, Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed 
Mana, said the order is to forestall the acts of vandalism and 
lawlessness by some misguided elements over the composition of 
the caretaker committee of Jos north local government area. The 
administrator expressed surprise at the development because the 
state government had publicly stated that the matter is being 
looked into by the appropriate quarters. He assured all 
law-abiding citizens in the state of their safety. A section of 
the Jos main market was set ablaze during the demonstration.
