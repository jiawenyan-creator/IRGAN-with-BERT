YOUR COINS: TREASURE IN DRAPES 
Question: Although I am not an avid coin collector, an item in one of your 
articles last year regarding an 1852 Canadian penny caught my eye. Also the 
statement you made a long time ago: "They are out there somewhere." They sure 
are. 
My wife and I dropped in on a garage sale. She liked some old drapes and we 
bought them, but they were too long, so she cut off the bottom. I was curious 
to find out what was in each corner to make them hang straight. This is what I 
found: 
Two penny tokens from the Bank of Upper Canada dated 1852, two others dated 
1857 and 1837, a George III Hibernia 1805 and one dated 1777 (I believe), a 
token dated 1878, and a penny bank token dated 1831 with the obverse in French 
and inscribed Evins and Bolton Montreal. 
So you are correct: They are out there. -- E.C.W. 
Answer: I hope your find doesn't inspire others to slash their drapes in hopes 
of discovering some treasures. But it is an example of what I meant when I 
wrote that article. Generally, most coins are either in the hands of 
collectors, dealers or museums. But occasionally, interesting pieces will turn 
up in the most unlikely places. 
Archeologists still unearth buried vessels from ancient days filled with coins; 
treasure hunters still find trunks of silver and gold at the bottom of the 
ocean, and, as you discovered, coins may even be found sewn into drapes. I 
don't recommend garage sales as the best place to purchase coins; you'll still 
do better getting them directly from the Mint, a dealer or at a coin show or 
auction. But as I've said before, one of the joys of collecting is the hunt. 
I don't know what the drapes cost, but your coins and tokens are each probably 
in the $5 to $25 range. I'd have them checked out, especially the George III 
Hibernia and the one with the inscription.
