FT  16 AUG 94 / Industry output shows rise
Industrial output in Japan grew in June compared with a year earlier, for
the first time in 33 months, according to revised figures from the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry yesterday.
It said production was up 0.6 per cent, compared with a fall of 1.8 per cent
in May and an initial June estimate, released late last month, which showed
neither growth nor decline.
The upward revision is further evidence that a cautious revival may be in
process after the country's longest post-war recession. Output was up by a
seasonally adjusted 2.7 per cent compared with May. Miti had previously put
that figure at 2 per cent.
Officials warned that July data could show a fall both on a month-on-month
and year-on-year basis. Drought is disrupting water supplies to high-volume
users such as the chemicals industry, and overall inventory adjustments have
not ended.
Of individual sectors, machinery lagged, with shipments down and stocks up.
Many consumer industries are benefiting from the hot weather, and Miti
singled out demand for sake as a factor in the strong June performance.
Shipments of all products rose an unadjusted 2 per cent from June 1993, the
first year-on-year rise in 15 months.
