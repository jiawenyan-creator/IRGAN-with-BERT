 

After OSHA adopted the ANSI pulpwood logging standard, 
trade associations with interests in the logging of other 
forest products, such as sawlogs and veneer bolts, joined 
with ANSI to revise the pulpwood logging standard to include 
all logging operations within the United States. The 
expanded ANSI standard was approved May 19, 1977 (ANSI 03.1
1978, Safety Requirements for Logging) (hereafter ``1978 ANSI 
logging standard'') (Ex. 214). That standard adopted most of 
the safety practices contained in the earlier standard, 
applying them to all logging operations throughout the 
nation.

The 1978 ANSI logging standard, however, was withdrawn 
by ANSI in 1984 because no final action was taken to revise 
or reaffirm it. Since ANSI procedures require that action 
be taken to reaffirm, revise, or withdraw a standard no 
later than five years after the date of its publication, the 
1978 ANSI logging standard was withdrawn by default. 
Currently there is no national consensus standard covering 
logging operations.

In July 1976, the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH), published a criteria document, 
Recommendations For An Occupational Standard For Logging 
From Felling To First Haul that was applicable to all 
logging operations (Ex. 43). The NIOSH document addressed 
the hazards and safe work practices involved in felling, 
bucking, limbing, yarding and loading operations.

The NIOSH criteria document differed from OSHA's 
pulpwood logging standard in several ways: 

(a) The criteria document included all logging 
operations such as those relating to sawlogs, veneer bolts, 
poles and pilings rather than being limited only to pulpwood 
operations; 

(b) It included training requirements for employees; 

(c) It did not include provisions dealing with 
equipment protective devices, personnel transport, 
off-highway truck transport, chipping operations, or the 
construction and maintenance of roads, trails, and bridges; 
and 

(d) It recommended pre-placement and periodic medical 
examinations.

This final standard for logging operations, as did 
OSHA's proposed rule, adopts many of the recommendations of 
the NIOSH criteria document, including expansion of coverage 
to all logging operations, emphasis on safe work practices 
and training, and elimination of provisions not unique to 
logging operations, such as that involving construction of 
roads and bridges.

Six states have promulgated standards covering logging 
operations under the OSH Act State plan procedure set forth 
in section 18 of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 667) and in OSHA 
regulations (29 CFR Part 1902), which requires State plan 
States to adopt standards which are at least as effective as 
those promulgated under section 6 of the OSH Act. 29 CFR 
1902.03(c). These States, Alaska (Ex. 217), California 
(Ex. 218), Hawaii (Ex. 219), Michigan (Ex. 220), Oregon 
(Ex. 221) and Washington (Ex. 222), have adopted standards 
which provide more protection than OSHA's pulpwood logging 
standard by covering all logging operations within their 
States. The standards of the five western states also 
contain a much higher level of detail and specification than 
either the 1978 ANSI logging standard or OSHA's pulpwood 
logging standard. OSHA used these standards as source 
documents during development of this final standard.

On May 2, 1989, OSHA published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) to amend OSHA's pulpwood logging standard, 
29 CFR 1910.266, to include requirements for all logging 
operations (54 FR 18798). Thereafter, on May 11, 1990, OSHA 
published a notice of hearing in which 10 issues were raised 
for additional comment (55 FR 19745). There were 92 
comments submitted in response to the proposed rule and 
hearing notice.

Informal public hearings were held on July 2425, 1990, 
in Washington, D.C., and on August 2123, 1990, in Portland, 
OR, to allow interested persons who had objections to the 
proposed rule to have an opportunity to state those 
objections. There were 23 companies, organizations, 
associations and individuals who participated in the 
hearings.
