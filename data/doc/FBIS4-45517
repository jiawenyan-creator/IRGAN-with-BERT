  [Text] Tarija -- The 10th Workers Congress that probably 
will end in the next few hours has defended coca crops and 
demanded the industrialization of this controversial leaf that, 
according to peasants, is constantly threatened by foreign 
interests. 
  Thus, the Workers Congress passed a resolution condemning 
the 
"merciless intervention of North American troops in the coca 
zones, openly ignoring our national sovereignty." 
  For Bolivia, coca is not cocaine; it is a natural product 
and 
resource that is part of the Bolivian national culture and must 
be defended by endorsing its industrialization and 
decriminalization. 
  According to the workers, coca must be defended as part of 
the cultural patrimony of the region's countries. The labor 
representatives expressed their wish to internationally 
decriminalize this Peruvian and Bolivian leaf. 
  Activities by nongovernment organizations (NGO's) in the 
coca- producing areas were harshly criticized by the labor 
representatives, who demanded their expulsion because these 
NGO's want to divide the strong coca farmers' movement. 
  The resolution approved by the Workers Congress calls for 
the 
total implementation of alternative development programs because 
they are considered a serious method to replace the coca economy. 
  The Chapare, a controversial region as a result of the 
presence of coca and drug trafficking, was declared a national 
emergency zone to protect it from a possible militarization of 
the area on the pretext of replacing the coca economy. 
  The workers also asked that peasant markets depend directly 
on peasant organizations. Peasant representatives also expressed 
their concern at the lack of roads.
