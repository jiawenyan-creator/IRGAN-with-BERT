METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRUG CHARGE AGAINST ALLUMS DROPPED 
A Torrance Superior Court judge dismissed a cocaine possession charge against 
former UCLA basketball star Darrell Allums Thursday and indicated he may 
consider reducing the nine-year sentence Allums received last week for eight 
armed holdups. 
Judge William Hollingsworth Jr. ordered a report from prison authorities due 
Oct. 23 evaluating Allums' conduct in prison. Typically, when such a report is 
ordered by a judge, the result could be a reduced sentence or even release of 
the convict on probation. 
Allums, 30, was sentenced by Hollingsworth June 16 for robbing eight Domino's 
Pizza deliverymen using a screwdriver as a weapon. During that trial, the judge 
said he sympathized with Allums, who contended he commited the robberies to pay 
for his cocaine habit. 
The cocaine possession charge was dismissed because it was "such a minor 
offense," Allums' lawyer Patrick Maginnis said. Allums had been caught with $25 
worth of rock cocaine in the spring of 1987. 
On June 22, 1987, Allums was arrested on the robbery charges and has been in 
Los Angeles County Jail ever since. Maginnis said Allums has been a "model 
prisoner." 
"The bottom line is, he wielded a screwdriver and robbed people. I don't think 
nine years in prison is too harsh of a sentence," said Dist. Atty. Julie 
Sulman.
