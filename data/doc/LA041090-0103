REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LITTON SELLS ENCODER UNIT TO BAY AREA MANUFACTURER 
Litton Industries Inc. of Beverly Hills sold its encoder business in Chatsworth 
to a subsidiary of BEI Electronics Inc. of San Francisco, an electronic 
components manufacturer, BEI said. 
The transaction, which included the sale of Litton's ITEK Measurement Systems 
operation in Newton, Mass., was for an undisclosed amount of cash, plus the 
assumption of debt, according to BEI. 
The Chatsworth encoder operation makes electronic devices that "read" and 
convey the motion of objects. The devices can be used in airplanes, for 
example, to convey the plane's altitude to air traffic controllers. 
BEI said the Chatsworth unit has annual sales of about $8.5 million and has 
about 100 employees.
