FT  14 JAN 93 / IDA to sharpen focus on poverty
THE International Development Association (IDA) - the World Bank's
concessional finance affiliate - will focus more directly on specific
measures to reduce poverty and promote environmentally sustainable
development, Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, pledged yesterday.
The IDA provides highly concessional loans for the poorest countries - those
with per capita annual incomes of Dollars 765 (Pounds 503) or less.
Mr Preston said the share of IDA resources devoted to social projects and
direct poverty reduction would be steadily increased. He said poor people
affected by programmes should play a bigger role in helping design projects.
His restatement of IDA goals followed formal board approval of the 10th
replenishment of IDA resources, covering the three years starting this July.
Donor nations have agreed to provide SDR13bn (Pounds 11.83bn). This
represents a small increase in resources compared with IDA 9, which was
SDR11.7bn.
However, in per capita terms the latest replenishment is less generous than
IDA 9 because funds will have to be spread over more recipients; newly
qualifying nations include several former Soviet republics. Donors also
failed to provide an additional 'earth increment' to fund more ambitious
environmental policies.
Mr Preston praised donors for not forgetting the needs of the poorest
countries, in spite of severe budgetary restraints at home. Officials said
the overall replenishment would have been smaller but for a surprisingly
large commitment from the Bush administration, which pledged Dollars 3.75bn,
nearly 20 per cent more than its dollar contribution to IDA 9.
Britain's contribution of Pounds 620m represented only 6.1 per cent of total
resources committed, down from 6.7 per cent of IDA 9.
