FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Banesto settles dispute with BP
BANESTO, the big Spanish retail bank, yesterday said it would underwrite the
placement of shares in its business that were owned by British Petroleum in
an agreement that concluded an angry dispute between the two institutions.
The shares, which BP had since February been attempting to return to Banesto
under a buy-back clause, were acquired by the British company a year ago
when it paid Pounds 340m for Petromed, the Banesto-owned oil refiner and
distributor.
Under the agreement BP transferred to Banesto 2.9 per cent of equity held in
the Banesto bank and a further 2 per cent of stock in Banesto's industrial
conglomerate.
Banesto said it had already placed 1 per cent of the bank stock with an
unnamed third party at a price of Pta3,000 per share and that the remaining
equity would be placed in a 'gradual and orderly' manner.
The initial 1 per cent sale of the bank stock, which will net BP Pta3bn
(Pounds 16.6m), represents a premium on Banesto bank's current share price
of Pta2,440 but is well down on the Pta3,965 value of the bank's shares when
BP acquired them in the takeover.
BP can also expect to incur a loss on the placement of its Corporacion
Banesto stock as the industrial conglomerate's share price has fallen by
more than 50 per cent in the past year.
In May the buy-back dispute between the bank and the UK refiner came to a
head when BP voted against Corporacion Banesto's 1991 accounts at the
conglomerate's annual meeting. Yesterday BP said the agreement was
'satisfactory' and that hostilities were at an end because 'we are no longer
Corporacion shareholders.'
