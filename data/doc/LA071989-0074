SACRED SYMBOLS 
Has America already forgotten that author Salman Rushdie is still in hiding 
because the Iranian government has deemed his form of speech a desecration of 
their sacred symbols? 
Has America forgotten how it showed sympathy toward the hurt feelings of the 
Iranians, but stood fast behind its ideal that freedom of expression has 
precedence over even the most cherished symbols? 
Has America forgotten what the flag represents?
