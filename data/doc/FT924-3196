FT  09 DEC 92 / Letter: Defying conventional wisdom
Sir, Your report on Renault's impressive success ('U-turn on the road to
ruin', December 3) notes that the company is 80 per cent state-owned and its
state-appointed chairman and chief executive is a former aide to the
Socialist prime minister, Laurent Fabius.
Does this not fly in the face of the conventional wisdom that only
privately-owned firms can succeed and that civil servants running industries
are always a disaster?
