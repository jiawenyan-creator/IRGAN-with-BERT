FT  18 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Gas hurt
Utilities took a back seat as yield considerations were pushed aside by a
drive for undervalued stocks. One utility, British Gas, was further affected
by news that the group was to restructure itself and become five independent
units.
The changes are likely to lead to 20,000 people, or a third of the UK gas
workforce, losing their jobs and thus lead to heavy redundancy costs. The
shares fell 3 to 357p.
Pharmaceutical group Wellcome was well bought following a meeting late on
Thursday to discuss prospects for some of its products, particularly its
anti-herpes treatment, Zovirax.
There had been concern that the company might fail to get early approval for
over the counter sales of the drug in the US and the meeting removed some
jitters. The group also announced an alliance with Vertex Pharmaceuticals,
of Massachusetts to develop inhibitors against Aids and HIV, the virus
causing Aids. The shares, which have suffered badly in recent weeks, soared
ahead to close 24 up at 655p on respectable turnover of 6.3m.
SmithKline Beecham continued firmer to close 10 higher at 405p with Smith
New Court, Nomura and Keinwort benson all recommending the stock.
Airports group BAA fell 10 to 1020p as investors took profits after a recent
good run. British Airways dipped 1 1/2 to 443 1/2 p as it said it would
invest Pounds 150m in expanding cargo facilities at London Heathrow airport
in a joint venture with BAA.
The postponed figures from French electrical retail subsidiary Darty were in
line with analysts' expectations and the relief sent Kingfisher shares
forward 7 to 717p, although dealers said this was due to marketmakers
running tight positions.
Elsewhere among stores stocks, specialists continued to fret over the
trickle of reports from retailers suggesting dull pre-Christmas trading.
Next is said to be one exception, its shares showing continuing resilience
to the soggy sector, finishing the day 4 up at 212p. Marks and Spencer
retreated 7 to 430 1/2 p, although GUS, up 8 at 605p, and Boots, ahead 10 at
550p, provided brighter spots.
Strauss Turnbull was recommending top slicing in Cadbury-Schweppes, the
shares closing a half-penny off at 498p.
Manweb reported interim profits up 48 per cent to Pounds 54.9m, although it
cautioned against a similar level for the full-year. The shares gained 4 to
751p.
Profit-taking hit water stocks, among which, North West slid 12 to 588p,
Southern 13 to 659p and Welsh 15 to 715p.
Shares in Trafalgar House came under further pressure, easing 3 1/2 to 76
1/2 p.
