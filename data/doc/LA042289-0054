THE PERSISTENCE OF PRYING EYES 
Government reports too often gather dust rather than generate action, and 
unfortunately that seems the fate to which industry has consigned federal 
recommendations to protect the privacy of employees and customers. In its 1977 
report, the U.S. Privacy Protection Commission expressed the belief that 
industry would voluntarily adopt fair information practices, but most have not. 
More than half the nation's largest employers don't tell workers what records 
they are keeping about them, and 38% have no policies to control how employee 
records should be made available to government agencies. 
Following up on that 1977 report of the commission he chaired, University of 
Illinois professor David F. Linowes did another study and found that industry 
still does far too little to protect privacy. They make matters worse by using 
outdated or inaccurate records, and often sharing the data with outside credit 
agencies and landlords. 
Some companies have, however, taken a few important steps to provide greater 
privacy. Since 1979, when Linowes made a similar follow-up survey, he found 
that more companies have definite policies on privacy. More give workers access 
to their records. And more will send corrections to anyone who has received 
inaccurate information in copies of personnel records. 
Linowes wants Congress to limit to the essential minimum the information 
collected by employers. Further, he thinks employees should know what 
information has been collected and have the opportunity to check their files, 
and to seek legal remedies if their privacy has been violated. Those, he says, 
are the minimum guarantees of privacy, especially in the age of the computer 
which allows vast expansion of data collection and analysis.
