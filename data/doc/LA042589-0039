VALLEY EARNINGS: 4TH-QUARTER PROFIT FALLS 22% FOR NATIONAL TECHNICAL 
National Technical Systems in Calabasas said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit 
fell 22% from a year earlier on a 21% decline in sales. 
NTS, which provides testing and engineering services, said net income in the 
quarter that ended Jan. 31 dropped to $257,000 from $328,000, while sales fell 
to $7.23 million from $9.11 million. 
The company noted that its latest net income was hindered in part by higher 
interest costs and income taxes compared with a year earlier. 
For its full fiscal year, NTS profit slipped 3%, to $1.15 million from $1.19 
million in fiscal 1988, and its sales rose 6% to $30.9 million from $29.1 
million.
