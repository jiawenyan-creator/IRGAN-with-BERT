FT  22 NOV 93 / Rabin hails US defence pledges
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, returned from a 10-day visit to
North America yesterday triumphantly saying he had won US economic and
defence assurances which would bolster the Middle East peace process.
The strengthening of Israeli-US relations, a key factor in the electoral
victory by Mr Rabin's Labour party last year, is critical for the prime
minister to continue to win Israeli domestic support for his peace drive.
Mr Rabin said President Bill Clinton had promised to maintain Israel's
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) aid package for 1995 and 'later on', despite a
shrinking US foreign aid budget, and had agreed to supply Israel with
advanced aircraft and other missile and weapon systems. The US had also
agreed to lift current barriers on Israeli purchases of advanced US
technology, including supercomputers, which would ensure Israel's military
edge over Arab states.
Israel, the prime minister said, hoped to get a significant quantity of US
military surplus equipment, such as 50 F16A jet fighters over the next two
years. The weapons would be supplied 'almost for free' because of cuts in
the size of the US military.
'The US understands our security needs,' Mr Rabin said at Ben-Gurion
airport.
Mr Rabin said he had also discussed peace talks with Palestinians, Jordan
and Syria, to prepare for the visit of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary
of state, to the region next month and he indicated he favoured US-brokered
secret talks with Damascus.
