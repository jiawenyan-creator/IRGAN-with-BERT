<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Belgian General Francis </F>
Briquemont, departing UN Protection Forces commander in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, by an unidentified correspondent in an ice 
rink in Sarajevo on 23 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] British General Michael Rose is to take 
over tomorrow from Belgian [General] Francis Briquemont, the 
head of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], who is not hiding his 
bitterness and his misgivings as he leaves Sarajevo. An 
exclusive interview with our special correspondents Jean-Jacques 
Le Garrec and Cyrille Pecheric: 
  [Correspondent] A medal presentation ceremony on an ice rink 
built for the Olympics. But this morning General Briquement is 
a man overwhelmed, like the whole town, by the murderous madness 
that just yesterday wiped out six children playing in the snow 
of Sarajevo. 
  [Briquemont] I have spent hours and hours explaining to the 
belligerents, and especially to the Serbs, that this shelling of 
the town is militarily useless, that it is always a human 
tragedy, and that really as far as international politics is 
concerned it certainly does not improve their image abroad. 
  [Correspondent] Have you yourself also felt humiliated 
during 
your stay here? 
  [Briquemont] Yes, certainly. I can tell you that when you 
have...[pauses] Well, after all I am commander (?in chief); 
when you are a lieutenant general, and when you are stopped at 
checkpoints by men of 18 or 20, who are drunk, and they point 
their guns at you, and you have to wait 30-35 minutes there and 
do not know why, well, you feel humiliated. 
  But I know that all the NCO's [noncommissioned officers], 
all 
the young officers who pass (?these checkpoints) suffer this 
every day too, and I think this is why General Cot made his 
statement on 1 January. I was there next to him, and I share 
[his feelings] entirely. 
  [Correspondent] And how do you respond, or what do you think 
of the decisions to keep removing the generals who end up 
opening their mouths, if I may use the expression? 
  [Briquemont] You know, in my life I have always said what I 
think. I have not stopped doing so as a lieutenant general. 
Perhaps it is true that some politicians, and perhaps some 
highly placed officials in major organizations, do not like us 
saying what we think. But I think that in the UN operations we 
have got to the point where it is no longer the case that we 
have a right to speak, but a duty, because I think we must say 
what is wrong; because it is impossible to continue in these 
conditions. 
  [Correspondent] Do you have one word to leave with the 
people, the people of Sarajevo? 
  [Briquemont] It is true that as I leave Sarajevo I feel 
something of a Sarajevan. I think that if there is a gulf 
between the UN Security Council resolutions and the means we 
have to put them into effect, I think there is a gulf between 
all the political leaders and public opinion, because I think 
the people only want one thing, peace, and for the fighting to 
stop. Let the fighting stop first, and perhaps we shall hold 
discussions afterward, but let the fighting stop. It is a 
completely useless war, and one that I find quite stupid.
