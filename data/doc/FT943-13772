FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons sells subsidiary to managers for
Pounds 4.56m
Hopkinsons, the industrial abrasives and engineering group which in April
reported a 69 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, has sold its
England-Worthside drinks equipment subsidiary in a Pounds 4.56m management
buy-out.
The purchasers are Mr Trevor Hicks and Mr Tony Clarkson, managing and sales
directors of England-Worthside, operating as Closerate, a company in which
they together have a majority interest.
The consideration is payable in cash. Closerate will also assume
responsibility for any bank overdrafts of England-Worthside. Inter-company
indebtedness of Pounds 432,000 will be repaid on completion.
The buy-out is backed by 3i, the investment capital group. The managers have
raised Pounds 6m for the buy-out and to meet on-going funding requirements.
England-Worthside makes hand pull beer pumps and distributes drinks
dispensing equipment. It produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 858,000 in
1993, on turnover of Pounds 5.17m.
The disposal is being made to allow Hopkinsons to concentrate on its
abrasives, engineering, plastic injection moulding and drainage businesses.
