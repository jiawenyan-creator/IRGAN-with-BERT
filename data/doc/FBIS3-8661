  [Text] Ankara--The ethnic Turkish population in Bulgaria 
has decreased during the last three years because of the exodus 
to Turkey, the ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY reported on Tuesday. 
According to official statistics, 250,000 people have moved 
into Turkey over this period. 
  The exodus has been particularly severe in Southern Bulgaria 
and in the town of Kircali 50 percent of the population have 
left for Turkey. 
  The immigrants mostly enter Turkey on tourist visas although 
some cross the border illegally. The Bulgaria Rights and 
Freedoms movement representative in Kircali, Talat Coban, said 
that if the present trend continues the Turkish presence in 
Bulgaria would soon disappear. Mustafa Omer, mayor of the town 
of Kosukavak, stated on Tuesday that 50 Turkish villages in the 
region were now almost empty and added, "There are only a few 
old people remaining and even they are only waiting for a signal 
from their relatives in Turkey to leave the villages."
