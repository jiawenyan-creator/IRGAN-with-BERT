FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: BCE
BCE, Canada's biggest telecom group, denies it is negotiating the sale of
its financial services subsidiary, Montreal Trust, but analysts still think
a deal is possible.
BCE paid CDollars 878m for Montreal Trust in 1989 in the last of its
diversification moves. It has since reversed its diversification policy,
selling assets outside the telecommunications field and reinvesting in its
core businesses.
The reports claimed it has been negotiating to sell Montreal Trust to either
Bank of Novia Scotia or Bank of Montreal, which are trying to expand in the
trust company field. Since 1992 banks can now own trust companies.
Montreal Trust and a property subsidiary are the only non-telecom assets
remaining in BCE's portfolio.
BCE, meanwhile, has appointed Mr Derek Davies, formerly Northern Telecom's
vice-president of corporate strategy, its senior vice-president of corporate
strategy - a newly-created position.
Mr Charles Labarge, former president and chief executive of BCE unit BCE
Telecom International Inc, has been named vice-president, corporate services
of BCE. Mr Derek Burney, current chairman of BCE Telecom International, will
replace Mr Labarge as its president and chief executive.
