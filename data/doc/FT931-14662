FT  16 JAN 93 / Wine: Worthwhile Californian selections
WHATEVER happens, California's best wines, which (unlike most from the New
World) have real distinction and subtlety, are unlikely to get any cheaper.
Morris &amp; Verdin of London SW1 (tel: 071-630-8888) import one of the UK's
most interesting selections, including Au Bon Climat and Bonny Doon's
deliberately quirky range. Bibendum of London NW1 (071-722 5577) and of York
(0423-330131) also try harder than most, with Chalk Hill, Saintsbury, and
Kistler's divine 1990 McCrea Chardonnay actually worth the premier cru
price, Pounds 17.50,
asked for it. The Wine Treasury of London SW1 (071-730-6774) also imports
Kistler and Williams-Selyem's famous Pinot Noir. Bonny Doon, Mt Eden,
Rochioli Pinot Noir and Joseph Swan Zinfandel are available from Raeburn
Fine Wines of Edinburgh (031-332-5166). Ridge, Chalone, Edna Valley and
Mondavi are available from Les Amis du Vin, London W1 (071-487-3419) while
John Armit Wines of London W11 (071-727-6846) has Ravenswood Zinfandel.
Meanwhile, Oddbins are committed to nosing out California bargains.
