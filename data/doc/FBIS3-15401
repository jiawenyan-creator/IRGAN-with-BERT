  [Text] Moldova has managed to persuade Russian gas 
suppliers not to resort to extreme measures, like cutting off 
gas supplies because of nonpayments, stated Boris Karandyuk, 
director general of Moldova's state department on gas supplies. 
Yesterday he held talks on settling Chisinau's gas debt to 
Russia with Gazprom managers. Chisinau will clear its debt by 
supplying goods, particularly agricultural goods.
