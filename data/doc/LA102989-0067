PAPER CARRIER CREDITED WITH SAVING LIFE OF WOMAN, 83, TRAPPED IN BATHTUB 
A 14-year-old newspaper carrier is credited with saving the life of an elderly 
woman who had spent 10 days lying on her back in a bathtub. 
Christy Wenrich alerted police after she noticed a pile of newspapers on the 
stoop of 83-year-old Ellen Gilmour's home. Wenrich had just resumed delivering 
The Record of Hackensack after her sister had taken over the route for a few 
days. 
When police went to Gilmour's home, they heard faint pleas for help coming from 
inside. "They broke into the back and found her in the bathtub on her back," 
said Ramsey Police Capt. Anthony Del Colliano. 
Gilmour told police she had been cleaning the tub when she fell in 10 days 
before her rescue. 
She was hospitalized in fair condition Friday.
