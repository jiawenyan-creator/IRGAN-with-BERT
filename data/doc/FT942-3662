FT  14 JUN 94 / N Sea oil finds 'full of promise'
Oil finds in deep water west of the Shetland Islands are 'full of promise,'
a company involved in the area said yesterday.
However, Mr Heinz Rothermund, managing director of Shell UK Exploration and
Production, a partner along with British Petroleum in the Foinaven and
Schiehallion fields, said it was too early to determine whether full-scale
development of the area will go ahead.
Speaking at the FT's North Sea conference yesterday, Mr Rothermund said the
companies plan to begin production at early as next year.
