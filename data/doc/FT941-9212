FT  16 FEB 94 / London Transport launches smartcard
London Transport yesterday launched an 18-month trial of electronic
smartcards that can be automatically checked by a 'reader' installed on its
buses.
The card does not have to be fed through a reader but is radio-scanned while
in its wallet. The card contains details of validity, the travel zones
covered and the category of traveller. Testing has begun on 162 buses
operating on 19 routes in north-west London.
