  [Text] Iman Abu-Sita, suspected of involvement in the 
murder of David Bublin and Hayim Weizmann in Ramla, was captured 
in Rafah today. The residents of the Rafah neighborhood where 
the capture took place said the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] used 
anti-tank missiles and that seven houses were damaged, one of 
which was completely destroyed. The IDF's Southern Command's 
reaction was that during an initiated operation in Rafah, 
grenades were used to break into and clear a house, after which 
an armed wanted man was captured.
