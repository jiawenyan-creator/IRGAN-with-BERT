FT  16 MAY 94 / The Markets: Fed strives for right pitch - Global Investor
Global markets will take their lead this week from the US, where the Federal
Reserve seems certain to put up short-term interest rates at tomorrow's
meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee. The only question is how
much it will tighten, and how well or badly this will be received by Wall
Street.
Opinion is sharply divided as to whether the bank needs to raise the Fed
funds rate by 25 basis points, to 4 per cent, or 50 points. There is a
general presumption that it will couple a move on Fed funds with a 50 point
increase in the discount rate, which the Fed itself charges for loans. While
the discount rate is nowadays regarded by Wall Street as a largely symbolic
indicator of monetary policy, it still carries some weight internationally.
The Fed's gradualist approach - it has increased in 25 basis point
increments since it started tightening in February - suggests it will raise
Fed funds to 4 per cent, with another 25 point increment at or before the
FOMC's next meeting, in early July. Recent signs of greater moderation in
the rate of US economic growth could reinforce this stance. But investor
sentiment argues for a 50 basis point increase.
The bond market's volatile behaviour over the past two weeks suggests that
the Fed still has to convince Wall Street of its inflation-fighting
credentials, even though last week's excellent inflation statistics for
April underscored that rising prices are not yet a problem.
The Fed's three previous 25 point increases have merely served to leave the
market anticipating more, and Fed Funds at 4.25 per cent is already largely
factored in to short-term rates. A rise on Tuesday of just 25 basis points
could thus be bearish for bonds, the dollar and stocks.
A 50 point increase would be more likely to underpin current bond market
values and the dollar. Certainly, higher US rates are a necessary second
step to reinforce the recent round of central bank intervention to support
the currency. And a 50 point rise would neatly match last week's unexpected
cut in German rates, creating the impression that banks are co-ordinating
their interest rate structures as well as their foreign exchange market
operations.
But even this more aggressive stance may be insufficient to trigger a
sustained bounce back in bond and stock prices from the current correction.
The fragility of sentiment in recent weeks shows Wall Street is still
struggling to come to grips with the dimensions of the turn in the interest
rate cycle, with economic opinion sharply divided over the wisdom of Fed
policy: while a majority fears the bank is still too accommodating, a vocal
minority argues that it is in danger of choking off growth by fighting
yesterday's enemy, since improving productivity, and intense domestic and
international competition will keep inflation under control. A plethora of
economic statistics and historical analogies suggest long bond yields are
abnormally high, but in the current market such fundamentals are of limited
help, and it may take a further cathartic plunge in fixed income and equity
values before investor psychology turns.
France
Whatever the outcome, and rights or wrongs, of the current Anglo-French tiff
over aircraft landings at Orly airport, the publicity surrounding the affair
is unlikely to bolster France's image among US fund managers, who account
for such a large part of global investment flows.
The economy may be starting to recover, but since the French Government's
climbdown last October over a threatened strike at Air France, American
investors have questioned the willingness of Prime Minister Balladur to put
the competitive restructuring of French industry ahead of social goals.
The Orly row can only reinforce that concern. For example, Morgan Stanley
strategist Mr Richard Davidson recently went underweight on French equities
in his model portfolio, fearing that 'French Government policies are
reacting to political pressures rather than economic objectives.'
China/ Hong Kong
Weekend news that Beijing has freed the second of two dissident leaders of
the Tiananmen Square uprising increases the chances that the US Government
will renew China's Most Favoured Nation trade status. The Clinton
Administration is due to decide on the issue on June 3 and uncertainty over
the outcome could hang heavy over Hong Kong equities for the next few weeks.
The White House, which has tied renewal to significant Chinese progress on
human rights, seems unlikely to withdraw MFN status completely, since this
would provoke a crisis in bilateral relations, severely damage American
companies' opportunities in the burdgeoning Chinese market, and cause fresh
unease in global bond and currency markets over the president's execution of
foreign policy.
MFN revocation would hit Hong Kong hard. The China Analyst newsletter
reckons that the increased tariffs would price at least Dollars 20bn (Pounds
13.6bn) of Chinese exports out of the US market - nearly 63 per cent of its
exports to America - and that some 70 per cent of this trade goes through
Hong Kong.
An alternative being kicked around Congress, is a partial removal of MFN
status, imposing punitive tariffs on selected state-owned Chinese factories,
but keeping them off private sector products. This would be hard to enforce
and would still infuriate China.
The noises from both capitals have been more conciliatory in recent weeks,
but anything less than than full MFN renewal would have a depressing impact
on Hong Kong stocks. Renewal could spark a rally in the Hang Seng, yet an
overblown Hong Kong property market, tightening credit conditions in China,
and rising interest rates in the US (to which the colony's currency is
pegged), suggest that the relief would be overshadowed quickly by other
concerns. It still looks wise to be underweight here.
Sprint
Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telecommunications group, is
talking to Electronic Data Systems, the world's leading computing services
company and a subsidiary of General Motors, about a merger or alliance.
The discussions are the latest manifestation of the convergence of the
telecommunications and computer industries and a full takeover would create
a powerful new force, both in the US and internationally, in the multi-media
revolution.
A looser alliance may be the more likely outcome, given the cultural
problems of putting the two together and possible tax complications for GM
in a full disposal.
However it is structured, a deal could be very beneficial for both
companies. Sprint would get greater access to EDS's large business
customers, and EDS's computer expertise would be helpful in a nationwide
cellular telephone service which Sprint is trying to set up.
EDS, which runs its own global communications network, could substantially
cut the cost of its leasing lines, and become more centrally involved in
multi-media.
Sprint is one of the cheaper US telecom stocks, trading on a prospective p/e
of about 14.5. It seems never to have shaken off its lacklustre Wall Street
image of several years ago, when poor long-distance marketing led to a loss
of market share.
However, it is has now built up a strong brand name, thanks to an aggressive
advertising campaign, and its careful targetting of affluent individuals and
small business is winning back market share. Its local telephone business is
among the most efficient in the nation and its cellular operations are
enjoying particularly fast growth.
As the smallest of the three big long-distance companies, it is subject to
greater investor anxiety about eventual long-distance competition from the
Baby Bell companies, now barred from that market. But that is a good five to
10 years away, and Sprint is well on the way to establishing itself as as a
nationally branded telecommunications service. A non-dilutive EDS deal
should bolster the stock, as would a link with an international partner.
