  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- China, Japan and Russia 
welcomed South Korea's flexibility when consulted beforehand 
about Seoul's decision to withdraw its demand for an 
inter-Korean envoy exchange, a Foreign Ministry official said 
Friday. 
  The decision, while aimed at turning the North Korean 
nuclear 
crisis away from international sanctions, would at the same time 
convince the world community including China that sanctions were 
inevitable if Pyongyang ignored even this incentive, the 
official said. 
  Seoul has attempted to break the nuclear impasse by saying 
it 
would no longer demand an inter-Korean envoy exchange as a 
precondition to North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. 
  The decision separates inter-Korean from North Korean-U.S. 
dialogue under Seoul's strategy to resolve the nuclear problem, 
leaving the issue to Pyongyang and Washington to untangle. 
  The North's recent behavior, such as threatening to turn 
Seoul into a "sea of fire," proved the South could not expect 
any progress in the nuclear dispute via an envoy exchange, the 
ministry official said. 
  "The decision to cut the link reflects the government's will 
to place prior emphasis on transparent inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," he said. 
  Washington was fully consulted about Seoul's move, he said, 
while China, Japan and Russia welcomed it, noted the official. 
  "If North Korea blocks progress on the inspection despite 
such efforts on our part, the international community will gain 
justification in seeking sanctions against it," he said.
