 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 NASA proposes to provide further implementation of the statutory goal to make at least eight percent of the funding
for prime contracts and subcontracts available to small business concerns or other organizations owned or controlled
by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, which include women, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, and other minority educational institutions. These categories of entities listed in the applicable
statutes are collectively identified as ``designated entities.''

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


This rule establishes major policies with respect to contracting and subcontracting with designated entities.
With respect to prime contracting, it ensures that designated entities are fully considered for awards. Also, the
consolidation or bundling of contract requirements is controlled. With respect to subcontracting, it requires
specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated
entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors, and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting
goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR
Subpart 19.7. NFS Subpart 1819.70 and the clause at 1852.21976 are substantially revised. A new subsection
is added to NFS 1815.608. NFS 1870.303, Appendix I, Chapter 301, is amended to cover proposal evaluation.


Availability of NASA FAR Supplement


The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this proposed coverage will become a part, is codified in 48 CFR chapter 18, and is
available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402. Cite GPO Subscription Stock Number 933003000001. It is not distributed
to the public, whether in whole or in part, directly by NASA.


Executive Order 12866


The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rule is significant under E.O. 12866. This
regulation is needed, because it provides the NASA policy regarding contracting and subcontracting with designated
entities. Regarding prime contract awards, the policy ensures that designated entities are fully considered for
awards. Regarding subcontracting issues, the policy requires specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for
subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors,
and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting
plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR Subpart 19.7. Current regulations do not address these prime
contracting and subcontracting policies. The potential costs for this regulatory action are nominal and are not
quantifiable. Because the subcontracting goals are included in the contract, costs for contracting with or subcontracting
to designated entities would normally be charged to the Government. The potential benefits are the increased direct
awards or subcontracting awards to designated entities which will broaden the base of NASA contractors. The value
of increasing the contract and subcontract opportunities to designated entities cannot be measured, because it
involves not only increases to NASA's business base of qualified and eligible contractors but also additional opportunities
for designated entities to receive a fair proportion of NASA awards to the maximum extent practicable.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


NASA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not impose any information collection subject to 44 U.S.C. chapter 35.
