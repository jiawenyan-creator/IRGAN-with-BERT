  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China (BOC) 
issued bonds worth 300 million Deutsche mark recently in the 
Frankfurt international capital market in Germany. 
  The five-year bonds carry an interest rate of 7.125 percent, 
and were sold to underwriters at a price 101.425 percent of the 
face value, a BOC spokesman said. 
  It was the third time since 1988 for the BOC to issue 
Deutsche mark-denominated bonds in international financial 
markets. 
  The BOC spokesman said that the fact that the interest rate 
of the Deutsche mark hit its record lowest point had been 
conducive to the bond issue. 
  The Commercial Bank of Germany served as the lead manager 
for 
BOC, and the underwriting group consisted of 29 banks and 
securities companies from Europe, Japan and the U.S.A. 
  The BOC has floated bonds in foreign currencies three times 
so far this year: once each in the U.S., Japan and Germany, 
netting capital totalling 830 million U.S. dollars.
