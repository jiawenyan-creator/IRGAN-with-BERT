FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Courts (Furnishers) shares jump 91p on 53%
advance
SHARES in Courts (Furnishers) climbed 91p to 613p yesterday as the home
furnishings group reported a 53 per cent pre-tax profits advance in the year
to March 31.
The rise from Pounds 8.09m to Pounds 12.4m was struck on turnover ahead 22
per cent at Pounds 224m, compared with Pounds 184m. At the interim stage,
the growth in turnover had only been 4.2 per cent. When those results were
announced the shares rose 25p to 344p.
The bulk of the profits growth came from the 12 overseas subsidiaries, where
electrical appliances account for 60 per cent of sales. Overseas turnover
expanded by Pounds 35.6m to Pounds 117.1m, 52.3 per cent of the group total.
Of the Pounds 35.6m, organic growth accounted for Pounds 20.2m and
favourable currency exchange rates the balance.
Operating profits in the Far East were Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 5.9m), the
Caribbean Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 6.3m) and the Pacific/Indian Ocean Pounds 6.3m
(Pounds 5.1m).
Transfers to deferred profits in the group, the payments so far on hire
purchase sales, rose to Pounds 9m (Pounds 5.3m). This derived mostly from
increased volume overseas where most of the business is on credit. In the UK
credit accounts for only 15 per cent of sales.
Sales of the Trinidadian joint venture, treated as an associate, were up
from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 17.2m.
Mr Bruce Cohen, chief executive, said that over the year there had been a
certain amount of recovery, albeit 'slow and hesitant', but that Queensway
and ELS had gone bust and that Chestermans, the Argos experiment, had been
wound up.
In the UK, operating profits were up at Pounds 4.41m (Pounds 3.53m) on sales
ahead at Pounds 106.9m (Pounds 102.5m). Mr Cohen said that when the market
strengthens, an increase in turnover would immediately impact on the bottom
line.
Earnings rose to 31.6p (19.7p) per share and the dividend is lifted to 5.5p
via a proposed final of 3.67p (3.17p).
