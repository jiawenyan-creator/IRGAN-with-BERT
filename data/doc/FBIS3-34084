  [Text] Semnan, Feb. 1, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Hassan Rowhani said here Tuesday that due to fall of 
oil prices Iran lost dlrs. [dollars] four billion in its 
revenues in the current Iranian calendar year, 1372 (March 
1993-94). 
  He added that in the current year's budget price of oil was 
set at dlrs. 17 per barrel, but the average price of each barrel 
of Iranian oil was dlrs. 14. Presently each barrel of oil is 
sold for dlrs. 11, he said. 
  Rowhani said that Iran lost dlrs. 6.4 billion in the course 
of the first five-year development plan due to fluctuation of 
dollar against other hard currencies. 
  On Iran's foreign debts, he said that the country has 
managed 
to solve the problem despite the problems created by the U.S. 
  Referring to the debate in Majles on the next year's budget 
bill, he said that in the course of the debates the deputies 
decided to set the government revenues at rls. [rials] 70,000 
billion instead of the proposed rls. 80,000 billion. 
  He said encouraging export of non-oil commodities will do 
the 
country good and it is a national and Islamic duty. 
  He added that the non-oil exports this year amounted to 
dlrs. 
5,000 million and proposed easing the present restrictions in 
this respect.
