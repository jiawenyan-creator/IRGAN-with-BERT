U.S. DESIGNATES WATTS TOWERS A LANDMARK 
Los Angeles' Watts Towers, the soaring spires Sabato (Sam) Rodia spent more 
than 30 years building, have been declared a national landmark, officials said 
Tuesday. 
Rodia, an unschooled Italian immigrant, used pliers, a hammer and wire clippers 
to build what critics regard as an act of visionary architecture. 
Once threatened with demolition, the structures at 1765 E. 107th St. are now 
undergoing extensive restoration. Watts Towers' designation as a national 
landmark will qualify it for various federal funds and private grants it may 
not have been able to attract before, said John Outterbridge , director of the 
Watts Towers Arts Center. 
"We here on site are very happy," Outterbridge said. "We always felt that the 
Watts Towers, like the Watts community, has been nationally prominent for many, 
many years. Residents of this community who have been caretakers (of the 
towers) for years are due just this kind of prominence." 
The designation of the Watts Towers as a national landmark by Secretary of the 
Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. increases the focus on the structures "as a national 
treasure," Outterbridge said. 
Rodia's hand-made masterpiece is an amalgam of broken bottles, pottery shards, 
seashells and bits of iron held together by chicken wire smeared with ordinary 
builder's cement.
