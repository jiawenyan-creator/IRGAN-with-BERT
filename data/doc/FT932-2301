FT  19 JUN 93 / SFO seeks access to Nadir banks
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office is seeking Turkish government co-operation to allow
access to the books of two Istanbul-based banks connected to Mr Asil Nadir,
the fugitive businessman.
The proposal was discussed last week with the Turkish government in meetings
with Ms Lorna Harris, the chief SFO lawyer dealing with fraud charges
relating to the affairs of Mr Nadir's former company, Polly Peck
International.
Legal experts in Ankara have confirmed that the UK has requested Turkish
assistance under the terms of a letter rogatory, under which a court in one
country can seek the co-operation of a court in another jurisdiction in an
investigation of a suspect. If the Turks agree, this would also allow the
SFO to interview key witnesses in Turkey relating to the affair.
The SFO is understood to have issued similar requests to a number of
countries where Mr Nadir had business interests, including the US and the
Cayman Islands.
The letter rogatory would allow SFO access to the records of both Impexbank,
the Istanbul merchant bank Mr Nadir sold in 1990, and Turkiye Yatirim Turizm
TYT bank to which Mr Nadir has also been linked. Mr Nadir is believed to
have channelled large sums out of PPI to these two banks using the accounts
of his mother, Mrs Safiye Nadir.
There is a diplomatic effort to dissuade Mr Nadir from travelling to the
Turkish mainland from northern Cyprus where he fled on May 5. He says he
wants to go there to reclaim his business empire.
