FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: IFE raises cash offer for TVS preference
holders
PREFERENCE shareholders of TVS Entertainment were last night celebrating 'a
victory for shareholder democracy' as International Family Entertainment
significantly increased the value of the cash alternative to its offer.
The initial offer for TVS, the south of England ITV company that lost its
franchise, was a mixture of paper and cash valued at Pounds 38.2m. A full
cash alternative was then unveiled worth Pounds 36m - 23p for ordinary
shareholders and 43p for preference shareholders.
IFE, a US cable television company founded by evangelist Pat Robertson,
yesterday made a qualified offer of a 60p cash alternative for preference
shareholders.
The American company said that Sun Life Investment Management Services, one
of a group of unhappy preference shareholders who were holding out for more,
had undertaken to sell its 5m preference shares if the offer is increased to
60p.
IFE said the offer would be increased to that level if the original offer
for the company goes unconditional by January 12. For that to happen IFE
wants acceptances from at least 75 per cent of preference shareholders.
By January 6 IFE had received acceptances, including irrevocable
undertakings, representing 79 per cent of the ordinary shares and 52.8 per
cent of the preference. Together they totalled 74.5 per cent of the voting
rights.
While the preference shareholders have been battling for better terms the
share price of IFE, owner of The Family Channel, has been rising on the New
York Stock Exchange.
On January 6 the value of the share offer was 37.1p for each ordinary share
and 66.7p for preference shares. This was based on an IFE share price of
Dollars 13.875 (899 1/2 p) on an exchange rate of Dollars 1.5423 to the
pound.
This values the share offer for TVS at Pounds 56.5m and the cash alternative
at Pounds 44.4m including Pounds 8.5m if the increase in the cash
alternative goes ahead.
