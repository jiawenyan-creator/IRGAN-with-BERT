BOWL REPORT; 
CITRUS BOWL; 
NEBRASKA TO START GRANT AT QUARTERBACK 
Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne named Mike Grant as his starting quarterback for the 
Citrus Bowl game Tuesday in Orlando, Fla., against Georgia Tech. Osborne chose 
Grant over Tom Haase after Mickey Joseph suffered a severe leg laceration in 
the last game of the regular season against Oklahoma. 
Grant was Nebraska's starter in the season opener against Baylor but had a 
bruised knee that cost him the next two games. He returned as the starter in 
the fourth and fifth games but was then replaced by Joseph the rest of the 
regular season. 
"It doesn't matter who the quarterback is, you've still got to stop their 
offense," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said. "He's (Grant) a great football 
player and has a good arm. He's a better thrower than Joseph." JOHN CHERWA
