DIGEST: DOWNEY; 
HEARING SLATED ON COUNTY PESTICIDE WAREHOUSE 
Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Norwalk) has scheduled a public hearing on a 
laboratory and pesticide warehouse that the county is building on its Rancho 
Los Amigos property in Downey. 
Epple told the Downey City Council on Tuesday night that he opposes county 
plans to use the warehouse to store pesticides and rodent poison. He said he 
will invite state health and agricultural officials to the meeting to help 
determine if the facility will pose a danger to the surrounding community. 
The laboratory and warehouse will be used by the Agricultural Commissioner and 
Department of Weights and Measures, which will move from its facility in nearby 
Pico Rivera. 
County officials contend that the facility will be safe. But city officials and 
residents say it could be dangerous in the event of a pesticide spill or fire 
because it will be near residential neighborhoods and the Rancho Los Amigos 
Medical Center. 
A handful of placard-carrying residents demonstrated against the facility in 
front of Downey City Hall on Tuesday night. 
The public hearing will be held at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 11 in the City Council 
chamber. The facility is scheduled to be completed in April.
