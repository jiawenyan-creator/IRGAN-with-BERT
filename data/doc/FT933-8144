FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
A QUIET opening to the new account saw turnover in the derivatives markets
slip back in directionless trading, writes Christopher Price.
However, business in the September FT-SE contract opened lively enough, with
traders half expecting another rousing session. The contract, having opened
at 3,020, was bought up to challenge the 3,030 level which has proved a
resistance point in the post-3,000 era. Dealers said the rise was even more
impressive given the 10 or so points that were taken out of the index
because of the number of stocks going ex-dividend.
Despite this, turnover was thin with few of the large institutions visible.
September thus began to drift off towards mid-day, although there was enough
buying interest to sustain the contract above the 3,020-level.
Another rally took the contract up to 3,031, its high of the day before
again falling back. A strong Wall Street failed to inspire any further
attempt, offset by weak gilts and a general lack of events for dealers to
focus on.
A late dip saw September close at 3,013, just five points above the cash
market. Volume was 5,727 contracts.
In traded options, turnover reached 20,873 contracts, Among the stock
options, Tesco, heavily tipped in the weekend press, led the way with 1,298
contracts. Amstrad, British Steel and Grand Metropolitan were also
prominent.
