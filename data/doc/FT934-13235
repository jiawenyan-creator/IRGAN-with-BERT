FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Jarvis cuts deficit to Pounds 630,000
JARVIS, which is involved in property investment, construction and
development, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 630,000 for the
six months to June 30.
Mr Harvey Bard, chairman, said the improvement followed actions taken last
year to reduce operating capacity, and the continuation of the policy of
only bidding for work when a positive margin could be anticipated.
The building division continued to experience poor trading conditions, he
said. Civil engineering had improved its order book though margins had
remained tight. Following a reconstruction the fitting-out company had
achieved a significant improvement.
Mr Bard said that in the second half a further loss was expected in the
construction side. That would be partly offset, however, by an additional
contribution from property investments.
In June, Jarvis acquired a 34 per cent interest in Chapel Wharf, a joint
venture company formed to develop a 9 acre site in Salford. Its two partners
are DC Thompson and the City of Salford.
Turnover declined to Pounds 36m (Pounds 48m). Losses per share were reduced
to 2.8p (8.1p) and again there is no dividend.
