FT  07 DEC 93 / Mexican economy contracts sharply
Mexico's economy shrank by 1.2 per cent in the third quarter of 1993,
compared to the equivalent period last year, by far the worst performance in
the five-year administration of President Carlos Salinas.
The manufacturing sector contracted by more than 5 per cent in the quarter.
The economy, especially private investment, was hit by the government's
restrictive monetary policy and by uncertainty over the North America Free
Trade Agreement, said Mr Jonathan Heath, head of Macro Asesoria Economica, a
consultancy in Mexico.
The government prefers to blame the slowdown on a weak world economy and
restructuring of the private sector, much of whose productive capital has
become obsolete as a result of Mexico's rapid trade liberalisation.
The finance ministry said the economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the first nine
months, compared to the equivalent period last year. The service sector
expanded by 1.4 per cent, while the industrial sector contracted by 0.3 per
cent and agriculture by 1.2 per cent. The manufacturing sector shrank by 1.5
per cent in the nine months to September.
The third-quarter figures were much worse than expected said Mr Rogelio
Ramrez de la O, of the consultancy Ecanal. He was revising downwards his
forecast for annual growth to 0.8 per cent for this year. The government's
most recent forecast is for growth of 1.1 per cent.
Mexico's government kept interest rates high throughout most of the year and
ran a budget surplus in an effort to maintain confidence in the economy in
the run-up to the vote in the US Congress on the free trade agreement. While
such a policy ensured a remarkably strong peso throughout the year, and has
helped reduce the trade deficit, the real side of the economy suffered.
