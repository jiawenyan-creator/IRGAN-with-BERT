FT  08 MAR 93 / Good news being prophesied by the bond markets
ARE THE 1990s to be a decade of low inflation? That is what bond markets
seem to be saying. If they are right, what might it mean for the recovery?
The timing of the bond market rally has closely followed that of the
business cycle. It started in the US, where redemption yields on 10-year
government bonds have fallen by 3 1/2 percentage points since March 1989
(see chart). It moved to the UK, where yields on 10-year gilts have fallen
by more than 5 percentage points from their peak in April 1990. Finally, it
hit Japan and Germany: Japanese yields have fallen by almost 4 percentage
points since September 1990, while German ones have fallen by 2 1/2 points
over the same period.
The US and the UK have not enjoyed bond yields as low as these since the
early 1970s. In better managed economies, current yields are less
remarkable. German long-term rates of interest were 5.7 per cent in March
1978 and below current levels for part of the late 1980s. Similarly,
Japanese long-term interest rates were lower, if briefly, in April and May
1987. Furthermore, current rates must be set in their historical context.
Long-term yields are still well above what had been normal in either the US
or the UK before the inflationary 1960s and 1970s.
Bond yields reflect the long-term real rate of interest, expected inflation
and taxation. The latter can be ignored, however, since so many holders of
long-term bonds avoid (or evade) tax.
The long-term ex ante real rate of interest is determined by supply of, and
demand for, investible funds. But the real rate of interest cannot be
ascertained from yields on conventional bonds, since inflation expectations
are unknown.
Here British index-linked gilts can help. Under certain strong assumptions -
perfect global capital market integration and the absence of credit and real
exchange-rate risks - the interest rate on British index-linked gilts would
also represent the world's long-term real interest rate. Although those
assumptions do not hold, the information provided in the chart is helpful.
It shows that real interest rates can vary substantially over time. It also
shows that British real interest rates have fallen by more than one
percentage point over the past 12 months, presumably because of the
recession-induced decline in investment opportunities and the real
depreciation of sterling (which has lowered the exchange rate risk on
sterling-denominated assets).
Nevertheless, the British data suggest that lower inflation expectations
were absolutely more important than lower real rates of interest in causing
the decline in nominal bond yields. For a tax-exempt British institution,
expected inflation, as measured by the gap between the yields on
conventional and index-linked gilts, has fallen by nearly 4 1/2 percentage
points since early 1990.
If 3 1/2 per cent were, indeed, the global risk-free real rate of interest,
expected inflation would now be around 3 per cent in Germany, 2 1/2 per cent
in the US and  1/2 per cent in Japan. These low figures suggest a high
degree of confidence in the prospect for inflation. Furthermore, the recent
strength of stock markets - except for the Japanese market, which also
remains rather expensive - does not suggest that fears of a slump are the
main reason for that optimism over inflation.
One good reason for optimism about real economic performance is the low bond
yields themselves. Regardless of the real interest rate, high nominal
interest rates increase the cash-flow risks attendant on borrowing for the
purchase of long-term assets. If they are sustained, low long-term interest
rates can help ensure healthy long-term investment throughout the upswing.
But for that to happen, inflation expectations need not only to be but to
remain subdued. The confidence of all those investors who believe that low
inflation will survive the recovery is admirable. But, particularly for
those buying huge quantities of gilts from the UK government, it also
represents the triumph of hope over painful experience.
