  [Text] An officer accompanying General Cedras has reported 
that the Army commander in chief toured various military 
garrisons in the metropolitan area in line with the state of 
emergency. He told us that the Army chief made it a point of 
presenting an overall view of the situation to the officers and 
the soldiers. The Army's number-one-in-command also wanted to 
lift troop morale and ask them to prepare for anything. 
  The officer added that Gen. Cedras took the opportunity, 
while visiting the barracks, to denounce, quote, the 
international community's emotional, irrational, and immoral 
role in managing the Haitian crisis. Gen. Cedras visited the 
naval and aviation corps, heavy machines, the National Palace, 
the Military Academy, and the Croix-des- Bouquets barracks. 
  It should be noted that sandbags have been placed near 
Port-au-Prince Police Headquarters, preventing traffic from 
entering nearby streets. This measure was taken in response to 
the Jonassaint government decree outlining various strategic 
zones.
