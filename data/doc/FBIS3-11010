  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Mar (EFE) -- Colombian 
Communications Minister William Jaramillo Gomez today announced 
that he will soon tender his resignation to President Cesar 
Gaviria. 
  Jaramillo Gomez, Liberal Party member, minister since May 
1992, and a former ambassador to Spain, made the announcement at 
a National Newspaper Association, ANDIARIOS, meeting in Santa Fe 
de Bogota today. He is the third communications minister since 
Gaviria assumed office on 7 August 1990. 
  He was preceded by advertising agent Alberto Casas 
Santamaria, currently ambassador to Venezuela, who held the post 
from August 1990 to November 1991, and journalist Mauricio 
Vargas Linares, who held it from November 1991 to May 1992. 
Jaramillo Gomez is a former mayor of Medellin. 
  Jaramillo Gomez hinted that he intends to resign because he 
plans to accept a nomination as candidate for governor of 
Antioquia, his native department, located in the country's 
northwest, in the coming October elections. 
  After last Sunday's legislative elections, political circles 
anticipate the resignations of Government Minister Fabio 
Villegas and Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos, both 
Liberal Party members, in what could be Gaviria's last crisis 
before he steps down on 7 August. 
  Villegas and Santos will participate in Liberal Party 
candidate Ernesto Samper's campaign, according to political 
sources. Samper, former economic development minister and 
former ambassador to Spain -- this is precisely where he 
succeeded Jaramillo Gomez -- on Sunday was elected the official 
Liberal Party candidate with 48.21 percent of the party votes, 
defeating six rivals. 
  In the first round of the elections, to be held on 8 May, 
Samper will contend for the Presidency of Colombia for the 
1994-1998 term with Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana 
Arango.
