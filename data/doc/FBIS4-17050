  [Excerpt] Riga, Apr 20, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet decided 
Tuesday [19 April] to raise the minimum salary from 15 lats (26 
U.S. dollars) to 22.50 lats (38 U.S. dollars), the Cabinet's 
press secretary, Sergejs Ancupovs, said at a briefing. 
  The government also determined regulations on order of 
giving 
pensions to those pensioners who still work. The regulations 
provide for the state employment services to find working places 
being vacant for two months. Pensioners will be allowed to take 
these jobs and receive both: pension and salary. [passage
