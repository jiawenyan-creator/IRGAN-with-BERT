  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has 
stressed Jordan's full readiness to become a positive factor in 
the endeavor to end Arab bloodshed in sisterly Yemen through 
cooperation with any Arab side or in any agreed-on arrangements 
because Yemen is an Arab and Islamic state. He said continued 
fighting in Yemen will result in a long destructive war, 
particularly because there are previous examples of this in the 
Arab world. 
  Asked by an AL-DUSTUR correspondent in New York about the 
failure of Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general to 
Yemen, in his mission to bring all Yemeni parties together, 
al-'Anani said: Jordan has always worked to safeguard the unity 
of sisterly Yemen, which it freely opted to do. At the 
beginning of the crisis, the brothers in Yemen asked His Majesty 
King Husayn to embark on mediation to spare Yemeni blood. This 
was achieved, thanks to His Majesty King Husayn's efforts, and 
the accord document was signed in Amman to safeguard Yemen unity. 
  Al-'Anani said Brahimi's mission has not ended yet, adding 
that he will present his report to the UN secretary general to 
be discussed. Therefore, al-'Anani added, it is difficult to 
say that his mission has failed. 
  The information minister noted that Jordan supports any Arab 
endeavor and will attend any meeting called by the Arab League 
to discuss events in Yemen. He said Jordan appeals to all 
Yemeni parties to stop fighting and to resort to diplomacy to 
save Yemen from suffering and civil war. He affirmed Jordan's 
readiness to participate in resolving differences, provided that 
the fighting stops.
