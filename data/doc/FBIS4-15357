  [Text] The future of the Estonian-Russian negotiations is 
vague, head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin told the ETA

concerning citizenship, while the problem of the retired

rejected all Russian proposals, Svirin explained. He added that 
the Russian side proposes a complex solution of the Paldiski 
issue, while the Estonian proposals had only concerned the
