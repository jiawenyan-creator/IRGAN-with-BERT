"Defense Industry Open to Businessmen"] 
  [Text] An exchange of opinions on the fulfillment of the 
agreements reached in Moscow between the Ukrainian, U.S., and 
Russian presidents on the elimination of the nuclear weapons on 
Ukrainian soil took place between Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy 
Shmarov and Nicholas Burns, head of the U.S. economic delegation 
and senior director of the National Security Council. The guest 
was also familiarized with the programs for the conversion of 
Ukraine's defense industry which propose close cooperation with 
U.S. firms. Conversion processes could be considerably 
accelerated by the involvement of small-scale business as the 
most mobile form of entrepreneurship. The U.S. side's attention 
was drawn also to problems of Ukraine's space complex, where 
there is extensive scope for cooperation.
