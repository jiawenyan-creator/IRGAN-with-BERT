FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: Time to make the water polluters pay (2)
Sir, In the debate about the price we must pay for clean water frequent
reference is made to the cost of combating pollution caused by fertilisers
and pesticides. If these costs were charged to farmers, according to the
'polluter pays' principle, it would be one step towards establishing the
true costs of intensive as opposed to extensive farming.
Other external costs incurred by intensive farming include massive
'set-aside' costs; storage and disposal of crop surpluses; unemployment
benefits; soil depletion; high energy consumption etc. If these were charged
to intensive farmers, the true economics of organic farming might become
more apparent, and water bills might rise more gently.
