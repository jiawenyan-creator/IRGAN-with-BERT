FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Interest costs hold back Severn Trent to 3%
rise
SEVERN TRENT, the Midlands water and sewerage group, saw half-year pre-tax
profits held to a 3 per cent rise by interest charges incurred on its heavy
investment in water treatment and by the impact of recession on waste
management.
Nevertheless, profits of Pounds 140.8m (Pounds 136.7m) for the six months to
September 30 were slightly ahead of City expectations. That, together with
the 9.4 per cent rise in the interim dividend to 7p (6.4p), helped the
shares rise 1p to 445p.
Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive, said: 'The recession is real and I don't
see it ending. It doesn't worry me - I'd just like it to be different'.
Water and sewerage price increases and a full six months contribution from
Biffa, the waste management company acquired for Pounds 212m in May 1991,
pushed group turnover up by 16.2 per cent to Pounds 459.1m (Pounds 395.2m).
Operating profits from the core water and sewerage business rose by 11.7 per
cent to Pounds 149m (Pounds 127.8m) as operating margins rose from 37.5 per
cent to 39.7 per cent. Severn Trent said that cost savings of Pounds 5.5m
were made in the half year, including a 1 per cent cut in staff to 7,400.
Operating profits in Biffa rose to Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.4m) but on a
comparable basis for a full six months this represented a fall of more than
10 per cent.
Operating profit on other businesses - water and waste services in Belgium
and the US - rose to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.2m) after a Pounds 600,000
contribution from recent acquisitions.
The fall in profits on a comparable basis was due to the costs incurred in
pitching for US municipal contracts, Mr Paul said.
Corporate overheads fell to 4.8m (Pounds 5m) because 'we've been attacking
all kinds of costs, and spending less on the annual general meeting and
paraphernalia', he added.
The interest payable of Pounds 11m, compared with Pounds 7.3m interest
received. It was incurred on debt of Pounds 280m at end-September, against
Pounds 170m in March and Pounds 36m in September 1991.
Earnings improved by 2.7 per cent to 37.5p (36.5p) per share.
COMMENT
It is not news by now that Biffa is unlikely to make the profits envisaged
at the time of acquisition for several years. Its Pounds 6m profits in the
half year covered only about half the interest charged on its acquisition
cost, but its dilutive effect on earnings appears largely to be in the share
price. Although interest charges will hold back profit growth, the peak
spending will soon be passed. Barring further disappointment in the non-core
businesses, Pounds 275m pre-tax profits and earnings per share of 70.7p
could be achievable for the full year. The dividend cover is still one of
the highest in the sector and if Severn pays a full-year dividend of 21p
(19.3p), that may give its shares reason to do better than the sector.
