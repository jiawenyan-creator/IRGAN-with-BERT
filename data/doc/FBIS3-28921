  [Text] Washington, Feb. 14 KYODO -- The U.S. Government 
Monday [14 February] unleashed a sharp attack on Japan's trade 
policy, accusing the Japanese of maintaining subtle and covert 
market barriers against imports. The White House, in an annual 
report on the nation's economy, said the United States has 
sought "objective criteria" to measure Japan's imports because 
the Japanese trade structure differs from other industrial 
nations. 
  "Japan is an outlier [as received]," top White House 
economist Laura Tyson said in a briefing to reporters on the 
presidential economic report. The report said Japan does not 
keep foreign products out through tariffs and import quotas, 
which "are not significant trade barriers." 
  The obstacles which foreign businesses must face in Japan, 
it 
said, are more subtle and therefore more difficult to penetrate, 
particularly in the manufacturing sector. "Japan's market is 
regarded by many as effectively closed to imports of many 
foreign manufactures, especially those that directly compete 
with Japanese goods," the report said.
