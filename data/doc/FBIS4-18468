in a Cabinet Post"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Sydney, April 2 -- The best-known of 
Italy's "Clean Hands" magistrates, Milan prosecutor Antonio Di 
Pietro, said during a reception here Saturday [2 April] that he 
wants to play no role in government. 
  A hero to Italians the world over for his lead role in the 
Clean Hands anti-corruption probe, Di Pietro arrived in Sydney 
Thursday with his wife and a friend, for a nine-day tour of 
Italian emigrant communities in Australia's major cities. 
  Asked about press reports that he might be tapped for the 
job 
of interior minister, he said this was just an April Fool's joke 
played by journalists. It was only while he was reading the 
newspapers aboard the flight taking him "down under" that he 
learned that Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi had allegedly 
offered him a cabinet post, Di Pietro said. "No one held out 
such a prospect and, in any case, I cannot and do not want to 
hold any government spot," he insisted. 
  The prosecutor went on to say that he had enough on his 
plate 
with his present duties and that were he to accept a political 
post he would not be able to complete the job he is doing and 
which is still far from completion. 
  Moreover, the government soon to be formed will not be a 
constitutional government in need of technicians, but a 
government sanctioned by the votes of the electorate, a 
political government which has no room for technicians, he said.
