 

d. The Type III exits and adjacent seat rows are offset longitudinally such that persons approaching an exit from one
end of the cabin may use the exit without interfering with those approaching the other exit from the other end of the
cabin;

e. The location and part number of each passenger seat must be defined by a drawing approved by the FAA or foreign civil
airworthiness authority. The seat arrangement may not be reconfigured without FAA approval; and

f. An evacuation demonstration must be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the aisle arrangement.

The content of the special conditions was based, in part, on the maximum passenger capacity proposed by BAe. The specific
limitation of 29 passenger seats was the maximum capacity requested by BAe, but the FAA considered that the fact that
this capacity was well below the maximum that could be allowed for the installed exit combination was a significant
factor in acceptance of the aisle arrangement.

Subsequent to issuing the Special Conditions 25ANM45 and prior to issuance of the Type Certificate
for that project British Aerospace Public Limited Company changed its name to Jetstream Aircraft Limited and changed
the model designation for the airplane from BAe Model 4100 to the Jetstream Model 4101. Type Certificate A41NM was
issued to Jetstream Aircraft Limited on April 9, 1993 for the Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. It is now anticipated
that additional models of the 4100 series may be added to this Type Certificate in the future. In addition to the Model
4101, Special Conditions No. 25ANM45 would be applicable to any other Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes
that incorporate the same novel or unusual aisle configuration.



Type Certification Basis



Under the provisions of 21.101, Jetstream must show that 30 passenger Model 4100 series airplanes comply with
the regulations in the type certification basis established for the 29 passenger Jetstream Model 4101 airplane.
The type certification basis for the Model 4101 is as follows:

The certification basis for the Model 4101 is established in accordance with 21.29, using the Joint Aviation
Regulations (JAR) as a reference point, with appropriate additional requirements incorporated to provide an equivalent
certification basis to the FAR requirements for U.S. certification. British Aerospace and the Civil Aviation Authorities
(CAA)UK elected to have the type certification basis be the following:




_JAR 25 as amended through Change 12 dated May 10, 1988;

_JAR 25 Orange Paper Amendment 881 effective October 18, 1988;

_JAR 1, definitions as amended through Change 4 dated June 1, 1987; and

_any additional part 25 paragraphs necessary to provide a composite type certification basis equal to the required
part 25 type certification basis.




Based on 21.29 and 21.17 and the type certification application date, the applicable U.S. type certification
basis was established as follows:




_Part 25 dated February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 251 through 2566;

_any applicable special conditions issued;

_any applicable exemptions granted;

_any equivalent safety findings made;

_the fuel venting requirements of Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 27, including Amendments 271 through
the latest amendment in effect on the date the Model 4100 is type certificated, and

_Part 36, including Amendments 361 through the latest amendment in effect on the date of TC.




If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25 as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes because of a novel or unusual
design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of 21.16 to establish a level of safety
equivalent to that established in the regulations.

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with 11.49 after public notice, as required
by 11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with 21.17(a)(2).

Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of 21.101(a)(1).



Novel or Unusual Design Features



The 30 passenger seat version of the Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes incorporate(s) the same novel or unusual
aisle configuration as described above for the 29 seat version.
