THE 'ORG BOARD'; 
HUBBARD'S PLAN FOR IMPROVING ON '80 TRILLION YEARS' OF MANAGEMENT 
A key element of the management techniques Scientologists sell to businessmen 
is L. Ron Hubbard's "organizational board." 
Used also by the Church of Scientology, the "Org Board" divides an organization 
into seven divisions -- executive, personnel, sales, finance, training, 
marketing and qualifications. 
Each division's duties are spelled out, along with the basis for evaluating 
employee performance. 
In describing the Org Board's virtues, Scientology consultants omit Hubbard's 
colorful account of its origins -- an account reminiscent of one of his science 
fiction tales. 
During a 1965 lecture to Scientologists in England, Hubbard said his board is a 
refined version of one that was used for "80 trillion years" by an "old 
galactic civilization." 
Hubbard said the civilization died (he did not say when) because its 
organizational board lacked one division that he incorporated into his 
modern-day version. 
Declared Hubbard: "We don't want these temporary fly-by-night affairs!"
