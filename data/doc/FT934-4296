FT  04 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A healthier view of the deficit
Sir, The chancellor uncharacteristically missed a trick in his Budget.
As part of the government's 'back to basics' campaign, he should have
reinstated the traditional British billion. That would have cut the deficit
to Pounds 0.05bn at a stroke.
