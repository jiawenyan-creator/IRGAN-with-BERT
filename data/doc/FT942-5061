FT  07 JUN 94 / Minister deplores detention protest
A Home Office minister yesterday accused 'leftwing protesters' of stirring
up trouble at an immigration detention centre from which six Algerians
escaped on Sunday night.
Windows and furniture were smashed and detainees took to the roof during
protests at the Campsfield centre in Kidlington, near Oxford.
Twenty two people were yesterday transferred to another centre and four
detainees who tried to jump the perimeter fence were taken to hospital with
leg and ankle injuries.
Mr Charles Wardle, junior Home Office minister, yesterday attacked
demonstrations against the centre. He said: 'The main difficulty is the
regular series of protesters - a motley coalition of leftwing supporters.'
Mr Wardle said the trouble on Sunday was probably sparked by the removal of
Mr Ali Tamaret, an Algerian student who was due to be deported tomorrow. He
said Mr Tamaret went to Algeria voluntarily on September 2 but returned two
months later using a forged passport.
