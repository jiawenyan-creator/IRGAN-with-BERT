  [Text] Singapore, January 7 (XINHUA) -- The delegation of 
the Communist Party of China (CPC) led by Wen Jiabao, alternate 
member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee left 
here for India tonight after ending a two-day visit to Singapore. 
  The delegation called on Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and 
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew here this afternoon. 
  At the meeting, Goh and Wen agreed that Asia Pacific is 
expected to have a healthy development in the next 15 years. 
Stability and development in China is vitally important to the 
Asia-Pacific region, even to the peace of the whole world. 
  During his meeting with Lee Kuan Yew, Wen appreciated Lee's 
"great, outstanding, and effective" efforts he has contributed 
to the development of the friendly relations between China and 
Singapore. He also voiced his support to the Suzhou Industrial 
Park initiated by Lee and said it was a great idea to transfer 
the software of Singapore to China. 
  Lee reiterated that a developing China, but not a weak 
China, 
is beneficial to the development and stability in Asia. 
  Lee noted that China should grasp the opportunity to speed 
up 
its economic development with the fast growing Asia in the 
coming three to four years.
