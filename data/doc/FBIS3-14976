<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Defense Ministry Press Service in </F>
Kiev; date not given] 
  [Text] Some mass media have reported on a declaration made 
on 26 February by Anatoliy Lupynis, leader of the Ukrainian 
National Assembly [UNA], at a meeting of Kiev intellectuals. In 
particular, the declaration pointed out that the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry had allegedly drafted a project to be discussed 
by the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. The project provides 
for the building of Russian military bases in Ukraine. 
According to Lupynis, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry had 
suggested that Russian laws be applied on the territories of 
those bases. 
  The Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press Service points out that 
the information provided by Mr. Lupynis regarding the 
possibility of locating Russian military facilities on the 
territory of our state is unsubstantiated. Such actions would 
contradict Ukraine's current laws, and allegations that the 
Defense Ministry either prepared or discussed a similar project 
are groundless. 
  Unfortunately, under the conditions of the current harsh 
political contests, some politicians are trying to gain 
political capital at all costs, even by defaming the Armed 
Forces. The declaration by the UNA leader is proof of this.
