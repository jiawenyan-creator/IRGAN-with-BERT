UC IRVINE TO ANNOUNCE NEW ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 
UC Irvine will name an athletic director today, filling a position that has 
been vacant since September, the school announced Sunday. 
Big West Conference Associate Commissioner Dennis Farrell, former Houston 
Athletic Director Tom Ford, Cal State Dominguez Hills Athletic Director Dan 
Guerrero and former Detroit Lions Coach Darryl Rogers are the remaining 
candidates from six who were interviewed. 
A press conference has been scheduled for 1 p.m. today at Irvine. 
Earl Edwards, associate athletic director at UC San Diego, said Sunday night 
that he had not been contacted by Irvine officials. Tom Beckett, associate 
athletic director at Stanford, interviewed for the job but later withdrew. 
The new athletic director will replace John Caine, who held the job for six 
years before being reassigned as a special assistant to the chancellor in 
September. Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor for student affairs, has been 
acting athletic director since Oct. 1. A 15-member search committee on Monday 
recommended from two to four names to Mitchell and Chancellor Jack W. Peltason.
