FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Purchases help MMI return to black
MMI, the financial services and communications company, reported a return to
profits for the half year to August 31 with Pounds 201,000 pre-tax, against
losses of Pounds 282,000.
Acquisitions, which provided Pounds 1.93m of the total turnover of Pounds
5.22m (Pounds 483,000), contributed operating profits of Pounds 382,000 out
of a total of Pounds 405,000, against losses of Pounds 72,000.
The most recent acquisitions of Pelham Communications, Park Avenue
Productions and Mediamix made a significant contribution. The BES business
increased turnover but the recruitment advertising business incurred a loss.
Mr Ian Perry, who replaced Mr Alan Bradshaw as chief executive at the
beginning of the month following a disagreement over strategy, is developing
the company into a business communications group.
It is proposing to change its name to Pelham Communications.
Earnings per share were 0.47p (losses 2.15p). An application to remove the
deficit on revenue reserves by reducing the share premium account is being
made to the courts.
