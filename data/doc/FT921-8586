FT  17 FEB 92 / International Company News: Echo Bay reduces target for gold
output this year
ECHO BAY Mines, one of North America's biggest precious metals mining
groups, has set 1992 targets which will see gold output fall and cash
production costs rise.
The Toronto-based company has set a production target of 700,000 troy ounces
of gold this year, down from 733,900 in 1991, which in turn followed a 10
per cent drop from the 1990 level.
The cash cost target is Dollars 255 an ounce compared with Dollars 249 last
year and Dollars 244 in 1990.
Echo Bay plans to lift capital expenditure from Dollars 50m to Dollars 66m
this year but exploration spending will be Dollars 5m, only half the 1990
level and down from Dollars 6m last year.
Silver output is targetted to jump from 5.6m ounces last year to 8m ounces
in 1992. In 1990 silver production was just over 2m.
Echo Bay announced its 1992 targets at meetings in Europe and North America
after revealing net earnings for 1991 were Dollars 6.8m, or 0.07 cents a
share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 59.7m, or 60 cents, in 1990 when
the company wrote off two investments.
Revenues fell to Dollars 315.6m from Dollars 338.9m reflecting lower gold
prices and production. The average price realised by Echo Bay for gold was
Dollars 392, down from Dollars 404.
The company has hedged 109,200 ounces of 1992 gold production at an average
of Dollars 397 an ounce and 3.7m ounces of 1992 silver at Dollars 4.45.
Pre-payment of loans reduced Echo Bay's hedged position and the company has
chosen not to lock in present 'low' prices by making any additional forward
sales. Gains of Dollars 6.2m from 1991 pre-payments of gold and silver loans
will be recognised in 1992 earnings.
Echo Bay's proven and probable reserves at the end of 1991 totalled 12.535m
ounces of gold, against 12.462m the previous year, and 116.994m ounces of
silver, against 135.881m.
