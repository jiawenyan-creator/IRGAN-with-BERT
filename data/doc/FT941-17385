FT  05 JAN 94 / India rejects plea on Kashmir
India yesterday rejected Pakistan's attempt to link bilateral dialogue to a
change in New Delhi's stand on the Kashmir issue, and cautioned that this
might cause a delay in settling other bilateral problems such as control of
the Siachen Glacier, the demarcation of a maritime boundary in the Sir Creek
area, nuclear non-proliferation, and stabilisation along the line between
the two countries, Shiraz Sidvha reports from New Delhi.
Mr JN Dixit, India's foreign secretary, said yesterday a stalemate on the
Kashmir issue had not been broken in talks with Pakistani officials in
Islamabad but India was prepared to continue talks as long as no
pre-conditions were set.
