FT  29 OCT 92 / Letter: Continuous improvement important to sustaining
business
Sir, In your article, 'Why customers come first' (Management, October 26),
you included a chart on the impact of relative quality on rates of return,
quoting PIMS Associates as the source. Permit me to make the following
observations on the use of our data.
Our measure of quality - on which the evidence is based - is customer
perceived relative quality. As your article rightly says, it is customers'
views which count when it comes to assessing the impact of quality on
business profits, not the internal systems on which many TQ programmes are
focused.
But another point from our evidence needs to be clearly understood: the only
worthwhile measures of quality are relative. They must reflect the choices
which customers have to make.
Quality in competitive markets can never be an absolute. Offering a good
product or service is not enough - what matters is whether it is better or
worse than the competition. This is why continuous improvement and
benchmarking are so important to sustain business profits.
The most successful companies we see are not those which set quality
strategies in tablets of stone. They are those which focus outwards, at both
customers and competitors, making sure that the advantage they had yesterday
will still be there tomorrow.
