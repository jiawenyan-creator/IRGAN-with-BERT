FT  13 JAN 94 / Dearing rejects union claim about growth in workload
Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief national curriculum adviser,
yesterday rejected claims by a union leader that teachers' workloads would
be excessive if his curriculum report was implemented.
It was Sir Ron's most outspoken support so far for the government's attempts
to ensure that this year's national curriculum tests in England and Wales
take place. Last year, the three main teachers' unions boycotted them.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers,
yesterday called for this year's tests to be abandoned. He said: 'Sir Ron
tacitly admits that the workload remains excessive.'
Mr McAvoy claimed that Sir Ron's comment that he wanted to reduce
administrative work was 'a clear admission that the national tests as they
are now bring with them additional workload which Sir Ron wishes and intends
to remove'.
But Sir Ron's response to Mr McAvoy was 'No. Emphatically no. I don't agree
with that.'
Sir Ron, who was speaking at an educational technology conference, said his
comments had referred only to the 'tick-lists' which teachers must compile
as part of continuing assessment for the national curriculum, not to the
end-of-year tests.
He added: 'On the tests, I've already recommended a halving of their length.
I would say to Mr McAvoy, that in the view of Her Majesty's inspectors, who
are paid to give an independent view, the assessment arrangements of the
national curriculum have a vital role in raising expectations of teachers,
pupils and parents.'
