  [Text] Vienna -- In 1993, Austria's foreign trade with 
Germany saw the biggest decline since the end of World War II. 
Although the downward trend in exports has slowed down somewhat 
over the past few months, exports decreased by a total 6.1 
percent, to 182 billion Austrian schillings, Guenter Graf, the 
Austrian trade commissioner in Frankfurt, said. 
  These figures indicate an above-average decline in exports 
to 
Germany -- with total 1992 exports going down by 4.3 percent. 
Imports from Germany amounted to 234 billion schillings, that is 
8 percent, or 20 billion schillings, below last year's figure. 
The trade deficit with the FRG sank by 14.1 percent, to 52 
billion schillings. In 1993, 39 percent of Austria's exports 
went to Germany, compared with 40 percent in 1992. Imports from 
Germany currently account for 41.5 percent of all imports; in 
1992 the figure was 43 percent.
