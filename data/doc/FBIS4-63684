  [Text] Baghdad, 19 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH has 
said that renewing and perpetuating the unfair embargo on Iraq 
will continue to be a U.S.-Zionist wager blessed by the 
humiliated henchmen in the region in order to peddle evil and 
suspicious U.S.-Zionist schemes. 
  In an article today, the paper, the mouthpiece of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, says: Regardless of this renewal and 
continuation of the embargo, Washington knows well that Iraq is 
not an easy prey and that Iraq will continue to be a thorn that 
bleeds the enemies' soft spot, deprives them of sleep, and 
obstructs their plans. 
  The paper says that despite all the conspiracies concocted 
against its principles, Iraq will continue to adhere to its 
leadership and to care for its unity. Iraq is capable of 
foiling all the evil greed by further patience, steadiness, and 
perseverance. 
  AL-THAWRAH continues: We do not pin much hope on lifting the 
unfair embargo through a Security Council resolution. Instead, 
we wager on Iraq's continued patience and perseverance in order 
to fragment and terminate the embargo. The paper stresses that 
all signs confirm that [word indistinct] is with us and that 
what appears on the surface in terms of conspiracies and renewed 
embargo are only futile attempts.
