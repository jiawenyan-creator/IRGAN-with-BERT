  [Text] The Estonian Defense Ministry is working on new 
entry regulations for Russian army officers. This was announced 
at a Tuesday news conference by Prime-Minister Mart Laar. 
  He said the old regulations were good when the withdrawal of 
troops was proceeding according to plan. However, the pullout 
has almost stopped. Now an applicant will have to clearly state 
which unit he is going to, for how long and when the unit is 
going to be withdrawn. 
  Estonia says there are about 2,500 Russian soldiers and 
officers in Estonia. At a regular round of talks at the end of 
last year the Russian side suggested completing the withdrawal 
by August 31, 1994. It demanded automatic residence permits and 
other social guarantees to retired Russian army officers. As 
the Estonian side refused to offer them, Russia said it might 
change the suggested deadline of the withdrawal.
