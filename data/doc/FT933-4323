FT  09 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever
The acquisition of a Dollars 500m-turnover US company, the biggest in its
field, would rank as a material transaction in most people's books. But for
Unilever, the agreement to buy Kraft General Foods' ice cream business
counts as little more than a handy bolt-on acquisition. Given that the
consideration represents less than 5 per cent of Unilever's assets, it is
not even obliged to disclose the purchase price.
Unilever has long desired to bolster its US foods interests. Adding KGF to
its existing US ice cream business will make Unilever market leader in a
fragmented field and will doubtless provide opportunities for distribution
and marketing synergies. Unilever may have its work cut out reversing KGF's
recent weak trading run. But Unilever seems unlikely to have paid over the
odds. It can afford to wait.
Philip Morris's decision to sell out of ice cream is indicative of the trend
among food manufacturers to narrow their focus on fewer markets in which
they have a dominant position. Unilever has already gone a long way to
winnowing out its brand portfolio. But in Europe, Nestle and BSN have
scarcely begun the process. The difficulties of managing weaker brands are
escalating by the day as retailer power grows stronger. Asset swaps among
the bigger operators may become an increasingly frequent feature of the food
scene.
