  [Text] The secretary-general of the Hizballah Islamic 
revolutionary movement of Lebanon met the foreign minister of 
our country ['Ali Akbar Velayati] in Damascus this morning. 
According to a report by the Central News Unit correspondent, 
at that meeting, which took place at the Iranian embassy, the 
latest developments in Lebanon -- especially the recent 
onslaught of the Zionist regime against the southern parts of 
that country -- were assessed. 
  Sayyid Hasan Nasarallah, describing the various aspects of 
this invasion, stressed: These provocations of the enemy will 
never be able to shake the resolve of the region's Muslims to 
liberate Islamic lands. He said: The presence of the masses of 
the Lebanese people, groups, and personalities in the funeral 
procession for the martyrs of this violent onslaught is 
indicative of the firm resolve of Muslims to remain steadfast 
and continue the path of the martyrs. 
  Mr. Velayati for his part expressed the condolences of the 
leadership, government, and people of Iran and emphasized: The 
Zionist's motive behind this aggression is the expansion of 
their domination over Islamic and Arab countries.
