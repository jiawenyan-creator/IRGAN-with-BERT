The Philadelphia Flyers acquired goaltender Pete Peeters and forward Keith 
Acton from the Winnipeg Jets -- a week after they had been dealt -- in exchange 
for a sixth-round draft choice in 1991. 
Peeters and Acton were sent to the Jets last week for future considerations, 
but there was speculation that the trade was a way to protect the veterans from 
Monday's waiver draft.
