FT  09 SEP 93 / Anti-US protest in Sudan
A CROWD of over 2,000 women, chanting Islamic and anti-US slogans, delivered
a protest note yesterday to the American embassy in Khartoum over US
accusations of Sudanese sponsorship of terrorism, Agencies report from
Khartoum.
The embassy has cut the size of its staff and evacuated family members.
Sudan's hardline military leadership has responded angrily to the
accusations. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said on Tuesday that Washington
had failed to produce any proof his country had allowed terrorist training
camps on its territory. Lt-Gen al-Bashir, speaking in the Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa after a regional summit, also denied he was supporting Somali
gunmen linked to Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, the fugitive warlord, in their
increasingly bloody battle with UN forces in Mogadishu.
