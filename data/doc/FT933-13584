FT  19 JUL 93 / Virgin wins union battle
THE British-owned Virgin megastores opened in France yesterday, following
another victory in their Sunday trading battle, writes John Ridding in
Paris.
A Paris tribunal on Saturday rejected a complaint by the CGT, the French
union organisation, which demanded Virgin's Paris and provincial stores be
closed for the day under the country's 1906 Sunday trading law.
