FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dow warns on first-quarter
earnings
DOW Chemical said yesterday its first-quarter earnings would be lower than
expected due to reduced earnings at Marion Merrell Dow, its prescription
drugs subsidiary, agencies report. Dow has a 71 per cent stake in Marion
Merrell.
The US chemical company said its first-quarter per-share net income could be
about 25 cents below the 62 cents of a year ago. That figure was reached
before one-time retiree healthcare charges. Including the charges, Dow lost
Dollars 2.17 a share in the period.
Marion Merrell said its first-quarter earnings could be as much as 60 to 70
per cent below average analysts' expectations of 62 cents a share. For the
first quarter ended March 31 1992, Marion Merrell reported net income of 60
cents a share.
Marion Merrell said the expected first-quarter decline was mainly due to
sharply lower US sales of its major prescription products, compared with a
the same period in the previous year.
