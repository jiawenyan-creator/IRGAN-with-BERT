<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice implements special local regulations for the start of the Cock Island Race from the Portsmouth Seawall
area of the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, Norfolk Harbor, Norfolk and Portsmouth, VA on July 16, 1994. The
sailboats will race to Hampton Roads and return. These special local regulations are needed to control vessel traffic
within the area due to the confined nature of the waterway and the expected vessel congestion during the starting of
the races. The effect will be to restrict general navigation in the regulated area for the safety of participants in
the races.

consist of over 200 sailboats ranging from 22 to 60 feet. The sailboats will be divided into several classes. Each class
will start at ten minute intervals from the Portsmouth Seawall area of the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River,
Norfolk Harbor, Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia on July 16, 1994, race to Hampton Roads and return. Because this
is the type of event contemplated by these regulations, and because the safety of the participants would be enhanced
by the implementation of the special local regulations for this regulated area, the regulations in 33 CFR 100.501
are being implemented for the start of the races.
