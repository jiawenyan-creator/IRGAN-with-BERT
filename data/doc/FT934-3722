FT  08 DEC 93 / Sharp rise in French company failures
The number of French company failures increased sharply in October, rising
to 5,629 from 4,177 in September, according to Insee, the national
statistics office.
The figures demonstrate the continued fragility of the French economy,
despite government claims that the worst of the downturn is over and that
recovery will start from the end of the year.
The number of business casualties in October, the highest for five months,
means that more than 62,000 companies failed in the 12 months to the end of
that month. This represents a rise of 9.9 per cent over the same period in
1991-1992.
Industrial companies, and particularly manufacturers of consumer goods, were
among the worst hit in October, along with hotels, cafes and restaurants.
Government officials said that an increase in the rate of business failures
often occurred at the end of a recession and that measures were being
implemented to aid small businesses.
Earlier this week, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, announced
increased financial support for struggling small businesses. He said that
CEPME, a body specialising in equipment financing for small companies, would
receive FFr200m (Pounds 23m) to extend in loan guarantees. Mr Alphandery
also urged commercial banks to follow the central bank in reducing the cost
of credit.
