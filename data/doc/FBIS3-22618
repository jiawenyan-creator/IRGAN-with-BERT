<F P=106> [Rodica Dirzu report: "Females Are More Affected by Cancer </F>
Than Males"] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that, in our country, cancer does 
not belong among the first-ranking illnesses that cause death, 
it is still a great health problem owing especially to its 
social implications. The cancer death rate is higher in the 
urban areas than in rural areas. In the category of people aged 
33-60, the so-called category of active [working] persons, 29 
percent of the deaths among females are caused by cancer, 
whereas the same figure among men is merely 22 percent. Among 
females, the most frequent cases of cancer are breast cancer, 
followed by uterine and stomach cancer. Among males, the list 
is topped by lung and bronchial cancer, followed by stomach and 
prostate cancer. The category of active persons is most 
affected by cancer (50 percent of the cases belong to that 
category), followed by the group of persons aged 60- 65 (45 
percent), whereas the least affected is the group aged 0-33 (5 
percent.) The number of cancer cases among children has 
increased lately: In 1993, 1,071 such cases had to be treated, 
compared to 800 in 1992.
