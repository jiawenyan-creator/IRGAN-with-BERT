ACTION:

 Notice of final List of Fisheries for 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final List of Fisheries for 1994 pursuant to the interim exemption for the taking of marine mammals
incidental to commercial fishing operations under section 114 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA).
The 1994 final list revises the categories of certain U.S. commercial fisheries based on new information obtained
since publication of the 1993 final List of Fisheries. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The final List of Fisheries for 1994 is effective August 25, 1994. Vessel owners who will operate in Category I or II
for the first time have until October 24, 1994 to register.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 114 of the MMPA establishes an interim exemption for the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial
fishing operations and requires NMFS to publish and annually update the List of Fisheries, along with the marine mammals
and the number of vessels or persons involved in each fishery, arranging them according to categories, as follows:





1. A fishery that has a frequent incidental taking of marine mammals; 

2. A fishery that has an occasional incidental taking of marine mammals; or 

3. A fishery that has a remote likelihood, or no known incidental taking, of marine mammals. 

The following criteria are used in classifying fisheries in the List of Fisheries, pursuant to section 114 of the MMPA:




Category I. 

There is documented information indicating a ``frequent'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery. ``Frequent''
means that it is highly likely that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel
in the fishery during a 20-day period. 



Category II. 

(1) There is documented information indicating an ``occasional'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery,
or (2) in the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors
such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished,
and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is a likelihood of at least an ``occasional''
incidental taking in the fishery. ``Occasional'' means that there is some likelihood that one marine mammal will
be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period, but that there is little
likelihood that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken. 



Category III. 

(1) There is information indicating no more than a ``remote likelihood'' of an incidental taking of a marine mammal
in the fishery, or (2) in the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals,
other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons
and areas fished, and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is no more than a remote likelihood
of an incidental take in the fishery. ``Remote likelihood'' means that it is highly unlikely that any marine mammal
will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period. 

On March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10372), NMFS published the proposed List of Fisheries for 1994 and requested comments and information
on the changes contained therein. After reviewing the comments received, NMFS has determined that all changes identified
in the proposed list are warranted and will be incorporated into the final list. In addition, portions of the mid-Atlantic
coastal gill net fishery (upper river and estuarine areas of the Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay and New York Bight, as
well as Pamlico and Albemarle Sound in North Carolina) will be reclassified under Category III based on recently obtained
information which suggests the rare occurrence of marine mammal takes in these areas. Gillnetters operating outside
of these areas in the mid-Atlantic coastal gillnet fishery must still register under Category II, regardless of whether
or not they sometimes participate in the reclassified inshore fishery mentioned earlier (Category III). 

This final list will remain in effect until the interim exemption established under section 114 of the MMPA becomes
obselete. The MMPA was amended on April 30, 1994, and section 118 was created to govern the taking of marine mammals
incidental to commercial fishing operations. The provisions of section 118 will replace the current interim exemption
system (section 114), when regulations are put into effect, no later than September 1, 1995. Included in the implementation
will be a revised List of Fisheries, a revised set of classification criteria, and new implementing regulations,
based on the provisions of section 118, to replace those provisions currently in effect.
