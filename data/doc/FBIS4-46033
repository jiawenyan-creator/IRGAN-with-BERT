  [Text] Russia strictly follows the strategy of mutually 
beneficial cooperation on the world raw uranium and uranium 
technologies market, and is willing to take part in setting a 
price quota, which would take into consideration the interests 
of other countries, said Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian minister for 
nuclear energy, speaking at the opening in St. Petersburg of the 
21st international conference "The World Market for Nuclear 
Fuel." 
  ITAR-TASS reports that the forum, held in Russia for the
