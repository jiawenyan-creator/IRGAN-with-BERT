FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Mohair blames decline on yarn side
British Mohair Holdings, the Bradford-based yarn and specialised engineering
products maker, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.1m to
Pounds 1.47m for the year to December 31.
The reduction was largely because of a decline in demand for yarn in the
second half, the company said, although the non-textile companies marginally
increased profits. However, early indications of demand for mohair yarns
showed some improvement and raw material prices had risen.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 39.3m (Pounds 39.2m).
A maintained final dividend of 7.1p is proposed to hold the total at 8.5p,
uncovered by earnings of 7.39p (10.8p).
