RACING BRIEFS; 
FAIRPLEX PARK'S FIRST WEEKEND SEES SHEPHERD, JOHNSTON STAKES 
The first of three weekends of racing at Fairplex Park on the L.A. County 
Fairgrounds in Pomona opens Saturday with 12 races on the track and the 
simulcast of the Woodward Handicap from Belmont Park. 
The Woodward is expected to feature the leading contender for Horse-of-the-Year 
honors, Criminal Type. 
The Woodward will be shown between early races on the program and will offer 
win, place, show and exacta wagering. It will not be part of the Pick Six nor a 
portion of the early daily double. 
On-track action will be highlighted by the $50,000-added Phil D. Shepherd 
Stakes for 3-year-olds and up. The winner of the 1 1/16-mile Shepherd receives 
an automatic berth in the $150,000 Pomona Invitational, the richest 
thoroughbred race of the meet. The invitational will be run Sept. 30. 
Fillies and mares are in the spotlight Sunday in the $50,000-added E. B. 
Johnston Stakes. 
Two added-money events for quarter horses also are slated. 
On Saturday, 3-year-olds meet in the $12,500-added Call Caleb Stakes, honoring 
the track record-holder at 870 yards. The $15,000-added Express Stakes on 
Sunday pits 3-year-olds and upward at 350 yards.
