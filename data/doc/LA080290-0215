DRIVER DIES WHEN TRUCK OVERTURNS 
A Van Nuys woman was killed Wednesday morning when her pickup truck overturned 
on a curve on Laurel Canyon Road in Studio City, Los Angeles police said. 
Sandra Jean Ettinger, 20, who had recently moved to Van Nuys from Arizona, died 
instantly in the 5:20 a.m. accident on the winding canyon road about half a 
mile north of Mulholland Drive, Officer Leona Thomas said. 
Police said Ettinger apparently lost control of the vehicle while driving at an 
unsafe speed on a curve. 
The pickup overturned and ejected her. It overturned several more times and hit 
a concrete block in front of a house. 
The accident closed two of the four lanes during the morning rush hour. 
Southbound traffic was backed up two miles to Ventura Boulevard.
