FT  26 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Allianz lifts Germany in dull
European trade
THE ABSENCE of UK and US investors was expected to quieten bourses
yesterday, and in most cases this happened. However, an outstanding UK order
for Allianz, the German insurer, was credited with bringing the Frankfurt
market round from an early loss to close at a new 21-month high, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT slid early in session, but selling pressure fell away as the
Allianz order took the insurer's shares up DM30.50, dragging other blue
chips and the 30-share DAX index up along with it.
After a 2.98 rise to 725.01 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed
8.61 better at 1,811.57. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt
reckoned that without the foreign holidays, the German market would have
maintained a faster climb.
As it was, a number of internationals were held back, Deutsche Bank rising
by only DM1.40 to DM715 - going ex-dividend last Friday did not help -
Daimler by just DM1 to DM813 and the big three chemicals stocks all posting
small declines.
On the credit side, Commerzbank added DM4.60 to DM273.30 on favourable
comment in a German Sunday newspaper, Volkswagen came back from
profit-taking to rise DM4.60 to DM408.60 and Continental, the tyremaker, put
on DM4.80 to DM277.50 on a magazine report that the state of Lower Saxony
had put together a friendly buying team to take over the interests of
Pirelli SpA, Conti's former suitor, and its friends.
MILAN was politically motivated all day, nervous in the morning after the
murder at the weekend of the Mafia-fighting judge, Mr Giovanni Falcone, but
lifted by a late rally on signs of a breakthrough in Italy's political
impasse over the choice of a new president.
The MIB index closed 0.3 per cent higher at 978. Holding companies took the
share price limelight, Cir rising L34 to L1,789, Ferruzzi Finanziaria by L49
to L1,821 and Ifi by L415 to L13,425.
PARIS finished barely changed in dull trade. The CAC-40 index gained 1.13 to
2,046.25 in turnover of some FFr1.3bn. Oil stocks were one of the day's
features following the Opec agreement on Friday. Elf rose FFr2.90 to
FFr396.90 while Total added FFr2.50 to FFr262.50.
LVMH rose FFr7 to FFr4,195 after noting that although recovery had been
tardy in coming to Europe the slowdown in Japan, an important market for the
luxury goods group, was likely to be of limited duration.
ZURICH ended a touch firmer, with the all-share SPI index rising 4.5 to
1,203.0. Certificates in the pharmaceutical group, Roche, topped the active
list as they rose SFr50 to SFr3,410.
AMSTERDAM saw limited interest as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 131.0.
There was scattered buying of some blue chip stocks including Royal Dutch,
which rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 154.40 following the Opec outcome last week.
Elsevier's recent strong rally continued, up Fl 1.40 at Fl 115.20. Buehrmann
Tetterode was also active on buy notes, closing up Fl 1.00 at Fl 53.50.
BRUSSELS ended slightly lower in thin trading. The Bel-20 Index shed 0.41 to
1,215.27 in turnover of BFr644m. Electrabel eased BFr25 to BFr4,600 in
volume of 42,850 shares while Delhaize lost BFr50 to BFr9,000. Elsewhere,
Petrofina fell BFr25 to BFr10,850.
COPENHAGEN was dominated by Hafnia which announced a three-for-two rights
issue at DKr105 a share. The insurer's B shares lost DKr9 to DKr160 in low
volume. The all share index closed up 0.45 to 336.80.
ISTANBUL closed at a six-month low on renewed concern about a fresh round of
interest rate rises. The index shed 176.44 or more than 5 per cent to
3,310.29 in turnover of TL115bn from TL128bn.
VIENNA closed firmer in light volume. The ATX index gained 6.47 to 984.79.
OMV rose Sch6 to Sch898 after reporting better-than-expected first quarter
results.
MADRID's general index ended down 1.06 at 258.70.
