FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba expects improved
efficiency to yield bigger sugar harvest
The Cuban government is forecasting sugar production from the 1993-94
harvest at 'several hundred thousand tonnes' more than the 4.15m tonnes
produced in the last harvest, which was 40 per cent down on 1991-92.
President Fidel Castro and Mr Nelson Torres, the sugar minister, told a
session of the National Assembly in Havana that the expectations of a better
performance were based on increased use of fertiliser and improved
efficiency in the industry.
The forecast is more optimistic than that made in September when Mr Torres
indicated modest government expectations for the current harvest. He said
then that the harvest would end in April, earlier than normal, to allow the
planting of more cane for future harvests.
