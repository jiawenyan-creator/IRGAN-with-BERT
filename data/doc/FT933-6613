FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Earnings hit ADollars 67.2m at
John Fairfax
JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper group, reports a net profit for the
year to June of ADollars 67.2m, (USDollars 45.4m), its first as a stock
market listed entity.
The company, which has operated in its current form since coming out of
receivership in late 1991, lifted revenue by 5.6 per cent to ADollars 770.1m
and has declared a maiden dividend of 4.5 cents a share.
Net earnings, as stated under Australian stock exchange rules, more than
quadrupled from ADollars 15.4m, but the directors warn the comparison is not
meaningful because of the high level of debt in the previous period.
That debt was restructured when the present company was created,
substantially reducing interest expense. The directors say earnings before
interest and tax - up 30.4 per cent to ADollars 168.0m - make a better
comparison.
The higher revenue was derived from an increase of ADollars 28.1m in
advertising and a ADollars 14.6m rise in circulation.
Fairfax, in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger group has a 25 per cent stake,
publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne's The Age newspaper and the
national Australian Financial Review.
