EARNINGS 
Rykoff-Sexton Inc.: The restaurant and institutional food supply company said 
net income for fiscal 1990 ended April 28 totaled $11.3 million, down 45% from 
the $20.6 million reported a year earlier. Sales rose 8% to $1.4 billion. The 
Los Angeles firm had predicted reduced earnings because of lower-than-expected 
sales increases, delays in cost-reduction efforts and a $2-million pretax 
charge related to bad debt and employee health-care benefits.
