  [Abstract]An algorithm is examined for adaptive control of 
a multidimensional linear stochastic plant. This algorithm is 
based on the usage of recurrent estimates of stochastic 
approximations with weighted averaging. Of primary interest was 
the speed with which the quality criterion converges with the 
optimal operating mode for a closed system. It is shown that the 
usage of a stochastic approximation algorithm with weighted 
averaging allows the maximum possible convergence speed to be 
achieved, if the necessary a priori information is available. 
The objective of control is to minimize threshold values of the 
output signal second moment, which is time averaged. The 
asymptotic properties in the sequence of estimates and average 
losses are researched. Conditions are established for asymptotic 
efficiency of the control algorithm. 29 references.
