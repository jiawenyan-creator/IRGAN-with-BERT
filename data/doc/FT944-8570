FT  19 NOV 94 / Japan's monetary growth weak
The growth in Japan's money supply continues to be weak, constrained by the
decline in bank lending, weak corporate demand for funds and a firm monetary
policy. M2, or cash in circulation and bank deposits, plus certificates of
deposit, grew by a mere 2.4 per cent last month, by comparison with October
last year, the Bank of Japan announced yesterday. That represents a very
slight increase on 2.3 per cent money supply growth in September. The
weakness of monetary growth contrasts with previous recoveries, when an
increase in domestic demand coincided with a robust rise in liquidity.
