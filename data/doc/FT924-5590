FT  26 NOV 92 / Indian protest attracts 250,000
A march organised by eight trade unions to the Indian parliament yesterday
drew an estimated 250,000 supporters protesting against the 'disastrous
economic policies' of the government, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Industrial workers and agricultural labourers who had travelled to the
capital shouted slogans demanding a self-reliant economy, trade union rights
and higher wages for the unorganised sector.
