  [Text] President Ange Felix Patasse left Bangui early this 
afternoon for Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, to attend the 
summit of heads of state of the Customs and Economic Union of 
Central Africa [UDEAC]. Prior to his departure, President 
Patasse stated in an interview granted our colleague Pedinguere 
Ouporo that Central Africa is ill and that the Ndjamena summit 
(?will strive) to remedy the situation. Let us listen to him: 
  [Begin Patasse recording] This Ndjamena meeting is crucial 
for the subregion. Apart from the problems confronting the Bank 
of Central African States, there is also that of [words 
indistinct], and we have to make decisions concerning the UDEAC 
too. Another issue is the creation of an economic and monetary 
community in Central Africa. I cannot tell the other countries 
the prospects ahead of us, but as I told you, the Central 
African subregion is ill. The subregion needs to wake up the 
UDEAC. I think we may face some disappointments in Ndjamena. 
But we are also anxious to know whether we will overcome our 
nationalistic tendencies and make way for true subregional 
integration. Achieving this objective will enable our 
respective peoples to realize that actually their future depends 
on integration and not on nationalism which has hampered our 
progress so far. [end recording] 
  In another interview, President Patasse strongly denounced 
all acts that might disturb the established law and order. He 
also stated that the Central African people, who bitterly 
suffered from injustice, torture, and underhanded dealings, have 
sovereignly decided to establish a lasting democratic state that 
can help all Central Africans participate in the management of 
public affairs. In conclusion, he severely warned the advocates 
of violence and called on the people to be extra vigilant to 
block the way to those yearning for past inhumane atrocities 
they underwent under previous regimes.
