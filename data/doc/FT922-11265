FT  27 APR 92 / Outram mbo team outbids Pearson
A MANAGEMENT buy-out team at George Outram, publisher of the Glasgow-based
Herald and Evening Times, looks as if it has outbid Pearson, the publishing
and industrial group, by offering Pounds 75m in the battle for the company.
Mr Tiny Rowland's Lonrho group is believed to have given the team, led by Mr
Liam Kane, managing director, an exclusive option until the end of this
month.
The management team is backed by Scottish financial institutions including
the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Robert Fleming, the London merchant bank.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, bid around Pounds 70m.
The planned sale is part of a campaign by Lonrho to reduce debt. It follows
the disposal of Lonrho's Scottish weekly newspapers in a Pounds 45m deal to
Trinity International, publisher of the Liverpool Post and Echo.
Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson group managing director, declined to comment on the
Outram deal yesterday. However, Pearson has a record of not getting involved
in acquisition auctions so an increased bid is unlikely. It will probably
become involved again only if the mbo fails.
Because an mbo deal would not be a concentration of ownership it would not
have to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, thereby
speeding up the disposal.
A return to Scottish ownership will also fit in with the present
devolutionary mood among many Scots.
