FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley sees 1992 income
up 7%
MORGAN Stanley, the New York investment bank, yesterday reported a 7 per
cent increase in net income for both the fourth quarter and 1992 as a whole.
Net income in the fourth quarter to January 31 totalled Dollars 141.8m, or
Dollars 1.68 a share, on revenues of Dollars 695.6m, compared with Dollars
132.3m, or Dollars 1.61 a share, in the quarter to the end of December 1991,
when revenues totalled Dollars 716.6m.
At a pre-tax level, income dipped from Dollars 206m to Dollars 194.8m, but
the net figure was helped by a sharply lower provision for tax (Dollars
52.9m, against Dollars 73.6m), due mainly to lower derivatives revenues from
Tokyo.
Investment banking revenues dipped from Dollars 252.3m in the 1991 quarter
to Dollars 227.9m, while trading revenues dropped from Dollars 246.3m to
Dollars 155.9m.
Revenues from investments rose from Dollars 14.3m to Dollars 33.7m, and
commissions were up from Dollars 73.9m to Dollars 81.7m. Interest and
dividends rose from Dollars 1.15bn to Dollars 1.24bn, while interest expense
was up from Dollars 1.07bn to Dollars 1.1bn.
Expenses excluding interest were held to Dollars 500.8m, down from Dollars
510.6m.
For the full year, Morgan Stanley reported net income of Dollars 510.5m, or
Dollars 5.90 a share, compared with Dollars 475.1m, or Dollars 5.93 a share,
in 1991. Net revenues were Dollars 3.02bn, as against Dollars 2.86bn.
Mr Richard Fisher, the chairman, and Mr Robert Greenhill, president, said
investment banking revenues continued to improve during 1992, with increased
debt and equity underwriting volumes offsetting weakness in financial
advisory services.
Secondary revenues - trading, commissions and net interest - declined 7 per
cent, with record results in foreign exchange offset by declines in equity
derivatives and commodities.
