FT  12 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Foundation work for Cementation
CEMENTATION PILING &amp; FOUNDATIONS, part of Trafalgar House Construction, has
recently commenced work on new projects valued at Pounds 4.3m.
The company has won the enabling works contract for the Royal Mail's
Bournemouth mechanised letter office. Work on the site includes constructing
803 driven cast in situ piles to support the main structure and ground
improvement using Cementation's patented Cemcol process to create 1,000
stone columns.
In Manchester a Soilmec rig is being used to construct CFA piles to a depth
of 12 metres and loadbearing capacity of between 1350kN and 3200kN for an
indoor gymnastic arena.
The project is part of the first phase of a Pounds 200m redevelopment of the
Victoria Station site, as part of the city's bid to host the 2000 Olympic
games.
