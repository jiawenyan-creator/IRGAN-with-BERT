  [Text] Bangui, 13 Jan (AFP) -- Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Mandaba of the Central African Republic announced here today the 
institution of price control measures in his country to "cushion 
the shock" of the 50-percent CFA franc devaluation. Speaking 
before the National Assembly, the prime minister also announced 
the setting up of a devaluation backup measures monitoring 
committee. 
  The government is studying backup measures needed to ensure 
the success of the devaluation and to safeguard the "fundamental 
interests of the business community and the people," he added. 
Mr. Mandaba believed that the "spin-off effects of the 
devaluation for his country's economy will be positive in the 
long run.... Public finance in particular is expected to be 
consolidated due to an expected increase in fiscal revenue." 
According to the prime minister, the expected increase in 
revenue will enable the state "to pay at least part of its 
internal arrears, especially to civil servants." 
  "We are expecting a recovery of our external finance, which 
we need, to beef up our investment recovery policy," he 
continued, judging -- without explaining -- that the country's 
gross domestic product "is expected to increase faster than 
forecast, by about 4 percent."
