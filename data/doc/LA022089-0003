Colombia's leftist Patriotic Union party, in what was seen as a significant 
policy change, called on rebel groups to end guerrilla activities and make 
concrete peace proposals. The government insists that it will only open talks 
with the rebels once they prove they are serious about seeking peace, but the 
Patriotic Union and other opposition parties want talks without prior 
conditions. Party President Bernardo Jaramillo said: "The guerrillas must 
realize that it is not possible to achieve a military triumph in this country. 
The only solution to Colombia's violence is to negotiate away from arrogant 
positions and offer concessions."
