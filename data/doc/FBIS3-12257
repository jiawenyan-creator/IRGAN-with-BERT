  [Text] Tunis, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Between 20 to 30 Jewish 
settlers led by an Israeli army captain carried out Friday's [25 
February] massacre at the Hebron mosque, official PLO spokesman 
Yasir 'Abd-al-Rabbuh said. 
  'Abd-al-Rabbuh rejected Israel's "lying version" which said 
a 
lone gunman, Baruk Goldstein, shot dead 53 Palestinians at the 
West Bank mosque during dawn prayers. 
  "The PLO blames the Israeli government and its army for this 
crime," 'Abd-al-Rabbuh said at a press conference here. 
  'Aziz al-Hashmami, aged 40, told AFP he was inside the Tomb 
of the Patriarchs when the shooting started and said that "four 
to five" gunmen had opened fire as the Palestinian knelt in 
prayer. 
  'Abd-al-Rabbuh said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
telephoned PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat to apologise for the attack. 
  The PLO declared three days of mourning and a general strike 
in the occupied territories after the massacre of more than 40 
Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
  The PLO denounced the shooting as "criminal slaughter" and 
said the Israeli government was responsible, a PLO statement 
said earlier. 
  The international community, including the co-sponsors of 
the 
peace process Russia and the United States, should act to "put 
an end to such massacres." 
  It repeated PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's call for 
"international protection" for the Palestinians in the 
territories. 
  The PLO is currently trying to clinch a deal with Israel on 
launching Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
