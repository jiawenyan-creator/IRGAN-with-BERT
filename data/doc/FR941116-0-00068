 

The Commission rejects the above arguments as collateral attacks on Order No. 561. ARCO recognized that the present
rule merely implements that regulation when it stated that ``the Commission has indicated in Order No. 561A
that it intends to proceed on the basis that it has this power'' to prevent an oil pipeline from putting into effect a
market-based rate until the Commission concludes that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant
markets.

 Nonetheless, the Commission sees no merit in the above arguments.

The indexing method sets the maximum lawful rate subject to exceptions which must be proven. For purposes of analyzing
the legal issues presented, the Commission must assume that market-based rates would be higher than indexed rates
because an oil pipeline is free to file for rates under the index without justification. Hence, an oil pipeline must
show that it is entitled to an exception to charge more than the index would permit. In this context, the application
is in essence a request for waiver of the maximum rate. Such a moratorium on filings for market-based rates (except
under the application process) comports with the Commission's power to restrict filings of proposed rates higher
than those determined by the Commission to be just and reasonable.

Cf.,

 Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 780 (1968). (``The Commission may under Sections 5 and 16 [of the Natural
Gas Act] restrict filings under Section 4(d) of proposed rates higher than those determined by the Commission to be
just and reasonable.'') 
</FOOTNOTE>


It is true that this treatment of market-based rates differs from the Commission's approach to filings by oil pipelines
for cost-based rates. However, the difference is justified. It is appropriate to take the present action with respect
to market-based rates for oil pipelines in order to ensure that presumed market forces will not be the basis of effective
rates for the transportation of oil when an oil pipeline's application (

i.e., 

its waiver request) is under consideration.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission cannot permit market-based rates without an affirmative showing that the oil pipeline lacks significant
market power in the relevant markets.

 With respect to the AOPL's contention about gas storage rates, the Commission notes that those cases were considered
mostly in certificate proceedings. While Koch Gateway Pipeline Company's proceeding was a rate filing, it involved
the continuation of an experimental program that had been previously approved as part of a settlement. 66 FERC 61,385
(1994). In addition, oil pipeline market cases have been lengthy and have gone beyond the statutory suspension period.
</FOOTNOTE>


Because the Commission is taking the approach that an oil pipeline must file an application for market-based rates,
Marathon's reliance on Section 6(3) of the ICA is misplaced. Simply put, there is no rate investigation. Rather, the
investigation is into whether the oil pipeline possesses significant market power in the relevant markets. 
The AOPL also maintains that the Commission is not authorized by the ICA to adopt market-power filing requirements.
It argues that, under Section 6(3) of the ICA, an oil pipeline seeking to change its rates need only file a notice of proposed
change with the Commission, and that the Commission's authority under that action is limited to rules and regulations
for the ``simplification'' of schedules.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The AOPL adds that the ICA does not require the submission of material in justification of a proposed rate change unless
and until that rate change is set for hearing. It asserts that the oil pipeline's statutory burden of proof under Section
15(7) of the ICA does not attach until the matter is set for hearing.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The AOPL last maintains that the Commission's characterization of the market power application as a nonrate filing
does not cure the statutory shortcoming because if it is not a rate filing there is no statutory basis for the application.
It further maintains that, in any event, the characterization is wrong as shown by the caption of this proceeding and
the collection of information form (FERC 550 ``Oil Pipeline Rates_Tariff Filings'').

Section 15(7) provides in pertinent part: 
At any hearing involving a change in a rate, fare, charge, or classification, or in a rule, regulation, or practice,
the burden of proof shall be upon the carrier to show that the proposed changed rate, fare, charge, classification,
rule, regulation, or practice is just and reasonable, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of
such questions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.

</FOOTNOTE>


As discussed in the order in 

Cost-of-Service Filing and Reporting Requirements for Oil Pipelines, 

issued contemporaneously with this rule, the Commission has the authority to adopt filing requirements beyond the
mere form of notices and schedules. The Commission may require information upon which to determine how to act on a filing.
In any event, as discussed above, the Commission views the application required here as in essence a waiver request,
which will enable the Commission to make the required affirmative finding that the oil pipeline lacks significant
market power in the relevant markets before it permits market-based rates as an exception to the indexing approach.
Nothing in the ICA prevents the Commission from setting forth the requirements of a waiver request, including placing
the burden of proof on the person seeking the waiver. Even if the application is a rate change under Section 15(7), the
Commission is not compelled to hold a hearing, but if it does hold a hearing, the hearing may be resolved on the written
record. The required application simply starts the hearing process and the statutory burden of proof would affix.

 With respect to the AOPL's arguments about the caption to this proceeding, it merely reflects the end result of the
process_market-based rates. Further, the form for the collection of information merely recognizes the end-result_oil
pipeline rates and, in any event, is purely ministerial.

The AOPL maintains that the scope of discovery is limited under the Commission's rules of practice and procedure (18
CFR 385.402(a)) to issues set for hearing. It submits that the Commission will put the ``procedural cart before the
horse by requiring production of discovery_related information before the scope of contested issues has been established.''

the requirements for a waiver as the first stage of the investigation.
