  [Text] Moscow February 5 TASS -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard described the results of his first official 
visit to Russia as "positive." 
  Speaking at a briefing at Moscow's Balchug Hotel on Saturday 
[5 February], Leotard said that during his four-day official 
visit he met with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, 
Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov and other officials to 
discuss the problems facing Russia, including conflict 
settlement and peace-keeping operations. 
  The French defence minister said the main results of the 
visit was the signing of the Russian-French inter-governmental 
agreements on defence, military and technical cooperation. 
  Speaking about the content of these documents, Leotard 
stressed that they are designed to develop the ideas which had 
been discussed during the visits to France by First Vice-Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets, First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev last autumn. 
  The talks which focused mostly on the conversion of the 
Russian defence industry resulted in a package of Russian-French 
agreements on cooperation to dismantle nuclear weapons in Russia 
and increase the safety of their transportation. 
  Leotard believes the key to peace lies in friendship and 
cooperation between France and Russia. He stressed the need to 
exert every possible effort to strengthen these ties of trust. 
  According to Leotard, Russia is the country which is seeking 
a path to democracy and trying to bring its Armed Forces under 
political control. This corresponds to France's own values, he 
concluded.
