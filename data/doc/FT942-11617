FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Polyester plant aid 'must be repaid'
The European Commission yesterday ordered that AlliedSignal Fibers the
advanced technology company, repay part of a French aid package donated
towards an industrial polyester fibre plant in eastern France.
It said that about FFr26.3m (Pounds 3.1m) of a total FFr200m aid package
awarded by the French government could not be paid because it broke the
European Union regulations on aid to the synthetic fibres industry.
The Commission, which has the authority to clear or block state aid within
the EU if it concludes that competition is harmed as a result, ordered that
part of the amount already paid should be returned with interest. This
figure amounts to roughly FFr621,000.
Allied Signal Fibers said it regretted the decision and would consider an
appeal.
'We believe we have taken all reasonable steps to verify that the subsidies
offered by the authorities were compatible with the commission rules,' said
a spokesman.
Allied Signal chose to locate its plant in the Pole Europeen de Developpment
 -an area straddling Belgium, France and Luxembourg which benefits from the
EU's regional fund.
The Commission also announced yesterday that it had started an inquiry into
an unspecified amount of aid that the Belgian government was planning to
give to another synthetic-fibre producer in Belgium, BVBA DS Profil of
Dendermonde.
