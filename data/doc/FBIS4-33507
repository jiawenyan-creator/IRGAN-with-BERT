  [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Border Guards 
Unit refrained from attacking a vessel on which 61 persons fled 
the island last weekend, a government source said today. 
  The guards, who had sighted minors aboard, limited 
themselves 
to escorting the vessel until it had left Cuban jurisdictional 
waters. 
  The U.S. Coast Guard rescued the vessel on Saturday in 
international waters off the Florida Keys; there were seven 
wounded aboard. The Cuban Foreign Ministry refused to comment 
on the incident.
