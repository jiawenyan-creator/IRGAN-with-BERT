Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Temporary Suspension of Certain Reserve Tonnage Pricing Provisions

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule temporarily suspends a sentence in 989.67(j) of the California raisin marketing order dealing
with the pricing of reserve raisins offered to handlers for free use. The industry is faced with a large supply of Zante
Currant raisins. The suspension will only apply to 199495 reserve Zante Currants so that the value of a portion
of the free tonnage inventory held by handlers on July 31, 1994, can be adjusted downward toward current market price
levels. This adjustment is necessary to help the industry become price competitive and to aid it in marketing Zante
Currants. This action was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is
responsible for local administration of the order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989] (order), regulating the handling of
raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule will allow the Committee
to implement an inventory price adjustment program for Zante Currents during the 199495 crop year, which began
August 1, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the order, and approximately
5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and a majority of producers of California
raisins may be classified as small entities. 
Under the order, seasonal volume regulations can be established. The free percentages prescribe the portion of the
crop that can be shipped at any time to any market. The reserve percentages prescribe the portion of the crop that must
be held for delayed shipment. Reserve raisins are held in a reserve pool by handlers for the account of the Committee.
Funds generated from the sale of reserve pool raisins are distributed equally to equity holders (growers). 
This final rule will suspend the penultimate sentence in 989.67(j) of the order for the 199495 crop year.
That sentence provides that: ``However, such raisins shall not be sold at a price below that which the committee concludes
reflects the average price received by producers for free tonnage of the same varietal type purchased by handlers
during the current crop year up to the time of any offer for sale of reserve tonnage by the committee, to which shall be
added the costs to the equity holders incurred by the committee on account of receiving, inspecting, storing, fumigating,
insuring, and holding of said raisins, and including costs of taxes and interest: 

Provided, 

That, where the outlook for the next crop year or other factors have caused a downward trend in the prices received by
producers for free tonnage raisins or in the prices received by handlers for free tonnage packed raisins, reserve
tonnage may be sold to handlers at the currently prevailing or the approximate computed field price for free tonnage
raisins, as determined by the committee.'' 
Limited volumes of Zante Currants are produced in California. The 199394 California production of Zante Currants
was 5,643 tons, which is 32 percent larger than the prior four-year average of 4,279 tons. The estimated 199495
production is greater than 6,500 tons or over 50 percent more than the 198992 four-year average. It is anticipated
that the production of Zante Currants will continue to increase in the next one to three years as newly planted acreage
begins to produce and/or reach full production. 
Greece is the major producer of currants, generally representing at least 85 percent of the annual world production
of such raisins. In 199293, Greek currants were in short supply and prices rose sharply. As a result, the market
for California Zante Currants strengthened significantly and the grower price increased to $1,600 from $1,365 per
ton the previous season. In 199394, the grower price for California Zante Currants was $1,200 per ton. The 199394
Greek currant crop was approximately 50,000 tons, of excellent quality, and prices were very competitive with those
quoted for California Zante Currants. This resulted in a significant drop in California Zante Currant shipments
here and abroad.
