NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM CANCELS GALA FOR OPENING OF CHINA EXHIBIT 
The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural history has canceled a gala party 
originally scheduled for Friday night's opening of a new exhibit of fossils 
from China, billed as the most comprehensive such display ever shown outside of 
Asia. 
But the exhibit, "From the Land of Dragons," will open Saturday for its 
full-scheduled run through Oct. 15, the museum said. 
Craig Black, the museum's director, said the party was canceled "in light of 
the events in China and the loss of life there." Black said the fossil exhibit 
is part of an ongoing museum exchange with China. 
The museum said the future of the exchange program has been cast in doubt by 
the current crisis in China. Black said he ordered the party canceled because 
he was "saddened and shocked by the action of the Chinese government taken 
against its students and peaceful demonstrators in Beijing and elsewhere." 
The exhibit will include fossils of dinosaurs and flying reptiles. It includes 
42 specimens, of both carnivorous and plant-eating species. 
The exhibit was accompanied by four Chinese scholars from the Beijing Institute 
of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. The four are installing the 
displays in the Exposition Park museum. The Natural History Museum said the 
four would remain in Los Angeles until June 18, as scheduled.
