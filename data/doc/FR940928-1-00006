</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 12, 1993 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate
the San Francisco Bay Area ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment. The ozone nonattainment area
includes the following counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano
(part), and Sonoma (part). Under the Clean Air Act, nonattainment areas may be redesignated to attainment if sufficient
data are available to warrant the redesignation and the area meets the other Clean Air Act redesignation requirements.



In today's action, EPA is proposing to approve the State of California's submittal because it meets the maintenance
plan and redesignation requirements. In addition, EPA is proposing to approve the nitrogen oxides (NO

x

) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) exemption petition submitted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District (BAAQMD) on April 15, 1994 under section 182(f). Finally, EPA is proposing to expedite the approval of the
annual and peak season 1990 inventory of actual ozone precursor emissions required by section 182(a)(1) by parallel
processing the emissions inventory.
