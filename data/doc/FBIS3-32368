<F P=106> [Statement by Miguel Angel Rodriguez, Costa Rican Social </F>
Christian Unity, PUSC, presidential candidate, in the Corobici 
Hotel in San Jose -- live] 
  [Text] I do not want to make the people wait any longer for 
this statement. All I was waiting for was the chance to have a 
personal communication to wish [Figueres] the greatest success. 
  The goal of this entire campaign has been a [words 
indistinct] [applause] and this continues to be our [words 
indistinct]. I wish every success for the new government in the 
coming four years because it has to do with the well-being of 
Costa Ricans. I wish and pray to God [words indistinct] our 
goal is that every Costa Rican should have greater well-being 
[words indistinct]. This continues to be [words indistinct]. I 
therefore pray to God and all Costa Ricans that we rally around 
the national flag and help this country come out ahead in the 
best possible way. Our goal is that all of you should enjoy the 
best possible standard of living. [applause] 
  I want to thank you first of all; you, the people who paid 
me 
the great honor of voting for me and those who did not vote for 
me. I thank you all. For many months you allowed me the 
privilege of walking these streets [words indistinct]. I 
received the affection of those who support and supported me. 
[Words indistinct] I thank all of you. [applause] 
  What is there to say about the leaders of this extraordinary 
party? They all gave me their heartfelt support [words 
indistinct] when it seemed as if there was not the slightest 
chance for this campaign to achieve as important results as we 
have received. When the going got tough, they supported me, 
they gave me their dreams, hopes, we shared pains [words 
indistinct]. For all of you I [words indistinct]. [applause] 
  Those who lead the campaign, those who worked in the cantons 
or in the neighboring circuit districts [passage indistinct]. 
For all of you my sincerest appreciation. I am sure the 
fatherland and God will appreciate this. This campaign is a 
campaign of [word indistinct]. It is a campaign of great 
ideals, a campaign that has called for us to be better, a 
campaign that has called on us to act in solidarity with others. 
This has been a campaign that asks us to (?follow the good 
example of the great Costa Rican institutions). [applause] 
  I am convinced that all of us who supported this great 
campaign have not done so in vain because today many Costa 
Ricans understand better the need to work for their own 
improvement and the [words indistinct]. This has made the 
campaign worth it. 
  There are so many people I should mention, but I will not 
mention them because I would always run the risk of leaving 
someone's name out. I would like to mention one person. I want 
to shower on this person all the affection, all the gratitude, 
all the emotion that I feel for all the people in this marvelous 
country. I want to thank all of you through my wife Lorena. 
[applause] 
  Lorena has been an extraordinary companion. She went much 
further than what seemed physically possible for a human being. 
The endless work, the toughest tasks, the greatest affection 
for all party leaders. My office became, during the difficult 
moments, the living room where practically everyone sought 
advice, consolation, and encouragement. She is the reflection 
of our belief in women's struggle; she is the reflection of our 
endearment for all Costa Ricans. In her I see the work of my 
children, my relatives, the work by the campaign directors, work 
by canton leaders, the work of those who were in the schools 
today, the work of those in charge of transportation, the work 
of those who acted as receptionists and guides throughout the 
country; the work of all Social Christians and all Costa Ricans. 
[applause] When I give Lorena a big kiss to thank her for her 
dedication I am thanking all Costa Ricans. 
  The country must continue united toward progress. We have 
accomplished a great task. I hope that President-elect Mr. Jose 
Maria Figueres Olsen chooses the best group, that he will go 
down the path of good, have the wisdom to distinguish what is 
good for Costa Rica and what is good (?for the people) who 
require our government's support and solidarity. I wish all 
Costa Ricans to join us tonight to pray to God to bless Costa 
Rica. God bless Costa Rica! [applause]
