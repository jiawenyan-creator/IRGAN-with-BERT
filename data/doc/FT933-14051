FT  16 JUL 93 / Troops on standby in Islamabad
PARAMILITARY troops were on standby in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
yesterday, as the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif prepared for a
'long march' by the opposition today which is aimed at forcing him to call
fresh elections, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
At least 60 police trucks and buses carrying riot policemen wearing helmets
and armed with tear gas and batons, drove past the parliament building in a
show of force.
Some officials said the government had plans to erect a barbed wire fence
around the city as part of its preparations.
Troops were also on standby near the city, ready to be called to protect
important government buildings and diplomatic missions, officials added.
The security build-up appeared to have dashed the few remaining hopes that
Mr Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, could avert today's
expected government-opposition clash.
Although Mr Sharif has become increasingly willing to hold early elections,
he is demanding that President Ghulam Ishaq Khan must first step down before
his term of office ends in November.
However, Mr Khan and many of his supporters, including opposition leaders,
do not want to wait beyond October.
