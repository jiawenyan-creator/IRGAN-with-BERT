FT  19 JUL 94 / UK companies pay bills latest
British companies pay their bills later than anyone else in Europe, and most
of the late payment is deliberate, according to a survey commissioned by
Intrum Justitia, Europe's largest debt collector. It polled just over 4,000
European companies, and found that payments in Britain are on average 23
days late, compared with a European average of 14 days. Some 54 per cent of
late payment by British companies was intentional, whereas the most common
reason for paying late in the rest of Europe was financial difficulty. 'The
British clearly pay as late as possible, probably because, with little
effective legislation to stop them, they know they can get away with it,'
Intrum Justitia said. The British government has recently come down against
legislating on late payment, but Intrum Justitia found that 88 per cent of
companies in the UK favoured the idea of a statutory right to interest on
overdue money all across Europe. A large majority also wanted the right to
compensation for the costs involved in chasing debts, as well as simpler
legal procedures.
