FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Apple and Dell slash prices by
over 30%
PERSONAL computer prices continue to tumble in the US as manufacturers
compete fiercely for a larger share of the slow-growth market. Two leading
manufacturers yesterday announced price cuts of over 30 per cent.
Apple Computer cut US prices for several of its Macintosh models by up to 36
per cent. The company is expected to introduce new models later in the year,
and analysts suggested the cuts were designed to clear inventories.
Apple said the price reductions would allow it to continue the momentum of
its aggressive strategy to build market share, launched a year ago when it
sharply cut its prices.
The company said that last year it had increased Macintosh unit shipments by
more than 60 per cent and net sales by 14 per cent.
The current price reductions cover most of Apple's Macintosh product family,
with the exception of the highest performance models and the new portable
Macintosh PowerBook 140 and 170 models.
Dell Computer also slashed prices by up to 38 per cent across its full line
of portable, desktop and floor-standing personal computers.
Dell has brought considerable competitive pressure to bear upon market
leaders, including International Business Machines and Compaq Computer, with
its direct sales marketing strategy and lower prices.
Recently, however, its prices have been undercut by a myriad of 'clone'
builders offering similar systems at even lower prices through discount
computer 'superstores' in the US.
Dell's new price reductions would make it even more difficult for companies
such as Compaq to compete in the US personal computer market, analysts said.
