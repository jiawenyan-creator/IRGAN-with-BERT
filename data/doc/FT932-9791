FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BM banking facilities extended
BM Group, the construction equipment concern, has successfully negotiated
continued financing facilities with its 10 banks for an initial period to
June 6.
Talks on securing longer term funding are proceeding but it is thought
unlikely there will be an agreement by the end of the period, requiring an
extension of the arrangements.
The company is working on a survival plan expected to cost about Pounds 42m
in redundancies, closures, disposals and write-offs.
