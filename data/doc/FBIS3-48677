  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- The government is not yet 
considering changing the date of the meeting between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
slated for February 11, a top Finance Ministry official said 
Thursday [27 January]. But the official also said if the 
cabinet resigns en masse following possible failure to enact 
political reform bills in the Diet, "the summit meeting will be 
canceled." 
  "Depending on the timing and manner of resignation, the 
schedule (for the meeting) will be altered," the official said. 
  Hosokawa, who staked his job on enacting the bills before 
the 
current Diet session ends on Saturday, could come under 
political pressure to resign or call an election if the 
government's bills are abandoned, political analysts said.
