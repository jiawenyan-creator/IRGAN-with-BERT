FT  09 DEC 94 / Firm start for SGS Thomson's IPO launch
SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer,
yesterday launched an initial public offer of 21m shares in the Paris and
New York stock markets, which could eventually raise more than Dollars 470m
(Pounds 286m) for expansion.
The shares began trading in Paris yesterday at a slight premium to the
French offer price of FFr119.95. In New York, the price was set at Dollars
22.25 per share, the upper end of a Dollars 21-Dollars 23 range set when
plans for the offer were announced last month.
The sale of some 16.3 per cent of the company's enlarged capital marks
SGS-Thomson's first move away from state control since its formation in 1987
from a merger between two loss-making, state companies, Thomson
Semiconductors of France and SGS Microelectronics of Italy.
Since then, the company has grown to challenge the world's top 10
semiconductor manufacturers. In October, the group reported net profits for
the six months to July of Dollars 166.1m, more than for the whole of the
previous financial year.
Some 18.6 per cent of the company could be sold in the offer, if
underwriters exercise their right to issue a further 3.15m shares which is
is expected to close next Thursday.
The Franco-Italian holding company which owns 95.49 per cent of the company
will reduce its stake to about 80 per cent, while Thorn EMI of the UK, will
be left with 2.8 per cent.
Morgan Stanley is acting as global coordinator of the issue.
