  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today outlined three major tasks for Russia -- building 
a genuine market economy, adhering to democracy, and keeping its 
previous role on the international scene. 
  In a live TV address at the major Ostankino TV and Radio 
Company here, the U.S. President expressed his admiration for 
Russian literature and art, its ballet and space industry. 
  He said Russia and the United States are bound to make their 
contribution to the consolidation of "the spirit of cooperation 
and partnership" throughout the world, and improvement of 
everyday life of each individual. 
  However, he stressed that Russians themselves are to make 
their own future. 
  The U.S. people and President want to be "partners and 
sincere friends" of Russia, he said. 
  On the Russian economy, the U.S. President agreed that 
transition to market economy was "painful and difficult, and 
could "disorient" Russian citizens. 
  However, he continued, Russia would have to pay more for 
being idle or trying to turn back, and state-controlled economy 
does not work in the modern world. 
  He also said the high inflation rate in Russia must be 
curbed 
and Russia needs to create a system of social guarantees for 
people affected by swift economic development. 
  The U.S. President pledged that his people will do their 
best 
to help alleviate the difficulties by making more investments in 
the country. 
  Many people gathered in the Ostankino studio to meet the 
U.S. 
President, television pictures showed.
