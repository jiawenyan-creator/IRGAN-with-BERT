FT  24 MAY 93 / Meeting on Ulster initiative
BRITISH AND IRISH min-isters will tomorrow try to dispel some of the gloom
over the prospects for talks on the political future of Northern Ireland
following last week's local elections in the province.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will discuss in Dublin with
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, how unionist and nationalist
political leaders can be persuaded to resume the negotiations which
collapsed last November.
Even before last week's local elections, which saw a better-than-expected
performance by the hardline Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, ministers from both governments were envisaging
another Anglo-Irish conference before talks would resume. Now they may
consider putting off the resumption of talks still further.
With the Reverend Ian Paisley, DUP leader, insisting his party will not
return to talks until the Irish Republic compromises on its territorial
claim to the north, the sense of political polarisation has increased.
The moderate Ulster Unionist Party, led by Mr James Molyneaux, is also
expected to be more cynical about further talks.
