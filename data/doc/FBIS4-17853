  [Text] Bonn, 28 Apr -- "We need to see how events develop, 
but the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, the 
European Union [EU], and the United Nations, could also discuss 
the Bosnian problem without the involvement of the conflicting 
parties." Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said this 
today at a news conference which was held after his consultative 
meeting with Germany's Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 
"It seems to me," he added, "that the important thing now is for 
Russia, the United States, the EU, and the UN to work out a 
coordinated approach." 
  This is necessary in order to make the conflicting parties 
in Bosnia aware that there is a reasonable alternative to war, 
and that they will not succeed in playing on differences between 
various states. "It should be clear to the conflicting sides in 
Bosnia that it is no longer possible for them to play the game 
in which one side or another puts forward deliberately 
unacceptable demands -- for instance, as regards territory. 
That will not work," Kozyrev said.
