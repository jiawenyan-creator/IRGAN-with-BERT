METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CAL STATE CAMPUS NAMES PRESIDENT 
Robert C. Detweiler, a 21-year veteran of the state's university system, was 
chosen Tuesday as the new president of Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
Detweiler, now vice president for academic affairs at Cal State San Bernardino, 
was selected over four other finalists to oversee the Carson campus. He will 
assume his new post within two months. 
"It was a close call," said William D. Campbell, vice chairman of the 
California State University Board of Trustees. "He had a lot of competition. 
But it was unanimous." 
Detweiler said his immediate goals at Dominguez Hills will be to build the 
school's enrollment and strengthen its ties to the 30 or so communities that it 
serves. Dominguez Hills currently has about 8,200 students. 
Detweiler succeeds Richard Butwell, who died after a heart attack in 1987. John 
Brownell, who has served as the school's interim president, is retiring. The 
current salary is about $95,000, though Detweiler's salary has yet to be set. 
Detweiler, 50, began his career with the state in 1968 as a history professor 
at San Diego State University. He subsequently held a variety of posts at that 
school before moving to his present job at San Bernardino in 1985.
