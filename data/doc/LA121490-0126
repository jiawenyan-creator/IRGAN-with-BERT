BASKETBALL PREVIEW 1990-91; 
GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE PREVIEW; 
GALLOWAY THE BEST PLAYER, BUT BEST TEAM A TOSSUP 
With the returns in from all precincts, it appears the voters are divided on 
which team will win the Garden Grove League boys' basketball title this season. 
Garden Grove finished 11-12 (8-6 in league) last season, but it returns two 
all-league players in guard Mark Perry and center Bob Ioja. 
"I like Garden Grove. On paper they should be the favorites," La Quinta Coach 
Jim Perry said. 
Coach Eric Hamamoto, whose Rancho Alamitos team is the defending co-champion 
with Kennedy and one of the standout squads again this year, shares Perry's 
opinion. 
"Garden Grove has to be easily considered the favorites," Hamamoto said. "When 
you return four starters and two who were all-league, I don't see how you can't 
be." 
Well, sometimes you can't when a team like Kennedy has a 6-foot-9 all-league 
center named Jermaine Galloway. 
"You've got to give it to Kennedy," Pacifica Coach Rhett Heckel said. "They've 
got the most dominating player in the league in Galloway." 
Clayton Olivier, the first-year coach at Los Amigos, agreed: "I think Kennedy 
is the team to beat because of Galloway." 
And what do Garden Grove Coach Dewey Van Cleave and Kennedy Coach John Mayberry 
think? 
"I'm not going to make any predictions we'll win league," Van Cleave said. "But 
I'll say we'll definitely qualify for CIF (Southern Section playoffs)." 
Mayberry puts his team third in league behind Garden Grove and Pacifica. 
Here's a team-by-team look: 
BOLSA GRANDE 
Coach: Tom Cardoza (third year). 
1989-90 record: 8-15, 6-8 in league. 
Returning lettermen: Three. 
Returning starters: Two. 
Top returners: Sy Sayareth (G, 5-7, Sr.); Din Le (G, 5-6, Sr.); Jim Fletcher 
(F, 6-2, Jr.). 
Top newcomers: Robert Fierro (F, 6-4, So.); Vince Mitchell (F, 6-0, Jr.); 
Marcus Wilson (C, 6-1, Sr.). 
Outlook: Sayareth, who was the sixth man last season, is off to a great start 
with 85 points in four nonleague games. He'll have to keep pumping them in for 
Bolsa Grande to be competitive in league. But getting the ball off the boards 
and into Sayareth's hands will be difficult. "Our biggest concern is our 
rebounding. We don't have the size," Cardoza said. Fierro is the hope for the 
future, but Cardoza said the lanky sophomore needs to beef up. 
GARDEN GROVE 
Coach: Dewey Van Cleave (sixth year). 
1989-90 record: 11-12, 8-6 in league. 
Returning lettermen: Five. 
Returning starters: Four. 
Top returners: Joe Aguirre (G, 5-10, Sr.); Bob Ioja (C, 6-3, Sr.); Mark Perry 
(G, 6-3, Sr.); Tim Vasser (F, 6-2, Sr.). 
Top newcomers: Cornell Archer (F, 6-0, So.); Scott Flores (G, 5-10, Jr.). 
Outlook: Van Cleave is counting on Perry and Ioja to turn the Argonauts into 
the championship club others have predicted they could be. Perry is off to a 
good start this season with 56 points in three tournament games. Archer, 
promoted from the freshman team, will start at forward, and Van Cleave said 
Aguirre has the makings of an all-league player. What can opposing teams expect 
from the Argonauts? "We'll be a running team," Van Cleave said. 
KENNEDY 
Coach: John Mayberry (14th year). 
1989-90 record: 18-7, 13-1 in league. 
Returning lettermen: Five. 
Returning starters: Two. 
Top returners: Jermaine Galloway (C, 6-9, Jr.); Rod Rosales (G, 5-10, Sr.). 
Top newcomers: Vince Church (G, 5-9, Sr.); Brian Cline (F, 6-0, Sr.); Morgan 
Murakami (G, 5-10, Jr.); Robert Weber (C, 6-4, Jr.). 
Outlook: Gone from the Fighting Irish lineup is forward Jim Barker, who last 
season carried he team with 22.6 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. Galloway is 
Kennedy's best hope to replenish the lost production. Rosales had knee surgery 
recently and probably won't be available until the second half of the season, 
if at all. "I need to find a replacement for him," said Mayberry, who reached 
200 victories at Kennedy last year and who has taken the team to the Southern 
section playoffs in 11 of his 13 seasons there. 
LA QUINTA 
Coach: Jim Perry (10th year). 
1989-90 record: 2-21, 2-12 in league. 
Returning lettermen: Five. 
Returning starters: Three. 
Top returners: Lloyd Bennett (G, 5-8, Jr.); Dusty DePree (F, 6-2, Sr.); Jon 
Ralston (F, 6-0, Jr.); Justin Sogoian (C, 6-4, Sr.); Stan Wada (G, 5-8, Sr.). 
Top newcomers: Cal Daniels (G, 5-10, Jr.); Brad Huss (C, 6-4, So.); Ryan Miller 
(F, 6-0, Sr.); Chris Puente (F, 6-0, Jr.); Li Riopelle (F, 5-10, Sr.); Chap Yam 
(G, 5-7, Jr.). 
Outlook: The once-mighty Aztecs are still in the early stages of a rebuilding 
program. Perry said an optimistic goal is a third-place finish, though fourth 
is more realistic. "Defensively we are OK," Perry said. "We try to create a 
tempo to help our offense." The points in Perry's wide-open offense should come 
from Bennett, a second-team all-league selection last year, and Sogoian. Huss, 
who led the JV squad in scoring and rebounding last year, will provide 
much-needed height. 
LOS AMIGOS 
Coach: Clayton Olivier (first year). 
1989-90 record: 1-20, 1-13 in league. 
Returning lettermen: Four. 
Returning starters: Two. 
Top returners: Eddie Benson (G, 5-10, Jr.); Chris Blythe (C, 6-7, Jr.); Andy 
Frazier (G, 6-0, Sr.); Derrick Ragsdale (F, 5-10, Sr.). 
Top newcomers: Raul Alvarado (F, 6-1, Sr.); Josh Cantu (F, 6-0, Sr.); Tim Clark 
(C, 6-6, So.); Mark Dillon (F, 6-2, So.); Brandon Douglas (C, 6-4, Sr.); Mike 
Hang (G, 5-8, Jr.). 
Outlook: Olivier, a former all-league player for the Lobos, returns to Los 
Amigos to take over a team that finished in the cellar last season. One of his 
first moves was to dismiss senior forward Andre Roberson from the squad for 
disciplinary reasons. Without Roberson (10.4 rebounds per game last season), 
the Lobos have only two returning starters -- Benson and Blythe. They will be 
complemented by Ragsdale, who has impressed Olivier with his defensive skills, 
Frazier and Alvarado, whom Olivier calls "an animal on the boards." 
PACIFICA 
Coach: Rhett Heckel (fifth year). 
1989-90 record: 12-12, 9-5 in league. 
Returning lettermen: Five. 
Returning starters: One. 
Top returners: Kevin Gaughen (F, 6-5, Sr.); Scott Lesser (F, 6-1, Sr.); Larry 
Nagata (G, 5-9, Sr.); Brian Showalter (C, 6-6, Sr.). 
Top newcomers: Don Choi (G, 6-0, Sr.); Brian Hachiwa (G, 5-7, Sr.); Tim Rouleau 
(G, 5-11, Jr.). 
Outlook: The Mariners have lost three of their four nonleague/tournament games 
this season, but two of the defeats came against top-flight Brea-Olinda and St. 
John Bosco. "If we are intense defensively, we should be competitive with 
anybody," Heckel said. The middle will be sealed by Showalter, who Heckel said 
is the best all-around player on the team. Offensively, Heckel has 
sharpshooting Gaughen (24.7 points per game this season, including 30 against 
Brea) and Nagata (22.0 average this season). 
RANCHO ALAMITOS 
Coach: Eric Hamamoto (second year). 
1989-90 record: 21-4, 13-1 in league. 
Returning lettermen: Two. 
Returning starters: None. 
Top returners: Eric Moore (C, 6-5, Sr.); Chris Singletary (F, 6-2, Sr.); 
Top newcomers: Nervanah Phonexay (G, 5-10, Jr.); Matt Roberts (C, 6-5, Sr.); 
Luther Tolbert (F, 5-8, Jr.); Ulysses Trammell (G, 5-9, Sr.). 
Outlook: Hamamoto is a bit short on experienced personnel, but he has a good 
group of players that should make the Vaqueros genuine contenders. One of the 
keys to Rancho's offense will be how well Trammell, the tailback who led all 
county rushers with 1,548 yards this football season, runs the Vaqueros' fast 
break. Moore and Singletary (200 pounds each) lend some bulk up front. Phonexay 
is averaging 23 points per game in nonleague games this year (he had 34 against 
La Habra) and is the team's primary young gun. Defensively, Rancho will go with 
a full-court press. "It's a style that I've always been happy with," Hamamoto 
said. 
SANTIAGO 
Coach: Paul Anderson (fourth year). 
1989-90 record: 8-14, 4-10 in league. 
Returning lettermen: Three. 
Returning starters: One. Top returners: Mike Carrasco (F, 6-0, Jr.); Con Nguyen 
(G, 5-6, Jr.). 
Top newcomers: Juan Castro (G, 5-8, Jr.); Joe Huelskamp (F, 5-11, Sr.); Juan 
Soriano (C, 6-1, Jr.). 
Outlook: Anderson faces the same predicament as last year -- only one returning 
starter (Carrasco) and lack of height. "We'll give people problems with our 
quickness," he said. "This is one of the best shooting squads I've ever had. I 
have four or five guys capable of scoring 20 points on any given night." 
Saturday -- Orange League.
