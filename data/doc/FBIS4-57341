<F P=106> [Article: "Candidates Launch Programs in May"] </F>
  [Text] The difficult and drawn-out process of forming 
electoral alliances, which is to be interrupted in May and then 
resumed after the first round of balloting on 3 October, is 
concealing something new from the voters: practically all the 
candidates will arrive at their party conventions in May with 
plans for government in their briefcases and maybe even on the 
tips of their tongues. What they are all proposing is economic 
growth and a fight against poverty. 
  It is true that some situations are not very clear. The PT 
[Workers Party], for example, has a plan for government, but so 
far its candidate, Lula, does not. Strong resistance to some 
aspects of the plan have made it necessary to harmonize what the 
majority in the party says with what the candidate can 
reasonably propose to the country. The PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] has a party platform that was drawn up in July 
1993, but Fernando Henrique's plan for government will have to 
be the result of the negotiations, already under way, with the 
PFL [Liberal Front Party], his main electoral partner.

*The final form of the programs will depend on party alliances. 


  The PDT [Democratic Labor Party] drew up a platform at its 
third national congress--held three years ago--and is scheduled 
to complete its revision of that platform this week. The 
resulting document will become the guide for candidates in the 
states and for the rank and file. To some extent, it is also 
supposed to guide Brizola's campaign message, since he is once 
again the party's candidate for president of the republic. 
  In the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], two of 
the 
men running for nomination on 15 May--Jose Sarney and Orestes 
Quercia--have plans for government and a few programs outlined. 
The new candidate for the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], 
Senator Esperidiao Amin, also knows by now what he is going to 
propose to the voters. The table above shows how each 
candidate's party proposes to deal with 11 points in the plans 
for government.
