FACES. . .: FINDING THE UPSIDE 
Those corporate fiends in marketing? John Getz doesn't think they're so 
fiendish. 
"I know these guys," says the actor, who is playing one such specimen in 
Richard Dresser's comedy "The Downside" at Pasadena Playhouse. "When I moved to 
New York, I met a group of people who worked in the marketing department of a 
major corporation. They're terrific people, whom I still care for. You have to 
understand: It's another reality. Lying about things . . . but with a grain of 
truth. And pretty soon you start to believe it yourself." 
And acting? "Acting isn't about lying, but discovering truths," he says. Beyond 
that, however, there are some moral parallels: "As an actor, you're presented 
with the opportunity of making a helluva lot of money to do something 
despicable. Have I? Sure! Not something with which I politically disgree. But 
certainly trash. It may not be really harmful, but it does add to the general 
pollution of ideas in the world." 
Happily for Getz, who is married to writer Grace McKeaney and the father of 
9-month-old Hannah, "Downside" is not that. Nor is "M. Butterfly," in which he 
served eight months last year on Broadway. Nor is "Born on the Fourth of July," 
in which he genially refers to himself as "one of the 130 actors in the movie." 
Except for his clean-cut cop in the series "Rafferty and MacGruder" and 
cuckholded husband in "Thief of Hearts," there have been a lot of bad guys 
lurking behind the handsome face -- like his inept murderer in "Blood Simple" 
and jealous suitor in "The Fly." And this week, he will go in front of the 
cameras to wrap Emilio Estevez's "Men at Work." Admits Getz of that movie 
character, "I'm somewhat less than reprehensible. A nasty piece of work."
