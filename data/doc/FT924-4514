FT  02 DEC 92 / Lottery plea for low taxation
THE NATIONAL Lottery Promotion Company yesterday asked Mr Peter Brooke, the
national heritage secretary, to keep the planned lottery's taxation low.
The non-profit-making company believes experience from other countries
suggests that the most successful lotteries are subject to little or no
direct taxation.
The Treasury is believed to be considering a tax rate of less than 20 per
cent.
