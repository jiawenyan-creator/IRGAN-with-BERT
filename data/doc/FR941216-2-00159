 

NPROVE is a new Nasdaq system for the execution of small-sized customer orders that will provide individual investors
with enhanced limit order protection and important price improvement opportunities, while at the same time affording
market makers an enhanced means to manage the risks associated with market making. The NASD anticipates that NPROVE
will be ready for implementation by May 1, 1995 and is hopeful that the SEC will consider approval of NPROVE well prior
to that date. Accordingly, assuming the SEC approves NPROVE by May 1, 1995, the NASD believes it is necessary for the
protection of investors and the preservation of the quality of the markets for Nasdaq securities to extend the effectiveness
of the Interim SOES Rules for approximately three months until May 1, 1995, so that there will be no lapse between the
effective date of NPROVE and termination of the Interim SOES Rules. By preventing a lapse in the effectiveness of the
Interim SOES Rules, the NASD believes investors and the marketplace as a whole will continue to receive the substantial
benefits derived from the Interim SOES Rules.

The Interim SOES Rules reflect a reasoned approach by the NASD to address the adverse effects on market liquidity attributable
to active intra-day trading activity through SOES, while at the same time not compromising the ability of small, retail
investors to receive immediate executions through SOES. Specifically, the Interim SOES Rules are designed to address
concerns that concentrated, aggressive use of SOES by a growing number of order entry firms has resulted in increased
volatility in quotations and transaction prices, wider spreads, and the loss of liquidity for individual and institutional
investor orders. In light of the SEC's approval of the NASD's proposed short sale rule in June 1994,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 however, the NASD believes it is appropriate to permit short sales to be entered in SOES. Accordingly, the NASD proposes
to allow the effectiveness of this particular SOES rule to lapse on January 25, 1995.

The NASD believes that the same arguments and justifications made by the NASD in support of approval of the Interim
SOES Rules are just as compelling today as they were when the SEC relied on them to approve the rules. In sum, the NASD
continues to believe that concentrated bursts of SOES activity by active order-entry firms contribute to increased
short-term volatility, wider spreads, and less market liquidity on Nasdaq and that the Interim SOES Rules are an effective
means to minimize these adverse market impacts.

The NASD also notes that the SEC made specific findings in the Interim SOES Rules Approval Order that the interim rules
were consistent with the Act. In particular, the SEC stated in its approval order that:




a. Because the benefits for market quality of restricting SOES usage outweigh any potential decrease in pricing efficiency,
the Commission concludes that the net effect of the proposal is to remove impediments to the mechanism of a free and
open market and a national market system, and to protect investors and the public interest, and that the proposed rule
changes are designed to produce accurate quotations, consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act.
In addition, the Commission concludes that the benefits of the proposal in terms of preserving market quality and
preserving the operational efficiencies of SOES for the processing of small size retail orders outweigh any potential
burden on competition or costs to customers or broker-dealers affected adversely by the proposal. Thus, the Commission
concludes that the proposal is consistent with Section 15A(b)(9) of the Act in that it does not impose a burden on competition
which is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

b. The Commission also concludes that the proposal advances the objectives of Section 11A of the Act. Section 11A provides
that it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets to assure economically efficient execution of securities transactions, fair competition among market
participants, and the practicality of brokers executing orders in the best market. The Commission concludes that
the proposal furthers these objectives by preserving the operational efficiencies of SOES for the processing of
small orders from retail investors.

c. The Commission believes that it is appropriate to restrict trading practices through SOES that impose excessive
risks and costs on market makers and jeopardize market quality, and which do not provide significant contributions
to liquidity or pricing efficiency. *** The Commission believes that it is more important to ensure
that investors seeking to establish or liquidate an inventory position have ready access to a liquid Nasdaq market
and SOES than to protect the ability of customers to use SOES for intra-day trading strategies.

d. The Commission believes that there are increased costs associated with active intra-day trading activity through
SOES that undermine Nasdaq market quality ***. Active intra-day trading activity through
SOES can also contribute to instability in the market.

e. In addition, these waves of executions can make it difficult to maintain orderly markets. Given the increased volatility
associated with these waves of intra-day trading activity, market makers are subject to increased risks that concentrated
waves of orders will cause the market to move away. As a result, individual market makers may be unwilling to narrow
the current spread and commit additional capital to the market by raising the bid or lowering the offer. When market
makers commit less capital and quote less competitive markets, prices can be expected to deteriorate more rapidly.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the NASD to take measured steps to redress the economic
incentives for frequent intra-day trading inherent in SOES to prevent SOES activity from having a negative effect
on market prices and volatility.

g. The Commission has evaluated each of the proposed modifications to SOES, and concludes that each of the modifications
reduces the adverse effects of active trading through SOES and better enables market makers to manage risk while maintaining
continuous participation in SOES. In addition, the Commission does not believe that any of the modifications will
have a significant negative effect on market quality. To the extent that any of the modifications may result in a potential
loss of liquidity for small investor orders, the Commission believes that these reductions are marginal and are outweighed
by the benefits of preserving market maker participation in SOES and increasing the quality of executions for public
and institutional orders as a result of the modifications.

h. The Commission *** has determined that the instant modifications to SOES further the objectives
of investor protection and fair and orderly markets, and that these goals, on balance, outweigh any marginal effects
on liquidity for small retail orders, and any anticompetitive effects on order entry firms and their customers. The
Commission concludes that the ability of active traders to place trades through a system designed for retail investors
can impair market efficiency and jeopardize the level of market making capital devoted to Nasdaq issues. The Commission
believes that the rule change is an appropriate response to active trading through SOES, and that the modifications
will reduce the effects of concentrated intra-day DOES activity on the market.

The NASD believes these significant statutory findings by the SEC regarding the Interim SOES Rules and the SEC's assessment
of the likely benefits to the marketplace that would result from the rules have been confirmed and substantiated by
an econometric study conducted by the NASD's Economic Research Department on the effectiveness of the Interim SOES
Rules.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 When the SEC approved the Interim SOES Rules, it stated that ``[a]ny further action the NASD seeks with respect to SOES_extension
of these modifications upon expiration, or introduction of other changes_will require independent consideration
under Section 19 of the Act.''
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the SEC stated that, should the NASD desire to extend these SOES changes or modify SOES, the Commission
would expect ``the NASD to monitor the quality of its markets and assess the effects of these changes on market quality
for Nasdaq securities.'' Also, if feasible, the SEC instructed the NASD to provide a quantitative and statistical
assessment of the effects of the SOES changes on market quality; or, if an assessment is not feasible, the SEC stated
that the NASD should provide a reasoned explanation supporting that determination.

 note 1, 59 FR at 69429. Amendment No. 4 to the NASD's filing for the Interim SOES Rules also states that the NASD ``understand[s]
that because of substantial negative comment on the modifications, the SEC may wish to review the impact of the changes
after they have been in effect for a reasonable time frame. The NASD believes that a one-year pilot will provide a reasonable
period to observe the operation of the modifications and confirm the absence of adverse impact on SOES averred in the
comments. The experience during the pilot period will also permit the NASD to better evaluate the prudence of requesting
permanent approval of these interim changes. For these reasons, the NASD hereby requests that the SEC approve the
proposal for a one-year pilot.''

In sum, the NASD's study found that:




&bull;Since the SOES changes went into effect in January 1994, the statistical evidence indicated that when average
daily volume, stock price, and stock price volatility are held constant through regression techniques, quoted percentage
spreads in Nasdaq securities experienced a decline in the immediate period following implementation of the changes
and have continued to decline since then. The statistical evidence also showed that the narrowing of quoted percentage
spreads became more pronounced and robust the longer the Interim SOES Rules were in effect. In particular, quoted
spreads in cents per share for the 500 largest Nasdaq National Market securities experienced a sharp decline from
April 28 to May 12 and from June 23 to July 18 (footnote omitted);
