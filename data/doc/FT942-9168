FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Spanish companies move ahead
Telefonica, the partly-privatised telecommunications group which is the most
frequently traded stock on Spanish markets, showed a 15 per cent increase in
consolidated net profit in the first quarter to Pta17.34bn (Dollars 125.8m),
compared with Pta15.06bn in the same period last year.
Parent company earnings before tax were 7 per cent up at Pta19.58bn, with
the net figure rising 9.8 per cent to Pta15.47bn, as turnover increased by
6.8 per cent to Pta312.84bn. The company said the results reflected a
recovery in demand for telephone services as the Spanish economy began to
pick up.
Financial costs in the quarter held steady at Pta54.5bn, and the company
forecast a downward trend, reflecting declining interest rates.
Iberdrola, the leading private-sector electrical utility, ranking number two
in recent stock market activity, reported a 35 per cent rise in pre-tax
profit for the quarter to Pta34.25bn. The result reflected a 12 per cent
increase in the company's operating margin together with a reduction of
almost 19 per cent in financial charges.
Another of Spain's top electrical companies, Sevillana de Electricidad,
reported a 17 per cent increase in first-quarter after-tax profit to Pta
3.94bn, on sales 3.5 per cent higher at Pta64.54bn.
The company faces an increasing challenge through deregulation of the mobile
telephone market, which is expected to be opened up to foreign operators
later this year, and also through the liberalisation of cable television. It
currently has a monopoly in both sectors.
