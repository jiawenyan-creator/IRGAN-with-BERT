FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Citizen Watch in German
expansion
CITIZEN Watch, the Japanese precision equipment-maker, has agreed to acquire
a medium-sized German machine tool company, G. Boley, as part of a strategy
to expand its European manufacturing oper-ations and to reduce its
dependence on watch production.
The DM13m (Dollars 8.6m) purchase is the first foreign acquisition by
Citizen, which is attempting to expand its office automation equipment and
machine tool businesses, and was attracted by G. Boley's expertise in the
manufacture of numerically-controlled lathes.
Japanese companies see the acquisition of small and medium-sized European
manufacturers as an important means of establishing a base in the region
without prompting controversy over Japanese investment.
G. Boley, based in Esslingen, has a capital of DM5.1m, sales last year of
DM30m, and 130 staff. The agreement between the two companies provides for
the Boley name to be retained, though the German company will be
wholly-owned by Citizen Machinery Europe.
The Japanese company said the purchase would improve its European
development and marketing of lathes, and that G. Boley, founded in 1870,
would be contracted to produce small lathes for Citizen, while continuing to
make its present lines under the Boley brand.
Watches still account for about 51 per cent of Citizen's sales, but revenues
have been under pressure because of recession in the US and Europe, and
because of a general decline in watch prices.
