FT  11 MAY 93 / Letter: Sunday trading; government, the public interest and
the social viewpoint (1)
Sir, Your leader ('Sunday trading', May 7) suggests that sectional interests
in the Sunday trading debate, and especially those who oppose deregulation,
are not making a genuine attempt to define the wider public interest. That
is not their job. It is the job of government to define and serve the wider
public interest, and gather such information as is deemed necessary to do
so.
In the case of Sunday trading, this process has been in work for many years,
and sectional representations have been balanced by many economic
assessments which, when they are independent as in the case of the latest
from London Economics, have produced results which can only be speculative
and imprecise.
Soon the issue will move on to parliament again, where of course sectional
interests are well represented. For this reason, the forthcoming
parliamentary consultation exercise is likely to lack the definition and
service of the wider public interest you rightly seek.
In the meantime, the leaders of the sectional interests will continue to
fight their corners, and they would be in serious dereliction of their duty
to their shareholders and members if they did not do so.
