FT  25 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Canada
The strength of both the Canadian dollar and its bond market suggests that,
having long since given up hope of a Conservative victory, financial markets
are discounting an outright Liberal win in today's election. If they are
right there may be more to play for. At over 5 per cent, according to
Goldman Sachs, Canadian government bonds carry the highest real yield of any
in the group of seven leading industrial countries.
A large part of the premium reflects the fear of separatist movements in
both Quebec and Western Canada. This would abate with a Liberal victory that
excluded both the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform party from a stake in a
coalition government. Canadian bonds would then be particularly attractive
to international funds on the look-out for high returns, especially after
the latest cuts in European interest rates.
An overall majority for the Liberals would leave their leader, Mr Jean
Chretien, free to concentrate on mundane issues like curbing the budget
deficit. Even this, though, is no easy task. Bad news as it would be to
Westland, cancellation of the CDollars 5.8bn EH-101 helicopter order would
be little more than a down payment. Concerted action on the budget, coupled
with the reappointment of the anti-inflationary Mr John Crow as governor of
the Bank of Canada in January, could shrink the 140 basis point spread
between Canadian government bonds and US treasury issues. But Mr Chretien
would need a long track record of fiscal rectitude to re-establish the 50
basis point differential last seen in the summer of 1992.
