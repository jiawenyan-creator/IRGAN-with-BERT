FT  31 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Green legislation made
user-friendly
Companies concerned as to whether they are meeting European and British
environmental legislation can turn to what is being described as a
'definitive' directory*.
Developed by Wearside Training and Enterprise Council and endorsed by
Northern Electric, the privatised utility, the directory is available on an
environment-friendly disk through Windows software.
The package is designed to render understandable the regulations included in
air, water, waste, dangerous substance and noise legislation. The directory
costs Pounds 899. Wearside TEC is also considering making the directory
available through Business Links for those who do not want to buy it.
*Available from Wearside TEC. Tel 091 416 6161.
