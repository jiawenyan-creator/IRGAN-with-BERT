FT  17 NOV 93 / Clinton reticent on Korean exercise
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday refused to say if the US would cancel a
military exercise with South Korea if North Korea allows inspection of its
nuclear facilities, Reuter reports from Washington.
'I'm not at liberty to comment on that now. The negotiations are going on
and I don't think I should comment. I'll have more to say about that, I
hope, in the next few days,' he told reporters.
The Washington Times reported yesterday Mr Clinton's foreign policy advisers
want him to cancel Operation Team Spirit, a joint military exercise by the
US and South Korea planned for the spring, in exchange for a North Korean
pledge to end a dispute over nuclear development.
Pyongyang, which for years has angrily denounced the manoeuvres as a dress
rehearsal for an invasion of the North, has reportedly offered to let
International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors visit its nuclear complex.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defence Secretary Les Aspin and
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake discussed the matter on Monday, but
when asked about the offer, Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary,
said: 'No decision has been made.'
