FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ford plans to develop new range
of small car
Ford, the US carmaker, has approved the development of a new small car aimed
at taking it into a segment of the European market below the supermini class
in which it sells its smallest car, the Ford Fiesta.
The company said yesterday that a decision on a production location had not
been reached, but it is probable that the new car will be produced at Ford's
plant in Valencia, Spain.
Along with its rival volume carmakers, Ford has been intensively studying
the potential of the so-called 'sub-B' segment of the European car market
beneath the B-class superminis such as the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa, the Ford
Fiesta, the Renault Clio and the Nissan Micra.
At present this segment is dominated by Fiat of Italy with its Fiat
Cinquecento, produced in Poland for west European markets.
Ford showed a concept study for a 'sub-B' car, called the Ka, at the Geneva
motor show in March.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said in an interview
with Automotive News, the US motor industry magazine, that the new car range
would be launched in the next two to three years.
Other volume carmakers, such as General Motors (Opel in continental Europe
and Vauxhall in the UK) and Volkswagen, are expected to follow Ford into the
emerging 'sub-B' segment of the market.
Ford says its new small car must be capable of carrying four adults as well
as some luggage.
Volkswagen has also announced plans for a cheap small car to be sold for
less than DM15,000 (Dollars 9,375) from 1996. It will be shorter than the
new Polo supermini to be introduced later this year, but it will share many
of the Polo's basic components.
Ford's 'sub-B' car is expected to be derived from a shortened Fiesta chassis
platform.
