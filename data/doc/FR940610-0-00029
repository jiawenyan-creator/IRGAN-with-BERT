SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Summary of State Submittal



On July 21, 1993, the Indiana Pollution Control Board adopted and on January 6, 1994, the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management (IDEM) formally submitted to the USEPA a request to approve the July 21, 1993, adopted emission statement
regulations, codified as 326 IAC 26. This submission addresses the emission statement requirements which
are found in section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended (1990 Amendments).

Section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Act states that, within 2 years after the enactment of the Act, states with ozone nonattainment
areas (classified as marginal or worse) must submit revisions to their SIPs to require the owners or operators of stationary
sources of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) or Oxides of Nitrogen (NO

X

) to provide the states with statements, in a form acceptable to the USEPA, showing actual emissions of NO

X

 and/or VOC from the sources. The first emission statements must be submitted within 3 years of the enactment of the
Act. Subsequent statements are to be submitted annually thereafter. These statements must contain certifications
of accuracy. 
Section 182(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act specifies that the states may waive the requirements for emission statements
for any class or category of sources which emit less than 25 tons per year if the states, through the submission of base
year emission inventories or periodic emission inventories (required to be submitted to the USEPA every three years),
provide for the reporting of the emissions from the exempted source classes or categories and emissions are determined
using emission factors acceptable to the USEPA.



II. Analysis of State Submittal



The criteria used to review the submitted SIP revisions are found in USEPA's draft Guidance on the Implementation
of an Emission Statement Program, (July 1992). It should be noted that this guideline has not been finalized, but does
provide current USEPA guidance on the contents of emission statements and on the states' use of emission statements.
For this reason, the July 1992 draft guidance has been used for the technical review of this submission. It should be
noted that the USEPA intends to incorporate the guidelines contained in the July 1992 guidance into the Code of Federal
Regulations in the near future.

The July 1992 guidance describes the following requirements for emission statement SIP revisions:

1. Regardless of what minimum emission reporting level is established, if either VOC or NO

X

 is emitted at or above the established minimum reporting level, the emissions of both VOC and NO

X

 should be reported;

2. The emission statements should, at minimum, include the following data:
