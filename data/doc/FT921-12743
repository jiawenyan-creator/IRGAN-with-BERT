FT  24 JAN 92 / Model price for Matchbox toys: Saleroom
A 2-ft long scale model of a London double-decker bus sold for Pounds 1,100,
twice its estimate, at Sotheby's yesterday. A group of Matchbox toys,
estimated at up to Pounds 400, made Pounds 2,090. They were part of the
collection of tinplate and die-cast toys sent for sale by the receivers of
Mint &amp; Boxed, which went bankrupt last May with debts of more than Pounds
15m.
The company, started in 1983, spent lavishly in acquiring private
collections, but had less success in persuading buyers to pay record prices
for toys.
The top price from the two-day auction was Pounds 47,300, paid by a private
American buyer for a toy fairground carousel, with tiny figures riding on
pigs or shell-shaped chairs. It was made by Marklin of Germany in 1910 and
is very rare. The price was above forecast.
The same sum was paid by a German collector for a set of six horse-drawn
tinplate fire toys made in 1902 by Marklin. Other high prices were Pounds
11,000, against a top estimate of Pounds 1,500, paid for a Marklin Gauge I
electric Commodore Vanderbilt locomotive, carrying the legend New York
Central, and Pounds 9,900 for Leipzig station, made by Marklin in tinplate
around 1930.
In contrast, a marquetry-and-wood version of Euston station, constructed in
1938 and installed in the First Class booking hall there, sold below
forecast at Pounds 3,300.
The auction total of Pounds 580,740, with virtually everything sold, was
within Sotheby's target and underlined the continuing good demand for
collectables. The strongest sector was cars.
