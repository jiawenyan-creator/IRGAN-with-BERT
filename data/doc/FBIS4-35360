  [Text] Tunis, 31 May (MENA) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
has noted that what the Palestinian people gained from the 
self-rule accord was not all they wanted but the best they could 
get under the worst circumstances. 
  Addressing the inaugural session of the constituent congress 
of the Palestinian Contractors Federation last night, 'Arafat 
said: The best achievement of the accord is that after 100 years 
we are again on the geographical map and the Palestinian entity 
is being recognized by those who said: "Palestine is a land 
without people for a people without a homeland." 
  'Arafat criticized the donor nations because they allocated 
just $2.2 billion for the West bank and Gaza Strip over five 
years at the rate of $440 million a year. He added that he 
informed U.S. President Clinton that the struggle is over 
whether Palestine should be a famine-stricken area as Gaza is 
now or one of the economic tigers in the region.
