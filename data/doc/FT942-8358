FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Transbrasil in financial
shake-up
Transbrasil, the Brazilian airline, is negotiating the sale of 40 per cent
of its voting shares and a capital injection of Dollars 700m as part of a
restructuring.
Mr Omar Fontana, who founded the airline and controls 94 per cent of voting
capital, said a group of European and Brazilian bankers was planning to buy
40 per cent of the voting shares.
The purchase would be followed by an immediate cash injection of Dollars 80m
and a total investment of Dollars 700m by the first half of next year. This
would include an investment of Dollars 100m in the airline's cargo
operations.
A final decision is expected shortly.
Transbrasil recorded an operating loss of Dollars 45m in the year to
December 1993 on sales of Dollars 422m and has not paid share dividends
since 1986.
Mr Fontana declined to name the potential buyers but said the Dollars 700m
investment would take the form of loans to be converted into equity.
