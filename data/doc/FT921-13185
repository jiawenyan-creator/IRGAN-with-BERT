FT  23 JAN 92 / Portuguese campaigners set to turn spotlight on Timor
killings
ABOUT 50 Portuguese students and human rights campaigners were expected to
leave Lisbon by boat last night for Dili, the East Timor capital, in a
voyage designed to draw world attention to Indonesia's rule of Portugal's
former colony.
Departure was due as soon as ship's documents were cleared. The Lusitania
Expresso's voyage will take about a month, stopping at Darwin to pick up 50
more campaigners. The organisers want to put a wreath in Dili's cemetery,
scene of a massacre of civilians by Indonesian soldiers last November. An
Indonesian inquiry recently said 50 people were killed when the army opened
fire on mourners, but other estimates put the death toll at up to 100.
East Timor was abandoned by Portugal in 1975 and invaded by Indonesia
shortly after. Jakarta's annexation of the territory was never recognised by
the UN. Since then, widespread human rights abuses have been reported. Human
rights organisations estimate that up to 200,000 East Timorese may have died
from war and famine. Portugal is pressing its EC partners to take action
against Indonesia. The voyage to Darwin is likely to embarrass the
Australian government, which has signed oil-search pacts with Jakarta.
