  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said 
that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will visit the United 
States on 22 April, as announced on Saturday [5 February] by the 
responsible departments of the two countries. Asked whether 
Papandreou's trip will be affected by Washington's recognition 
of Skopje, the spokesman said: The government's policy is to 
convince the international factions that a solution will be 
found when Kiro Gligorov bends his intransigence. So, the prime 
minister's trip will take place as announced.
