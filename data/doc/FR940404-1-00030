Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; 
Texas; Revision to the 
State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
Addressing Carbon Monoxide (CO) for El Paso 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action proposes to approve a revision to the Texas SIP addressing CO for El Paso. Certain elements of the complete
El Paso CO SIP were submitted by the Governor of Texas to the EPA in order to meet the November 15, 1992, deadline for the
purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO. These elements
satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area CO SIP for El Paso. Therefore, this 

Federal Register

 (FR) action only proposes approval of some of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, specifically the 1990 base
year CO emissions inventory and the oxygenated fuels program. 



The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, to be submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1993, have been or will
be acted upon in separate FR actions.

Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by May 4, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A segment of El Paso, Texas, was designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value below

12.7 parts per million (ppm.) (specifically 12.6), under 
sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)
of 1990.

</FOOTNAME>
The 1990 Amendments to the CAA made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do
not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the CO NAAQS (see
Pub. L. 
Number 101549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the CAA, as amended, 42 U.S.C. sections 7401 

et seq

. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The air quality planning requirements for moderate CO nonattainment areas with a design value less than or equal to
12.7 ppm. are set out in subparts one and three of part D, 
Title I of the CAA. Subpart one contains provisions generally applicable to CO nonattainment areas, and subpart three
contains provisions specifically applicable to CO nonattainment areas. Section 104 of the CAAA of 1990 amended part
D of Title I of the CAA by adding two additional sections to subpart three 
(sections 186 and 187), which pertain to the classification of CO nonattainment areas and to the submission requirements
of the SIPs for these areas, respectively. At times, subparts one and three overlap or conflict. The EPA has attempted
to clarify 
the relationship among these various provisions in the 
General Preamble and, as appropriate, in this FR action.
