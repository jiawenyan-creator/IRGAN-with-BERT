ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
AVIATORS: While former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and 11-year-old globe-circling 
pilot Tony Aliengena ride in downtown Santa Ana as marshals in Saturday's Times 
Orange County Holiday Parade (perhaps somewhere near the float of Popeye show 
character "Eugene Jeep," above), Orange County's most storied aviator plans to 
spend a quiet day at home. . . . At the northernmost tip of the city, 
82-year-old Douglas (Wrong Way) Corrigan (N2), who in 1938 flew from New York 
to Ireland after filing a cross-country flight plan, likely will be cutting the 
grass or watching TV in his modest house not far from Corrigan Avenue and, of 
course, Memory Lane. Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky
