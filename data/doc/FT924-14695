FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Norilsk nickel minesmay
keep prices low
THERE are several new nickel mines in development in Norilsk in Russia, with
good enough grades to offset depletion of some of the area's high-grade
deposits, geologists have told a seminar in Sudbury, Ontario.
Norilsk's production of nickel will remain flat for the near future if
productivity is maintained. Reserves are estimated at 70 years' production,
they said.
Russia is now shipping about 100,000 tonnes of primary nickel to the West
yearly, or 15 per cent of total supply, plus some scrap.
Canadian analysts said the Russian statements suggested a recovery in nickel
prices is some distance away.
Earlier this week, Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer,
announced production cuts of 18,000 tonnes in 1993, equal to about 3 per
cent of annual western consumption. It blamed Russian exports and a fall in
stainless steel production.
Falconbridge is expected to announce cuts next week, but a significant gap
between supply and demand is expected to continue.
On the London Metal Exchange yesterday, nickel recovered some of its recent
losses. Three-month metal built on support above Dollars 6,700 a tonne and
the possibility that other nickel producers might follow Inco and take
measures to cut production.
