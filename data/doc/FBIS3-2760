  [Text] Wuhan, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Women now "hold up half 
the sky" in the designing of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway line, 
which is being busily worked on. 
  According to officials at the No.4 Institute of Surveys and 
Design of the Ministry of Railways, 529 of the 1,440 engineers 
and technicians involved in the surveys and design are women. 
  The institute, based in this provincial capital of central 
China's Hubei Province, is responsible for the overall design of 
the trunk railway line linking south and north China. 
  Some 125 woman engineers and technicians have been appointed 
as leaders in charge of professional designing -- about half of 
the leading technicians for the design of the whole 
Beijing-Kowloon Railway line. 
  Chen Dajing, a woman engineer in her 50s, worked 448 extra 
hours last year, completing the design of 22 bridge culverts and 
re- checked the designs for 19 other bridge culverts, fulfilling 
her set task six months ahead of schedule. 
  According to engineers in charge of the construction, China 
will use 105 items of new technology and equipment in the 
construction of this north-south trunk rail line, which are 
expected to greatly increase work efficiency and ensure the 
quality of the railway project.
