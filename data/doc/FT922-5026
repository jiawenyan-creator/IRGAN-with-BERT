FT  02 JUN 92 / Observer: Right choice
When it comes to political infighting, Italy's bankers are almost as
professional as their legislative neighbours. Hence there is some relief
that technocrat Giuseppe Zadra has seen off the opposition and collected the
directorship of Italy's bankers' association.
In many other countries the post would be regarded as a restbed for weary
commercial bankers. But not Italy. At a time when the country's fragmented
and inefficient banking system is on the brink of substantial change, Zadra
will be in a powerful position to influence the cause of sensible reform. He
will not be as easily swayed off course by political undercurrents as some
previous incumbents.
During his seven years as head of the stock market division at Consob,
Italy's stock exchange and companies' watchdog, the 51-year-old Zadra helped
transform Italian equity trading. A fluent English-speaker he has been a
tough defender of the new bourse rules against foreign critics.
Tancredi Bianchi, the professor of banking who chairs the bankers'
association, was so desperate to recruit Zadra that he reportedly threatened
to resign himself, if his colleagues baulked at his choice.
