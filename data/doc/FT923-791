FT  26 SEP 92 / Worries over Cuba embargo
CANADIAN and European Community hopes of averting legislation to extend the
US trade embargo against Cuba to foreign subsidiaries of US companies have
become inextricably tied up in the complex politics of abortion and nuclear
testing, writes George Graham from Washington.
The legislation is attached to a much broader defence authorisation bill
which also includes controversial measures to ban nuclear testing and to
allow military personnel to obtain abortions in US military hospitals
overseas.
The Cuban bill is strongly opposed by the US's partners, who see it as
unjustified extraterritorial interference.
