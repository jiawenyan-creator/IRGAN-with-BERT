FT  21 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Crisis in the ERM
FOREIGN exchange trading this week is certain to focus on whether the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism has a future, writes James Blitz.
By the end of last week, the chaos in the EMS left dealers believing that
little may now depend on the result of the French referendum vote on
Maastricht. The foreign exchanges have seen that the European Monetary
System is weak after the departure of both sterling and the Italian lira,
and the massive run on both currencies.
Although the UK government has said that sterling will return to the system
when the time is right, the UK Chancellor appeared to imply in an interview
last Friday that an early return to the EMS is not envisaged. There have
been subtle indications, too, that the Bank of Italy is having second
thoughts about its commitment to return to the system tomorrow.
The D-Mark's strength has even started to create strains at the very core of
the system, among the Benelux countries which closely track the D-Mark's
moves. On Friday, Belgium's central bank governor said the Belgian franc
would be allowed to diverge more widely from its central ERM rate against
the D-Mark than it had in the past.
The dollar could continue to profit from the turbulence in the EMS. In
recent weeks. it has regained some of its old status as a safe haven
currency and peaked at DM1.5020 in US trading on Friday night. Some analysts
believe that the dollar needs to break through DM1.55 if its upward path is
to be ensured. But with the US presidential election nearing, a sustained
dollar rally may be difficult to achieve. The August figures for durable
goods orders and home sales due out on Friday will confirm how weak the US
economy is.
