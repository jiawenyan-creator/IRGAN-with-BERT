METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN FACES MURDER CHARGE IN FATAL FIRE 
Murder charges that could carry the death penalty have been filed against a 
Glendale contractor accused of setting fire to a boarded-up house in Glassell 
Park, killing a squatter trapped inside and seriously injuring another, the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office reported. 
Frank Paul Piumetti, 53, who owned the house, also was charged Thursday with 
attempted murder, arson and burglary stemming from the Aug. 21 fire, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Savitt. 
Jesus Ortega Sandoval, 18, died after being overcome by smoke, and Miguel 
Martinez, 22, remains hospitalized with injuries suffered in the blaze, Savitt 
said. Both were illegal aliens who slept in the house without permission, 
Savitt said. 
If convicted of murder and arson, Piumetti could face the death penalty or be 
sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, Savitt said. 
Piumetti was being held without bail, Savitt said. 
Piumetti and his brother bought the property in January and planned to build a 
multi-unit dwelling there, Savitt said. While awaiting a needed zoning change, 
Piumetti tried repeatedly to evict the transients who lived in the house, at 
one point boarding up the windows and doors, Savitt said. But the men returned, 
he said.
