FT  03 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metal prices take a tumble
 -Week in the Markets
BASE METAL prices on the London Metal Exchange began the week as they meant
to go on - downwards.
'The metal markets have been disembowelled,' said one analyst of Monday,
when prices fell across the board. Heavy selling of copper, zinc and nickel
reflected growing fears that the sluggish state of worldwide economic
recovery would continue for some time.
Economic data coming from the US, Japan and Germany - the major outlets for
base metals - have reinforced the gloom over the week, suggested Mr Nick
Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett. Growth in OECD countries had been
postponed, and the markets could only wait for producers to show some
restraint.
Obvious signs of the strain of low prices on producers emerged with news
that Inco, the world's largest nickel producer with about 25 per cent of the
market, was in talks with unions about action to stem losses. 'We have a
number of options, including production shutdowns or shorter work weeks,'
said Mr Bob Allen, Inco's vice-president of corporate affairs, on Tuesday.
He dismissed as 'absurd' market talk that the company, which produces about
113,000 tonnes of nickel a year, might cut production for six months.
Nickel demand has been depressed by a fall in stainless steel production,
which accounts for about 60 per cent of nickel consumption, and by big
increases in Russian exports to the west.
Inco's production costs are thought to be about Dollars 3.25 a lb for
nickel. Last night cash nickel closed at Dollars 6,705 a tonne, down Dollars
165 on the week, and equivalent to Dollars 3.04 a lb. News that Inco plans
to make a statement on Monday came too late to affect the market.
Low aluminium prices are delaying the start of work on new smelting
capacity, according to Mr Harry Helton, an executive vice-president at
Reynolds Metals, the second biggest US aluminium group. He believes the west
needs to build 13 new smelters at about Dollars 1bn each by the year 2002 to
keep pace with demand. But before investment could proceed, the industry
needed to see a sustained price of between 80 and 85 cents a lb, equivalent
to between Dollars 1,763 and Dollars 1,873 a tonne.
Last night cash aluminium closed at Dollars 1,212.50, down Dollars 27 on the
day having recovered from earlier eight-month lows. Aluminium fell on every
day of the week, closing down Dollars 61.
Rising stocks have put pressure on the copper market this week, cash copper
closing yesterday at Pounds 1,331.50, down Pounds 62 on the week. LME
warehouse stocks were up 3,650 tonnes on Tuesday and a further 4,875 tonnes
yesterday, taking them to the highest level since March at 296,750 tonnes.
Stocks on New York's Comex are at a five-year high of 51,025 short tons
(2,000 lbs each).
However, the recent price weakness reflected only a correction to the sharp
gains of June and July, said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst with Carr Kitkat &amp;
Aitken. In a special report on copper this week, he suggested that copper
demand could rise by 2.5 per cent next year on renewed economic growth in
Japan and the US. This would result in a supply deficit of about 200,000
tonnes compared with a 75,000 tonne deficit this year, and trigger some
sharp price spikes.
The International Coffee Organisation's talks on a new pact lasted through
Wednesday night to end on Thursday at 7am with the feeling that something -
although not much - had been accomplished in 10 days. As one New York
analyst put it: 'At least they didn't strangle each other like they did in
July.'
Analysts believe it is now just possible that a new agreement can be agreed
by the end of the year at meetings starting at the end of next month.
However, serious subjects such as prices and market share have yet to be
broached.
The markets have been a little ambivalent towards the ICO talks. London's
November robusta contract closed yesterday at Dollars 802 a tonne, down
Dollars 2 on the week, having at one stage fallen as low as Dollars 763.
The gold market weathered a sharp hike in the overnight cost of leasing
gold. The glitch in an otherwise smooth week followed a central bank's
unexpected removal from the market of 1.4m troy ounces of gold which it had
swapped (sold with a commitment to buy back at an agreed price and date).
Usually such swaps are rolled over.
However, by the end of the week leasing rates were easing back to more
normal levels, and gold closed yesterday at Dollars 348.15 a troy ounce,
just Dollars 1.20 down on the week.
