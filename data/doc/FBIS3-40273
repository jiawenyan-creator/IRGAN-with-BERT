Interior Ministry Points To Disadvantages of Dual Citizenship"] 
  [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government's decision to 
impose a 10- percent income tax on its citizens to support the 
war effort in Bosnia- Herzegovina could affect about 67,000 
people in Slovenia who hold Slovene and Bosnian citizenship. 
  Since we can assume that these people who live and work in 
Slovenia will have to send this money or it will be collected -- 
the method of collection is not yet known since this regulation 
is new -- it is obvious that the revenue will not clear 
Slovenia's borders without violating Slovene regulations, 
whether the money is taken abroad by individuals or by an 
"authorized" collector. 
  This is merely the latest example of the problems which dual 
citizenship brings along with its advantages.
