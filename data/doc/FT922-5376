FT  30 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Intercontinental influences as
bourses return to work
MOST bourses came back from holiday yesterday to a stimulus from better New
York and Tokyo prices overnight, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT held early gains, helped by German car production in April, up an
adjusted 4 per cent, and the industry's 28 per cent rise in exports. After a
2.35 gain to 721.17 for the FAZ index at mid-session, the DAX closed 9.17
higher at 1,803.22. Both indices, however, were flat on the week.
The market has still to react to the mid-May preliminary index for the cost
of living in western Germany, up 0.3 per cent on the month and 4.5 per cent
higher than 12 months earlier. Turnover yesterday fell from DM5.7bn to
DM4.6bn.
Dealers said that there had been demand for selected stocks; in utilities,
modestly in favour recently, Veba rose DM3.20 to DM410.20 and RWE by DM4.80
to DM414.80; and among carmakers, Volkswagen led with a DM6 rise to DM410.
Lufthansa rose DM6.30 to DM135, up a lot on the day but sadly down in a
painful year for the shares. Continental, the tyremaker, ended down DM4 at
DM272.00 after a state court in Hanover ruled that the move in March 1991 to
scrap its voting rights restrictions was null and void.
PARIS was firmer by the close after a weak morning session when arbitrage
ahead of the expiry of May futures and options drove the index lower. The
CAC-40 index closed up 19.20 at 2,033.29, but was down 0.6 per cent on the
week. Turnover was estimated at FFr3bn.
Both Euro Disney and Eurotunnel were again in the spotlight. The market was
rife with rumours including unsubstantiated reports that the theme park had
been losing staff since it opened. Its shares closed down FFr2.50 or 2 per
cent at FFr121.0. Eurotunnel weakened during the session ahead of a meeting
with its bankers, closing 30 centimes lower at FFr36.25. At the close it was
announced that the banks had agreed to release further funds, enabling the
project to continue.
Elsewhere, Peugeot rose FFr18 to FFr798 and Societe Generale lifted FFr26 to
FFr545.
MILAN traded uncertainly ahead of today's Bank of Italy annual meeting and
further political developments next week, but the Comit index rose 1.98 to
496.60, 0.6 per cent higher on the week.
Shares in Pirelli SpA, the former suitor of Germany's Continental, dipped on
the German court news from Hanover and then recovered to close just L6.50
lower at 1,425.50. Owning 5 per cent of Conti, and with options on a further
34 per cent, Pirelli could have gained from a decision to scrap the voting
limit, one of the reasons for the failure of its bid for the German tyre
maker last year.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index closed 5.70 higher at 991.50, 1 per
cent lower on the week, on selective demand for Swedish blue chips. The
narrow SX-16 index, which tracks the 16 most active stocks, rose 1 per cent
on the day.
Shares were helped by a decline in Swedish money market rates and a surge in
Ericsson B, the session's most active stock - up SKr5 to SKr148 in turnover
of SKr40m - on speculation that the group is close to winning a SKr1bn US
mobile telephone order. Volvo also advanced with the B up SKr8 to SKr418.
AMSTERDAM closed with the CBS Tendency index 0.7 ahead at 131.0, a 0.5 per
cent increase on the week.
Ahold, which presents first quarter figures next week, was unchanged at Fl
86.80. Morgan Stanley has recently reiterated its hold recommendation on the
stock. Pirelli Tyre Holding advanced Fl 1.40 or 5 per cent to Fl 29.70 ahead
of next week's annual meeting.
MADRID saw strong month-end activity in the last minutes of trading push the
index ahead, closing up 2.02 at 261.06 for a 0.5 per cent gain on the week.
Turnover was estimated at Pta24bn.
COPENHAGEN climbed in active trading, the CSE index closing 5.74 higher at
347.48 after opinion polls showed a clear majority of Danes planning to vote
'Yes' in Tuesday's referendum on the EC Maastricht treaty.
