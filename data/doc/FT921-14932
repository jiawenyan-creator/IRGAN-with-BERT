FT  14 JAN 92 / Italian ban ends on Philip Morris
Sales of Philip Morris cigarette brands resumed yesterday after a month-long
ban imposed by the Italian government to curtail a growing contraband trade,
writes Robert Graham in Rome. The government could reimpose the ban if it is
not satisfied that Philip Morris has taken adequate measures to reduce the
flow.
