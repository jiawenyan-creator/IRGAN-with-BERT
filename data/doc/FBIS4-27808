  [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Eijiro Hata, minister of 
international trade and industry [MITI], said Friday [3 June] he 
is gravely concerned that the latest development in his 
ministry's personnel affair could shake an already fragile 
cabinet. 
  "The situation is very abnormal," the MITI minister said. He 
was referring to a parliamentary accord to summon a former 
high-ranking ministry official to the Diet to clarify his sudden 
resignation last December. 
  Masahisa Naito, the former head of MITI's Industrial Policy 
Bureau, will appear before the Diet next Monday as an unsworn 
witness to speak about the circumstances that led to his 
resignation last December. 
  In mid-December, Hiroshi Kumagai, chief cabinet secretary 
and 
then trade minister, forced Naito to step down over his alleged 
bias in the appointment of an official who planned to leave the 
ministry to run in national elections. 
  Naito has denied the allegation, saying the special 
promotion 
of a retiring official has been customary at MITI. But he 
finally agreed to resign, apparently bowing to strong pressure 
from Kumagai. 
  The incident prompted strong public criticism that branded 
Kumagai's resignation request as politician's interference in 
bureaucracy. 
  The renewed bickering over the controversy stalled 
parliamentary business Thursday. 
  Speaking before a press conference, MITI chief Hata said his 
ministry will "calmly" watch developments in the matter. 
  Hata said he understands the former trade minister's 
resignation request was intended to "rejuvenate MITI." 
  On Thursday, some opposition camp members called for 
Kumagai's resignation, a key cabinet minister under the minority 
Hata government.
