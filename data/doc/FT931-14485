FT  18 JAN 93 / Monday Interview: Man who would be worker bee - Edouard
Balladur, potential leader of the next French government, talks to William
Dawkins and David Buchan
Mr Edouard Balladur, the courtly technocrat tipped to lead the next French
government after the March parliamentary election, says prime ministers of
France are like worker bees.
'An eminently frustrating function,' says 63-year-old Mr Balladur, quoting
from his latest book, Dictionary of Reform, as he holds forth in his elegant
office just down the road from the National Assembly. 'The prime minister is
like a kind of industrious bee, devoted exclusively to protecting and
feeding the president of the republic, the queen bee, to whom is attributed
every success and all that is good,' he explains.
Wisely, Mr Balladur refuses comment on the general belief in France that he
will run the right-wing government which the polls indicate will take over
from the Socialists after a decisive election victory. Even so, he
carelessly fails to stop himself slipping from the conditional into the
future tense when describing the policies the next government would, or
will, follow. The message is that, future prime minister or not, Mr Balladur
will set the tone for the next right-wing administration and has already
drawn up his action plan.
As finance minister in the last right-wing government in 1986-88, Mr
Balladur drew up the policy of delicate cohabitation with the Socialist
President Francois Mitterrand. So he will be well-qualified to run the next
cohabition government, and argues in his book that cohabition can even allow
worker bee prime ministers more margin for manoeuvre than in governments in
which prime minister and president are from the same party.
So what kind of man might the French get as the pivotal player in
government? Mr Balladur is nice but a bit dull. One could happily entrust
the family savings to him. He keeps himself to himself and is unfailingly
courteous, even to his political opponents - a sober contrast to the media
folk, entrepreneurs and academics who so interestingly spice the Socialist
team.
His origins and background are quite different to those of Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the current prime minister, a Ukrainian working-class lad who
made his way from metal-working to the Matignon. Mr Balladur, born into a
rich banking family, is a brilliant product of the Ecole Nationale
d'Administration, the stable of the elite.
As former chief adviser to Mr Georges Pompidou, Mr Balladur was thought to
have held the government together during the former president's long
terminal illness, an experience he no doubt hopes will not be repeated with
the ailing Mr Mitterrand. The Pompidou experience has marked Mr Balladur in
that his ideas seem closer to the moderate pragmatism of his old boss than
the Gaullism of the RPR party to which he belongs.
Yet in one important way, Mr Balladur is also like Mr Beregovoy, another
former finance minister. They both appear most confident on their home turf,
economic policy. If the style is different, the underlying content of Mr
Balladur's policies are very similar to the Socialists, a mark of how
mainstream French politics has converged on the centre in recent years.
On matters such as the need to promote European construction, the defence of
the franc and the importance of preserving the rural economy, Mr Balladur
and the current government speak the same language. 'Today, the objective of
the EC is to organise our continent so that it is more responsible for its
destiny in monetary affairs, in commercial affairs - from where comes the
need to defend our vital interests in Gatt - and on the military and
diplomatic arena, from where we derive the need to develop political
co-operation,' says Mr Balladur.
He is thus about as pro-EC as it is possible for a Gaullist to be. This,
plus his good manners, might make him the least unacceptable candidate to Mr
Mitterrand with whom, after all, the choice of prime minister lies.
In the election run-up, Mr Balladur plays up his policy differences with the
Socialists, but they are mostly on domestic economic management. 'The budget
deficit risks being triple what we left in 1988, the state debt is double,
and the fall in taxes and charges necessary to put our country into good
condition for the single market has not been made. There is the difference
in our general ideas,' he says.
Yet Mr Balladur makes no promises about turning back record unemployment,
now close to 3m and a big factor in the Socialists' unpopularity. 'This will
be a difficult year in all European countries and we cannot hope to do
better than to try to stop the damage.' If western economies pick up at the
end of the year, unemployment might start to fall, but Mr Balladur says it
would be 'irresponsible' to make precise forecasts.
One of the toughest challenges facing the next government will be to
persuade voters that it has better solutions to unemployment than its
predecessor. 'It's not an intellectual difference, it's a question of
action. The real source of unemployment is heavy social security charges,
insufficient training and too rigid forms of work. We must act in all these
directions. It's one thing to say things, it is another to act on them,' Mr
Balladur says.
Here he calls for state backing for apprenticeships and more part-time
working - an area where he admits the Socialists have done well. Where he
does break new ground is to call for sharp cuts in high social charges and
taxes, which he says absorb the equivalent of half of gross domestic
product, a serious burden on economic activity and employment.
This would be funded by an ambitious privatisation programme, similar to the
FFr140bn wave of privatisations he organised in 1986-88, seen as one of the
Gaullist government's few successes. He is moderately confident that the
Paris stock market will be able to absorb heavy state asset sales in the
current difficult economic conditions. 'In 1986 I was told it would take 15
to 20 years to privatise the companies I had selected. In 14 months, I
privatised half of them . . . Today, the conditions are no doubt less
favourable. We shall see. It must be done and we will do it in the best
interests of the state.'
Mr Balladur is already preparing a list of privatisation candidates, which
he says will start with banks, insurance companies and industrial groups.
He sees no point in using privatisation income to curb the deficit in the
short term, even though he thinks the shortfall will be at least FFr100bn
(Pounds 11.7bn) too high this year at FFr230bn or FFr240bn, a long way over
even the Socialists' target. He would rather concentrate on tax cuts to
stimulate the economy and cut the deficit when that has been achieved. 'It
will be necessary to have a five-year plan for the recovery of public
finances to avoid debt becoming a factor in strangling activity,' he adds.
The other big challenge facing a right-wing administration will be to hold
the line against a diverse minority which wants to float or devalue the
franc to pave the way for a drop in French interest rates. Mr Balladur, an
early proponent of a single European currency, is a staunch defender of the
franc fort policy. Yet the right is more internally divided on the franc
fort policy than the Socialists, for which the right comes in for a lot of
teasing from the government.
'It is natural that there should be a debate. On the other hand, I am not
prepared to let the government get away with claiming that it is the
opposition's fault if there has been speculation against the franc,' says Mr
Balladur. He is convinced that devaluation would drive up long-term interest
rates - and hence the cost of industrial investment - as has happened in
Britain after sterling left the EMS, 'an operation from which we would have
nothing to gain'.
The overall impression is that France under a government run and selected by
Mr Balladur is likely to be less fun - less erratic - than the Socialists.
But Mr Balladur would certainly bring a steady pair of hands to a sensitive
period.
