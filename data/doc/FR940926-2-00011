 

Initiation of Investigation 



We have examined the petition for pipe nipples from Mexico, as amended, and have found that it meets the requirements
of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether
imports of pipe nipples from Mexico are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.
If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminary determination by 
February 7, 1995. 



International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification 



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of these actions and we have done so. 



Preliminary Determinations by the ITC 



The ITC will determine by October 17, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of pipe nipples from
Mexico are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a) of the
Act, a negative ITC determination in this investigation will result in the termination of this investigation; otherwise,
the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).
