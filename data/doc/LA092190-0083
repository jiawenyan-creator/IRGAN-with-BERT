METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AFTER VIOLENT PARTY, HOTEL GETS WARNING ON 
PERMITS 
The Inglewood city attorney's office has sent a sharply worded letter to the 
hotel where a party erupted in violence earlier this month, threatening 
prosecution if hotel officials do not comply with occupancy limits or get city 
permits for future gatherings. 
Officials are still investigating whether the Days Inn Park Plaza Hotel on 
South Prairie Avenue violated city law by failing to get a permit for the Sept. 
1 party that left one guest dead and several injured. 
However, city officials said in a statement that several discrepancies in the 
Days Inn booking process may have contributed to the outbreak of violence. 
Mayor Edward Vincent expressed anger at hotel manager Kay Hong's comment that 
part of the reason for the violence was the neighborhood where the hotel was 
located, which she called a "hot spot." Vincent said the police investigation 
has found that the party-goers were from out of town.
