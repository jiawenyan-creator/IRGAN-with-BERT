Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources: 
Municipal Waste Combustors

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 Proposed rule and notice of public hearing.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is proposing a new subpart Eb to regulate emissions from new municipal waste combustor (MWC) units for which
construction, modification, or reconstruction began after September 20, 1994.


Today's proposal would implement sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act (Act). The proposed rule would apply to new
MWC units at facilities with aggregate capacities to combust greater than 35 megagrams per day (Mg/day; a megagram
is a metric ton, and one megagram is equal to 2,204 pounds or about 1.1 short tons) of municipal solid waste (MSW) and
would require sources to achieve emission limits reflecting the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of air pollutants
that the Administrator determines is achievable, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission
reduction, and any non-air-quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements. The proposed rule
establishes emission limits for MWC acid gases (sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) and hydrogen chloride (HCl)), MWC metals (particulate matter (PM), opacity, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury
(Hg)), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), nitrogen oxides (NO

x

), and MWC fugitive fly ash/bottom ash. The proposed rule would also establish standards for MWC operating practices
(carbon monoxide (CO), load, flue gas temperature at the PM control device inlet, and operator training/certification)
and siting requirements for new MWC units.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Information 


On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed new source performance standards (NSPS) for new MWC's in subpart Ea of 40 CFR
part 60. The subpart Ea NSPS were promulgated on February 11, 1991 and were developed under authority of paragraph
(b) of section 111 of the Act of 1977. The Act of 1990 requires the EPA to review these emission standards and determine
if they are fully consistent with the requirements of section 129. The EPA has reviewed the subpart Ea NSPS and has concluded
that they are not fully consistent with the requirements of section 129 of the Act of 1990. Therefore, the EPA is proposing
a new NSPS in subpart Eb that would fully comply with the requirements of section 129. Municipal waste combustors that
begin construction, modification, or reconstruction after September 20, 1994, and that meet all other applicability
criteria, would be subject to the proposed subpart Eb. Municipal waste combustors that were constructed, modified,
or reconstructed after December 20, 1989 and on or before September 20, 1994, and that meet all other applicability
criteria, would remain subject to the subpart Ea NSPS and would not be subject to the proposed subpart Eb NSPS. Those
sources subject to subpart Ea would, however, also be subject to the emission guidelines that are being proposed under
subpart Cb in a separate notice in today's 

Federal Register

. The proposed subpart Cb emission guidelines would be applicable to sources constructed, modified, or reconstructed
on or before September 20, 1994.
