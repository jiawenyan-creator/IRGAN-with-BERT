THE SIDELINES; 
STEWART OKD TO RESUME COACHING 
University of Missouri veteran basketball Coach Norm Stewart, who missed a 
third of last season after surgery for colon cancer, has been given the final 
OK by his doctor to return to coaching this season. 
Stewart underwent extensive tests last week at Columbia Regional Hospital that 
showed his body was free of cancer and the seven ulcers that plagued him in 
February, according to his personal physician Jay Ward. 
"Everything we did went extremely well," Ward said. "It was great." 
Stewart, whose collapse on an airplane Feb. 9 triggered the discovery of 
cancer, has regained almost all of the weight he lost during his recovery, Ward 
said. 
He said the tests completed last week were more thorough than the occasional 
checkups Stewart had during the spring and summer. 
Stewart, 54, will begin his 23rd season at Missouri Nov. 17 when the Tigers 
host the Brazilian national team. His record is 429-225.
