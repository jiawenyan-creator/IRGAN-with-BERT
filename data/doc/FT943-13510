FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Domtar to spin off Quebec mill
DOMTAR, a big Canadian forest products group, will spin off its northern
Quebec kraft pulp mill into a separate unit partly held by employees and the
public, writes Robert Gibbens.
Domtar will spend CDollars 250m (USDollars 182m) at the Quevillon mill to
put in secondary treatment, a new boiler and a cogeneration plant. Capacity
will rise from 250,000 tonnes yearly to almost 300,000 tonnes.
Quevillon, 400 miles north of Montreal, ships high quality pulp to Domtar's
fine paper mills and also to outside customers.
