Title:

 Compliance Extensions for Early ReductionsReporting and Recordkeeping Requirements (EPA ICR No. 1582.02;
OMB No. 20600222). This is a request for renewal of a currently approved information collection. 


Abstract:

 Respondents are owners or operators of sources emitting hazardous air pollutants (HAP) who voluntarily seek compliance
extensions for applicable standards through demonstration of early emission reductions, in accordance with the
regulations implementing section 112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act (see 40 CFR part 63, subpart D). Sources may obtain
a six-year extension of compliance with standards promulgated under section 112(d), if the source demonstrates
achievement of early reduction of HAP by 90 percent (95 percent for particulates), before proposal of an applicable
section 112(d) standard. Industry respondents must submit a one-time demonstration of reductions achieved. State
or local permitting agencies will evaluate these demonstrations for the purpose of granting compliance extensions.
