CHINA'S LOST GENERATION 
Nine months after the Tian An Men Square massacre, while some people have 
almost forgotten what happened there last June, we Chinese students in the 
States are still struggling with the painful reminiscences of the blood bath 
and with the dilemma of longing to contribute to our motherland but at the same 
time facing possible political persecution if we go back. We are so grateful to 
you for letting our experience be known to the public. 
After reading "China's Lost Generation" (March 25), many of our American 
friends told us that they were moved by our stories vividly portrayed by Jim 
Mann. Many of them asked whether they could do anything for us. 
At the turning point of this century, democracy is triumphing in almost every 
corner of this planet. Why should China be left out of this worldwide 
megatrend? We believe a democratic and economically strong China is of great 
importance to a peaceful world, especially to a peaceful Asia. We also believe 
that the seeds of the democratic ideal have already been brought to China. A 
noble course needs to be urgently pursued to spread these seeds on the vast 
land of China and to let them sturdily grow there. It is for these beliefs that 
we Chinese students in the United States are still forcefully fighting.
