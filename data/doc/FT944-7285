FT  25 NOV 94 / People: Coleman: PW's World Leader
So how does an unassuming accountant become a World Leader? In one easy
step, judging from 45-year-old Andrew Coleman, partner at Price Waterhouse
in charge of the European capital markets group, who has just been promoted
to the position of World Leader of a newly formed global capital markets and
treasury group.
The move comes in the context of the international accountancy firm's
rearrangement of its activities along industry rather than geographic lines.
'I guess the idea is to harness the power of individual batteries to get a
real charge,' says the new World Leader, 'rather than allowing (regional
centres) to do their own thing.'
The title itself, which he intimates is not of his own choosing, is designed
to distinguish between those running individual 'industry' divisions -
himself and others - and the chairman of the world financial services
practice, Thomas Macey.
The regrouping, which involves treasury being brought into the capital
markets fold, means that Coleman goes from managing a division of between
40-50 people to one encompassing between 400 and 500. His customers comprise
both the panoply of banks offering capital market and treasury services and
corporations, the would-be buyers of those services. The group will help the
banks originate and structure products and manage the risks on their books,
while advising companies on the likes of how to put risk management
frameworks in place.
A graduate of the London School of Economics, Coleman has been with PW his
entire working life, increasingly specialising on the capital markets side.
A partner for the past 12 years, he has become a well-known face in the
derivatives field, largely on account of his membership of the working group
which in 1993 produced the Group of Thirty Global Derivatives Study.
