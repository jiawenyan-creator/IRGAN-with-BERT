FT  20 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Odd comment on ITV cartels
Sir, In his letter of October 13, the director-general of the Incorporated
Society of British Advertisers opposes changes to the ITV ownership rules on
the grounds that 'advertisers do not want to see new cartels and monopolies
develop'. This is an odd observation, since the rules on airtime sales have
for some time past allowed any single sales point to sell up to 25 per cent
of the ITV market. At present, there are five sales points selling ITV, and
there are no proposals to reduce their number.
With respect to his concerns about regional programmes within the 15 licence
areas of ITV, the Independent Television Commission has an effective armoury
of powers to ensure their provision at the level and quality promised in the
application process of 1991. It is our contention that the resources to
sustain regional commitments (and also with growing competition the strength
of the network schedule) will be best ensured by allowing further
rationalisation of the system. Underpinning programme strength must surely
be in the long-term interest of viewers and advertisers alike.
