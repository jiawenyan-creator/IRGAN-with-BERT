seeks to strengthen and expand traditional ties between the two 
peoples and parties: 
  [Begin Wu recording in Mandarin with superimposed Spanish 
translation] We have a lot in common. That is why I have 
arrived with great interest in Cuba. We have arrived in Cuba 
with the friendly feelings of the CPC and the Chinese [word

two countries even more. [end recording]
