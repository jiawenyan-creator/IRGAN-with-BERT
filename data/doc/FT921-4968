FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: SEC gives go-ahead to
'incubator' exchange
THE Securities and Exchange Commission, the US watchdog, yesterday gave the
go-ahead to the American Stock Exchange's (ASE) plan to create a new
'incubator' stock market for small companies.
The SEC's approval means that the ASE can launch its Emerging Company
Marketplace (ECM) as planned on March 18. It will list companies with a
market value of less than Dollars 2.5m which are too small to meet the
exchange's regular listing standards.
The ECM will compete directly with the Nasdaq over-the-counter market run by
the National Association of Securities Dealers. The Nasdaq has traditionally
been regarded as the first home for small and start-up companies.
The ASE hopes that between 15 and 20 stocks will be listed on the ECM for
opening day. All the newly listed stocks will be subject to normal
regulatory requirements such as last sale reporting, trading and marketmaker
allocation rules, and surveillance procedures.
The new companies, however, will be exempt from the ASE's rules mandating
independent directors, audit committees, shareholder quorums and common
stock voting rights.
The ASE is setting up the new market to make it easier for very small
companies to raise funds through equity issues. At the moment, newly created
and small companies are finding it difficult to borrow money because US
banks have tightened their credit standards in the recessionary business
climate.
The SEC has already this year proposed changes to make it easier for small
companies to raise money on the capital markets. Those proposals included:
allowing small companies to issue up to Dollars 1m in unrestricted
securities and canvas the public directly for investor interest; widening
eligibility to use a simplified disclosure document for share offerings; and
allowing small companies to file 'junior' quarterly and year-end reports.
