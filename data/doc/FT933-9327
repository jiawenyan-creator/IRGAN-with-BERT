FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: First-half sales down by 11% at
Peugeot-Citroen
PEUGEOT-Citroen, the French car manufacturer, announced a 11.4 per cent fall
in sales in the first half of the year, reflecting the depressed state of
the European car market.
The company achieved sales of FFr73.05bn (Dollars 12.40bn) in the first six
months of 1993, compared with FFr82.4bn in the same period in 1992.
Peugeot-Citroen said the results reflected a continued decline in the
European car market, which saw sales of new vehicles fall by 17.4 per cent
in the first half of the year.
Motor industry analysts said they saw little prospect of rapid recovery in
the European car market, particularly in France and Germany, and forecast
that French car sales would fall by about 15 per cent this year.
The decline in sales at Peugeot-Citroen was aggravated by foreign exchange
movements, particularly the devaluations of the British pound and the
Italian lira. The company said that these effects accounted for about 4 per
cent of the decline in sales during the first half.
The company said it enjoyed strong sales in the British market and
consolidated its position in Germany. As a result, it maintained its share
of the European car market at 11.9 per cent in the first half.
