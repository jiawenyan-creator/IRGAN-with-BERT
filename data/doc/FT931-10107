FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: US brewer up to Dollars 162m in
last period
ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the largest US brewer, lifted fourth-quarter net profits to
Dollars 161.6m, or 58 cents a share, from Dollars 159.2m, or 55 cents, on
sales of Dollars 2.73bn against Dollars 2.67bn, agencies report from St
Louis.
Full-year net profits slipped to Dollars 917.5m, or Dollars 3.22 a share,
from Dollars 939.8m, or Dollars 3.26, after a Dollars 76.7m charge for
changes in accounting practices.
The group expects to report first-quarter 1993 beer sales volume slightly
below first-quarter 1992. This was due to the phase-in of production at its
new Cartersville, Georgia, brewery beginning in the spring.
The beer maker said it usually builds inventories at the wholesaler level in
the first half of each year to meet peak consumer demand during the summer.
Availability of the extra capacity at Cartersville would reduce shipping
requirements during the first two quarters of 1993.
While first-quarter sales volume was expected to slip, volume in the second
half of 1993 would be substantially higher than the second half of 1992,
providing full-year volume growth of 1 to 2 per cent.
For the first quarter of 1993, Anheuser-Busch expects sales to retailers,
which are regarded as better indicators of underlying consumer demand, to
increase more than 1 per cent.
