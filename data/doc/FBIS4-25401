  [Text] Seoul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam said here today that his country will increase 
investment in China, which has now become the largest receiver 
of Seoul's overseas investment. 
  Kim made his remarks during a meeting with Wu Yi, Chinese 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, who arrived 
in Seoul on Tuesday [7 June] for a six-day visit to South Korea. 
  By the end of last year, South Korea's investment in China 
had reached 550 million U.S. dollars. 
  Kim said that he was happy to see the rapid development of 
Sino- South Korean relations since the two countries established 
diplomatic ties in August 1992. 
  He expressed the belief that Sino-South Korean cooperative 
relations will develop faster than ever in all fields. 
  On China rejoining the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade 
(GATT), Kim said that as a large country, membership in GATT 
will be conducive to China's development and beneficial to the 
rest of the world as well. 
  During the meeting Kim and Wu briefed each other on economic 
development in their countries. 
  Earlier this morning, Wu held talks with South Korean Trade, 
Industry and Resources Minister Kim Chol-su on bilateral 
economic and trade cooperation between China and South Korea.
