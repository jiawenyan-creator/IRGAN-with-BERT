EASTERN EUROPE AND GERMANY 
Following your excellent coverage of the events taking place in Eastern Europe, 
especially the escape of the hundreds or thousands of young East Germans from 
Hungary to the West, I am reliving the moments of joy and euphoria that I felt 
when I escaped from Hungary to Austria with my brother during the night of Nov. 
24, 1956. It is an indescribable feeling that can only be compared to giving 
birth to a child. 
I am very proud of Hungary and would like to thank Austria for helping the 
refugees of Eastern Europe all these years.
