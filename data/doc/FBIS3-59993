  [Text] Zambia, which was recently blamed by international 
donors for an alleged increase in drug business, has put into 
force a new anti-drug law providing for heavier penalties for 
drug offenders. President Frederick Chiluba recently signed the 
Narcotics, Drugs, and Psychotropic Substances Act of 1989 which 
gives officers of the Drug Enforcement Commission wider powers 
and latitude to investigate drug trafficking and use. Under the 
new law persons convicted of trafficking in a narcotic drug or 
psychotropic substance will be jailed for 25 years while illegal 
exporters will go in for 20 years. The law slaps a 10-year jail 
term on any person who helps to launder money known to have been 
obtained from illegal drugs business.
