FT  28 JUL 93 / Ambulance complaints service attacked
POOR service from the London Ambulance Service had been matched by a
complaints system which its chief executive accepted was 'not working at
all', a Commons committee said yesterday.
A report by the Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner for
administration (the ombudsman) says all complaints about ambulance services
mentioned in the health service commissioner's 1991-92 report involved
London.
Two thirds related to its accident and emergency service, with 75 per cent
of all complaints concerning delays.
The failure of the London computerised dispatch system last year resulted in
a report severely criticising the management of the London Ambulance
Service.
Mr Martin Gorman, who later became its chief executive, told the committee
he had inherited a complaints system that was not working at all. Describing
the situation as 'appalling', the committee commends Mr Gorman for
increasing staff to clear a backlog of complaints.
It was clear, it says, that there had been 'wholly ineffective supervision
of complaints' by the management of South West Thames regional health
authority, which is responsible for the London service.
On the general issue of National Health Service complaints the committee
foundthat the system is given a low priority, with under-qualified staff and
wholly inadequate supervision.
