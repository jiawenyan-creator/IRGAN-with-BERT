UC IRVINE SAILORS DESERVE RECOGNITION 
Jim Murray rightly acknowledges the fine tradition and coaching of Eddie 
Merrins golf program at UCLA; and the focus on the 1988 National Collegiate 
Championship for UCLA golf team is surely justified. 
However, in recognizing other L.A. area national championship teams in 1988, he 
neglected to mention the UC Irvine sailing team. Collegiate sailing is perhaps 
the most demanding and competitive sailing in the world, and graduates of its 
ranks go on to be the sport's Olympic medalists and even America's Cup 
competitors. In 1988, Irvine won both the Dinghy National Championship and the 
Team Racing Championship. Irvine also had four skippers and one crew earn 
All-American honors. 
Frankly, Coach Craig Wilson's Anteater sailing team deserves far more 
recognition and credit than has been afforded it by the L.A. Times.
