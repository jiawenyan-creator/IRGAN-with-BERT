BLUE LINE RIDERSHIP UP AGAIN 
Ridership on Los Angeles' light rail system increased Wednesday as an estimated 
38,000 passengers, many of them youngsters and families on sightseeing rides, 
took advantage of the Blue Line's free fares and air-conditioned cars. 
"We were running extra trains during the midday period and had heavy loads all 
day," said Art Leahy, director of transit operations for the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District. 
Wednesday's 38,000 riders eclipsed the passenger volume on each of the first 
two weekdays of service and raised the total number of passengers to more than 
204,000 since the electric trolleys began operating last weekend. 
The only problems reported Wednesday were a faulty switch and a 17-minute delay 
for the trolleys that occurred when a Southern Pacific freight train crossed 
their tracks, transit officials said. 
No arrests were reported on the line Wednesday, they said. 
While ridership has surpassed original estimates, the popularity of the Blue 
Line also has caused some headaches for transit officials. 
Leahy said several hundred stranded passengers had to be taken from Wardlow 
Station on Tuesday night and bused to downtown Los Angeles after they boarded 
the last scheduled trains from Anaheim Station, despite warnings that those 
particular trains did not run to the end of the line. 
"Some of the people are enjoying this so much that they would really ride the 
train all night long if they could," Leahy said. 
Transit officials have credited the free fares for much of the passenger 
volume. The free rides will continue through July 31. 
Beginning Aug. 1, a flat fare of $1.10 will be charged. RTD monthly bus passes 
also will be honored.
