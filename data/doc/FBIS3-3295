  [Text] Shanghai, March 17 (XINHUA) -- The property 
development sector is in good health in Shanghai's Pudong New 
Area and will make further progress under the continuing 
favorable policies, according to a recent official survey. 
  Zhu Chunhong, one of the survey's sponsors from the 
management committee in the area, said that most of the real 
estate companies are well organised, since qualified 
professionals make up over 70 percent of the staff in 199 
companies out of 205 sampled. Some 80 percent of the firms have 
sound accounts and good management, he said. 
  Housing construction has also kept up a reasonable growth 
rate, he said. 
  In the period from May, 1992, to June, 1993, some 300 such 
projects were approved in Pudong, to cost 16 billion yuan and 
covering an area of 2,000 hectares. 
  So far, 180 projects have started construction, with 
ordinary 
commercial houses making up for 47 percent of the planned floor 
space, and luxury ones, 18 percent. 
  Zhu said that 38 ha. of land belonging to 15 companies has 
been reclaimed by the government, because the projects have 
failed to go into operation within two years.
