FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bombardier launches business jet
programme
Bombardier, the international aerospace and transit equipment group,
yesterday launched its long-range Global Express business jet programme. The
aircraft will have a range up to 6,500 nautical miles, longer than its
competitor, the Gulfstream V.
The aircraft's first flight is due in 1996 and it should go into service in
1998. The base selling price will be about USDollars 28m, plus interior
fittings.
Its development will cost almost CDollars 1bn (USDollars 747m) and will be
shared between Bombardier, BMW Rolls-Royce, the engine builder, and
Mitsubishi of Japan, which will build the wings and centre fuselage, and
possibly others.
The aircraft is a new design, though Bombardier has benefited from its
experience with its regional jet, a 50-seater commuter aircraft.
Bombardier has 30 firm orders, eight short-term options and is negotiating
12 more sales for a total backlog of USDollars 1bn.
A large order from mid-east customers in November helped to swing the
decision, and Bombardier sees a total world market of about 800 for such
long-range business jets.
