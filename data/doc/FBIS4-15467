<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Strategic Bomber Accord With Ukraine </F>
Not Reached"] 
  [Text] Petr Deynekin, commander-in-chief of the Russian 
Federation Air Force, has intimated that no "mutually acceptable 
agreement" on the turning over to Russia of strategic bombers 
stationed on Ukraine's territory has been reached so far. 
According to him, the stumbling block at the talks is the 
"astronomical" sum the Ukrainian side is asking for the transfer 
of the bombers. Ukraine wishes to pay around 700 billion rubles 
of its debt to Russia in 42 aircraft. In the Russian side's 
view, the figure should be some 200 billion rubles.
