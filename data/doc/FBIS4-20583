  [Text] Due to the resemblance of the crystalline structure 
between graphite and hexagonal BN, the generation of new curious 
properties, both electrical and optical, are expected by 
synthesizing the hybrid ceramic alloy such as BCN. 
  In the several investigations[.sup]1-4[/] on the 
preparation of BCN by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 
method, BCl[.sub]3[/] and NH[.sub]3[/] have been used 
mainly as boron and nitrogen source materials, respectively. 
Materials such as C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]2[/], CH[.sub]3[/], 
C[.sub]3[/]H[.sub]8[/], and CCl[.sub]4[/], have been 
used as carbon sources. 
  In this paper, BCN films are deposited by metal organic CVD 
using triethylboron (TEB) and ammonia as a source materials. The 
apparatus used in this experiment is a horizontal type quartz 
reaction tube (50_P_ x 500L) with an external heating 
electrical 
furnace. Silicon and fused quartz plate (12 x 12 x 
0.4mm[.sup]3[/]) are used as substrate and are set on a 
graphite pedestal at an angle of 3 to the horizon. The 
substrate temperature was 700[.sub]c[/]C to 1050C and 
the ratio of TEB to NH[.sub]3[/] was 0 to 10. Hydrogen or 
argon was used as the carrier gas of TEB and its effect to the 
films deposited was examined. 
  The composition of the films deposited at 750C using 
hydrogen carrier gas is shown in Figure 1 as a function of molar 
ratio of ammonia to TEB. The composition is determined by 
electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). Nitrogen content in the 
film increases with increasing ammonia steeply at first and then 
gently at above NH[.sub]3[/]/TEB=0.8. The contents of boron 
and carbon in the film decrease with increasing ammonia. From 
this result, it is suggested that the ratio of the three 
components in the film is controlled by the ratio of ammonia to 
TEB. X- ray diffractograms of deposits show very wide 
diffraction line corresponding to 002 planes of hexagonal BN and 
graphite. The deposits seem to be microcrystalline or amorphous.
