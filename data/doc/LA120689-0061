METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAPD, SHERIFF AND CHP AIDING MADD PROGRAM 
Three Los Angeles area law enforcement agencies joined with Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving to encourage area restaurants to participate in a designated 
driver program, Sandy Freeman, president of MADD's Los Angeles chapter told a 
press conference Tuesday. 
Officers from the California Highway Patrol, Los Angeles Police Department and 
the Sheriff's Department have been querying restaurant owners about whether 
they will join the program, Freeman said. Participating owners have agreed to 
ask patron groups if they will designate one person in their party to refrain 
from drinking to help ensure that the others have a safe ride home. As part of 
the program, the designated driver is given free non-alcoholic drinks, she 
said. 
After two years of promotion by MADD, about 125 restaurants in the county are 
participating or have agreed to join the program, Freeman said.
