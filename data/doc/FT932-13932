FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Huntleigh doubles to Pounds 5.5m
HUNTLEIGH Technology, the maker of pneumatic hospital mattresses that
relieve bed sores, yesterday reported a doubling of profits and an even
larger increase in earnings.
Helped by rapid growth in its new ultrasonic blood pressure gauge, pre-tax
profits advanced from Pounds 2.36m to Pounds 5.54m on sales up 35 per cent
at Pounds 28.4m.
Earnings per share rose from 17.35p to 40.12p and the recommended final
dividend is 6p, giving a total for the year of 10p (4.5p).
A 2-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed to increase the marketability of the
shares which yesterday rose 95p to close at Pounds 10.70p, up from 413p a
year ago.
Huntleigh is today awarded the Queen's Award for technological achievement
for its Dopplex blood pressure diagnostic work.
Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the group had reached an agreement with
Slumberland to develop and distribute therapeutic mattresses to hospitals.
That would extend its own range of mattresses that prevent bed sores in
lower risk patients, a move which will bring the group's products to a
larger market.
Huntleigh is also entering a joint venture with one of its sub-contractors
in the US to manufacture its products. The US currently accounts for 40 per
cent of its sales. Mr Schild said some large customers, like the Veterans
Administration, had a strong preference for buying from US companies.
He added that the company would also invest some of its cash this year to
double production capacity.
Net cash at the period end amounted to some Pounds 2.3m.
During the year Huntleigh expanded the rental depots in the UK, Germany and
the US from which it distributes its own products.
