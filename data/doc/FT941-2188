FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Brightstone for market with Pounds 8.8m tag
Brightstone Properties, the property arm of the collapsed London United
Investments is making an uncharacteristic entrance to the listed property
sector, by placing its shares at a substantial discount to net asset value.
The company has been set up to buy Brightstone Estates from the
administrators of Walbrook, an LUI subsidiary, for Pounds 8.15m. It will
have an initial market capitalisation of Pounds 8.75m, compared with a net
asset value of Pounds 10.3m, or 147p per share.
Brightstone has placed 6.9m shares at 125p, and Mr Richard Jacobs, the chief
executive, has subscribed for a further 100,000.
The directors will own 13 per cent of Brightstone, and other backers will
include PDFM, Jupiter Tyndall and Clerical Medical Managed Funds.
Despite the collapse of its parent group, Brightstone remained profitable
throughout the recent property slump and has been managed independently.
Brightstone's net worth grew from Pounds 3.1m in 1982 to Pounds 10.25m, and
its property portfolio is currently yielding 10 per cent against its
December valuation of Pounds 12.9m.
Of the portfolio 69 per cent is in the east Midlands, although Central House
in Croydon is valued at Pounds 3.1m, accounting for 24 per cent of the
portfolio.
Mr Richard Jacobs, chief executive, said Brightstone's properties had
primarily been developed by the group. After suffering from the financial
restraints imposed on its parent company, it plans to resume an active
development programme.
The company is sitting on Pounds 3.7m of cash, which will be partially used
to repay Pounds 1m of a Pounds 5.3m debenture. Pre-tax profit amounted to
Pounds 400,000 in 1993, but property income was double debt repayments. The
shares are being issued on a notional net yield of 3 per cent.
