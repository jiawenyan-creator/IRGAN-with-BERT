FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems to support Maastricht
treaty
MR Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said that although the
Maastricht treaty had failed to provide democratic accountability for the
European institutions it created, his party would still support the bill.
The Liberal Democrats believed the treaty was 'a step forward that must be
taken and that it would be a disaster for Britain and for Europe were it not
to be ratified'.
At Westminster last night, the party's MPs voted to replace European affairs
spokesman Sir Russell Johnston as deputy leader with Treasury spokesman Mr
Alan Beith.
