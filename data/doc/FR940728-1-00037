 

Proposed Action 



The EPA is proposing to reclassify the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment area from a marginal nonattainment area
to a moderate nonattainment area. This action also proposes a determination that the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton,
NJ-PA; Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY ozone
nonattainment areas classified as marginal have attained the ozone air quality standard by the attainment date of
November 15, 1993. These actions are based on measured ozone air quality levels during the years 19911993.


Nothing in this proposed rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future
request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from review Under Executive Order 12866. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 

Reclassification of nonattainment areas under Section 181 of the Act do not create any new requirements. Therefore,
because the federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant
impact on small entities. Moveover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state
action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.
