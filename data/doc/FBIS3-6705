  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- A Japanese business leader 
Thursday [17 March] called for income tax reduction as a 
permanent measure based on "correction of the imbalance between 
direct and indirect taxation." 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, made the remark at an annual general meeting of the 
chamber attended by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Referring to the current economic situation, Inaba said 
there 
is a slight sign of recovery in Japanese corporate sentiment 
concerning the prolonged economic slowdown. 
  On strained trade relations between Japan and the United 
States, Inaba said, "we are in a severe situation." 
  Japan should present some concrete measures to the U.S. to 
improve the bilateral trade in place of the numerical targets 
which Washington has been demanding, he said. 
  But the prime minister was right to disagree with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton at their February summit in Washington on 
setting such objective criteria as part of the economic 
framework talks between the two nations, Inaba said. 
  In a speech at the meeting, Hosokawa said, "The three 
working 
groups of the headquarters promoting administrative reform are 
expected to come up with effective measures. A bill is also 
going to be presented to the Diet to set up an independent body 
equipped with strong surveillance." 
  He added that he hoped these combined efforts would also 
bring about positive results for the relationship between Japan 
and the United States.
