  [Text] Manila, March 20 (CNA) -- The Philippine Department 
of Trade and Investment (DTI) has reached an agreement with 
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs on a long-term loan 
assistance program for the development of small and medium sized 
enterprises. 
  DTI Undersecretary Tomas I. Alcantara said the Taiwan 
Government has agreed to extend loans worth US$10 million 
through the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund 
and the Industrial Cooperation Center. 
  The amount, however, could be increased to US$100 million 
after two years depending on the success of the initial program 
and on the needs of the users. 
  Under the plan, the amount will be lent to the Development 
Bank of the Philippines [DBP] for a 10-year period with an 
annual interest rate of 3 percent and a three year grace period. 
  The DBP will in turn re-lend the money to the private sector 
for a maximum of five years at lower than market rates, 
Alcantara said. 
  At least five sectors have been considered for the 
assistance 
package, including the metal, tool and die, garment, component 
manufacturing, and equipment and electric industries, he added.
