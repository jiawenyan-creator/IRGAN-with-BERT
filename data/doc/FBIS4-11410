<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus with </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [O GLOBO] Your privatization program is considered a 
success. Some analysts nonetheless consider that the situation 
could change, with the cutting of subsidies to companies. What 
do you think of this? 
  [Klaus] The foreign media always state that we have a low 
unemployment rate because companies continue to receive 
subsidies. A bankruptcy law, as the West understands it, has 
existed in our country for more than a year, and the government 
does not interfere in bankruptcy processes. The low 
unemployment rate is due to the effort made by companies to 
reorganize themselves and seek new markets and products. 
  [O GLOBO] Why didn't the GDP of your country increase last 
year? 
  [Klaus] The Czech Republic is completing its radical 
transformation to create a market economy. One of the 
inevitable phenomena is the elimination of several activities 
linked with central planning, which in a market economy cannot 
survive. 
  [O GLOBO] What will be the benefits to joining the European 
Union? 
  [Klaus] Given that our most important partners are or will 
be 
members of the EU, and given our links with a more integrated 
Europe, our association is essential.
