  [Text] The Conservative Party National Directorate today 
seriously called to question the government and former President 
Julio Cesar Turbay, the Liberal Party director. Barely 12 days 
before congressional elections and with three kidnapped 
candidates and 500 municipalities in which political campaigns 
are banned because of domination by the guerrillas, the 
conservatives spoke out. The statement indicates that the 
government has been incapable of providing guarantees for the 
exercise of political rights. Here is what Conservative Party 
Deputy Cornelio Reyes said: 
  [Begin Reyes recording] The Colombian Government does not 
have the capacity to provide guarantees in over 500 
municipalities. [end recording] 
  The government, through Government Minister Fabio Villegas, 
assures that everything is normal and that elections will be 
held. 
  [Being Villegas recording] All Colombians, through their 
vote, want to go to the polls on 13 March to reject violence and 
terrorism as a political [word indistinct]. [end recording] 
  With the Liberal Party convention around the corner choosing 
a candidate, the Conservative Party Directorate has asked its 
party members to abstain from participating after labeling as 
outlandish former President Turbay's insinuation of alleged 
interference.
