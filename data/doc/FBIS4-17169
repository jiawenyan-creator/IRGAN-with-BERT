  [Text] Yakutsk -- Yakutia's State Assembly has declined to 
discuss the draft agreement on reaching civil accord in Russia. 
The deputies motivated their decision by their unwillingness to 
become involved in political gambles at the top. In their 
opinion, the nationally approved Constitution of Russia may 
serve the goals of civil accord quite well.
