  [Text] Moscow March 15 TASS -- "Local self-government was 
described as "the basis of political stability of the state and 
social welfare of the population" by the leader of the PRES 
[Party of Unity and Accord] Duma faction Sergey Shakhray, who is 
also the federal minister of nationalities and regional policy. 
  Shakhray said in his speech in the State Duma's hearings 
about local government reform that 80 per cent of people's vital 
interests are realized at local level. 
  Shakhray said reform of local self-government would help 
bring closer together the taxpayer and the territorial bodies of 
power and thus reduce the influence of the central power on the 
inhabitants of regions, which, in turn, "will ease the tension 
of the struggle for power in the state as a whole". 
  In the course of reforms, three levels of state government 
will emerge: the federal level, the level of the component parts 
of the federation, and the level of local government, Shakhray 
said. 
  With this in view, the country needs a system of agreements 
among the component parts of the federation and bodies of local 
government on the division of powers and authority. 
  Shakhray stressed that the local governments must be granted 
the right to independently handle the necessary financial 
resources, which makes it expedient to reform the budget and tax 
system, because "the situation is absolutely abnormal where 
two-thirds of Russia's component parts survive on subsidies from 
the centre", Shakhray said. 
  According to him, the reform of the budget and tax system 
must result in a rational distribution of the taxation base 
"within a normally functioning state," in which 20 per cent of 
all taxes will go to meet the federal needs, thirty per cent to 
meet the needs of the component parts of the Russian Federation 
and not less than fifty per cent of all tax revenue must remain 
at the local level. 
  Shakhray said the bodies of local self-government should 
have 
the inalienable right to dispose of municipal property and 
municipal land at their discretion as the guarantee of their 
economic independence.
