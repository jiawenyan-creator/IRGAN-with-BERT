FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc producers plan smelter
closures
EUROPEAN ZINC producers decided yesterday to press ahead rapidly with a
scheme to eliminate substantial over-capacity by the permanent closure of
one or two smelters. The cost of the so-called 'shut-down' scheme would be
paid for by the rest of the industry.
An independent assessor has been taking soundings during confidential
discussions with industry representatives for the past three months, and his
report, presented to senior executives yesterday, showed that the scheme was
feasible and that there were a number of smelters willing to be considered
for closure.
'This is a very serious project now,' one industry executive said after the
meeting in Brussels. The producers will now work on the difficult details -
how much capacity should be closed, how much it would cost and how the rest
of the industry would contribute towards the cost.
They must also get European Commission approval, but this should not prove
difficult because the Commission gave the go-ahead to a similar scheme in
1982. That scheme came to nothing because prices rose, easing pressure for
cuts.
However, last year Union Miniere, on its own account, closed its zinc
smelter at Overpelt, Belgium, and with it 100,000 tonnes of capacity.
Some zinc traders hoped to hear something more dramatic from the European
producers yesterday so, after touching Dollars 961 a tonne at one stage,
zinc for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange eased back to
close last night at Dollars 951, up Dollars 2.50 a tonne.
'The market was holding its breath and anticipating some sort of cutback
now, not more talks,' said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
He said a fundamental refined zinc supply surplus, likely to be about
420,000 tonnes this year, was putting severe pressure on prices, which
reached a six-year low of Dollars 927 a tonne in July. The closure of only
one smelter might not be enough to bring the market back into balance.
While European producers seem unified over the shutdown scheme, they are
split over whether to restrict imports from the Commonwealth of Independent
States, which are adding to the industry's severe difficulties.
