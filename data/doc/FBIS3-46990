  [Text] Vientiane, January 7 (KPL) -- Last year, the rice 
harvest of both dry and rainy seasons in Khammouane totalled 
76,986 tons of paddy. The second rice crop's turned out 3,856 
tons while the highland rice farming yielded 1,430 tons. 
  According to an official of the local agriculture service, 
the output may not meet the demand in consumption of 230,000 
residents in this central province. Accordingly, rice shortage 
is likely to loom over the province for two months this year. 
  The shortfall in rice production in Khammouane was due to 
severe floods, drought and pests which damaged 3,321 ha 
[hectares] of farmland. 
  In compensation for the losses, the agriculture service has 
encouraged for the cultivation of starchy crops and for rice 
farming on 154 ha with an expected yield of 4.45 tons of paddy 
per ha.
