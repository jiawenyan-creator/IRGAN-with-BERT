MORE BAILOUT FUNDS FOR S&amp;LS 
I hope that every voter in California saw Conrad's cartoon on Sen. Alan 
Cranston (Nov. 12) "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The shadow 
knows!" and read the front-page story ("Bush Hints He May Oust Top Thrift 
Overseer"), noting that Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other senators received 
$1.3 million in political contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr., Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan's chairman. 
The fact that Cranston's intervention with regulators on Lincoln's behalf has 
resulted in a $2-billion bill to be paid by the taxpayers, will, hopefully, be 
remembered on election day. Keating deserves to be in jail, and Cranston, most 
assuredly, does not deserve to be in the U.S. Senate!
