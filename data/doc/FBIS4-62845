  [Text] Chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian 
parliament Vladimir Shumeyko believes that before joining the 
program Partnership for Peace, it is necessary to see whether 
Russia will lose on its interests and what it stands to gain 
from putting its signature under the document. 
  I believe there is not need to hurry up with the solution of 
the problem, he said in an interview with Interfax. 
  Shumeyko said that jokingly he calls the Partnership for 
Peace program, the "partnership for NATO" program . 
  He favored an immediate creation of CIS peace-keeping 
forces. 
He said that at present about 15,000 Russian military 
servicemen are performing peace-keeping functions in the 
republics of the former Soviet Union, while Russia alone carries 
all the financial burden for them. 
  Shumeyko said that the CSCE and the United Nations are 
unable 
to carry out in the CIS countries serious peace-keeping 
operations due to a shortage of finances.
