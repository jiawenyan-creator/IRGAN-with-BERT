GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER 
Ron Linden's new pieces take the solid roundness of a circle and whittle away 
at it from the sides leaving the remainder to ruminate on ideas of wholeness. 
Several consist of one unpainted round wood panel cleanly sliced through by 
partial ellipses. The remaining flat shape resembles the head of a two-sided 
ax. 
Each orb speaks in emblematic, even heraldic terms about monumentality and 
completeness. We wind up considering the significance of sliced-out sections in 
pieces such as "Study for Deadwood" or casting their absence in symbolic light, 
as in the political eulogy of "Rally." 
Linden's work, with its manipulation of abstract, private symbols is 
intellectually complex and often hard to penetrate. In good post-modern 
tradition the objects reveal themselves to be involved in a self-conscious kind 
of discussion that states "I'm making art that talks about art, even while it 
deals with other issues." Where this work proves most enlightening is in its 
exploration of perceived wholeness. The circle is used as both an opening and a 
passing phase of openness -- framing and fragmenting constructed reality.
