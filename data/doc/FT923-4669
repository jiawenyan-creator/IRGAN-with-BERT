FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Arvis resigns from Groupe
Victoire
MR Jean Arvis (56) is to resign as chairman of Groupe Victoire, one of
France's larger insurance groups next month.
He will be replaced by Mr Gerard Worms, a prominent figure in French finance
who heads Suez, the company that controls Victoire.
Victoire is enmeshed in a controversial series of negotiations between Mr
Worms and Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris
(UAP), the biggest French insurer, over UAP's plans to swap part of its
holding in Victoire for shares in Colonia, a German insurance company.
