Stock, $1.00 Par Value; Common Stock Purchase Rights) File No. 110105</DOCTITLE>



February 1, 1994.



Matlack Systems, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d22(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock and common stock purchase rights
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock and common stock purchase rights
commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on December 9, 1993 and concurrently therewith such stock
was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not believe that dual trading of its securities on both the NYSE and Amex would be advantageous, but
rather, that such a dual listing might fragment the market for the common stock.

Any interested person may, on or before February 23, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.
