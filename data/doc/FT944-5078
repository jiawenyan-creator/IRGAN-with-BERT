FT  06 DEC 94 / Pena visit to Taipei steps up US links
Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary, yesterday called on Taiwan's
foreign ministry, the first US cabinet official to do so in 15 years in a
sign of Washington support for the island's democratic reforms and
recognition of its growing economic clout.
Mr Pena visited Mr Fredrick Chien, foreign minister, stepping up bilateral
ties despite previous objections by China. The meeting was significant as
Beijing tolerates economic ties but frowns on those carrying diplomatic
import.
The Clinton administration official is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of
the US-Taiwan Economic Council, a private business organisation. He is to
meet Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui, Mr Lien Chan, the premier, and other
officials.
Washington severed diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 in favour of Beijing.
The US has since maintained strong but low-profile informal ties with
Taiwan.
On Saturday, Taiwan held elections for provincial governor for the first
time and the first elections in three decades for city mayors. Pressure from
the US Congress, supportive of Taiwan's democratisation, led the
administration to upgrade ties in September, after the first review of
Taiwan policy since 1979.
Mr Pena is only the second US cabinet official to visit Taiwan since 1979.
Ms Carla Hills, then US trade representative, came to the island in 1992 but
did not meet the foreign minister.
Mr Pena yesterday met American Chamber of Commerce members to discuss
infrastructure projects in Taiwan. A high-speed railway, urban mass transit
systems and a fourth nuclear power plant are among projects planned or under
way. He also met Mr Vincent Siew, chairman of Taiwan's planning ministry.
Today he is due to witness a Dollars 226m (Pounds 141m) contract signing by
Westinghouse Electric of the US and Taiwan's environmental protection agency
to build two solid-waste incinerators on the island.
