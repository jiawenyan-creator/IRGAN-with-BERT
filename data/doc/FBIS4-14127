  [Excerpts] What is taking place between Palestine President 
Yasir 'Arafat and the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas? This 
question is being posed in light of the reported contacts 
between the two parties, especially after Hamas' pledge to Yasir 
'Arafat to name him president if he voices commitment to 
implement Islamic law. 
  Hamas' pledge seems to have been taken seriously by Yasir 
'Arafat, who unhesitatingly held contacts with this movement's 
leaders in Gaza through Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt to 
ask them to meet him in Cairo after his meeting with Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Hamas' pledge, however, was not taken seriously by the other 
Palestinian rejectionist factions that are allied with Hamas 
under the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. [passage omitted] 
  The Palestinian president has prepared a complete file for 
the Cairo meeting. The file primarily addresses the situation 
in Gaza under the autonomy and spells out foundations for the 
relationship between the Hamas movement and the self-rule 
authority. 
  SAWT AL-SHA'B has learned that 'Arafat will propose that 
Hamas take over the Gaza municipality in a preemptive attempt to 
prevent it from asking for half the seats of the self-rule.
