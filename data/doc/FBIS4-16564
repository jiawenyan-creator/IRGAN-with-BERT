Zhirinovskiy's Election Campaign Was Financed by the Former 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany" -- ITAR-TASS headline] 
  [Text] Moscow, 16 Apr -- The Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia [LDPR] has not received any money from the former 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany in order to conduct an election 
campaign, Stanislav Zarichankiy, an official in the LDPR's 
organizational department, declared today in a conversation with 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "We know of no Berlin company called 
'TFO,' which is supposed to have transferred money to the LDPR's 
funds," he said. "We regard this as an attempt by the German 
paper to mislead the public."
