FT  12 MAY 93 / Mermaid Inn to be sold
THE MERMAID, one of England's oldest inns, has joined the list of casualties
in the depressed UK hotel market. The 15th-century hotel in Rye, East Sussex
 -once a favourite haunt for smugglers such as the Hawkhurst desperadoes -
has been in receivership since March and has now been put up for sale by
receivers Arthur Andersen. They are inviting offers in excess of Pounds 1m.
