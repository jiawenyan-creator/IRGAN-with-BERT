FT  23 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Japanese ready for US pension demands
Japan's financial authorities are preparing to meet US demands that Tokyo
opens the management of its state pension fund. The authorities are putting
together a proposal to present to the financial service negotiations between
the two countries which will be held in Seattle next week.
The US government has long been lobbying for the Japanese government to
allow investment advisory companies to enter the country's Y20,000bn
(Dollars 200bn) public pension fund market, currently limited to life
assurers and trust banks. The issue has been a centrepiece in the financial
service negotiations which form part of continuing US-Japan framework talks
on bilateral trade.
In 1990, investment advisory companies were allowed into the private pension
fund market but foreign managers have failed to make a significant
breakthrough because of business practices based on long-term relationships.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare, which governs the state pension fund
system, has also been calling for deregulation in order to diversify fund
investments. However, it has come up against the Ministry of Finance which
regards itself as the bastion of prudent investments for state funds and
which has opposed deregulation, citing the possible increase in stock
investments regarded as high-risk.
The Japanese government is keen to reach an early settlement of the
financial service talks before Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's visit to
the US scheduled for early January. 'An earlier settlement is highly
desirable, although we are not promising to conclude the talks within this
year,' Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, said yesterday.
Details of the finance ministry's proposal are expected to be revealed early
next week. Local papers have reported that finance ministry officials intend
to allow investment advisory firms into the market by setting up an
'investment union' with a trust bank.
