FT  16 JUN 92 / Union to reject 'beauty contests'
THE GMB general workers' union is to become the first large union to refuse
to take part in 'beauty contests' in which employers decide which
organisation should represent their workers.
The decision at yesterday's annual GMB conference reflects growing
dissatisfaction among unions with a system many believe is undemocratic and
leaves victorious unions relatively powerless. It will lead other large
unions, particularly the TGWU general union, to consider their participation
in future contests.
The decision will also further strengthen the hand of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union which, through its two wings, has been by
far the most successful union in recent years at winning contests.
Beauty contests are often used by overseas companies, particularly Japanese
ones, when they set up plants in the UK and want only one union to represent
workers. The system was strongly criticised at last year's annual conference
of the Trades Union Congress.
The decision comes in a week when a study of the Nissan car plant in
Sunderland claims that the role of the AEEU, which won a beauty contest
there in the 1980s, is merely that of an onlooker.
Membership of the union at the plant is less than 50 per cent of the
workforce, although penetration among blue-collar workers is significantly
higher.
