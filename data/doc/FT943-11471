FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Matsushita Electric eyes India
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics
group, will establish a marketing subsidiary in India by the end of this
year, following approval from the New Delhi government.
Japanese consumer electronics makers have been showing increasing interest
in the Indian market due to its size and growth potential. Sony, another
leading electronics maker, recently applied for government approval to
launch its first television production plant there.
Matsushita said it would start producing this autumn 150,000 colour
television sets and 350,000 audio visual products a year through Salora
International, a consumer electronics maker based in New Delhi with which
the Japanese company has a technical co-operation agreement. The new Indian
subsidiary will provide after-sales services and handle publicity.
