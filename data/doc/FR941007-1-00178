 

Supplemental Instructions 
for Collection of Data In Connection With Small Business and Small Farm Loans





A. Format 



Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm 
loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants 
or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written 
application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership 
on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction 
with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information 
at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the 
information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you 
neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the 
information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is 
to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported 
to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. 



B. Procedures 



1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to 
provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this 
information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 

2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the 
form. 

3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this 
information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from 
discriminating on these bases.
