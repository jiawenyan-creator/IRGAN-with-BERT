  [Text] One of possible candidates for prime minister as 
mentioned in the discussions of Riigikogu [parliament] factions 
with President Lennart Meri, MP Uno Mereste, claimed to be 
surprised at being mentioned in that context. 
  Presidential advisor Rain Rosimannus admitted on Friday that 
Tiit Vuhi and Uno Mereste had been mentioned as possible 
candidates for the post. Mereste commented to the POSTIMEES 
that no one had discussed the matter with him, although he had 
heard some vague rumours. He added that he is not among the 
most active critics of Mart Laar's government.
