METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL BACKS FIRST STEP ON FREEWAY EXTENSION 
Moving from pencil to pavement, the staff of the California Transportation 
Commission has recommended approval of a crucial first step in the 
controversial extension of the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena. 
Despite bitter objections from local officials and South Pasadena residents, 
transportation officials recommended that the commission earmark $4.8 million 
in a new master building plan to begin right-of-way acquisition for completion 
of the heavily traveled roadway between the Foothill Freeway and Valley 
Boulevard in Alhambra. 
Even though the staff recommended -- and the commission is expected to approve 
-- this first step toward completing the gap, it is far from becoming reality. 
Still to be completed is the environmental process and a detailed plan of how 
and where the roadway will be built, commission officials said.
