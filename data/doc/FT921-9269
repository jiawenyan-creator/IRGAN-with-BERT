FT  13 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Menem condemns 'diktat' of EC farmers on
Gatt
ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem made a direct appeal to the European
Community yesterday to override 'the diktat' of its farmers and compromise
over agricultural subsidies in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations.
In a speech to the European Parliament at the start of a tour of EC
countries, Mr Menem said that by failing to agree to compromise proposals on
farm trade the Community risked sparking a trade war.
'The reluctance of certain European governments to accept a progressive
dismantling of agricultural subsidies will bring with it serious
consequences for international trade,' the Argentine leader said. 'Can the
principle of free trade, which should govern trade relations, be
subordinated in the area of agriculture to the diktat of a definitively
minority sector?'
Argentina is a member of the Cairns group campaigning for a liberalisation
of farm trade in the current round of talks on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Menem also appealed to European companies to participate in his country's
privatisation programme.
