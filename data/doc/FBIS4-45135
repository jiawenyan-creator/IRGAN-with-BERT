  [Text] Baku, June 13 (TURAN) -- "The Gabala Radio-Locator 
station remains under Russia's jurisdiction and it will be used 
within the framework of the CIS Collective Security Pact," said 
the head of Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, Azad Alizade [name 
and title as received], to TURAN. 
  On June 11, Pavel Grachev and President Aliyev concluded a 
preliminary agreement on this matter. "A principal agreement 
will be worked out by specialists of both countries and after 
that a final document will be signed," said Alizade. The same 
source said that the staff of employees of that station will 
include Russian military personnel and a few Azeri soldiers. 
  Another source from Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry told TURAN 
that Russia will use the radio-locator station free of charge 
and in exchange, Moscow has allegedly promised to "make other 
concessions to Azerbaijan in military affairs." 
  The Gabala radio-station was built in 1982-84 and it is the 
most powerful station in the south of the former USSR. It is 
used to observe the launching of ballistic missiles.
