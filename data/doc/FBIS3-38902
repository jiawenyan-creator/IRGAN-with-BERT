  [Text] The Swedish Government might accept air strikes in 
Bosnia despite the fact that Swedish UN soldiers are present in 
Bosnia. This was said by Ulf Dinkelspiel, minister of foreign 
trade and European affairs, at a meeting of the EU Council of 
Ministers today. Dinkelspiel also said that it is not the time 
to withdraw the Swedish soldiers even though air strikes could 
lead to retaliation attacks from the Bosnian Serbs.
