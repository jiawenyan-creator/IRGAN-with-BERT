THE SIDELINES; 
ARIZONA BARS CRITICIZED REFEREE 
Veteran referee Roger Yanez, who came under criticism for his handling of a 
one-sided fight here last month, will not be allowed to work any more bouts 
this year, state boxing officials said. 
Buzz Alston, commissioner of the Arizona State Boxing Commission, said the 
decision was made after a review of Yanez's performance during the Alex 
Garcia-Bernard Benton fight Oct. 9 at the La Mancha Athletic Club. 
Benton, a former World Boxing Council cruiserweight champion, was pinned in a 
corner and knocked unconscious by Garcia at 2:42 of the second round. 
Commission officials said that Yanez was not in a proper position to make a 
timely decision and that Benton was left defenseless -- taking 32 unanswered 
punches before falling face down on the canvas. 
The fight was televised live nationally on USA Cable, and La Mancha employees 
said their switchboard was deluged with telephone calls in protest of Yanez's 
handling of the fight.
