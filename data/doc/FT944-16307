FT  14 OCT 94 / Confidence improves in EU
Business and consumer confidence is improving across the European Union,
according to the latest survey from the European Commission. The survey's
industrial confidence indicator is compiled from business people's replies
on a number of issues, such as order books and selling price expectations.
In September, the industrial confidence indicator improved to zero, from -1
in August and -14 in the first quarter of the year. The Commission said a
rise in order books was mainly responsible for the improvement in sentiment.
The consumer confidence indicator also improved from -14 in August to -12 in
September. The main reason for the upturn was that consumers were more
confident about the general economic situation; there was no improvement in
their expectations for their own finances. The most confident consumers were
to be found in Ireland and the least confident in Portugal. Among
industrialists, Ireland also topped the confidence polls, while German
business people were the most pessimistic.
