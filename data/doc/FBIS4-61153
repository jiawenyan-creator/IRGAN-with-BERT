  [Text] The Defense Ministry press service reported that 
relative calm has been prevailing all along the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani border since last night. No incidents are

  The picture is different in Nagorno-Karabakh. The active 
military operations continued unceasingly yesterday and last 
night on the northern and northeastern sectors of the front. 
The press service of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] 
Defense Army headquarters reports that the battles in these 
sectors continued in the areas of Talysh and Karmiravan in 
Mardakertskiy Rayon. NKR defense units managed to halt the 
Azerbaijani side's offensives and forced them to retreat to 
their initial positions. 
  The same source reports that relative calm prevailed all 
along the confrontation line this morning. We have not received 
any further information on the situation since then.
