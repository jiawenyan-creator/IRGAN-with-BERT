  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Croatian Foreign Minister 
Mate Granic on Tuesday rejected a plan by the Bosnian government 
to divide the war-torn country into 17 regions. 
  "Only a union (of three ethnic republics) can guarantee the 
future status of Bosnia-Herzegovina," Granic told a meeting of 
the Bosnian Croat self-declared "parliament" in Livno, southern 
Bosnia, in a speech obtained by AFP. 
  Granic said Croatia was "against a return to unrealistic 
positions," alluding to the Bosnian government's plan, which was 
similar to one set out a year ago by international mediator Lord 
Owen and his former colleague Cyrus Vance. 
  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic presented the new plan 
to 
the mainly-Moslem Bosnian parliament on Monday ahead of renewed 
talks between the three warring parties due to be held in Geneva 
on Thursday. Under the proposed plan Bosnia would become a 
"decentralised state, a state of non-ethnic regions." 
  Granic also said it was Croatia's "sacred duty" to help the 
Bosnian Croats, but condemned "Croat extremism" in Bosnia, and 
said some of the HVO's [Croatian Defense Council] actions were 
putting it in an "indefensible position." 
  He cited as examples the massacres of Moslems by the HVO 
last 
year in Ahmici and Stupni Do, the destruction of the old bridge 
in the divided city of Mostar, the blocking of aid convoys and 
"violations of laws on war and humanitarian conduct." 
  But he added that the "Moslem offensive in central Bosnia is 
the main obstacle to a normalisation (of Croat-Moslem relations) 
and shows that the Moslem leadership is opting more and more for 
the military option." 
  Granic confirmed in his speech that he was to meet Bosnian 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Geneva accompanied by Bosnian 
Croat representative Mile Akmadzic and the leader of the Bosnian 
Croat forces (HVO) Ante Roso.
