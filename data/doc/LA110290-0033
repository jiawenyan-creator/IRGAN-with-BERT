VOTER APATHY, DISSATISFACTION 
Many cities have strict ordinances restricting the use of signs on public and 
private properties. 
Yet the same elected public officials who write these laws disregard them at 
election time. Most vacant lots, public walls and street poles are plastered 
with election signs. 
These signs are terrible. Local law enforcement should fine each election 
campaign officer who is responsible and have the signs removed.
