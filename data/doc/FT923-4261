FT  08 SEP 92 / Letter: Which pound gives the fullest tank?
Sir, Driving through Belgium at the weekend, reflecting on the pros and cons
of monetary union, I stopped to fill up the tank only to discover that one
livre anglaise would buy me 52 Belgian francs but that my livre ecossaise
was worth only 50 francs. Is this what Mr Delors means by l'Europe des
regions? The company making this offer? British (sic) Petroleum.
