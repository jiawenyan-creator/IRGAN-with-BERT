FT  22 JUL 93 / Tajik rebel attack injures Russians
Rebels operating from Afghanistan shelled a border post in Tajikistan on
Tuesday night, injuring at least two Russian soldiers, the commander of
Russian troops in the former Soviet republic said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
He told local journalists that the rebels, who fled to Afghanistan last year
after being defeated in a near civil war, had shelled the southern 10th
border post.
The two injured men were serving with the Russian 201st motorised infantry
division, which has been pressed into action to help border guards and Tajik
troops deal with the rebels.
Moscow reacted swiftly after a big rebel attack last week in which 25 border
guards were killed, sending in troop reinforcements to the Central Asian
republic and setting up a new command structure to help counter the attacks.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported serious clashes in the area and said
the situation at a string of border posts along the mountainous frontier was
'extremely serious'.
