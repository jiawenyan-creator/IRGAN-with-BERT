FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada advances
Shares in Granada firmed 10 to 501p after the company unveiled results at
the top end of market expectations. Profits came in at Pounds 103m, a jump
of 51 per cent, with turnover up from Pounds 640.2m to Pounds 941.4m.
Granada shares have been a weak feature in recent sessions as rumours in the
market suggested merger problems with LWT. Yesterday the stock's supporters
were quick to point out the Pounds 4.7m contribution among the 64 per cent
rise in television profits. Smith New Court and NatWest Securities both
reiterated their buy recommendations.
A number of prominent retail stocks weakened in the face of a couple of
large programme trades. Among these, Great Universal Stores slid 20 to 559p,
WH Smith 'A' 10 to 465p and Marks and Spencer 11 1/2 to 380p. Rank
Organisation receded 19 to 359p.
Hoare Govett reiterated its positive stance on MFI ahead of preliminary
results due shortly. The shares hardened a penny to 156p. Laundry group
Sketchley moved forward 5 to 110p after good results, boosted by the first
contribution from Supasnaps, bought in April last year.
There was an element of disappointment in the market with the 13.7 per cent
increase in Northern Ireland Electricity's dividend total. Some of the
utilities sector's super-optimists were said to have been looking for an
increase in the region of 15 to 16 per cent, a figure which would match
potential increases by the regional electricity companies. Switching from
Northern Ireland to the 'recs' left the former 19 lower at 222p.
The building sectors of the market were hit by the general pessimism on
domestic interest rates, which many analysts expect to move up later this
year.
There were very few pockets of resistance in the housebuilders/contractors,
where Bryant Group dipped 3 to 147p, Wimpey 5 to 164p, John Laing 'A' 6 to
292p and Persimmon the same amount to 250p.
CAMAS, the demerged construction materials division of English China Clays,
began trading at 73p and gradually improved to end the session at 76p.
English China Clays, whose shareholders were given one CAMAS share for every
ECC share held, commenced trading in ex-CAMAS form at 355p and settled at
360p.
Wolseley, the builders merchant group, was undermined by news of a placing
of around 7.4m new shares at 748p apiece to fund the purchase of US
photographic equipment group Calumet for Pounds 28m. Wolseley fell 15 to
764p.
Brewers were generally firm as bargain hunting was encouraged with some
broker recommendations. Bass, up a penny at 519p, and recommended by SG
Warburg on Tuesday, was reported to be also tipped by Hoare Govett, the
broker advising a switch out of Guinness, down 5 at 472p. Having held up
well on Tuesday, Grand Metropolitan retreated 14 to 425p. Elsewhere,
Whitbread gained 5 at 519p but Scottish &amp; Newcastle slipped 9 to 505p.
Engineering group Siebe gave up the previous day's advance to close 9 lower
at 547p in volume of 1.8m in nervous trading ahead of today's figures.
NatWest Securities urged investors to look closely at the margins in the
controls division when the figures are published. The engineers team at the
securities house said: 'However good the 1994 results are and however well
supported the shares seem to be on fundamentals, the scope for share price
outperformance will be dictated by how well Siebe's controls margins
respond.' NatWest expects full-year profits for the year to March 1994 to be
Pounds 212.5m.
A stock overhang was reported in British Aerospace, where the shares gave up
6 to 455p. Powell Duffryn, which reports figures today, closed 12 down at
621p.
Worries about increasing competition in the bread market weakened Tomkins,
owner of food manufacturer RHM. The shares relinquished 7 to 214p in trade
of 1.8m.
