FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sparebanken over-estimates
equity capital
SPAREBANKEN, Norway's biggest savings bank, said it had over-estimated its
equity capital partly due to a miscalculation of goodwill at the end of the
first half, Reuter reports.
It said it lowered the bank's group equity capital to 8.74 per cent, still
above the legal minimum, from 9.25 per cent. 'The difference is due to a
miscalculation of goodwill and an incomplete inclusion of deficits from the
bank's subsidiaries,' Sparebanken said.
From the end of 1992, banks' total equity must be at least 8 per cent of
risk-weighted balance sheet items.
