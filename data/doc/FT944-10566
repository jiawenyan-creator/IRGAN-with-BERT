FT  10 NOV 94 / Japanese bonuses increased
Japan's leading electronics companies yesterday said they would increase
workers' bonuses for the first time in four years, a good sign for consumer
spending. Other sectors are unlikely to follow suit this year because they
have done less well than electronics groups. Yet the bonus rise indicates
that the traditional link between workers' incomes and corporate profits has
survived the rigours of recession. Trade unions at the top 17 electronics
groups said yesterday they had accepted six-monthly bonuses averaging 5.06
months' basic salary for this winter and next summer, up from last year's
five months' bonus.
