MORNING REPORT: STAGE 
To Be or Not to Be: Patrick Stewart, who stars on television's "Star Trek: The 
Next Generation," will begin to direct a series of 10-week professional actor's 
workshops of Shakespearean plays Jan. 12. 
Eventually, Stewart, an associate artist of the Royal Shakespeare Company for 
25 years, hopes to produce the Bard's plays in Los Angeles. "My goal is to have 
a company which would be specifically a Shakespearean company," said Stewart. 
The weekly workshops will be at Paramount Studios. CLAUDIA PUIG
