FT  04 JUN 93 / BT cuts price of EC and US calls
BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday cut the price of international calls to
EC countries, Canada and the US by between five and 10 per cent, depending
on the type of call. It also extended discounts for higher volume users. The
changes are in line with a 1991 agreement between BT and Oftel, the industry
regulator, obliging BT to limit the average price change for its main
services in the year to July to 6.25 per cent below inflation.
