FT  11 JUN 93 / People: Safe pair of hands for Ireland's AIB
The biggest company in Ireland has a new chieftain. Jim Culliton, one of
Ireland's most respected industrialists, is to take over the chairmanship of
Allied Irish Banks, following Peter Sutherland's appointment as
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The 59-year-old Culliton, former chief executive of building products group
CRH where he started his career, is more than a dozen years older than
Sutherland, who took on the chairmanship in October 1989 after he stepped
down as a European Community Competition commissioner.
Without the same sort of international profile, as Sutherland, Culliton is
regarded as a safe pair of hands  - important because in addition to losing
its chairman, AIB is also in the process of changing chief executives. Next
March Tom Mulcahy, 51, takes over from Gerry Scanlan, who has been running
AIB for the last nine years. Culliton has been on the AIB board since 1984.
