FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Price increases behind rise at Thames Water
 -Restructuring costs total Pounds 8.5m as 400 jobs are shed
THAMES WATER, the largest of the privatised water companies, yesterday
announced a 6 per cent profits increase for the year ended March 31 1993,
thanks to a strong performance from its regulated business.
Pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 236.3m to Pounds 251.3m mainly because
of average price rises of 9 per cent. At the interim stage, profits were 5
per cent higher at Pounds 124m.
Mr David Luffrum, group finance director, said the results were
'satisfactory given the recession, not only in the UK but also in our
overseas markets'.
Turnover for the 12 months increased from Pounds 899m to Pounds 1.04bn,
lifted by sales from acquisitions which contributed Pounds 76.6m. The
regulated business reported turnover up 7.4 per cent at Pounds 810m and was
affected by reduced measured usage.
There were restructuring costs of Pounds 8.5m as staff numbers were cut by
400 to 6,800. Operating costs increased 16 per cent to Pounds 769.2m.
Thames's unregulated businesses, which include process engineering companies
PWT Worldwide and Utag, reported disappointing pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.8m on sales of Pounds 234.4m.
About Pounds 3.1m of profits, however, stemmed from treasury operations and
several of the operating companies announced losses. Brophy, an associate
involved in environmental services, suffered losses totalling Pounds 2m but
this has been restructured.
A planned dam and pipeline project in Turkey has been delayed, but Mr Mike
Hoffman, group chief executive, said he remained hopeful the project would
be signed this year.
Interest costs increased from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 30.8m as net borrowings
increased nearly Pounds 200m to Pounds 518m in line with the company's
capital expenditure programme. Gearing increased from 21 per cent to 31 per
cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.69bn.
Earnings per share increased 8.2 per cent to 59.3p (54.8p) helped by a lower
advance corporation tax charge following the budget changes.
The company recommended a final dividend of 14.1p to make a total of 21p, a
9 per cent increase. It decided against offering an enhanced scrip dividend
alternative after sounding out some of its larger shareholders.
