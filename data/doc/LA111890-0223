DIVISION 4-A WATER POLO SEMIFINALS; 
IN THE OTHER 4-A SEMIFINAL: 
Long Beach Wilson 8, Corona del Mar 4 -- Three-time defending Division 4-A 
champion Corona del Mar (25-5) is out of the final for the first time since 
1986 after losing at Newport Harbor High. 
Wilson will be playing for its first title since 1981. 
Three consecutive goals by Wilson in the first 3 minutes 25 seconds of the 
second quarter and the goaltending of Nick Fullerton ended the Sea Kings' 
hopes. 
Eric Vinje, Corona del Mar's assistant coach, said: "We came into the game as 
ready as we were going to be, but our press and counterattack were not executed 
as well as we hoped for." 
Aaron Axton, Ted Simpkins, Brent O'Brien and Austin Weir scored for Corona del 
Mar. BOB BORSUM
