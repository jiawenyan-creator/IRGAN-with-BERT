Relaxed Moment"] 
  [Text] Almaty, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Soon after the CAAC 
Boeing-767 special plane with Premier Li Peng and his party on 
board took off from Almaty, the atmosphere in the cabin became 
lively. 
  Over the last 10 days, Premier Li Peng had nearly 20 rounds 
of talks and meetings with leaders of the Central Asian nations; 
repeatedly met with the people from various circles of those 
countries; delivered speeches, signed documents, and met the 
press more than once there. The itinerary was quite tight. 
Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, who accompanied Premier Li 
Peng on the Central Asia tour and served as secretary general of 
the delegation, suggested a performance of talents by those 
present, obviously trying to create a relaxed atmosphere after 
the busy visit. Cabin attendant Zhang Chunxian was the first to 
respond to his suggestion and sang a song. 
  Premier Li Peng came to the rear section of the cabin. He 
thanked the comrades from various departments there and affirmed 
their endeavors during the visits to the four nations. At their 
request, he took the microphone and sang a song -- "Song of 
Guerrillas." Then, he joined his wife Zhu Lin in a duet on 
"Waves on the Honghu Lake" and "In the Yonder Place." The 
couple was followed by other comrades in talent performance, and 
the cabin was full of song and laughter, showing the success of 
the premier's visit to the four Central Asian countries and the 
satisfaction and joy of his entourage. 
  After the impromptu performance over the Tianshan Mountain 
came to an end, Premier Li Peng returned to the front cabin and 
immediately began to discuss work with Ismail Amat and several 
other members of his entourage. Four hours later from then, 
Premier Li Peng would be visiting Mongolia.
