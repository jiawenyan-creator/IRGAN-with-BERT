  [Text] This morning at the Foreign Affairs Ministry in 
Vientiane capital, Souban Salitthilat, foreign affairs minister 
of Laos, and U Maung Maung Lay, ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary of the Union of Myanmar [Burma] to Laos, signed 
an agreement on a set of maps showing the demarcation of a 
common borderline between the two countries. The border maps 
signed today included 24 maps with the scale 1:10,000, showing 
the common border from the north to the south with the total 
length of 236 kilometers; and six border maps showing the 
overall border areas with the scale of 1:50,000. 
  Laos and Myanmar have cooperated with one another in 
conducting a survey to collect data and to draw maps since 1991. 
So far, the task has been completed. This achievement clearly 
shows the effective cooperation between the two sides, aimed at 
turning the common border between the two countries into one of 
genuine peace and friendship.
