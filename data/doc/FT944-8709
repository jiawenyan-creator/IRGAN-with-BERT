FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Eurovein priced at 141p gives Pounds 23m
valuation
Dealings in shares of Eurovein, the Sheffield-based specialist engineering
concern, begin next Thursday following the announcement yesterday of listing
particulars for a placing to raise Pounds 13.55m, net of expenses.
The 10.1m new shares being placed with UK institutions, at a price of 141p,
will represent 61.2 per cent of the enlarged share capital, and give
Eurovein a market capitalisation of Pounds 23.2m.
The deal is an encouraging sign of UK institutions' continued interest in
manufacturing, in a market that has not been easy for flotations. Eurovein
has interests ranging from shotblasting equipment to filtration and machine
knives, and operations in the UK, Germany and Italy.
Mr Bill Eastwood, chief executive, said the placing required a lot of work
from brokers Albert E Sharp, but there was no point where it looked to be at
risk. It was also reasonably priced at a multiple of 11 times last year's
pro-forma earnings.
Eurovein had operating profit of Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.6m) in the year ended
July 31.
The company, whose businesses represent a reconstituted version of the old
quoted concern WA Tyzack, will use the placing proceeds to reduce
significantly its gearing, and provide the flexibility to enhance some of
its existing businesses through investment or acquisition.
