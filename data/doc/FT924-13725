FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cabra to sell two football grounds to third
party
CABRA ESTATES, the heavily indebted property company, is negotiating the
sale of two London football grounds to a third party having failed to reach
agreement with Mr Ken Bates, chairman of Chelsea football club.
Mr Eoin Cotter, Cabra's chief executive, said the buyer was 'financially
reputable' and known to the group's two main banks.
The latest borrowings figure of Pounds 52m dates back to March 1991. Since
then, Mr Cotter said, there had been asset sales, including selling an
interest in a residential developer in Houston.
No balance sheet information was issued with yesterday's results from Cabra
for the year to March, although it said its net assets had fallen to less
than half the called up share capital of Pounds 24m.
This followed pre-tax losses of Pounds 22.1m (loss of Pounds 11.3m) and
further writedowns in property values. An exceptional charge of Pounds 13m
was taken to write down Stamford Bridge's value from the previous Pounds
22.85m and also to reduce Craven Cottage's value.
Mr Cotter said that as a technicality an extraordinary general meeting had
been called for November 6 because of the gap between net assets and share
capital.
Turnover fell to Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 54.3m). Loss before exceptionals was
Pounds 9.19m (Pounds 8.03m). The loss per share was 21.39p (loss of 10.2p).
There is no dividend.
One of the possibilities following the grounds' sale is that the buyer will
revert to the plan of trying to get Fulham to share Chelsea's ground,
eventually freeing up for redevelopment the Craven Cottage site
Fulham, however, has reached no agreement with Chelsea and is believed to
interested in buying the Craven Cottage ground. Chelsea's aim continues to
be to buy Stamford Bridge.
