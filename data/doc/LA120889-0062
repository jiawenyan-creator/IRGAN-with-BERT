SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
A 19-year-old man who was living in Balboa Park's canyons was found guilty 
Thursday of the first-degree murder and robbery of a man in the park July 5. 
After discussing the case 2 1/2 hours, the San Diego Superior Court jury 
convicted Javier Garcia Gutierrez of killing Franklin Black, 34, who was 
apparently jogging in Balboa Park at the time of the 4 a.m. attack. 
Sentencing was set for Jan. 4, and Gutierrez faces a maximum sentence of 25 
years to life in state prison. 
The victim was stabbed in the arm, but the wound hit a critical artery that 
caused Black to bleed to death. Black was robbed of his wallet, but it was 
found in some ice plant not far from where Gutierrez and five others were 
arrested.
