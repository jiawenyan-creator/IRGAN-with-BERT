  [Text] Canadian Ambassador to Mexico David Winfield has 
affirmed his country's trust in Mexico. Speaking at the 
National Autonomous University of Mexico, the ambassador said 
economic support will be reinforced. 
  The recent events that occurred in our country will not 
alter 
the good relations between Mexico and Canada, Ambassador David 
Winfield said. On the contrary, he added, there will be greater 
economic support for Mexico. 
  [Begin Winfield recording] Canada is very interested in 
investing here in Mexico now in order to expand and strengthen 
our economic ties. The three finance secretaries of the three 
countries approved a new trilateral swap [preceding word in 
English] in Washington yesterday so as to maintain the value of 
the currencies. [end recording] 
  Participating in the Canada-Mexico 50 Years of Diplomatic 
Relations Congress, the Canadian ambassador voiced his rejection 
of the recent kidnappings that took place recently in Mexico 
City. 
  [Begin Winfield recording] It is a terrible, unacceptable 
crime; it is a method that is unacceptable for solving problems. 
We reject this type of action, but such actions will not change 
our trust in the country. [end recording]
