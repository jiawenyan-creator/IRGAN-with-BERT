JAPANESE DEFENSE CHIEF TELLS HOPES FOR FSX GO-AHEAD 
The chief of Japan's Defense Agency today said he hopes the United States will 
not alter an agreement the two countries have for the joint development of the 
FSX fighter jet. 
"It is very important to proceed with a joint development by all means . . . to 
increase reliable relationships between Japan and the United States," Kichiro 
Tazawa told a news conference. 
His remarks followed a statement Tuesday by President Bush that the United 
States has decided to go ahead with the proposed fighter jet project with 
Japan, "with certain clarifications" to safeguard U.S. technology. 
According to Bush Administration and congressional sources, Bush will propose 
revising the agreement negotiated last year by the Ronald Reagan Administration 
to better protect computer "source codes" for the software that helps fly and 
control the plane and other sensitive U.S. data.
