DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RANCHER HAD RIGHT TO KILL DOG, JUDGE RULES 
A San Fernando Superior Court judge has ruled that a Canyon Country rancher 
charged with cruelty to animals for shooting a neighbor's dog had a right to 
kill the animal because it was trespassing on his property and threatening his 
livestock. 
Judge John P. Farrell on Monday dismissed the charges against Ernest Lynn 
Reubens, 59, who shot Freckles, a brown and white springer spaniel belonging to 
4-year-old Erica Owen. Farrell said he based his decision on a section of the 
Food and Agriculture code that allows livestock owners to shoot any dog 
trespassing on their property. 
Farrell dismissed the charges after the closing arguments in Reubens' second 
trial. 
A first trial ended in a mistrial in December.
