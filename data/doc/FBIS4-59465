<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F>
Salim 'Ali Dhiyab in Amman on 12 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Basindwah] I communicated to His Majesty King 
Husayn greetings from his brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, and then related to him Yemeni developments from A to Z. 
I explained to his majesty ... 
  [Dhiyab, interrupting] Mr. Minister, have there been any 
Arab initiatives about Yemen? 
  [Basindwah] Mediation would be in order when you have two 
evenly matched sides. We are not after a military victory in 
order to force our control over all of Yemen. A political 
solution should be pursued, in the sense of securing the 
participation of citizens of the southern governorates in 
office. This is what the president intends to do -- to let 
southern-born Yemenis keep the positions they had previously 
been allocated.
