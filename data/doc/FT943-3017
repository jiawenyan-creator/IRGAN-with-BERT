FT  16 SEP 94 / Liberian coup foiled
African peacekeeping troops in Liberia ended a day-long siege of the
capital's seat of government yesterday when they overran rebels who took
over the building before dawn in an attempted coup, Reuter reports from
Monrovia.
After pounding the building with mortar bombs, cannon and fire from gunboats
offshore, the troops stormed the executive mansion, claiming to have
suffered only three men wounded. The African force said rebel casualties
were still being counted.
The coup attempt - the latest violent turn in Liberia's long civil war  -
was staged by a military faction led by General Charles Julue, who was a
commander in the defeated army of slain dictator Samuel Doe and who fled
Liberia in 1990.
The fighting erupted three days after Liberia's three main warring factions
signed a peace agreement. The accord caused dismay in Monrovia as it
provided for replacement of the interim government.
The eight-nation African peacekeeping force tried at first to persuade the
rebel soldiers to surrender. But Gen Julue declared he was prepared to
resist attempts to dislodge him from the mansion, formerly a presidential
palace but now an administrative building.
The peacekeepers then opened fire from three gunboats and some tanks around
the building, a four-storey fortress on the Atlantic ocean.
