FT  22 JUL 93 / Nicaraguan rebels attack city
ABOUT 300 former Contra rebels and discharged soldiers attacked the northern
Nicaraguan city of Esteli yesterday and seized two police stations, radio
reports said, Agencies report from Managua.
One attacker was reported killed and another person wounded in the attack,
the biggest outbreak of violence since Mrs Violeta Chamorro was sworn in as
president in April 1990, ending a decade of civil war between the
US-supported Contras and Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
Radio Sandino, the broadcasting station of the Sandinista movement, said the
rebels also tried to capture the nearby towns of Ocotal, Condega and La
Trinidad, all north of Managua. It did not say if they succeeded.
Military officials were quoted on Radio Nicaragua as saying the rebels had
seized control of the city. Reports said the army, which is still under
leftist Sandinista control, had begun rushing troops to the area.
