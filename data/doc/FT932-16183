FT  07 APR 93 / People: Neil Hood joins Grampian
Neil Hood of Strathclyde university in Glasgow is adding to his considerable
portfolio. He is to become a non-executive director of Grampian Holdings,
the Glasgow-based mini-conglomerate whose interests range from veterinary
pharmaceuticals to sporting goods.
Hood, 49, is director of the Strathclyde International Business Unit, and
has been professor of business policy since 1979. But he may be best known
for his off-campus activities. He is regarded as a marketing strategist of
international standing, advising companies and governments worldwide. In the
late 1980s he was director of Locate in Scotland, the inward investment
bureau at the Scottish Development Agency.
He is already a non-executive director at Shanks &amp; McEwan, Kwik-Fit, I&amp;S
Smaller Companies Trust (managed by Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh fund
manager) and Scottish Development Finance. He is also corporate adviser to
ScottishPower.
Hood is a man of great verbal efficiency; he can complete a one-hour
interview in little more than 30 minutes. After his stint at Locate in
Scotland he was put in charge of reshaping the SDA to prepare for its
transition into Scottish Enterprise. Later he made no secret of his doubts
about the wisdom of this piece of government tinkering, describing Scottish
Enterprise in its early stages as 'a morass of complexity' full of 'tensions
and uncertainties'.
The man who originally proposed the idea of creating Scottish Enterprise was
Bill Hughes, chairman of Grampian Holdings.
