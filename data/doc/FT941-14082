FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Aerolineas investment
restriction removed
Argentina has removed one of the key obstacles to restructuring the finances
of Aerolneas Argentinas, the loss-making privatised airline. It is allowing
foreign investors to hold a majority of the company without altering its
flag-carrier status.
The government issued a decree stipulating simply that investors in
Aerolneas should be legally domiciled in Argentina. Previously, legislation
stated that Argentine nationals must hold at least 51 per cent of the
company. An Aerolneas executive said: 'With these new rules, the financial
problems are resolved.'
Iberia, the Spanish national airline which operates and owns 30 per cent of
Aerolneas, said this week it would go ahead with a Dollars 500m capital
injection for the company. However, its efforts to raise the equity would
have been hindered by the rule that 51 per cent of Aerolneas should be held
by nationals.
The Argentine government, which owns 33 per cent of the airline as well as
10 per cent held in trust for employees, said it would not contribute any
money.
An Argentine bank and two small investors hold a further 8 per cent of
Aerolneas, but only the Medefin merchant bank said it would participate in
the capital-raising exercise.
As well as contributing its Dollars 150m share, Iberia is expected to be
supported by Spain's Banco Hispano and the troubled Banesto, which each hold
7.5 per cent of Aerolneas. It could also buy 28 per cent of the company from
the government, which bought the stake in 1992 to prevent the collapse of
the airline.
