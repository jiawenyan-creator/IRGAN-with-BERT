FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz enters reinsurance
Daimler-Benz, the German industrial company, is setting up its own
reinsurance company to try to inject more competition into the industrial
insurance market and keep down rising premiums.
The move will be made through Debis, its service and computer software
subsidiary, which already has its own insurance operation serving Daimler
subsidiaries and outside customers. The new reinsurance company and a
reinsurance broking firm will be based in Luxembourg.
Daimler's decision comes as industrial companies in Germany are looking
closely at insurance premiums as they reassess their total operational
costs; other concerns like BASF chemicals also have reinsurance offshoots.
Siemens, the electrical and electronics group, has just switched a large
part of its fire risk business for next year from Allianz of Germany to
Factory Mutual of the US to save on premiums.
In recent years, German insurance companies have raised fire risk premiums
steeply to try to offset heavy losses resulting from over-capacity and
under-bidding.
Mr Hans Adam, a Debis director, linked the company's reinsurance decision
with the higher cost of fire insurance, the expense of product liability
insurance in the US, and increasing risks on the environmental liability
side.
