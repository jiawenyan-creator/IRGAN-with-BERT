  [Excerpt] In Rwanda, fighting with heavy weapons continued 
today on several fronts. The counteroffensive launched on 
Monday [6 June] by the regular army is reported to have failed. 
Valerie Hirsch reports: 
  [Hirsch] Violent fighting is taking place on three fronts: 
north of Kigali, where the army has launched an attack from the 
town of Ruhengeri, in the capital itself, and 20 km from 
Gitarama, the town where the interim government has taken refuge. 
  According to the United Nations, the army has not regained 
any ground from the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which is 
still holding the initiative in the fighting. 
  However, the Front does not want a military victory. This is 
what the RPF president said in an interview published this 
morning by LE SOIR. 
  Besides, according to the Ugandan president, the Front is 
not 
in a position to get the upper hand militarily. President 
Museveni, who is considered an ally of the RPF, has criticized 
the Front: they have to accept a cease-fire, the Ugandan 
president said, because the international community has promised 
to try those behind the slaughter. 
  Negotiations on a truce in the fighting will resume on 
Thursday, 9 June or Friday in Kigali. [passage omitted]
