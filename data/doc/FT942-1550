FT  23 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Footsie futures rallied strongly on the back of a recovering bond sector and
talk of an impending statement on the US dollar, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the September FT-SE 100 contract was struck at 2,948. But
for a brief decline to 2,941, buyers carried the contract forward throughout
the day. The smaller broking houses and independent operators (locals) were
reported to have been the main buyers in the first half of the session. The
reduction in interest rates in several European countries and the
improvement in bonds underpinned the buying activity, helping September to
maintain a premium to cash.
Reports that the US President was to make a statement on the dollar, and the
strong buying on Wall Street, gave further encouragement to derivatives
traders in London which brought a squeeze on the contract towards the close.
September ended at 2,968, up 30 from its previous finish and at a premium to
the cash market, although at a slight discount to its fair value premium to
cash of 13 points. Dealers reported a further rise in after-hours' trading.
Closing volume was 14,304.
Turnover in traded options improved to reach 33,792 contracts. FT-SE 100
option volume was 12,720 lots, and 2,154 were traded in Land Securities to
make it the busiest stock option.
