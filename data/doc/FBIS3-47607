  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
assured China Friday that its relationship with Taiwan is 
strictly economic, saying it would not do anything to harm Kuala 
Lumpur-Beijing ties. Recognising the one China policy, Malaysia 
was exercising its right as a business partner to hold talks 
with Taipei, one of its major investment and trading nations. 
  We understand Beijing's sensitivity over the China-Taiwan 
policy and we want them to know that we are aware of it, 
Abdullah told reporters after meeting Singapore Foreign Minister 
Professor Jayakumur at Foreign Ministry here. 
  Abdullah was responding to China's warning to Malaysia (and 
Singapore) Thursday for hosting a private visit by Taiwanese 
Premier Lien Chan which, it claimed, had overstepped the mark of 
approved contacts with the nationalist island. 
  China Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin yesterday 
claimed 
that countries which have dilpmmatic relations with Beijing had 
gone beyond non-governmental contacts with nationalist Taipei. 
  Abdullah said that Beijing should also understand that 
Taipei 
was an economic entity with which Malaysia has been having good 
relations over the years. 
  Malaysia is a good friend of China's, he said, adding that 
it 
would never bo anything detrimental to the relationship. 
  Abbullah said there had been no official protest from 
Beijing 
over the visit two weeks ago which was the first since 1974. The 
premier visited Singapore later. 
  Malayia severed diplomatic relations with Taipei 20 years 
ago 
after it recognised China under the so-called one China policy
