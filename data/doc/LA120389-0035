HENDRIX'S VISION 
As a 20-year-plus devotee of the life and works of Jimi Hendrix, I must take 
strong exception to several of the quotations in Chuck Philips' Nov. 26 
article. 
As Vernon Reid, Little Richard and others point out, Hendrix broke down many 
doors and blew apart the mentality that governed numerous musical and racial 
stereotypes of that era. Perhaps the true beauty of Jimi's stance, though, is 
that these barriers were broken on all sides of the fence, for everyone who was 
feeling the pain and constrictions that he felt. 
It is ludicrous for Reid to state that Hendrix's version of the "Star-Spangled 
Banner" is so powerful "because he was black." It's so damn powerful because it 
spoke, and continues to speak, for people of all races. 
In the summer of 1969, it reached into white suburbia and encapsulated the 
feelings of thousands of middle-class white youths too -- white kids, like kids 
of all races everywhere who were feeling hostile, frustrated and confined by a 
system they couldn't change, by a generation they were getting a raw deal from. 
Reid also asks, "Who could listen to 'Machine Gun' without thinking about black 
soldiers in Vietnam?" I don't know, Vernon. Around that time, most kids I knew 
were thinking about all their buddies in 'Nam when they heard "Machine Gun." 
Black kids, white kids, blue, gray, whatever. Kids from all backgrounds were 
trapped in that hellhole.
