GOLDEN STATE ATHLETIC CONFERENCE BASKETBALL; 
SCC HOLDS ON TO POST 82-80 VICTORY 
When push came to shove, Southern California College had a foul to give. 
After squandering a 15-point halftime lead, the Vanguards needed a well-timed 
shove by Kyle Lundy in order to hold off Westmont, 82-80, in a showdown of 
Golden State Athletic Conference powers. 
With the crowd of 1,057 at Murchison Gymnasium on its feet and only 1 second 
left, Westmont's Mike Kelly lobbed an inbound pass to 6-foot-5 Dan Swanner, who 
outleaped Lundy for the ball a mere eight feet from the basket. 
Lundy shoved Swanner at the buzzer, before he could attempt a shot. However, 
the Warriors were not in the bonus, so no free throws were awarded. 
Game over. 
"We had a couple fouls to give, so we told the kids that if they could steal 
the ball, foul," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "When the ref signaled it wasn't 
a shot attempt, I said, 'Thank you, Lord.' " 
By winning their 14th consecutive game, the Vanguards (24-2 overall, 11-0 in 
conference play) all but clinched the conference championship. They have a 
two-game lead over Westmont (15-10, 9-2) with three games remaining in 
conference play. 
Westmont had a golden opportunity to take the lead in the final 40 seconds. A 
steal and a layup by Mike Kelly (22 points) pulled the Warriors to within 81-80 
and another steal by Kelly gave them a chance to take the lead. 
Guard Peter Partain drove to the hoop and appeared to have John Mounce beaten. 
However, Mounce reached in from behind and batted the ball free. He was then 
fouled and made one of two free throws for an 82-80 lead. 
"We were just hanging on by our fingernails the whole second half," Reynolds 
said. 
Southern California made 29 of 49 field goals (59%). The Vanguards' shooting 
offset the fact they were outrebounded, 32-21. 
Lundy (23 points), Terry Scruggs (23) and Jeff Bickmore (21) did the most 
damage. But mostly in the first half, when the Vanguards shot 50% to the 
Warriors' 38%.
