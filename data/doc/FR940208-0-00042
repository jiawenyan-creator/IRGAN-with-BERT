 

a. 

Hydrologic area. 

Iowa proposes, at IAC 2740.35(12), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 779.24(g) by deleting
the phrase ``defined by the regulatory authority.'' Iowa further proposes to add the following sentence at the end
of incorporated 30 CFR 779.24(g): ``Hydrologic area'' is the area that consists of the permit area and the adjacent
area.'' Thus, the Iowa proposal would require permit applications to include maps showing, among other things, the
locations of water supply intakes for current users of surface water flowing into, out of, and within the permit and
adjacent area.
Iowa adopts by reference at IAC 2740.4(207), the term ``adjacent area'' as it is defined at 30 CFR 701.5. The
definition for ``adjacent area'' includes the area outside the permit area where resources, determined according
to the context in which 

adjacent area

 is used, are or reasonably could be expected to be adversely impacted by proposed mining operations, including probable
impacts from underground workings. In explaining the meaning of the term ``adjacent area,'' OSM stated in the 

Federal Register 

notice dated April 5, 1983 (48 FR 14814, 1481814819), that:



The term ``adjacent area'' is intended to refer to an area of variable size in which specified resources could be adversely
impacted by mining operations. The size of the adjacent area could vary on a case-by-case basis depending upon whether
impacts on water, fish and wildlife, cultural resources, or others are being considered ***.

*** The area determined to be within the ``adjacent area'' must be defined within the context
of the particular resource being evaluated and often will depend upon local conditions. *** Thus,
the adjacent area may differ from case to case depending upon the factors under consideration. This can best be resolved
by the regulatory authority within the context of the particular requirement of the regulatory program and the conditions
within the particular State, region, or locale where the proposed mining operation is located.



Thus, Iowa's proposed revision ensures that permit application maps will illustrate the locations of all water supply
intakes for current users whose surface water supply will or could reasonably be expected to be adversely affected
by the proposed mining operations. Accordingly, the Director finds IAC 2740.35(12) to be consistent with
SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations, and is approving it.
b. 

Section and section line identification. 

Iowa proposes, at IAC 2740.35(14), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 779.24(1) by inserting
the following at the beginning of the regulation: ``Section lines and section identification, and any ***.''
Thus, as revised by the State, the incorporated provision would require that permit applications include maps showing,
among other things, ``[s]ection lines and section identification, and any other relevant information required
by the regulatory authority.''
The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 779.24(1) simply allows the regulatory authority to require other information.
While the corresponding Federal regulations 30 CFR 779.24(1) do not require the information regarding section lines
and section identification, in accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining
and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover,
the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations
on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart provision exists. Section 505(b)
of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal
program. Therefore, the Director is approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 2740.35(14).

IAC 2740.36(3), Surface Mining Applications_Minimum Permit Requirements for Reclamation and Operation
Plan and IAC 2740.38(8), Underground Mining Permit Applications_Minimum Permit Requirements for Reclamation
and Operation Plan



Iowa proposes to add the following new language at IAC 2740.36(3) and 2740.38(8), which deal with minimum
requirements for reclamation and operations plans for surface and underground mining permit applications, respectively:




The determination of probable hydrologic consequence (PHC) made pursuant to these rules as part of a permit application
shall address all proposed mining activities associated with the permit area for which authorization is sought as
opposed to addressing only those activities expected to occur during the term of the permit.



In a November 6, 1991, rulemaking (56 FR 56578, 5658456578), OSM requested that Iowa clarify how it intended
to implement 30 CFR 780.21(f) and 784.14(d) regarding PHC determinations. The State proposal satisfies the concerns
OSM expressed in Finding No. 15 of the November 6, 1991, 

Federal Register 

document. Accordingly, the Director finds the State proposals at IAC 2740.36(3) and 2740.38(8) to
be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations and is approving them.
