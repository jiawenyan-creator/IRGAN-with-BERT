  [Excerpt] The accession of Austria, Norway, Sweden, and 
Finland to the European Union [EU] must be decided today. More 
details from Brussels from Fernando Paula Brito: 
  [Brito] The EU is preparing a final response, which will be 
handed to the four candidates this afternoon. Foreign Minister 
Durao Barroso is confident that a solution will be found for 
some of them. Norway continues to be one of the most 
problematic cases: 
  [Begin recording] [Barroso] I believe Norway has not shown 
enough flexibility yet. We and many others cannot accept their 
negotiating stands. I believe that is the most problematic case 
in these negotiations although there are other issues to be 
resolved with some of the candidates. 
  [Correspondent] But is Norway not wanting to limit access to 
its territorial waters somehow for the same reasons Portugal 
limits access by community vessels to Madeiran and Azorean 
territorial waters? 
  [Barroso] Yes, but we accept the principle of restricted 
access. What we cannot accept is a member state refusing 
categorically -- such in the case of Norway -- refusing to share 
its resources in any way. We also share some of our resources.
