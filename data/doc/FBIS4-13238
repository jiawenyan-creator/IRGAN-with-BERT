  [Excerpt] Jordan has promised the United States to 
restrain the activity of the Hamas organization in its 
territory. From Washington, Qol Yisra'el's correspondent Arye 
Golan quotes American sources as saying that since the weekend, 
the Hamas headquarters in the Jordanian capital is no longer 
operating. Israeli sources have said that if Jordan indeed 
stands by her pledge, Israel will take no further action. Last 
week Israeli leaders made it clear that they expected Jordan to 
halt Hamas' incitement and operational activity directed from 
its Amman offices. 
  Earlier, King Husayn himself made it clear that he 
considered 
an illegal organization in the Hashemite kingdom. [passage
