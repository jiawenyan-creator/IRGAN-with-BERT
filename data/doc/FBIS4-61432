  [Text] [Simakov over video of conversion output produced 
at Izhevsk's "Mekhanicheskiy Zavod"] The current, admittedly 
dire situation has not brought the gunsmiths at Izhevsk's 
"Mekhanicheskiy Zavod" Plant to their knees. On the contrary, 
it has made them act quickly and display a lot of initiative. 
  And so missiles and electronic guidance systems for missiles 
have disappeared, to be replaced by laser video recorders, 
"Kompanyon" computers, magnificent electro-cardio-stimulators, 
and much else besides. For example, this intercity public pay 
telephone. The plant's designers have excelled themselves, 
developing highly original goods within an extremely short 
period, such as this pump-action gun, for example. Its 
versatility is simply enviable. This and other innovations 
caused a big stir at a recent exhibition in Nuremberg. 
  Incidentally, the exhibition of the plant's output is not 
confined to firearms. It also includes purely civilian goods 
produced with hi-tech methods and therefore in great demand.
