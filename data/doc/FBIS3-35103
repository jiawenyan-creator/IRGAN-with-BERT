  [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has denied a MENA 
report citing a responsible source at the U.S. State Department 
saying that he received a message from Secretary of State 
Christopher informing him that Israel may carry out a 
large-scale offensive against the south. Dallul added that U.S. 
Ambassador Mark Hambley expressed satisfaction with the progress 
of the Lebanese Army and informed him of the U.S. Congress' 
approval of the deal to grant Lebanon armored personnel and 
troop carriers. He added that the deal, which has been on hold, 
involves between 100 and 150 carriers.
