FT  27 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Generators busy
The Scottish power generators, left behind by their English and Welsh
counterparts following Thursday's coal industry white paper, hit all-time
highs yesterday before settling marginally below their best levels. Scottish
Hydro touched 273p and closed a net 7 1/2 firmer at 271 1/2 p with 1.5m
shares traded, while Scottish Power ended a busy session a net 9 1/2 to the
good at 254p, after a record 255p. As from Monday both stocks will trade cum
the final 70p call.
PowerGen and National Power both rushed up to all-time highs before
attracting profit-taking. The latter were unchanged on balance at 336p,
having traded at 340p, while the former closed 3 better at 345p, after a
record 348p. Turnover in National Power was 5.3m shares and in 7.5m in
PowerGen.
Wellcome, given rough treatment by the market on Thursday after announcing
its interim figures, remained under heavy selling pressure as the market
continued to focus on the possibility of a slowing in earnings growth and
the recent spate of profits warnings from the leading US drug companies.
Wellcome shares dropped 24 more to 794p on heavy turnover of 3.9m.
Royal Bank of Scotland substantially outperformed the rest of a mixed
banking sector. The shares jumped 10 1/2 to 249p on much higher than usual
turnover of 4.3m, amid suggestions that some of the City's leading broking
houses may be preparing to upgrade their forecasts for the bank. Abbey
National were well supported and closed 6 1/2 higher at 373p, with dealers
adopting the view that the shares had been oversold.
HSBC, which goes ex-dividend on Monday, put on 13 to 621p helped by the
strong performance of the Hong Kong market.
Burmah Castrol delivered one of the best performances among the Footsie 100
stocks reflecting keen institutional support ahead of next Thursday's
preliminary statement of profit figures which most analysts expect to show
net income of about Pounds 85m and a net dividend of around 25p.
The shares jumped 14 to 714p, albeit in rather unspectacular turnover of
818,000 shares.
With the 'dash for gas' policy enshrined in the government's white paper on
coal, British Gas moved up 4 1/2 to 300p on heavy turnover of 9.6m shares.
The go-ahead given by Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade,
to the gas-powered Connah's Quay power station, which will be fed by the
Hamilton and Hamilton North gas fields in Liverpool Bay, triggered a further
burst of buying in Monument Oil &amp; Gas whose shares edged up 1 1/2 more to 45
1/2 p. Monument has a 25 per cent stake in the gas fields and the adjacent
Douglas oil field as well as a 25 per cent stake in the nearby Lennox field.
Several stocks in the retail sector were said to have been depressed by a
stock overhang following Thursday's programme trade by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
These included Boots, which gave up 13 to 486p, and WH Smith 'A', 8 lighter
at 402p. Sentiment in both stocks was further weakened by DIY competition
worries from Kingfisher, which hardened 5 to 558p, as investors continued to
appreciate the group's favourable results earlier in the week.
A profits warning from Fenner sent the shares tumbling. By the close the
shares had fallen 22 to 65p. Smiths Industries shed 3 to 331p, with both UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew and NatWest Securities said to have had large lines of
stock.
A stock overhang continued in Siebe which left the shares 3 lighter at 443p,
after trade of 1.9m.
Confirmation that French holding company CGIP was in negotiations as part of
a consortium to acquire a 25.3 per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox, along
with reports of an insider dealing inquiry in Paris, saw Carnaud Metalbox
fall 225 to 2488p. The stake is currently held by building products group
MB-Caradon whose shares eased 5 to 311p.
Around 15 per cent of the company's stock changed hands in Atreus on its
first day of trading. By the close, volume had risen to 9.7m and having been
placed at 20p, the shares moved 1 1/2 forward to 21 1/2 p.
Shares in office equipment group Erskine House fell 7 to 34p after the
company said its final dividend for 1992 will, 'at most, be a nominal one'.
The company paid a 2.3p interim dividend and the move now means the total
dividend has fallen from last year's 6.35p. The company blamed the changes
in ACT regulations included in the UK Budget earlier this month, and said it
would instead use the money to reduce borrowings.
The blow to sentiment in Erskine was felt in several other stocks in the
sector. These included Gestetner which gave up 8 to 115p, and Danka Business
which relinquished 16 to 589p.
Property shares remained fairly active as investors continued to assess
prospects for recovery in the sector. Although expectations of another large
rights issue continued to unsettle share prices, there were few obvious
candidates.
At 188p, Slough Estates were only a few pence off, with the market evidently
satisfied with the details of this week's Pounds 147m rights issue.
Hammerson 'A' shares eased to 349p with talk of a bid still echoing in the
background.
Among the other leaders of the sector, turnover was moderate but share
prices moved within narrow bands. While the likelihood of a further cut in
UK base rates in the near future has clearly receded since the Budget,
investors still see property shares as the harbingers of a recovery across
the range of the UK economy.
BUDGET CHANGES
The Financial Times will implement with effect from April 5 the Budget
reduction in the income tax rate applied to dividends to 20 per cent from 25
per cent. This will affect gross dividend yields shown for individual
companies in the London Share Service, and those calculated for the FT-SE
Actuaries UK Share Indices and the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
