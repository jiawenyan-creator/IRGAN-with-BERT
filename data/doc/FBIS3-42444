  [Text] The obstacle-clearing engineer vehicle is designed 
for supporting troops' advance through areas of destruction, 
including on terrain with radioactive and chemical contamination. 
  They are successfully used in civil defense formations to 
clean up after massive destruction and large industrial 
accidents. 
  The vehicle consists of the following: A tank base chassis, 
a 
telescoping boom with a universal scoop-type operating element, 
a universal bulldozer attachment, and a track-clearing mine 
sweeper. Its operating equipment makes it possible to clear 
cross-country routes on moderately rough terrain, in light 
forests, and on virgin snow; dig up roots, knock down trees, and 
clear away tree blowdowns, rock barriers, and industrial rubble.
