FT  17 JUL 93 / Project to build warship agreed
BRITAIN yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with France and Italy
to jointly develop and produce a warship.
The Common New Generation Frigate, which is expected to enter service early
next century, will be the first significant maritime collaboration between
the three nations.
The Ministry of Defence said the project was at a very early stage. It
added: 'It's an encouraging sign that we've got this far. It will need
considerably more detailed negotiations between partners . . . but it is a
good example of European co-operation.'
