FT  19 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich registers second
consecutive record
THE Danish Maastricht vote was given credit yesterday for buoyancy in a
number of bourses which, on examination, seemed to be climbing for reasons
of their own, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH reported institutional and options-related buying which took the SMI
index up 21.7 to a second consecutive record close of 2,226.7.
Foreign investors were also active buyers on the view that the market is
currently undervalued. The firmer dollar encouraged demand for chemicals
issues while lower interest rates helped financials.
Roche certificates were the most activley traded issue, gaining SFr40 to
SFr4,630. Sandoz registered shares found renewed demand adding SFr70 to
SFr3,070.
Among financials, UBS bearers rose SFr14 to SFr967 while Zurich Insurance,
expected to benefit strongly from a US economic pick-up, added SFr40 to
SFr2,290. Winterthur Insurance registered shares rose SFr20 to SFr3,260 as
it announced plans to convert non-voting participation certificates into
registered shares and to split its resistered and bearer shares.
MADRID returned to the upgrade, the general index closing 3.93, or 1.6 per
cent higher at 256.89. Turnover rose from Pta20.2bn to an estimated Pta30bn.
Interest rate sensitive stocks did well, BBV rising Pta75 to Pta3,145 among
rising banks and Iberdrola by Pta23 to Pta748 in a relatively more buoyant
utilities sector.
Among builders and electricals, Huarte, the subject of takeover speculation,
put on Pta85 at Pta557 with more than  1/2 m shares traded. Cristaleria
gained 5.1 per cent, and Agroman 3.5 per cent.
PARIS regained some ground in technical trading after recent weakness, but
interest remained subdued ahead of the Ascension day holiday. The CAC-40
index improved 10.68 to 1,846.40 after a day's high of 1,861. Turnover was
strong at FFr3.8bn.
BSN went against the rising trend on plans to cut prices in an effort to
retain market share for its products in Europe, where it ranks third behind
Nestle and Unilever. Some analysts commented that the group, with relatively
negligible dollar exposure, was finding it very difficult to squeeze volume
growth out of any of its divisions. The shares finished FFr11 weaker at
FFr863.
Elf Sanofi roseFFr41 or 4.6 per cent to FFr935 as shareholders finally
approved the acquisition of YSL, thereby creating the world's third largest
beauty products group.
MILAN staged a broad advance as the strength of the lira again prompted
hopes that the Bank of Italy would act soon to cut interest rates. The Comit
index rose 4.64 to 544.19.
The market began weak but picked up later. Fiat shed L224 to fix at L6,327
before rebounding to L6,644 after hours with investors expecting the board
to cut the dividend at the end of the month.
Foreign demand help Credito Italiano and BCI to extend Monday's gains. Mr
Romano Prodi, appointed chairman of Iri at the weekend, is expected to
expedite privatisations. Credito added L166 or 5.6 per cent to L3,093 while
BCI put on L219 or 4.2 per cent L5,427.
Among telecoms, which are seeing strong foreign demand, Sip rose L19 to fix
at L1,956 before L1,974 after hours while Stet, its parent company, dipped
L39 to L2,960 but picked up to L3,060 on the kerb.
FRANKFURT saw a continued downward drift in bond prices as the repo rate
stayed at 7.60 per cent and the DAX index ended flat, closing 0.60 higher at
1,628.48 after an opening rally to 1,636.09.
Turnover recovered from DM4.7bn to DM5.7bn. Company news included a 10 per
cent drop in first quarter sales at the tyremaker, Continental, but the
company said that it would try to pay a dividend in 1993 and the shares rose
DM2.80 to DM198.80.
A drop in profits at Degussa, the chemicals, metals and pharmaceuticals
group, left it DM4.50 lower at DM329.50. Meanwhile, the threat of a dividend
cut at Altana, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, left the shares DM5
lower at DM535.
AMSTERDAM saw falls in Unilever, off Fl 1.80 at Fl 193.20, which reflected
the BSN news and Pakhoed, down Fl 1.40 to Fl 36.60, after it forecast a
sharp fall in first half 1993 profits. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.2
lower at 106.3.
STOCKHOLM was active in Volvo, which lost SKr8 to SKr400 following bigger
than expected first quarter losses. However, a strong performance from
Ericsson, up SKr7 to SKr313, supported the overall market as the
Affarsvarlden general index ended unchanged at 1,083.2. Turnover rose to
SKr1.4bn from Monday's SKr1.3bn.
HELSINKI rose by 3 per cent on hopes that the threatened strike in the
country's export sector would not start today. The HEX index jumped 34.00 to
1,184.7 after a 1.2 per cent fall on Monday.
WARSAW resumed its climb after a drop on Monday, the WIG index soaring by
237.2, or 8.2 per cent to 2,748.8 in turnover of 261.7bn zloty.
ISTANBUL's slide continued with a further loss of 2.5 per cent in the
75-share index, down 205.25 at 8,024.66.
