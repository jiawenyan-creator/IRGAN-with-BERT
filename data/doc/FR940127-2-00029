</FOOTNOTE>



The Commission is consulting with the New Hampshire State Historic Preservation Officer (hereinafter, SHPO) and
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (hereinafter, Council) pursuant to 36 CFR 800.13 of the Council's
regulations implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 470f), to
prepare a programmatic agreement for managing properties included on, or eligible for inclusion in, the National
Register of Historic Places at Project No. 2456. 



The programmatic agreement, upon approval by the Commission, the SHPO, and the Council, would satisfy the Commission's
section 106 responsibilities for all individual undertakings carried out in accordance with the agreement until
the agreement expires or is terminated (36 CFR 800.13(e)). The Commission's section 106 requirements for the above
project would be fulfilled through a programmatic agreement for comments under section 106. 


Public Service of New Hampshire, as a prospective licensee for the project, is being asked to participate in the consultation
and is being invited to sign as a concurring party to the programmatic agreement.



For purposes of commenting on the programmatic agreement we propose to restrict the service list for Project No. 2456
as follows:






Mr. R.G. Chevalier, Vice President, Fossil/Hydro Engineering Operations, Northeast Utilities Service Company,
P.O. Box 270, Hartford, CT 061410270



Ms. Nancy Muller, Director, New Hampshire State Historic Preservation Officer, New Hampshire Division of Historical
Resources, P.O. Box 2043, Concord, NH 03302



Advisory Council on Historical Preservation, Eastern Office of Project Review, The Old Post Office Building, suite
809, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. Washington, DC 20004






Any person on the official service list for the above-captioned proceedings may request inclusion on the restricted
service list, or may request that a restricted service list not be established, by filing a motion to that effect within
15 days of this notice date. An original and 8 copies of any such motion must be filed with the Secretary of Commission
(825 N. Capitol St., NE., Washington, DC 20426) and must be served on each person whose name appears on the official
service list. If no such motions are filed, the restricted service list will be effective at the end of the 15 day period.
Otherwise, a further notice will be issued ruling on the motion.
