TEACHERS STRIKE PROMPTS CHANGES ON TV 
KLCS Channel 58, the TV station owned by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, altered its broadcast schedule in response to the teachers strike 
Monday to include more instructional programs that do not require an adult 
educator's presence. 
The strike also shut down two 52-part educational series that KLCS is producing 
-- "Driver Education" and "Educational and Career Planning" -- because six 
certificated staff members were called into classrooms to fill in for striking 
teachers, said Sabrina Fair Thomas, manager of program scheduling. 
KLCS' staff-produced live show "Homework Hotline" (weekdays from 4:30 to 5:30 
p.m.), which uses teachers on the air to answer questions called in by 
students, will be replaced during the walkout by reruns of previous segments. 
Elsewhere in its schedule of instructional programs for elementary and 
secondary schools, KLCS was replacing some teacher-dependent shows with PBS 
series such as "Newton's Apple," "Wonderworks" and "Reading Rainbow." 
"This is relevant programming; it's not designed to baby-sit students," Thomas 
said. "These particular programs were selected because of their instructional 
value. They allow kids to learn something without direct supervision." 
Thomas said the temporary programming schedule is most beneficial to secondary 
students whose complex lesson plans are more difficult for interim teachers to 
plan. 
"We're like a backup," Thomas said. "Normal instruction will still go on. But 
in case a person doesn't know how to teach science, they can turn on 'Newton's 
Apple' and the class will still learn something."
