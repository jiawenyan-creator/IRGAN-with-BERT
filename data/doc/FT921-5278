FT  05 MAR 92 / Algerian court orders FIS dissolution
AN Algerian court yesterday ordered the dissolution of the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS), two months after the fundamentalist party was denied almost
certain victory by the cancelling of parliamentary elections, Reuter reports
from Algiers.
The decision, which takes effect in one week but is subject to appeal,
closed off any other legal outlet for FIS militants who wanted to make
Algeria an Islamic state.
Diplomats have said they feared a ban would drive hardline FIS members to
violence, operating underground.
Mr Larbi Belkheir, the interior minister, had asked the court on February 9
to order the dissolution or suspension of the FIS, accusing the party of
multiple violations of the law.
The same day, the authorities ordered a 12-month state of emergency, opening
internment camps to hold detainees.
In its last communique before the court order, the FIS said those thwarted
from the legal path would have every reason to turn to 'other means.'
