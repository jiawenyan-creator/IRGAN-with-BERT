FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Edinburgh Inv net assets edge up
the second largest in the UK - increased its final dividend by 10 per cent
to 4.95p despite a rise of only 0.8 per cent in net asset value per share in
the year to March 31.
The trust had net assets of Pounds 771.2m at its year end, equivalent to
262.5p per share, against 260.5p per share previously.
The increase in net assets lagged behind the FT-A All-Share Index - which
rose by 7 per cent over the same period - because of the overseas weighting
of the trust.
At March 31, 33 per cent of the portfolio was invested outside the UK, split
between continental Europe (11.5 per cent), Japan (8.8 per cent), United
States (8.3 per cent) and Far East (4.4 per cent).
Edinburgh has debenture debt of Pounds 105m, most of which is invested in
the markets.
The total dividend for the year is 7.7p (7p) based on earnings per share of
8.15p (7.84p).
Although net asset value underperformed against the index, a narrowing in
the discount to net asset value of the share price - from 19.4 per cent to
14.4 per cent - helped the shares to perform almost in line with the
All-Share Index over the year.
