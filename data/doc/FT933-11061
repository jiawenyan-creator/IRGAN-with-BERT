FT  31 JUL 93 / Judge orders Pounds 1.15m Nadir bail forfeited
FRIENDS OF Mr Asil Nadir were yesterday ordered to surrender Pounds 1.15m
they promised as bail surety for the fugitive tycoon.
The money was part of a record Pounds 3.5m bail which Mr Nadir skipped in
May when he escaped to northern Cyprus rather than face charges of false
accounting and theft.
Mr Ramadan Guney, the businessman who promised a Pounds 1m bail surety for
Mr Nadir, was yesterday ordered to forfeit Pounds 650,000. Mr Guney appeared
in court after the case had earlier been deferred on the grounds of his
ill-health.
At the Old Bailey Mr Justice Tucker gave Mr Guney six months to pay and
imposed a sentence of two years' imprisonment if he defaulted.
Mr Nadir's ex-wife, Mrs Aysegul Nadir, had promised Pounds 500,000 surety.
Mr Justice Tucker ordered that she pay that sum to the court within 28 days
or go to prison for 18 months.
However, he expressed doubt that she would pay since she was reported to be
in northern Cyprus.
The judge said he was satisfied that Mr Guney had played no part in Mr
Nadir's flight nor aided his escape but he had not taken all reasonable
steps to ensure Mr Nadir appeared for trial.
Mr Guney said he would appeal. 'As far as I can see there is no justice.'
Mr Rick Shearman, Mr Guney's solicitor, said the substance of his client's
case, which the judge heard in private, was that the surety had not been
renewed in June last year when Mr Nadir first appeared in court.
Mr Nadir's bail was comprised of both securities, where the money is
deposited, and sureties, where the money is pledged but not handed over.
A total of Pounds 2m was deposited with Mr Nadir's solicitors as security
for his appearance at court. Ownership of this money is now disputed and is
the subject of a further civil court hearing on August 18.
