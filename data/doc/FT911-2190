FT  01 MAY 91 / Spain keeps clamps on nuclear power after gas pipeline deal
SPAIN HAS decided not to lift its seven-year moratorium on the building of
new nuclear power plants following agreement yesterday to construct a
Dollars 1.3bn pipeline to feed Algerian natural gas into Spain through
Morocco and the Straits of Gibraltar.
Although more than 30 per cent of Spain's electricity is nuclear generated,
the government has had five plants, in various stages of construction, in
mothballs since 1984.
It had been assumed that at least one of them, Valdecaballeros in
Extremadura, would be allowed to come on stream under a new national energy
plan which is due to be announced this summer.
Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry and energy minister, said yesterday,
however, that the new energy plan would 'not increase nuclear generating
capacity in Spain'.
He said that the power industry needed to diversify, that increased use of
gas would lower costs and that the decision would help protect the
environment.
The government has come under fierce pressure from the governing Socialist
party not to lift the moratorium, even though private sector utilities have
been pushing hard for Valdecaballeros to be completed.
Mr Aranzadi met Algerian and Moroccan counterparts in Madrid yesterday to
sign an agreement to build a 1,265km pipeline from Algeria to Seville.
The pipeline, which would come on stream in 1995, could eventually link up
with a Soviet line in northern Europe.
Under the terms of yesterday's agreement, a 20-25 year pricing framework
would be established, with tariffs coming up for review every four years.
Financing for the work has still to be negotiated, though a number of
Spanish banks have already expressed strong interest in the project.
