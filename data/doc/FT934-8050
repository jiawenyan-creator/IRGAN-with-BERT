FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: UK food industry margins narrow
OPERATING PROFIT margins of British food and drink manufacturers have
narrowed in the past year from 6.7 per cent to an average of 6.3 per cent,
the lowest level since 1987, according to a survey.
The survey, by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, part of accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, also found that the industry's return on capital fell from 19.5 per
cent to 17.9 per cent, the lowest since 1985.
OC&amp;C said these declines followed a period of 'remarkable resilience' during
the recession, when operating margins in the industry held steady at 7.1 per
cent on average for three years.
However, the overall figures masked wide variations. Companies with annual
turnover of less than Pounds 100m fared worse than bigger companies in
1992-93, achieving lower margins and return on capital and slower sales
growth. About 40 per cent of bigger companies increased their margins.
That marked a reversal of the pattern in the mid-1980s, when small food and
drink companies performed more strongly than large ones.
Nonetheless, several leading branded food companies performed poorly in the
past year. Cadbury Schweppes' profit grew by less than 2 per cent, after
rising 15 per cent annually in the two previous years.
The British subsidiary of Nestle of Switzerland, the world's largest food
manufacturer, suffered a 6 per cent fall in profit, while fierce competition
from cheaper brands cut the profit of Heinz UK by 28 per cent.
By contrast, profit margins increased from 25 per cent to 28 per cent at
Walkers, the leading UK potato crisp brand. It was the most profitable UK
food company, followed by Kellogg UK, with a 16 per cent margin.
The industry's continental European sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 3.7bn,
more than a fifth of which was accounted for by Tate &amp; Lyle.
