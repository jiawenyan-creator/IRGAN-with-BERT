FT  09 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Japan's car makers 'discourage set-up of
European parts plants'
JAPAN's car makers are discouraging Japanese component manufacturers from
setting up in Europe 'as a matter of policy', according to a new study of
the European motor components industry by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
As a consequence, the prospect of an influx of Japanese components groups
seriously threatening the welfare of Europe's indigenous components industry
 -as happened in the case of the US - can be 'largely discounted', the
report* concludes.
Even with the absence of a Japanese threat, however, the West European
components industry will be the subject of further 'drastic' restructuring
in the near future, with the likelihood of a spate of acquisitions and
mergers as vehicle manufacturers come to rely increasingly on suppliers
which have a global capability, the report warns.
It earmarks south-east Asia and the Pacific rim as providing the greatest
growth opportunities in vehicle and components manufacture, and says that
'it is now essential for European companies to establish bridgeheads in
these regions' if business is not to be lost irrevocably, overwhelmingly to
the Japanese components industry.
Between them, western Europe's component makers have the chance to dominate
the motor industry's rebirth in Eastern Europe, the report concludes.
So far, however, it identifies Germany's components industry as making the
running, with nine manufacturing operations or joint ventures already under
way, with several more forecast to follow.
