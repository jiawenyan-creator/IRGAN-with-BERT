  [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- Kye Ung-tae, Politburo 
member and secretary of the C.C. [Central Committee], the WPK 
[Workers' Party of Korea], took the floor at a national seminar 
held here Thursday to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 
start of work by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  He said: 
  On June 19, 1964 dear Comrade Kim Chong-il began to guide 
the 
party work at the party Central Committee, complying with the 
ardent desire and organisational will of the whole party and the 
entire people for him to lead in the van the sacred revolution 
to carry forward the cause of the respected leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song. With this great event our party has become a 
revolutionary party which successfully solved the question of 
inheriting the leader's cause for the first time in history. 
  With the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il standing at the 
head of the party, a great heyday has come in the building of 
our party and accomplishment of the revolutionary cause in the 
past 30 years, our party and people have been able to vigorously 
carry forward the revolutionary idea and feats of the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song, our party has been able to exalt a 
glorious revolutionary party successfully carrying on the 
revolution for the independence of the popular masses under the 
banner of modelling the whole party and society on the chuche 
idea. 
  The dear leader clarified that the most correct way for the 
building of socialism and communism in our era is to dye the 
whole party and society with the chuche idea, the revolutionary 
idea of the great leader correctly reflecting the independent 
demand and interest of the popular masses. 
  An unprecedented change has taken place in all fields of 
socialist construction in a historically short period in our 
country under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il who has steadfastly turned the helm of revolution and 
construction to modelling the whole party and society on the 
chuche idea. 
  Under his wise guidance the work of modelling the whole 
party 
on the chuche idea has been stepped up, so that the features of 
our party as a great party have been fundamentally changed, its 
militancy and leadership role remarkably strengthened and the 
whole party and the entire people have formed an integral whole 
rallied close around the leader in an organisational and 
ideological way. 
  A great turn has taken place in socialist economic 
construction, cultural building and revolutionary armed force 
building as the driving force of our revolution has been 
strengthened and its role enhanced under the party's leadership. 
  Today the economy of our country has been more firmly 
consolidated as the socialist independent national economy, 
unaffected by any worldwide economic fluctuation and any 
economic blockade of the imperialists, and magnificent creations 
glorifying the Workers' Party era built in succession across the 
country to fundamentally change the features of the country. 
  Along with this, a great heyday of chuche-based literature 
and art has been brought by the rapid development of socialist 
national culture. 
  Under the energetic leadership of respected Supreme 
Commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il the modelling of the whole Army on the 
chuche idea has been propelled and thus our People's Army has 
grown up to be a true army of the party unfailingly loyal to the 
party and the leader and acting as one under the party's 
leadership and to be an unrivalled strong army equipped with 
powerful offensive and defensive means enough to defeat any 
aggressor at one stroke. 
  The immortal feats of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
who has ushered in the great heyday in building our party and 
carrying out the revolutionary cause with his profound 
revolutionary idea and great revolutionary practice will shine 
forever down through generations along with the history of the 
revolutionary struggle of the popular masses for independence.
