  [Text] Tbilisi, 27 April (SNARK) -- If till 10 May the UNO 
[United Nations Organization] does not pass a resolution on 
bringing the international peacekeeping forces into the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone, Georgia will resort to other 
mechanisms of settlement of the problem. This declaration was 
made today by the new chairman of Georgian Committee on human 
rights defence and ethnic relations Sandro Kavsadze in an 
interview to SNARK. 
  In his words, such mechanism could be the CIS collective 
security forces. "We cannot wait. Otherwise, the situation in 
Abkhazia may become ungovernable, and the conflict will acquire 
a large-scale character," stressed Kavsadze. 
  Besides, he noted that official Tbilisi raises the question 
of expanding the mandate of the UN observers dislocated in the 
conflict zone, and increasing their number.
