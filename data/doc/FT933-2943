FT  16 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ofgas must keep teeth
Sir, One way for British Gas to protect its monopoly is to seek regulation
of the regulator ('British Gas demands curbs on regulator', September 7).
British Gas spends a great deal of time, money and resources on public
relations and political lobbying. I am sure that it would like a more
comfortable relationship with its regulator so it could take full advantage
of the situation.
Even if its market share is reduced to 25 per cent in due course, British
Gas will continue to wield immense power over the UK's gas industry. As
mentioned by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Ofgas under Sir James
McKinnon has had a positive impact, bringing down British Gas charges for
gas transportation and price in the tariff market. I find it hard to imagine
that without Sir James's no-nonsense approach British Gas would have brought
down prices of its own accord.
I hope his successor proves to be equally tenacious and committed. Although
the MMC has opened the door to competition a bit further, it still leaves a
lot to be done. There is a danger that the flames of competition just
unleashed in the gas market will be extinguished. We will need a 'Sir James'
more than ever.
