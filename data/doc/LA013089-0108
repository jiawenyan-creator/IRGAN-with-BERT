SANTA ANA MAN SHOOTS SELF IN HEAD 
A Santa Ana man died Sunday night after he accidentally shot himself in the 
head, police said. 
Family members of Jose Rojas, 19, called police about 9:45 p.m. yesterday, 
officials said, to report that he was brandishing a .357-caliber handgun 
outside his home in the 1100 block of West Walnut Street. When police arrived, 
they found Rojas lying on the ground with a fatal gunshot wound to the head, 
police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
Family members and neighbors told police that Rojas had been drinking and 
firing the gun all day. 
Thomas said there was no evidence Rojas intended to commit suicide, so police 
are calling the shooting accidental.
