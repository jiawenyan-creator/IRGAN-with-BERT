FT  31 MAR 94 / Property deal shows stronger demand
Scottish Amicable, the insurance and investment group, has agreed to buy the
Camberley Shopping Centre in Surrey for about Pounds 90m from the receivers
of Mountleigh, the property company that failed in May 1992.
The deal, the largest retail transaction since the sale last September of
Merry Hill, a shopping centre in the West Midlands, reflects the continued
strength of institutional demand for commercial property. Several
institutions, property companies and overseas buyers made bids for the
centre, which had an asking price of Pounds 77.5m.
The strong interest in the property contrasts with the absence of buyers
when it was first put on the market 18 months ago.
The 350,000 sq ft property has an annual rental income of about Pounds 7m.
The sale brings the total realised from Mountleigh's portfolio to more than
Pounds 250m.
