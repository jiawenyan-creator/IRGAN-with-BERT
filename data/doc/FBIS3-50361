  [Text] The talks between the Protest Committee formed by 
"Solidarity" ["S"], "Solidarity '80" ["S'80"], "Kontra" of the 
Confederation for an Independent Poland, and the Board of 
Directors of the Jastrzebie Coal Partnership have not yielded 
any results. The unionists insist on 15-percent wage increases. 
The board is prepared to give them only half of that. The 
miners are still occupying the company's seat, whereas the board 
is remaining in the building of the Chief Technical 
Organization. Talks have been broken off; while waiting for the 
talks to be resumed, the miners prepared a poster newspaper that 
is being distributed at the Jastrzebie mines. They turn 
directly to the prime minister; they write mainly about the sale 
of the Silesian Bank. This is what they wrote in the paper: 
  "Mr. Prime Minister Pawlak, what is going on? The miners of 
three trade union centers--'S,' 'S'80,' and 'Kontra'--are 
protesting the continuous decrease in real wages. They want 
more for their hard and dangerous work. The owner--that is, the 
industry minister, who is a member of your government--says `no' 
to the modest demands of the miners. At the same time, the 
ownership transformations minister allows huge and unjustified 
fortunes to be made in only one day. The loss that we all 
incurred as a result of the sale of the Silesian Bank is 
unimaginable to the miners. We want only a 15-percent raise, 
which is a fraction of 1 percent of the money that was stolen 
from the Poles. Mr. Pawlak, we know what is going on. We also 
know the saying: `If you do not know how to do things, do not 
shoulder your way to the limelight.' We remember well those 
declarations: `The situation does not have to be like this.' 
Now we are saying: `The situation must be changed!'"
