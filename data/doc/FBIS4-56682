  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said 
high-ranking U.S. officials, including U.S. State Secretary 
Warren Christopher and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor, 
have "openly" expressed their government's interest in 
negotiating a free trade agreement with Chile. 
  An official Foreign Ministry note states: "This has been 
confirmed publicly and unequivocally on several occasions. The 
only points requiring definition are the methods to be used, the 
bilateral agreement, membership to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), and the date to officially begin negotiating." 
  The foreign minister thus answered a report that an 
unidentified Foreign Ministry official had mentioned 
difficulties in the negotiations, or that Chile is not a 
priority for the United States in the free trade agreement. The 
mentioned report says, among other things, that the United 
States has made environmental demands that Chile cannot meet. 
  Figueroa said: "I want to say that such a report is 
absolutely false because all the information we gathered through 
the Foreign Ministry, the public, and through several involved 
U.S. Government officials, shows that negotiations between Chile 
and the United States over a free trade treaty or over joining 
the NAFTA are open and ready to go." [passage omitted]
