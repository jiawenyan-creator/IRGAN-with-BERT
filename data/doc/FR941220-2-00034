 

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1(800) 2485100 (in Missouri
1(800) 3426700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Phillip F. McKee: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Ernest L. Blake, Jr., Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts  Trowbridge, 2300 N Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20037 attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)(v) and 2.714(d).

The Commission hereby provides notice that this is a proceeding on an application for a license amendment falling
within the scope of section 134 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), 42 U.S.C. 10154. Under section 134 of
the NWPA, the Commission, at the request of any party to the proceeding must use hybrid hearing procedures with respect
to ``any matter which the Commission determines to be in controversy among the parties.'' The hybrid procedures in
section 134 provide for oral argument on matters in controversy, proceeded by discovery under the Commission's rules,
and the designation, following argument, of only those factual issues that involve a genuine and substantial dispute,
together with any remaining questions of law, to be resolved in an adjudicatory hearing. Actual adjudicatory hearings
are to be held on those issues found to meet the criteria of section 134 and set for hearing after oral argument.

The Commission's rules implementing section 134 of the NWPA are found in 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart K, ``Hybrid Hearing
Procedures for Expansion of Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Capacity at Civilian Nuclear Power Reactors'' (published
at 50 FR 41670, October 15, 1985) to 10 CFR 2.1101 

et seq

. Under those rules, any party to the proceeding may invoke the hybrid hearing procedures by filing with the presiding
officer a written request for oral argument under 10 CFR 2.1109. To be timely, the request must be filed within 10 days
of an order granting a request for hearing or petition to intervene. (As outlined above, the Commission's rules in
10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G, and 2.714 in particular, continue to govern the filing of requests for a hearing or petitions
to intervene, as well as the admission of contentions.) The presiding officer shall grant a timely request for oral
argument. The presiding officer may grant untimely request for oral argument only upon showing of good cause by the
requesting party for the failure to file on time and after providing the other parties an opportunity to respond to
the untimely request. If the presiding officer grants a request for oral argument, any hearing held on the application
shall be concluded in accordance with hybrid hearing procedures. In essence, those procedures limit the time available
for discovery and require that an oral argument be held to determine whether any contentions must be resolved in adjudicatory
hearing. If no party to the proceedings requests oral argument, or if all untimely requests for oral argument are denied,
then the usual procedures in 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G, apply.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 25, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington DC, and at the local public document room located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department,
101 Washington Street, Toms River, New Jersey 08753.
