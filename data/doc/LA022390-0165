WORLD; 
FORMER SWISS OFFICIAL CLEARED OF VIOLATING SECRECY POLICIES 
The nation's highest court today cleared former Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp 
of violating official secrecy, a charge that ended her chances for the 
presidency. 
The five-judge panel of the Federal Criminal Court ruled that Kopp had not 
violated official secrecy laws when she made a telephone call warning her 
husband to quit a company suspected of laundering drug profits. 
The court said it could not be proved that she revealed secret information 
deliberately. 
A guilty verdict would have made Kopp Switzerland's first government minister 
disgraced by a criminal conviction. 
Kopp, 53, was forced to resign from the government in the unprecedented case 
that cost her a chance to be Switzerland's first woman president. 
Kopp telephoned her husband Hans on Oct. 27, 1988, to tell him to resign as 
vice chairman of Shakarchi Trading Co., a Zurich-based foreign exchange and 
gold-trading firm about to be linked to a "Lebanon Connection" money-laundering 
probe.
