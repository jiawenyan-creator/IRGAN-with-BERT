BRIEFLY 
Wesson Refinery to Close: Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson will close its Wesson oil 
refinery in Fullerton, eliminating about 100 jobs, a company spokeswoman said. 
No date was set. The company told workers that the refinery would be closed for 
"economic and strategic reasons," the spokeswoman said. The 1,500 employees at 
Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson's Fullerton headquarters and another 900 employees -- 
including seasonal employees -- at the tomato-processing and can-making plants 
also in Fullerton are not affected.
