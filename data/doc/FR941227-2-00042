December 20, 1994. 




Take notice that on December 15, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company filed First Revised Substitute Ninth Sheet
No. 30 pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act and Section XXVI of the General Terms and Conditions of Tennessee's
Fifth Revised FERC Gas Tariff. The tariff sheet is proposed to become effective November 1, 1994. 

Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the Commission's Order on Technical Conference
issued November 15, 1994 in Docket Nos. RP94197000 and RP93151007, and to adjust the GSR
costs previously reported in Tennessee's past GSR quarterly filings. Tennessee's currently effective GSR charges
were accepted by the Commission and allowed to become effective November 1, 1994 in Tennessee's last quarterly GSR
docket, Docket No. RP94425. 

Tennessee states further that it has recalculated its pricing differential costs for each month since implementing
Order No. 636 on September 1, 1993, and that the net effect of the adjustments is to reduce Tennessee's pricing differential
costs by approximately $1.5 million, and to decrease Tennessee's currently effective total demand surcharge by
11 cents, from $3.96 per Dth to $3.85 per Dth. Copies of this filing were posted in accordance with section 154.16 of
the Commission's regulations and mailed it to all affected customers and state commissions. 

Any person desiring to protest the filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426 in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before December 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the
proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with
the Commission and are available for public inspection.
