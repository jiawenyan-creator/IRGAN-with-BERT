  [Text] Several rounds of barrage fire from an 
anti-aircraft machinegun landed on the central parts of the town 
last night. The chetniks were frequently firing provocatively 
with small arms at the defense lines on the left bank of the 
Drina River. They also fired grenades. The outskirts of the 
free territory were shelled occasionally. 
  Somewhat more intensive shelling by the aggressor's 
artillery 
took place on the sector of the front toward Foca and Pale. The 
situation on the right bank of the Drina River has not changed 
since the arrival of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. The 
chetniks are still in the same positions. The looting has more 
or less been completed. UNPROFOR units are still without 
precise orders and authority. Two UN helicopters landed in 
Gorazde this morning. After a brief stop they left toward 
Sarajevo. It is said unofficially that General Rose paid a 
visit to the members of the peacekeeping units.
