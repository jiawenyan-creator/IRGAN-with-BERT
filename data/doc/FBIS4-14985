  [Text] Estonia has not changed its positions concerning 
the retired Russian military and the troops withdrawal, Prime 
Minister Mart Laar told the news conference yesterday. Laar 
hoped that Russia will assume constructive views and claimed to 
rely on the Russian leaders' common sense. "Russia is the only 
country whose interests are harmed by the continued troops 
presence in Estonia," he explained. 
  Foreign Ministry vice-chancellor Raul Malk announced that 
Estonia is ready to initial the troops withdrawal agreement and 
claimed that the Russian troops will leave by August 31. He 
also pointed out that Russia's views on the Hitler-Stalin pact 
had been clarified lately, although differences concerning the 
legal aspects of Estonia's annexation still exist. 
  However, head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin 
declared in Moscow that the August 31 troop withdrawal deadline 
will be "no longer current" if an agreement on "social 
guarantees" to the retired military will not be signed. 
  A Foreign Ministry press release of Tuesday, April 5, 
announced that Russia had linked the troops withdrawal date with 
two additional conditions. Amendments to Estonian legislation 
were still demanded, as well as the granting of automatic 
residence permits to all retired or reserve officers, regardless 
of the legality of their residence. The demands for the 23 
million dollars to construct housing for the officers being 
withdrawn were also reiterated.
