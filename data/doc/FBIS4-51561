  [Text] Tokyo, May 1 KYODO -- The new cabinet of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata posted a 51.6 percent public approval 
rating, down 24.1 percentage points from last August's 
inauguration of the cabinet of his predecessor, Morihiro 
Hosokawa, a KYODO NEWS SERVICE public opinion poll showed Sunday 
[1 May]. 
  The support for Hata's cabinet also represented a 3.5 
percentage point decline from the 1991 inauguration of the 
cabinet of then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  KYODO's telephone poll of 1,000 voters also showed that 31.3 
percent disapproved of the Hata cabinet while the remaining 17.1 
percent gave no clear answer. 
  A YOMIURI SHIMBUN survey published Sunday put the cabinet 
approval rating at 58.0 percent. 
  KYODO conducted the survey Friday and Saturday covering 486 
men and 513 women aged 20 or older and picked at random 
throughout the country. 
  Hata, head of the ruling coalition's core party Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], was elected prime minister last Monday 
and inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday after the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) quit the coalition. 
  The poll also said 37.4 percent supported the SDP's 
departure 
from the coalition, compared with 20.7 percent who would like to 
see the SDP rejoin the coalition, 41.1 percent who neither 
supported nor disapproved of the SDP's departure, and 0.8 
percent who gave no clear answer. 
  Asked why the pollees supported the Hata cabinet, an 
overwhelming 48.3 percent replied that there is no other 
appropriate candidate, compared with 18.0 percent who showed 
trust in the new prime minister and 17.1 percent who expressed 
positive expectations of reforms. 
  Among the nonsupporters, 58.1 percent replied that Hata is 
under excessive influence by key coalition strategist Ichiro 
Ozawa, cofounder and secretary general of Shinseito. 
  The poll showed 18.5 percent of the nonsupporters view 
Hata's 
minority cabinet as unstable, 12.5 percent replied they cannot 
count on the cabinet's policies and 7.0 percent indicated 
concern with the exclusion of Japan's two largest political 
parties -- the LDP and the SDP. 
  Asked to pick the most important policy item for the Hata 
cabinet, 44.4 percent of the pollees cited economic 
pump-priming, followed by 18.4 percent for tax reform, 16.7 
percent for political reform, 5.5 percent for deregulation, 5.0 
percent for national security, and 4.7 percent for improvement 
of Japan-U.S. relations. 
  The poll said 39.8 percent predicted the Hata cabinet to 
last 
about half a year, while 29.3 percent indicated one year, 20.9 
percent said two or three months, and 6.1 percent predicted two 
years or longer. 
  Those approving of the inauguration of the minority 
government reached 32.1 percent, while 32.9 percent expressed 
concern, and 33.7 percent expressed neither approval nor concern. 
  Of those who expressed concern, 71.4 percent called for an 
early dissolution of the House of Representatives for a snap 
general election, 21.3 percent proposed soliciting members of 
the LDP and SDP to form a majority ruling force, and 3.3 percent 
urged the Hata cabinet to resign en masse. 
  The LDP, the largest opposition party, was the most popular 
among the respondents garnering support of 17.2 percent, down 
from 18.3 percent in February. 
  Hata's Shinseito ranked second at 12.2 percent, up from 6.4 
percent, the SDP ranked third at 11.2 percent, up from 9.2 
percent. 
  Komeito, a coalition party backed by the country's biggest 
Buddhist lay organization Soka Gakkai, garnered support of 4.4 
percent, up from 3.3 percent, and new party Sakigake rose to 2.9 
percent from 2.1 percent. 
  Hosokawa's Japan New Party, which enjoyed booming popular 
support in last July's general election, suffered a crushing 
setback as voter support dropped to 2.1 percent from 8.2 percent. 
  Last month, three members left the JNP because of 
differences 
with the party leadership over the party's approach to Shinseito. 
  The number of voters who do not support any particular party 
remained unchanged at 42.3 percent.
