FT  09 AUG 93 / Bhutto's brother in power bid
MR Murtaza Bhutto, the exiled brother of Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's
opposition leader, plans to return to contest the October elections, raising
speculation of a power struggle in the Bhutto family, writes Farhan Bokhari
in Islamabad.
The polls were called after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam
Ishaq Khan stepped down last month.
The Bhutto family has led the Pakistan People's party, the most important
opposition force, for almost 25 years. Mrs Nusrat Bhutto, the family's
matriarch and Ms Bhutto's mother, said at the weekend that Mr Bhutto would
end his 16-year exile in Damascus.
He fled Pakistan in 1977 when an army coup toppled his father, former prime
minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was later executed following a conviction
for conspiring to murder a political opponent.
