FT  07 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: More good news for dollar
THE dollar crept cautiously higher in late European trade yesterday after
rumours of intervention by the Bundesbank and Federal Reserve proved false,
and dealers turned their attention back to a surprisingly strong US February
employment report, writes Neil Buckley.
The dollar had opened at DM1.6685/95 but spent a nervous morning waiting for
the employment data, and later came under pressure as the Swiss National
Bank finally intervened against both the dollar and the D-mark to support
the ailing Swiss franc.
It rebounded to a DM1.6777 high when the non-farm payroll figure showed a
large increase of 164,000, higher than the most optimistic estimates.
At this point, the SNB was reported to have intervened once more,
concentrating this time on aggressive dollar selling. This sparked rumours
of wider intervention which knocked the dollar back to DM1.6570 before the
market realised they were untrue and the dollar began its upward climb
again. It closed at DM1.6695 in London.
Volatile trading in New York left it at DM1.6690 by midday.
'The payroll data were much stronger than expected and seemed to confirm the
view that the US economy is in the early stages of recovery,' said Mr Gerard
Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. 'The Fed now has little scope
for easing interest rates.'
In Japan, a disappointing Tankan survey provided more evidence of economic
weakness. The Bank of Japan is now widely expected to ease interest rates,
possibly after March 13, when the lower house is due to approve next year's
budget.
Efforts by Mr Hiroshi Yasuda, the deputy finance minister, to talk the
dollar down by warning of possible coordinated intervention by the G7
countries had little effect, and the dollar looks set to remain in its new
range above Y130. It closed yesterday little changed at Y131.75, from
Y131.85
The Swiss National Bank's intervention managed to strengthen the Swiss franc
against the D-mark from SFr0.9110 on Thursday to SFr0.9090 yesterday.
The Bank of Canada also acted to underpin its currency by raising its prime
rate by 75 basis points to 8.25 per cent.
In the EMS, the peseta went through its ceiling to 6.33 per cent above its
pivot against bottom-placed sterling, before slipping back to 6.23 per cent.
Sterling had another shaky day. It closed steady against the D-mark at
DM2.8700, but had earlier dipped below DM2.8660 to touch its effective floor
against the D-mark. Dealers said that only the threat of intervention around
that level moved the currency back up.
Against the dollar, sterling firmed very slightly to Dollars 1.7185 from
Dollars 1.7165 on Thursday.
