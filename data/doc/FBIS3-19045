  [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- France reminded Germany 
Wednesday [9 March] of the role played by its Western allies in 
the fall of the Berlin Wall, a day after Bonn refused to allow 
allied forces to hold a parade before leaving Berlin in 
September. 
  "France, like its allies, wishes to give these departure 
ceremonies all the importance linked to a military presence that 
contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall" in November 1989, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said. 
  He was reacting to German Chancelor Helmut Kohl's decision 
earlier that no military parade should be held when American, 
British and French troops withdraw from the east German city in 
September. 
  Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Kohl's decision stemmed from 
"internal and external pressure," and may be linked to the 
German government being miffed at not having been invited to 
join ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the allied 
landing on Normandy beaches on June 6.
