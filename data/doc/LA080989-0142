COUNTY-BASED MAZDA AND HYUNDAI RATED AMONG BEST IN AUTO SATISFACTION SURVEY 
Two car companies that have U.S. headquarters in Orange County -- Mazda and 
Hyundai -- ranked among the best in an annual survey of customer satisfaction 
among new-car buyers. 
The survey, released this week by J.D. Power &amp; Associates, amounts to a 
report card for domestic, Japanese and European autos. The Agoura Hills 
marketing research firm scores the makes according to customer satisfaction for 
both product quality and dealer service over the first 12 months of car 
ownership. 
For that reason, the Power survey is one of the most influential in the auto 
industry. 
Average Jumps 10 Points 
J.D. Power asked more than 24,000 owners of 1988 models about 16 categories 
ranging from satisfaction with the dealer to mechanical problems and vehicle 
repair. The survey ranks 158 models of 35 makes, or nameplates. 
In the 1989 survey, the industry average -- for domestic, Japanese and European 
autos -- was 118, a whopping 10-point jump above last year's industry average. 
On one hand, the increase in the average score is good news: It means that 
satisfaction levels have gone up over time. But on the other hand, 
manufacturers can also expect that "customer satisfaction will also rise -- so 
it will be more difficult to maintain those high levels of satisfaction," said 
William Fleming, an account executive with J.D. Power. 
Among manufacturers with operations in Orange County, Mazda got the highest 
marks. The Japanese company, which has U.S. headquarters in Irvine, ranked No. 
8 with a score of 125 -- an eight-point jump from the 1988 score of 117. 
In comments released with the survey, J.D. Power states, "Mazda's people skills 
improved dramatically to move above the industry average. . . . (The) vehicle 
repair/reliability score stayed relatively constant, but remained above the 
industry average. The problem-at-delivery level continues to be below the 
industry average. . . . 
"The proportion of owners indicating they are 'very satisfied' with dealers . . 
. and their overall ownership experience are both significantly higher than the 
industry average." 
Hyundai, a South Korean company with U.S. headquarters in Garden Grove, ranked 
No. 14 with a score of 119, one point above the industry average. That meant 
that Hyundai dropped from its 13th-place slot on last year's rankings, even 
though its score climbed by seven points. 
In comments on the survey, J.D. Power states that Hyundai's customer handling 
skills are about equal to last year's. "However, the improving industry average 
put the nameplate under the total industry average" compared to last year. 
Two Others in Top 25 
"Hyundai's slightly improved repair/reliability performance did not keep up 
with the gains made by the total industry," the survey continues. "Both 
problems during the warranty period and service delays due to lack of parts are 
below the industry average. 
"Owners' satisfaction with their new vehicles and their ownership experience 
remain well below the industry averages. . . . However, Hyundai owners were 
more likely to indicate they are 'very satisfied' with dealers selling their 
make and their overall ownership experience than were Hyundai owners in the 
1988 survey." 
Two other Japanese companies with U.S. headquarters in Orange County -- 
Daihatsu and Mitsubishi -- were ranked by J.D. Power among the top 25. 
Daihatsu tied with two other manufacturers for 17th place, scoring 117, one 
point below the industry average. 
The car, which was introduced in January, 1988, scored lower in the 
service-advisory categories and "very high" in the product categories, said 
C.R. Brown, chief operating officer with Los Alamitos-based Daihatsu American 
Inc. 
Those scores translate to customers that are unhappy with treatment at the 
dealership, particularly with the apparent lack of knowledge on the part of 
service managers who write up repair orders at dealerships. 
Brown said that because the Daihatsu is a new product, all of its dealerships 
are new. So when the survey was completed, "many of our dealers had just been 
in business 30, 60 or 90 days. It takes time to get fully trained and 
indoctrinated on the product. . . . We'll improve as service advisers have more 
experience," he said. 
Daihatsu got high marks in the J.D. Power IQS survey, which measures problems 
encountered by customers in the first 90 days of ownership. That separate 
survey, which was released in June, ranked Daihatsu above average with fewer 
problems per 100 vehicles than the industry average. The industry average was 
153 problems per 100 cars. 
In the car satisfaction survey, meanwhile, Mitsubishi, was ranked 21st -- a 
drop from last year's No. 18 ranking. 
In that survey, Mitsubishi scored 112, six points below the industry average of 
118. Even so, the score marks an improvement over last year when the 
manufacturer scored 109 on an industry average of 108. 
"We dropped slightly this year because the entire industry is moving ahead," 
said Tom Benson, Mitsubishi's vice president of service. Kim Custer, a 
spokesman with Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, added that 
Mitsubishi will soon announce a "comprehensive effort" to improve overall 
customer satisfaction.
