FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson AGB benefits from merger with
Pounds 3.12m
TAYLOR NELSON AGB yes-terday issued its first full year results since
becoming the largest market research group in the UK following the merger of
Taylor Nelson and AGB Research.
The expanded group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.12m last year
against Pounds 486,000 in 1991, with higher net in-terest income of Pounds
479,000 (Pounds 122,000) more than off-setting the group's share of losses
from associates, which increased to Pounds 294,000 (Pounds 30,000).
Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 47.2m (Pounds 18.1m) reflec-ting the
acquisition of AGB, part of the collap-sed Maxwell private empire, in March
last year and organic growth in the Taylor Nelson businesses which boosted
their turnover to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 17.9m).
However, some businesses sold by the group in earlier years ran into
financial difficulties and the group, because of its responsibilities as
original tenant, incurred Pounds 1.3m of unexpected rent charges last year.
This cost, which is included in a Pounds 1.62m extraordinary charge, also
includes a provision for future rental payments.
Despite the extraordinary charge, earnings per share more than doubled to
1.28p (0.62p), and the group is paying a final dividend of 0.2p, making 0.3p
for the year, up from 0.15p a share in 1991.
Mr Tony Cowling, chief executive, said: 'the merger of the existing Taylor
Nelson businesses, with the acquired AGB, RSGB and related businesses, has
proved to be profitable for the group and for shareholders, and has
generated considerable opportunities for development and expansion'.
He said that against a 'difficult and highly competitive market background'
the group achieved its profit margin target, recording a return on sales of
6.6 per cent compared with 4.6 per cent in the second half of 1991.
The group's strong performance and the successful and speedy integration of
the AGB businesses, resulted in very strong cash genera-tion over the year
and the group ended the year to end-December with Pounds 6.7m of net cash.
