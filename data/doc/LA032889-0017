MORNING REPORT: OSCAR WATCH 
The telecast of the 61st Academy Awards Wednesday night will feature nearly 
seven minutes of computer animation, said to be a record for an awards 
broadcast. Designed by graphic artist C. David Pena, the visual lead-ins to the 
various categories feature silver film strips, gold Oscars statues and neon-lit 
movie marquees to match the program's theme of "That Old Hollywood Glamour." A 
computer-generated envelope will open to reveal the name of each winner and a 
simulation of the beaded curtain in the Shrine Auditorium will rise to reveal 
the staged production numbers. The animation was created at the Limelight 
Studio in Hollywood. ALEENE MacMINN
