FT  31 DEC 93 / Sizewell B faces inspection after test
Engineers were last night preparing to carry out detailed inspections
following a crucial test on the Sizewell B nuclear power station containment
building - the barrier designed to prevent any release of radioactivity,
David Green writes.
Pressure inside the sphere-shaped building on the Suffolk coast has been
pumped up during the past two days in excess of the maximum it is thought
likely to have to withstand in the event of a major accident.
The building, which is larger than St Paul's cathedral, expanded by 5mm. The
test was carried out on the innermost of the two 'skins' which make up the
sphere, the central part of the Pounds 2.03bn power station.
