FT  18 AUG 93 / How warring sides have mapped out the future
A Serb-Croat proposal for the maps leaves the Moslems, who made up 44 per
cent of the pre-war population of 4.35m, in a landlocked republic consisting
of two parts as well as the three pockets in eastern Bosnia, writes Laura
Silber. However, the plan gives no guarantees to the Moslems of access to
Adriatic ports. In a report earlier this month, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary-general, said the enclaves would be linked to the mostly
Moslem Bosnian republic by 'access authority throughways'. This proposal was
accepted after 'intense negotiations with the Serb side'. In contrast, a map
proposed by the Bosnian government claims most of eastern Bosnia and
territorial access to ports on the Sava River and the Adriatic.
