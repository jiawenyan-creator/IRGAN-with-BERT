 

The licensee notified the referring physician, the patient, and the patient's family of the misadministration.



Cause or Causes

_The seed leaked after being inadvertently crushed by a surgical staple used to secure the catheters during the implant
procedure.



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_For future procedures, the licensee plans to ensure that the implanted seeds are located further down the catheter
in order to reduce the likelihood of seed damage from surgical staples. The licensee also plans to examine each I125
seed for leakage following each explant procedure.



NRC

_NRC dispatched two inspectors on January 16, 1994, to monitor the licensee's decontamination efforts and to obtain
more details on the misadministration. NRC also obtained the services of a medical consultant to review the medical
implications of the incident. A followup NRC inspection (Letter from W.L. Axelson, Director, Division of Radiation
Safety and Safeguards, to Donald Harrison, M.D., Senior Vice President and Provost for Health Affairs, University
of Cincinnati, forwarded Inspection Report No. 03002764/94001, Docket No. 03002764, License No.
340690305, dated March 10, 1994) was conducted from February 7 to 11, 1994. On March 16, 1994, NRC held
a telephone Enforcement Conference with the licensee to discuss the safety inspections conducted in January and
February 1994, at the University of Cincinnati.

A Notice of Violation was issued by NRC on March 25, 1994, which imposed a fine of $5000 for a violation not associated
with this misadministration. In the Notice of Violation, NRC determined that the inadvertent opening of the I125
sealed source did not constitute a violation of the University of Cincinnati's license.

946Medical Brachytherapy Misadministration at Keesler Medical Center at Keesler Air Force Base
in Biloxi, Mississippi



One of the AO reporting guidelines notes that a therapeutic exposure to a part of the body scheduled to receive radiation
such that the actual dose received is greater than 1.5 5imes the prescribed dose can be considered an abnormal occurrence.



Date and Place

_January 13, 1994; Keesler Medical Center, Keesler Air Force Base; Biloxi, Mississippi.



Nature and Probable Consequences

_A patient was prescribed a lung brachytherapy treatment delivered by an Omnitron 2000 high-dose-rate (HDR) remote
afterloader system. The prescribed tumor treatment plan included 1000 centigray (cGy) (1000 rad) absorbed doses
at 5 treatment positions using a 144.3 gigabecquerel (3.9 curie) iridium-192 source within a special needle. At the
end of fifth and last treatment, the source wire retracted 0.5 centimeter (cm) (0.2 inch) and stopped. Alarms immediately
alerted Keesler staff that the source remained inside the patient's body. Licensee personnel followed emergency
procedures, entered the therapy room and removed the needle from the patient. Once outside the patient's body, the
radioactive source retracted to the stored position.

The licensee determined that the source remained stuck at 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) above the fifth position for approximately
21/2 minutes. The treatment plan called for the delivery of 1000 centigray (cGy) (1000 rad) at 1cm from each of the 5
treatment positions. As a result of the additional 21/2 minutes exposure, the last treatment position received 1732
cGy (1732 rad) absorbed dose, or 73.2 percent over the prescribed dose. The treatment plan also predicted an 800 cGy
(800 rad) absorbed dose at 0.5cm (0.2 inch) from each of the 5 treatment positions. The point 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) above
the last treatment position, where the movement of the source stopped, received approximately 1400 cGy (1400 rad),
or 75 percent greater than the absorbed dose stipulated in the prescribed treatment plan. The failure of the source
to retract resulted in a single overexposure, causing an overall absorbed dose of 75 percent greater than that prescribed,
for all the tissue surrounding the position 0.5cm (0.2 inch) above the last treatment site.

The licensee reported that no adverse health effects to the patient are expected. The patient was immediately notified
of the misadministration.



Cause or Causes



The patient had made a sudden move near the end of the treatment causing the special needle to bend at the point where
it extended beyond the biopsy needle. The bend prevented the radioactive source from retracting to the stored position,
causing the misadministration.



Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence





Licensee

_The licensee immediately stopped the use of the HDR device pending a complete check of the system by the manufacturer
(Letter from Omnitron International, Inc. to NRC Document control Desk, forwarding a Report of HDR misadministration,
Part 21 Reporting of Defects and Noncompliance, Omnitron Report No. 102, dated January 19, 1994, Docket No.
03026841, License No. 422353901AF; and Letter from Omnitron International, Inc. to John W.
Lubinski, Mechanical Engineer, Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, NRC Washington, D.C., forwarding a report
of Inspection of Source Wire, dated April 6, 1994, Docket No. 03026841, License No. 422353901AF).
The licensee also evaluated the practice of extending special needles beyond biopsy needles and the probability
of patient movement causing damage, and decided to discontinue this practice (Letter from Department of the Army,
HQ AFMOA/SGPR, Brooks AFB, TX to NRC Region IV, forwarding the 15-Day Report of Misadministration at Keesler AFB,
MS, dated February 1, 1994, Docket 03026841, License No. 422353901AF; and Letter from Department
of the Army, HQ AFMOA/SGPR, Brooks AFB, TX to NRC Region IV, responding to a NRC Confirmatory Action Letter (dated January
18, 1994), dated March 8, 1994, Docket 03026841, License No. 422353901AF).



NRC

_A special inspection was conducted from January 19 to 21, 1994, to review the circumstances surrounding the misadministration
and the licensee's Quality Management program. A representative of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also
participated in this inspection. No violations of regulatory requirements were identified during the inspection,
but NRC initiated the following actions: (1) A Confirmatory Action Letter (Letter from James L. Milhoan, Regional
Administrator, Region IV, to Department of the Army, USAF Radioisotope Committee, HQ AFMOA/SGPR, Brooks AFB, TX,
forwarding a Confirmatory Action Letter, CAL No. 49401, Docket No. 03028641, License No. 422353901AF,
dated January 18, 1994) was issued to the licensee on January 18, 1994, which prohibited the use of the HDR unit until
serviced by the manufacturer; (2) a medical consultant was contracted to evaluate the clinical effects and to assess
the events that led to this misadministration; (3) the manufacturer was asked to analyze the source wire involved
in the misadministration for damage as a result of the stresses experienced during this event; (4) Southwest Research
Institute was contracted to analyze the special needle for mechanical failure; (5) a generic communication is being
developed to notify other HDR users of the results of the inspection and related research; and (6) NRC is coordinating
with FDA an evaluation of the generic implications surrounding this event.
