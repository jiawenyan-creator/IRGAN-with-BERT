 

II. Submission of Amendment


By letter dated September 14, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KS567), Kansas submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Kansas submitted the proposed amendment with the intent of satisfying, in part,
required program amendments at 30 CFR 916.16 (a), (b) and (c) that were placed on the Kansas program on October 7, 1988
(53 FR 39467, 39470), September 13, 1991 (56 FR 46548), and June 14, 1993 (58 FR 32847, 32855).
OSM published a notice in the September 27, 1993, 

Federal Register

 announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on the adequacy of the proposed amendment (58 FR 50302).
The public comment period ended October 27, 1993. The public hearing scheduled for October 22, 1993, was not held because
no one requested an opportunity to testify.
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns related to the Kansas Administrative Regulations (K.A.R.)
47414a(c)(7), regarding intervention, K.A.R. 47414a (d)(10)(D) and (d)(5)(B)(vi)
regarding public hearings, K.A.R. 4755a (a) and (b) regarding civil penalties, K.A.R. 4755a(b)(14)
regarding the definition of ``violation, failure or refusal,'' and K.A.R. 47151a(b)(21) regarding
inspection and enforcement, substitution of terms.
OSM notified Kansas of these concerns by letter dated January 26, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS574).
Kansas responded in a letter dated March 9, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS575), by submitting further
revisions to Articles 4, 5, 6, 9, and 15 of the Kansas Administrative Regulations. On March 10, 1994 (Administrative
Record No. KS581), Kansas requested further information from OSM regarding its proposed amendment. Subsequently,
Kansas again, in a letter dated March 10, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS576), revised its proposed amendment.
OSM reopened the public comment period on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14811). The public comment period closed on April 14,
1994.


III. Director's Findings


After a thorough review, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Director finds,
with two exceptions, that the proposed amendment as submitted by Kansas on September 14, 1993, meets the requirements
of SMCRA and 30 CFR chapter VII.


1. Provisions Not Discussed


Kansas proposes certain revisions to its rules that involve minor typographical corrections and recodification.
The Director finds that these proposed revisions, unless specifically discussed below, are no less effective in
meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations and is approving them.


2. Required Program Amendments


Kansas submitted proposed revisions in response to required program amendments that the Director placed on the Kansas
program, codified in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 916.16 (a), (b) and (c). The Director finds that the following
proposed State regulations satisfy the required program amendments, are no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements
than the Federal regulations indicated in each required program amendment, and is approving them (the codified required
amendments at 30 CFR 916.16 are indicated in brackets): K.A.R. 47414a(c)(7) by requiring that a person
petitioning for leave to intervene in a proceeding need only show why his interest is or may be adversely affected rather
than why his interest would be adversely affected and by requiring the presiding officer to make a decision to grant
intervention based on factors listed at K.A.R. 47414a(c)(7)(B)(i)(iv) in the event subsection
(7)(A)(i) or (7)(A)(ii) are not applicable [30 CFR 916.16(b)(8)]; K.A.R. 47414a(c)(11) by providing
that any person that fails to file a responsive pleading by the required time 

may

 be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing [30 CFR 916.16(b)(10)]; K.A.R. 47414a (b), (d), and (d)(2)(F)
by replacing the phrase ``this act'' with the phrase ``these rules and regulations,'' [30 CFR 916.16(c)(2)]; K.A.R.
4755a (a) and (b), (a)(8), (a)(10) and (b)(14)(20) by replacing the identified Federal terms
and citations with the appropriate State terms and citations and by providing the State address where an individual
may file a petition for review [30 CFR 916.16(b)(24)]; K.A.R. 4755a(b)(14) by replacing Federal terms
and citations with the appropriate State terms and citations [30 CFR 916.16(b)(24)]; K.A.R. 4755a(c)(7)(C)
by imposing a 30-day time limit within which the Surface Mining Section must remit a refund [30 CFR 916.16(c)(3)];
K.A.R. 4767(h)(2) by correcting an improper reference from K.A.R. 47414a(d)(14) to
K.A.R. 47414a(d)(14) [30 CFR 916.16(b)(30)]; K.A.R. 4791 (c)(17) and (d)(17) by modifying
the adoption by reference of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.61 by deleting from its adoption by reference of
30 CFR 816817.61(c)(1) everything but the statement ``all blasting operations shall be conducted under the
direction of a certified blaster,'' [30 CFR 916.16(c)(4)]; K.A.R. 4791 (c)(46) and (d)(44) by deleting
paragraph (d), concerning variances for steep slope mining, from its adoption by reference of 30 CFR 816817.133
[30 CFR 916.16(a)]; K.A.R. 47151a by removing the incorrect reference to K.A.R. 47155a
from the section heading for K.A.R. 47151a [30 CFR 916.16(c)(5)]; K.A.R. 47151a(b) (6)
and (9) by providing the correct counterpart State citations for the terms ``43 CFR Part 4'' and ``43 CFR 4.1281,''
[30 CFR 916.16(c)(7)]; and K.A.R. 4747151a(b)(21) by requiring that informal public hearings
be conducted in accordance with K.A.R. 47414a [30 CFR 916.16(c)(6)].
Accordingly, the Director is removing the required program amendments as identified above from the Kansas program
and as codified at 30 CFR 916.16.


3. K.A.R. 47275(e)(6), Definitions


Kansas proposes to revise K.A.R. 47275(e)(6) to replace the reference in the Federal regulations at
30 CFR 846.5 to section 703 of SMCRA which deals with employee protection, with a reference to Kansas Statute Annotated
(K.S.A.) 752973 which also deals with employee protection. Kansas is submitting this revision in response
to a required program amendment placed on the Kansas program at 30 CFR 916.16(c)(1).
