ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; 
10-K PROCEEDS GIVEN TO ANTI-DRUG PROJECT 
The Dana Point Chamber of Commerce has donated the proceeds of a recent 10-K 
run to the anti-drug abuse program at Dana Hills High School. 
The chamber has contributed about $4,000 to the program this year, including 
$1,442 from a Thanksgiving Day run. About 2,800 runners took part in the event, 
and the chamber donated 50 cents to the program for each participant. 
Dana Hills High School uses the money to pay for speakers who appear at drug 
awareness forums, Cowder said.
