FT  29 APR 93 / Reno hits back over Waco challenge
ANY lingering suspicion that Ms Janet Reno, the new attorney general, might
be a shrinking violet were thoroughly dispelled yesterday morning in her
spectacularly pugnacious defence of the government's actions ending the
siege of a religious faction's compound in Waco last week.
Cabinet members normally approach important congressional hearings with a
degree of deference. But that element was totally absent in several
exchanges between Ms Reno and members of the House judiciary committee,
above all with Mr John Conyers, veteran Michigan Democrat.
In a typically grandstanding address, he said he thought she should have
tendered her resignation because of the Waco debacle, in which over 80 cult
members died. He was also not satisfied with her explanations of the deaths
of the children in the compound. 'This is a profound disgrace to law
enforcement in the United States.'
Ms Reno glared at him from behind her glasses and stuck out her jaw. 'I feel
more strongly about it (the deaths of the children) than you will ever
know,' she spat out with visible anger. 'I will not walk away from a
compound where (federal) agents were killed. I will not engage in
recriminations. I will look to the future.'
Mr Conyers looked stunned. Ms Reno demanded that he ask more specific
questions of her. The congressman blustered. She offered to come to his
office for a private talk, a gesture quickly seized on by the committee
chairman as a way of dispelling the tension.
Nor, in other sharp exchanges, did she seek to shift any of the
reponsibility for the bloody Waco denouement on to President Bill Clinton,
the FBI, or any one other than David Koresh, the cult leader who died in the
conflagration.
'The decision how to proceed was mine,' she stated.' I advised the
president. . . of my decision to authorise the use of tear gas and he said
he would support my decision.' There was 'no realistic expectation the
matter would be resolved peacefully if we did nothing'.
