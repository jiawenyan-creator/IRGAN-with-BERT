BRIEFLY 
Warner in Licensing Deal: Warner Bros., its profit already soaring from fees 
for "Batman" merchandise, is teaming up with pro baseball in a licensing deal 
for Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester the Cat and other "Looney Tunes" 
characters. LCA Entertainment, Warners' licensing unit, announced that it has 
entered the cross-licensing deal pairing the characters with the 26 major 
league teams' trademarks. Looney Tunes baseball garb is expected to be in 
stores by the first of the year, with toys, statues and novelty gifts soon 
after that. Generally, the joint venture is to receive a royalty of between 9% 
and 12% on licensed merchandise, with the 26 teams dividing baseball's share 
equally. LCA has been flying high this summer with fees from "Batman" 
merchandise.
