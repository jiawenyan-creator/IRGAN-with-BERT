 

(1) Such yield shall be based on the county yield determined by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)
for the preceding 5 crop years; 

(2) The highest and lowest yield in such 5-year period shall be excluded; and 

(3) The remaining 3 crop year yields shall be averaged. 

(c) If a county yield is not available from NASS for the 5 preceding years for a crop of soybeans or minor oilseeds, State
committees shall calculate the yields using the following data: 

(1) State or area yields determined by NASS for the 5 preceding crop years, calculated as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)
through (3) of this section. 

(2) If neither State or area yields for the 5 preceding years are available from NASS, yields from FmHA for such years.


(3) If such yields are not available from FmHA, data for such yields from other government entities, such as Extension
Service (ES). 

(4) If no yield information is available from the sources listed in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section,
obtain yields from other available sources.

Historical weighted yields (HWY). 



If separate irrigated and nonirrigated farm crop program payment yields were established for the 1990 crop on a farm,
the program payment yield for such crop for the 1994 through 1997 crop years shall be a HWY that is determined by: 

(a) Multiplying the smaller of the effective irrigated acreage maximum (IAM) determined according to 1413.18
or the CAB times the 1990 irrigated farm program payment yield for the crop; 

(b) Subtracting the IAM from the current year CAB and multiplying the result, not less than zero, times the 1990 nonirrigated
farm program payment yield for such crop; and 

(c) Totaling the results of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this section and dividing by the current year effective CAB.
If the result is zero, the HWY yield is the 1990 nonirrigated program payment yield for the crop. 



1413.18 



Irrigated acreage maximum (IAM) for determining HWY's. 



(a) 

General. 

The farm IAM represents the maximum acreage for which deficiency payments using the irrigated payment yield will
be computed. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the IAM for the farm shall not be changed for the 1994 through
1997 crop years. 

(b) 

Calculation. 

The calculated farm IAM is the sum of the crop IAM's calculated as follows: 

(1) 

Base period. 

The calculated crop IAM shall be computed, at the producer's option, on the basis of either the sum of the 1988, 1989,
or 1990 irrigated planted and CU for payment acreages on the farm or the result of the 1991 CAB multiplied by the result
of dividing the 1988, 1989, or 1990 irrigated planted and CU for payment acreages by the sum of the irrigated and nonirrigated
planted and CU for payment acreages for the same year. 

(2) 

Base period for rotation farms. 

If 1 or more crops are produced on a farm in a 2-year rotation, the producer has the option of using the 1991 CAB and the
1990, 1989, and 1987 years or the 1992 projected CAB and the years 1990, 1988, and 1986 for the computations explained
above. If 1 or more crops are produced on a farm in a 3-year rotation, the producer has the option of using the 1991 CAB
and the 1990, 1988, and 1985 years or 1992 projected CAB and the years 1990, 1989, and 1986 years or 1993 projected CAB
and the years 1990, 1987, and 1984 years for the computations explained above. 

(3) 

Calculations for farms enrolled in the CRP. 

Appropriate adjustments in the IAM calculation shall be made to reflect the amount of irrigated cropland enrolled
in the CRP and the amount of reduction in CAB required by the CRP contract. 

(4) 

Calculations for FmHA inventory farms. 

If a farm was in FmHA inventory prior to 1991 and had irrigated program crops prior to 1988, the county committee may
approve adjustments to the farm IAM upon request from FmHA, operator, or owner. IAM calculations shall be based on
substituting the most recent years the farm was not in FmHA inventory for the years the farm was in inventory. 

(c) 

Allocation of IAM's to crops. 

If a farm has more than 1 irrigated crop, and the effective IAM for the crop exceeds the effective CAB for the crop, the
operator and owners have the option to reallocate the amount of the excess, provided that the receiving crop IAM does
not exceed the effective CAB. Form CCC507A, Agreement for Reallocation of Farm Irrigated Acreage Maximum,
must be signed by both the operator and owners of the farm before the reallocation can be completed. The deadline for
filing form CCC507A is the same as for form CCC477, Intention to Participate in the 1994 Price Support
and Production Adjustment Programs. The reallocation is final for the year and becomes the following year crop IAM.
