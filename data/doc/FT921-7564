FT  21 FEB 92 / Final tally cut for Bush
FINAL vote counts from Tuesday's New Hampshire primary have cut the tallies
of both President George Bush and his right-wing challenger, Mr Patrick
Buchanan.
After adding in candidates written in on the ballot papers, officials said
President Bush had won 53 per cent of the votes in the Republican party
primary, rather than the 58 per cent he was initially credited with.
Mr Buchanan won 37 per cent of the vote, rather than 40 per cent as
initially reported.
While the revised official count lowers Mr Buchanan's vote below the 40 per
cent barrier, it also narrows Mr Bush's margin of victory.
It does not appear to have substantially altered the view that the
television commentator had badly embarrassed the incumbent president.
For the Democratic primary, the adjustment was much smaller. Mr Paul
Tsongas, the former Massachusetts senator, saw his winning total cut to 33
per cent from 34 per cent, while Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, in
second place, dropped from 26 to 25 per cent.
