FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Woolworth to keep German
operations
WOOLWORTH, the US retailing group, does not plan to sell its general
merchandise or specialty store operations in Germany, AP-DJ reports from New
York.
The company had announced in November that it was exploring the possible
disposal of some or all of its German operations.
Woolworth operates more than 500 stores in Germany through its subsidiaries,
including 330 Woolworth general merchandise stores and 190 specialty stores.
The company said its German operations would continue to operate under its
present management.
The company also operates 144 Foot Locker athletic footwear and apparel
stores in eight countries in Europe. Woolworth said it still planned to be
operating at least 1,000 Foot Locker stores throughout Europe by the year
2000.
Woolworth has also named Mr William Lavin as chairman and chief executive to
replace Mr Harold Sells when he retires, at the age of 65, in July.
Mr Lavin, who is 48, has served as chief financial officer of the US
retailer since 1991. He joined Woolworth in 1981.
An announcement about Mr Sells' successor has been widely expected since
September, when a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed that Mr
Sells had sold Dollars 3.4m of stock in the company.
