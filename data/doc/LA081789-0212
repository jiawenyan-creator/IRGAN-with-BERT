3 NO-HITTERS AREN'T ENOUGH TO GET PITCHER TOM DREES TO BIG LEAGUES 
Vancouver pitcher Tom Drees has to wonder how to get to the major leagues. 
Apparently, pitching three no-hitters in one season doesn't work. 
Drees, 26, accomplished the feat as the Canadians downed the Las Vegas Stars 
5-0 Wednesday night in the first game of a double-header. In the minor leagues, 
double-header games are seven innings each. 
The performance, witnessed by Larry Himes, vice president and general manager 
of the parent Chicago White Sox, tied a mark set in 1952, when Bill Bell threw 
three no-hit games in the Class D Appalachian rookie league. 
Drees' first two no-hitters came in back-to-back starts. He blanked the Calgary 
Cannons 1-0 in a nine-inning game May 23, then beat the Edmonton Trappers 7-0 
in a seven-inning game May 28. 
However, the White Sox have no plans to promote Drees. In fact, the team has 
already told the pitcher to report to the Florida Instructional League after 
the PCL season, beginning in mid-September. 
Vancouver pitching coach Moe Drabowsky said Drees, 11-10, needs to develop more 
consistency and to strengthen his pitching shoulder, which was operated on last 
December.
