FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Philips, IBM discuss chip deal
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and IBM, the US computer group, are
negotiating the establishment of a semi-conductor joint venture at IBM's
existing German factory in Boblingen Hulb, near Stuttgart.
The proposed venture will make memory chips for IBM and logic chips for
Philips. The move, which hinges on successful completion of the negotiations
as well as on government approval, would help solve some capacity problems
at Philips, which earlier this year announced an expansion of its main Dutch
semi-conductor plant in Nijmegen. IBM's plant currently employs 800 people
to manufacture 4 megabit dynamic random access memory (D-RAM) chips. The
venture would rely on assets and employees from the existing Boblingen Hulb
site.
