FT  31 DEC 94 / International Company News: Euromercato supermarkets sale
hits legal problems
Last-minute legal problems are holding up the conclusion of the L950bn
(Dollars 584m) sale of Euromercato, part of Fininvest's supermarkets and
chain stores division.
The division has a total turnover of L5,200bn. The Euromercato supermarkets
disposal will cut turnover by about L1,200bn.
A deal was due to be signed yesterday selling Euromercato to a consortium of
the Benetton clothing group and Luxottica, the spectacles group owned by Mr
Leonardo Del Vecchio. However, a spokesman for Standa, the Fininvest stores
group that is hand-ling the sale, said lawyers would need 'a few more days'
to complete it.
The sale marks a major divestiture for Fininvest, Italy's largest private
business group owned by out-going premier Silvio Berlusconi.
The sale is necessary to reduce overall debts from L3,920bn to L2,800bn by
the end of this year.
It also signals an important expansion of Benetton-Luxottica's recent
diversification into retailing.
