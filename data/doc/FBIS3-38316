<F P=106> [Report by Sinan Kurun: "President al-Asad Has Made No </F>
Promise on PKK"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Prime Minister Tansu Ciller held a telephone 
conversation with President Clinton yesterday. President 
Clinton informed her that President al-Asad neither promised 
anything nor opened any door on the issue of the Workers Party 
of Kurdistan [PKK] and Hizballah during their talks in Geneva. 
  Considering President al-Asad's indifference to PKK 
terrorist 
activities, Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have said: "It 
seems President al-Asad wishes to continue to use the PKK as a 
trump card against Turkey." 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin is reportedly expected to hold 
bilateral talks with his Syrian counterpart when the foreign 
ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Syria hold a summit on northern 
Iraq in Istanbul early in February. Recalling that the summit 
should have been held in November 1993 but was repeatedly 
postponed because of Syria's objections, Foreign Ministry 
officials have revealed that Damascus has informed Ankara that 
the Syrian foreign minister may visit Istanbul from 4 to 6 
February. But they have also said that "Iran has not yet 
responded."
