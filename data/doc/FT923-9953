FT  01 AUG 92 / Poll tax arrears may last to 2000
ONE IN 12 local authorities expects to be collecting poll tax arrears into
the year 2000, even though the tax will be replaced by the property-based
council tax next April.
Two out of five councils believe that the poll tax backlog will affect
implementation of the council tax either extensively or moderately.
The findings come in a previously unpublished study commissioned by the
government from CSL, the management consultants, and leaked to Mr Jack
Straw, shadow local-government minister.
The Department of the Environment agreed yesterday with Mr Straw's
assessment that more than Pounds 1bn was uncollected from the first two
years of the poll tax.
'The poll tax fiasco lives on and is likely significantly to upset the
implementation of the council tax,' Mr Straw said yesterday.
'The country has already paid too dearly for the mess of the poll tax: it
looks as though the council tax will replace one fiasco with another.'
As councils prepare for introduction of the council tax, some Environment
Department officials believe that the average bill for a household in a band
D home (worth Pounds 68,000-Pounds 88,000 in April this year) might well be
more than Pounds 500.
