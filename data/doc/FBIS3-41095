  [Text] Demetrio Chavez Pena Herrera, 40, alias El Vaticano 
or Loco Limoniel, the country's most wanted drug trafficker was 
briefly presented today to the media at the Dincote [National 
Counterterrorism Directorate] headquarters in Lima. Chavez, who 
during the presentation was wearing a striped prison suit 
bearing the number 1891 on the back, has been charged with 
narco-terrorism and treason. 
  [Begin unidentified Dincote spokesman recording] According 
to 
preliminary investigations carried out by DINAN [National Police 
Intelligence Narcotics Department] in accordance with police 
report no. 45 of 23 January, evidence was found linking Demetrio 
Chavez Pena Herrera to narco-terrorism activities. [end

  As has already been established, initial DINAN 
investigations 
have uncovered links between El Vaticano and subversive groups 
operating in the Alto Huallaga region. This connection has been 
verified by several former terrorists who decided to surrender 
to the authorities. 
  The charges were acknowledged by El Vaticano to a military 
prosecutor as well as his defense attorney Juan Lazarte Luna.

...alias El Vaticano or Loco Limoniel, used them as links to 
ensure their support and cooperation which has been corroborated 
in affidavits by several former terrorists who decided to 
surrender. In turn, the charges have been acknowledged by the 
accused in the presence of his defense attorney as well as the 
corresponding prosecutor. [end recording] 
  The drug trafficker would resort to the services of a few 
terrorists known as Artemio, Clae, Manzini, James, and Liborio 
to transfer protection money [cupos] to the PCP [Peruvian 
Communist Party], Shining Path, as well as MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Party] military and political leaders. 
  Intelligence service investigations have established that El 
Vaticano repaired back roads in the Provinces of San Martin and 
Mariscal Caceres and used them as clandestine helicopter landing 
sites to transport drugs.

...could rely on the protection and support of terrorist 
criminals whom he would pay $5,000 for each flight. In addition 
to that, he would also pay $2 for each kilo of basic cocaine 
paste, and $6 for each kilo of clean basic cocaine paste. [end

  Once Dincote investigations have concluded, El Vaticano will 
be turned over to the Special Army War Council [Consejo de 
Guerra Especial del Ejercito]. On the other hand, the Dirandro 
[General Narcotics Directorate] will continue with its 
independent investigations into drug trafficking and money 
laundering.
