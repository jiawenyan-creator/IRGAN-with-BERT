FT  28 FEB 92 / The airline deal that did not fly: FT writers examine the
collapse of the merger talks between British Airways and KLM
It was late on Wednesday night. Executives from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
British Airways had been meeting separately for hours on either side of the
English Channel in a last-ditch attempt to save the planned merger between
the two airlines.
The negotiators had spent months on an elusive project called 'Sahara'. It
was an attempt to create a formidable airline group with an extensive
international route network into north America and the Far East, served by
one of the world's most modern fleets and fed by two of Europe's biggest
airports, the expanding Schiphol near Amsterdam and London's Heathrow.
The planned merger would have created a European company capable of matching
the scale of US airlines such as Delta, American Airlines and United, which
are increasingly aggressive rivals on transatlantic routes.
For BA there was an added attraction. KLM's minority stake in Northwest
Airlines offered possible access to the US market which it had been denied
by the failure of merger talks with United in 1990.
So why on Wednesday night did the two teams of weary negotiators conclude
that they could go no further? And where does it leave the two airlines?
The talks got off to a good start last September. The two airlines had
already worked closely in an attempt to create a European airline built
around Sabena, the Belgian carrier.
Advisers to both companies said the atmosphere had been good. The main
protagonists, Mr Piet Bouw, KLM's president, and Sir Colin Marshall, BA's
chief executive, struck up a good relationship. A KLM executive said
yesterday: 'Both sides wanted to come to an agreement but it just was not to
be.'
The co-operative atmosphere helped the two companies to devise ways of
overcoming some of the practical obstacles they faced. In January, Mr Bouw
disclosed that KLM was prepared to give up its name for the sake of the
merger. The negotiators believed they had found a solution to one of the
trickiest problems they faced: how the merged airline could retain the
landing rights which airline regulators around the world had granted to the
national airlines separately.
Financial advisers involved in the talks said there had also been common
ground on the main operational issues of how the merged airline should be
run, including the way its marketing and sales forces should be managed,
ticketing systems, aircraft maintenance and joint procurement. These matters
were not mere details. By pulling together the two airlines' operations the
merger held out the prospect of generating huge combined savings - of about
Pounds 100m a year in the first year, rising to perhaps Pounds 500m after
several years.
BA and KLM were buoyed by the track record of earlier Anglo-Dutch mergers,
notably Shell in oil and Unilever in consumer goods. The key to the success
of both these deals was their shareholding structure. Although both Shell
and Unilever are merged groups, they retain separate British and Dutch
national companies. At Shell, the national parent companies are paid
dividends from a joint holding company which manages the company's assets.
Unilever operates a complex profit equalisation agreement which determines
how profits should be shared.
BA and KLM set out to create a profit-sharing structure modelled on
Unilever. The two national companies were to be paid shares of the profits
earned by the merged group. It was in these discussions that the negotiators
hit the insurmountable obstacle which brought the talks to an end.
Various measures were discussed to determine how the profits of the combined
group should be shared. BA's market capitalisation is about Pounds 1.6bn,
three times that of KLM, suggesting a 75 per cent/25 per cent split in
favour of BA. If a profits share-out were based on the capital reserves in
the companies' balance sheets, it would split in BA's favour by 65 per cent
to 35 per cent. Estimates of the two companies' cashflow, their net earnings
combined with the amount they spend upon depreciation, would also suggest a
65/35 split.
However, from the outset KLM made it clear it wanted at least 40 per cent of
the profits from the merged group. It wanted the valuation to take account
of the long-term value of its stake in Northwest in the US even though the
airline's recent losses have helped to depress KLM's share price.
The Dutch airline also wanted the deal to take account of two of its assets
not included in its market capitalisation - its strong position at Schiphol,
and its recent investment in fleet modernisation. In 1989 KLM ordered 36
aircraft worth Fl 5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) which were for delivery up to the
mid-1990s. It calculates that because it has spent so much creating the most
up-to-date fleet in the world after Singapore Airlines, the merged airline
would have to spend less on fleet modernisation.
This valuation was rebutted from BA. An adviser commented: 'BA was vitally
interested in its share price, earnings dilution and its dividend policy.
KLM was not as interested in those issues. The two companies' operating
cultures are very compatible but they live in completely different financial
cultures.'
BA stuck out for a deal to give it at least 70 per cent of the merged group.
The reasons for its insistence are clear from calculations by Mr Mark
Simpson, an airline analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker. He
forecasts BA will make net profits of Pounds 289m in 1993 and KLM will earn
about Pounds 100m. Assuming the merger would have generated after-tax
savings of Pounds 80m in its first year, the merged group would have had net
profits of Pounds 469m.
If these profits had been shared out on a 70/30 split in BA's favour, its
earnings would have been enhanced by about 14 per cent, while KLM's would
have risen 41 per cent. If the split had been 65/35, BA would have still got
a marginal profits enhancement of about 6 per cent, with KLM enjoying a 64
per cent leap in profits.
A 65/35 deal might just have been presentable in the City. But a 60/40 split
would have left BA suffering an unacceptable dilution of its earnings.
Despite warnings that a 60/40 deal would not get off the ground with
investors in London and New York, the Dutch persisted. A BA adviser said:
'The Dutch were terribly stubborn. At the start everyone assumed they were
not serious when they said they wanted 40 per cent. But they just would not
budge.'
Dutch politicians' fear of job losses and the loss of identity for the
national flag carrier may have been behind this stance. The Dutch
government, which owns 38 per cent of KLM, insisted the company had acted on
its own. Nevertheless, six of the 11 members of KLM's supervisory board are
government appointees. As the main shareholder in Schiphol airport, the
Dutch government has no desire to see its taxpayers' money used to promote
the profits of a privatised British airline.
What lies in store for the airlines? British Airways is responding
aggressively to the downturn in its market. Its costs are falling fast, with
its workforce cut by 11 per cent this year, wage inflation down to about 4
per cent and fuel costs moderating. In the third quarter it made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 100m compared with just Pounds 20m the year before. When
passenger volumes rise, it should reap significant productivity gains.
BA will continue talking to potential partners in Europe, the Far East and
America. But its financial strength means it is in no rush to do a deal.
As for KLM, it is narrowing its losses and cutting costs. It may start talks
with other European airlines such as SAS, the Scandinavian group. Although
it is regarded in the industry as a high-quality airline, few believe KLM
has a long-term future as an independent force, as the market in Europe is
opened to more competition. A deal with either Air France or Lufthansa seems
unlikely, while a merger with SAS would not provide the size and scale
needed. Mr Philip van den Berg, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in London,
commented: 'KLM is not big enough to survive on its own, it may yet have to
return to BA for support.'
