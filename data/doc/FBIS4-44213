<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Maroni: "Veltroni Moves Up, Overtakes </F>
D'Alema, and Wins"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- Sixty-four for [L'UNITA editor] 
Veltroni, and 42 for [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, 
outgoing Deputy Secretary] D'Alema. Unexpectedly, in an opinion 
poll which largely belies the most accredited forecasts made on 
the eve, the majority of the PDS federations have indicated the 
L'UNITA editor as their favorite candidate to succeed [outgoing 
PDS Secretary] Occhetto, thus confronting today's executive 
board and tomorrow's National Council with the almost certainty 
of a duel to the last vote, as well as with the difficulty of 
reading the political implications of a result which in itself 
-- regardless of the numbers in the PDS miniparliament -- does 
not yet deprive the Gallipoli deputy [D'Alema] of all his 
chances. However -- at least initially -- this result 
undoubtedly prevents both him and Veltroni from withdrawing 
without putting up a fight or from reaching a gentlemen's 
agreement -- a solution which the opinion poll figures and 
significance now rule out altogether. Thus, looming ahead on 
the PDS horizon, is now also the possibility that neither of the 
two candidates will obtain the necessary quorum and, therefore, 
the PDS may face the uncertainty of having to refer the election 
of the new secretary to the party congress. [passage omitted] 
  However, there are indications weighing -- heavily -- 
against 
the L'UNITA editor. True, he is backed by a majority of 
Emilia's federations, but Bologna, Modena, and Ravenna -- which 
together comprise 25,000 members more than all the other 
federations put together -- are siding with D'Alema. 
Furthermore, the former lower house floor leader is still 
backed by the most important Lombard federations, from Milan to 
Mantua and Brescia, and the same applies to Rome, the whole of 
Puglia, and the south, where the PDS has fewer members, but 
where it won in the elections. Finally, D'Alema is backed by 
most of the leaders interviewed at Botteghe Oscure [PDS 
headquarters], including deputies, senators, federation 
scretaries, and CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] 
leaders. [passage omitted] 
  In short, a battle will be waged -- an open battle fought 
out 
in a climate which, despite the efforts made by both opponents, 
is beginning to be poisonous. Weighing down on the rivals is 
also the uncertainty over the next moves planned by Occhetto, 
who is regarded as the hidden but clearly identifiable 
protagonist of the last two weeks of strife within the PDS. 
Support for Veltroni derives much of its thrust from the wish 
to sweep aside the leading group that was defeated in the 
elections, and to press for a radical renewal of the PDS style, 
men, and political language. [passage omitted]
