FT  23 MAR 93 / Letter: Encouraged - but then penalised
Sir, You report that NatWest is to impose swingeing penalties on those
customers who habitually become overdrawn ('NatWest to charge daily for
overdrawn accounts', March 20). This is the same institution which, when
many of those same customers were students, inculcated the habit by
encouraging unlimited overdrafts without warning or penalty, much to the
disgust of parents who had tried to develop responsible attitude to money.
Such a cynical and irresponsible policy deserves to lose it the custom it so
unworthily obtained by such methods.
