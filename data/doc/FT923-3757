FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British-Borneo surges to Pounds 2.07m
Against a background of 'difficult trading conditions' British-Borneo
Petroleum Syndicate, the oil and gas exploration company, reported profits
after tax of Pounds 2.07m from total revenue of Pounds 6.61m in the six
months to end-June.
The outcome compares with profits of Pounds 1.43m on revenues of Pounds
3.07m last time.
Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said oil and gas operating income had
more than trebled, reflecting the Norsk Hydro acquisition and continued
success in the Gulf of Mexico, while the emerging US business had moved into
profit.
Earnings per share fell to 4.6p (7.96p) as a result of a jump of shares in
issue from 18m to 45m following the placing and open offer in October last
year. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.667p.
The company recently announced it had paid Pounds 21.4m for a 10 per cent
interest in the Victor gas field. With estimated reserves of some 450bn cu
ft, the acquisition reduced the effective cost of exploration in the North
Sea to 17p in the pound.
