FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Victoire sees sharp fall for
year
VICTOIRE, the French insurance company which is the subject of a quarrel
between the Suez holding company and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP)
insurance group, yesterday warned of a sharp fall in full-year profits due
to the problems of Baltica, the Danish insurer.
The future of Victoire, which yesterday also reported a 41 per cent fall in
net profits to FFr275m (Dollars 48.5m) in the first half of this year from
FFr470m in the same period of 1992, was flung into doubt when Suez, its
majority shareholder, last week announced it had resumed negotiations with
UAP over its minority holding.
UAP, the largest French insurer, has for some time been anxious to exchange
its Victoire shares for control of Colonia, the latter's German subsidiary.
The resumption of talks between Suez and UAP has come at a sensitive time
for Victoire, which has for the second successive year been badly affected
by the difficulties of the loss-making Baltica, in which it holds a 23 per
cent stake.
