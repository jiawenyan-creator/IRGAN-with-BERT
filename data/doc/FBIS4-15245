  [Text] One of the leaders of Russia's Choice, Boris 
Zolotukhin, said in an interview with Interfax that he has a 
high opinion of the draft agreement reached on Wednesday by the 
leaders of Russia's Choice and the unregistered deputy group 
December 12 Union about possible cooperation. December 12 Union 
is led by Former Vice- Premier and Finance Minister of the 
Russian Federation Boris Fedorov. 
  "We used to vote in the same way in the State Duma without 
previous discussion, but it would be very useful to work out a 
certain mechanism for coordination of positions on the most 
important issues," Zolotukhin pointed out. He believes that 
regular meetings of these deputy groups could become such a 
mechanism for coordination of actions prior to taking important 
decisions in the Duma. 
  Asked by IF's correspondent, Zolotukhin said that similar 
talks with leaders of the Yavlinskiy faction were in their 
preliminary stages. Interfax learned that Russia's Choice will 
be represented by Boris Zolotukhin, the Yavlinskiy bloc Viktor 
Sheynis and December 12 Union by Boris Zamay. A final decision 
on the issue will be taken by Russia's Choice at its meeting on 
April 7.
