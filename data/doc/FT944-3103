FT  15 DEC 94 / Bahrain police arrest protesters
Bahrain police used teargas to disperse small groups of demonstrators two
nights running this week and arrested some of them. Witnesses said yesterday
that tear gas was used on Monday and Tuesday nights against demonstrators in
central Manama and at Qadim, a village about 5km to the west of the capital.
The cause of the demonstrations was not known. Residents said judging by the
authorities' actions at previous such incidents in the small Gulf island
state, most of those arrested would be released soon after questioning. The
residents variously estimated the numbers involved at between 50 and 100 in
each location.
