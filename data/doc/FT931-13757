FT  21 JAN 93 / Ilva sells 75 per cent holding in Italian tube group
ILVA, the Italian state-owned steel goup, yesterday announced a further
rationalisation of its operations with the sale of its residual 75 per cent
stake in Tubi Ghisa, a specialist in ductile cast-iron fittings, to France's
Pont-a-Mousson.
The French group, which previously held a 25 per cent of Tubi Ghisa, has
paid cash - the equivalent of L127.5bn (dollars 86.2m). On Ilva's books, the
stake was written in at L20bn.
Apart from ductile cast-iron fittings for pressure pipes, Tubi Ghisa
produces from its Genoa-based plant second-casting foundry work for tubes.
It has 20 per cent of the water-piping market in Italy and this is seen as
an ideal fit for Pont-a-Mousson, a European leader in water supplies. Last
year, Tubi Ghisa returned a L6.3bn profit on sales volume of 106 tonnes and
income of L147bn.
On Monday, Ilva announced its subsidiary Dalmine Tubi Speciali, producing
seamless stainless steel tubes, hoped to cut costs and production via a
three-way venture with subsidiaries of Germany's Mannesmann and Usinor
Sacilor of France. Yesterday, Mr Piero Nardi, Ilva managing director, said
the group planned to raise a further L400bn this year in sell-offs. A
meeting of the Ilva board is due to assess its financial position on Friday,
reported to be heading for a loss in 1992 of around L1,300bn.
