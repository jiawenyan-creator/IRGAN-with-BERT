  [Text] The Interior Ministry hereby announces to citizens 
throughout the governorates of the Republic of Yemen that they 
must abide by instructions to carry all documentation proving 
ownership of the cars they drive. The ministry stresses that no 
vehicle may be driven unless it meets pertinent legal 
requirements. The ministry agencies will carry out continuous 
inspection campaigns to seize violators. Warning against the 
gravity of ignoring these instructions, the ministry stresses 
that violators will be subject to stringent penalties. It hopes 
that all brother citizens will cooperate with and respond to 
these instructions.
