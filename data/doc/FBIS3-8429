  [Text] Today Burgas Port started to step up its 
operations, after it had offered its services for handling goods 
shipped from and to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]. The first shipment of export goods from 
Macedonia has arrived. 
  A Russian cargo ship is expected to arrive with 14,000 
metric 
tons of rice, which has to be transported to Macedonia by road. 
The trend is for mainly food products to be shipped to 
Macedonia, in return for exports of chemical industry products 
and raw materials. 
  According to a preliminary arrangement, a Macedonian 
delegation is expected to visit Burgas Port at the beginning of 
next week, with a view to signing a final agreement on handling 
goods shipped to and from Macedonia.
