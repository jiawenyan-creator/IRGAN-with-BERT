FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister minimises Jubilee Line
snag
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday played down reports that negotiations to secure
financing for the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line Underground extension were on
the point of collapse, David Owen writes.
It said it was 'hopeful' the talks would soon be successfully concluded.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister, said there had been 'no change
whatever' in the government's position.
Ministers remained committed to putting money into the project once a Pounds
400m private-sector contribution had been approved.
'We are making progress,' he said. 'That progress will continue. When the
process is complete . . . we will begin the line.'
Negotiations between bank lenders to Canary Wharf and the government on the
private-sector contribution to the line have been going on for about a year,
following the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian company which built
the east London property development.
Mr Norris admitted yesterday that the complexity of reaching an agreement
with O&amp;Y's creditors had been underestimated.
Mr Tony Banks, a Labour frontbench transport spokesman, urged ministers to
make clear they were not being pressed by the Treasury to scrap the
extension.
