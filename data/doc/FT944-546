FT  28 DEC 94 / Iberia strike called off
Pilots of Spain's crisis-hit state airline Iberia have called off a
threatened 12-day strike after last ditch talks with the company. A joint
statement from the pilots' union Sepla and Iberia said last night that they
had reached agreement on salary cuts that allowed the pilots to call off the
strike, which was due to start at midnight. No details of what salary cuts
had been agreed were given.
The pilots called the strike to protest against a tough wage and job cuts
plan designed to save the loss-making airline from bankruptcy.
