<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Transportation is making a series 
of minor or technical amendments to its drug and alcohol 
testing procedures. The most significant of these include 
revising the initial test cutoff level for marijuana 
metabolites, changing split specimen collection procedures to 
be consistent with those of the Department of Health and 
Human Services, revising the temperature range for urine drug 
specimens, revising the drug testing custody and control form 
and modifying the alcohol testing form, clarifying laboratory 
reporting procedures to consortiums, deleting a requirement 
for a second ``air blank'' after alcohol confirmation tests, 
specifying procedures related to the display of the 
sequential number for alcohol tests, and clarifying chain of 
custody requirements. The changes have the purposes of 
updating the procedures to be consistent with Department of 
Health and Human Services guidelines and addressing 
implementation problems of which the Department has become 
aware.
