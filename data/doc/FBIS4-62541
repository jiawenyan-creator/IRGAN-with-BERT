Slezevicius met leaders of health organizations on Thursday [12 
May] and talked about threatening economic situation of 
Lithuanian health care. 
  Health Minister Jurgis Bredikis told a news conference on 
Friday that hospitals were overburdened by huge debts. Six 
million Litas are unpaid by them only for municipal services. 
  There is a great lack of medicines, equipment, dressing, 
clothes and other necessary things in hospitals. Bredikis said 
9 million Litas were still not transferred from the budget for 
the needs of the health system. 
  Bredikis also said that, because of difficult economic 
situation and before creating the medical insurance system, an 
amount of paid medical services would be increased.
