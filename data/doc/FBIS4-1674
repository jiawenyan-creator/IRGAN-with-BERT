  [Text] Fuzhou, April 3 (XINHUA) -- The electricity-short 
Chinese province of Fujian will utilize overseas capital to 
build more power stations in the years ahead. 
  In the past, only state or collectively-owned organizations 
were allowed to construct and run power plants. 
  This policy hampered the development of Fujian's power 
resources, which include many rivers with steep drops suitable 
for hydro-electric power stations. 
  While thermal power plants have very limited output due to 
the province's lack of coal, less than 22 percent of the 
hydraulic resources were utilized. As a result, this southeast 
China's coastal province is left with a shortage of several 
hundred millions of kwh of electricity per year. 
  Since the mid-1980s, however, Fujian has used 800 million 
U.S. dollars from overseas investors to build several power 
plants. 
  The provincial authorities recently announced new policies 
to 
encourage foreign investment in construction and management of 
local power stations. Several projects have been set for 
tenders, according to relevant departments.
