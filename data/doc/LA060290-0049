SCHOOL GROUPS WIN SALES TAX EXEMPTION 
In a victory for schoolchildren and a defeat for the tax man, Gov. George 
Deukmejian signed into a law Friday a bill that would exempt school-sponsored 
youth groups from having to collect sales tax on items they sell. The measure, 
sponsored by Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley), nullifies a decision by 
the State Board of Equalization that required most school groups to collect 
sales tax on many items they sell to earn money for after-school activities. 
The board made the decision as part of a 3-2 ruling against the Monterey High 
School wrestling team, which had been served with a $1,000 bill for sales taxes 
officials said it should have collected when it sold fried calamari at a county 
fair.
