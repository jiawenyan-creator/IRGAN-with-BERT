NEWSWIRE: RED SOX MANAGER SUSPENDED 
Manager Joe Morgan of the Boston Red Sox was suspended Tuesday for three games 
by American League President Bobby Brown for supporting a brush-back pitch that 
led to a bench-clearing brawl last weekend in Cleveland. 
The suspension is to begin tonight with Boston's game against the New York 
Yankees at Fenway Park. 
Morgan said that he will not appeal. 
"Appeal? Appeal for what? You lose appeals," Morgan said after Boston beat the 
Yankees, 9-8, Tuesday night. "I talked to Mr. Brown. I told him I did not like 
his decision and I have no further comment." 
Problems began last Saturday when Indian reliever Doug Jones threw a pitch near 
the head of Tony Pena, who had helped Boston beat Cleveland the previous night. 
On Sunday, Roger Clemens hit the Indians' lead-off batter, Stanley Jefferson, 
triggering a fight. 
"I loved it. We got even, didn't we?" Morgan said after Boston's victory 
Sunday. "We voted as a team, 34-0, that it would be such." 
Brown was unhappy with Morgan's attitude. 
"The fact that pitchers throw close to hitters and sometimes deliberately hit 
them is a known fact," his statement said. "Nevertheless, it behooves the 
American League office to eliminate premeditated and announced violence."
