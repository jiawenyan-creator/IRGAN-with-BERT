FT  24 JUL 92 / US close to edge of depression, Perot warns
MR ROSS PEROT is warning that the US 'is on the edge of a severe recession
or depression', avoidable only by adoption of tough measures as soon as
possible.
In his first newspaper interview, with the Los Angeles Times, since dropping
his undeclared presidential candidacy a week ago, the Texas billionaire
promised to keep speaking out, trying to make those seeking public office
face up to economic realities.
His own economic revitalisation proposals would be published, perhaps next
week. These are known to include a five-year plan to balance the budget by
combining sharp rises in consumption taxes and steep cuts in federal
subsidies and entitlements, including social security.
Mr Perot painted a dire picture of prospects for the US, unless decisive
action were taken. 'If we have an economic catastrophe, tens of millions of
ordinary people will be devastated. It will probably take us 20 years to
recover.'
He foresaw the complete collapse of the financial establishment, with banks
and mortgage finance companies all going under.
'Then, if huge numbers of people are out of work, huge numbers will lose
their homes and all the federally guaranteed home mortgages will kick in and
that will have to be paid for, when people don't have work and the tax base
is deteriorating.'
