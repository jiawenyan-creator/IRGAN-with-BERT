MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT TOWER'S DESIGN 
In "Interstate Tower: Art of the Deal" (July 1), Leon Whiteson complains that 
the design of the Interstate tower was dictated by non-architectural deals and 
trade-offs. The thrust of the article is that this particular building suffers 
from an unusual set of economic and other compromises. 
Great architecture is not created by perfect conditions and an unlimited 
budget. First, such conditions do not exist. Secondly, if they did, mediocre 
design would result from those circumstances if mediocre designers were 
employed. 
Some of the greatest architecture has been generated by the toughest conditions 
when a great client and talented architect came together. Los Angeles is loaded 
with examples of easy deals and bad buildings. 
Yes, corporate architecture sometimes can be superior, but there are only a few 
examples of corporate headquarter buildings in all of Southern California and 
maybe three or four in downtown Los Angeles. The rest are spec office buildings 
designed before an anchor tenant was signed (and the building named for them). 
Good buildings rent for higher rates. Bad buildings attract marginal tenants 
who often cannot pay their rent. The shapers of our cities will eventually 
learn this economic truth and demand quality design no matter how many "deals" 
it takes to put the building together. 
Maquire Thomas has consistently produced the best-looking and functioning 
buildings in Los Angeles but blaming bad design on "the deal" misdirects our 
attention and lets the developer and architect off the hook.
