FT  05 APR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on dollar
ALL EYES will be on the US dollar this week, after Friday's non-farm payroll
figure for March was worse than dealers had expected, writes James Blitz.
The payroll figure is the most important indicator affecting the dollar in
the money markets, and tends to cast its shadow over dealing for some days
afterwards.
Many dealers had been expecting a monthly rise in the payroll of only 80,000
by last Friday morning.
But, far from rising, the number of people in work actually contracted on
the month by 22,000, taking the dollar as low as DM1.5870 on Friday
afternoon.
The later rebounded above DM1.60 in the European afternoon, but dealers
hoping that the dollar will stay above that level have little to hope for
from this week's US indicators.
The consumer prices figure for March, which is due on Good Friday, may
indicate whether there is an upturn in inflation inside the US economy.
Increased US inflation would raise expectations that the Federal Reserve
might raise its official short term interest rates, a move that would be
positive for the dollar.
However, Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London,
believes that last week's US indicators suggest that any rise in inflation
will be on the modest side.
There are expectations, however, that the Bundesbank will shave the rate at
which it offers wholesale funds to commercial banks in its weekly operation
on Wednesday.
There was disappointment that the Bundesbank did not ease official rates
last week. However, the discount rate is now some 67 basis points below the
Bundesbank's repo rate, leaving scope for money market rate cuts.
