  [Text] Algiers, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Algerian police have 
arrested two Islamic militants in connection with the kidnap and 
murder of Mohammed Bouslimani, the president of the charity 
Al-Islah wa al-Irshad. 
  Bouslimani's body was found a week ago in El Affroun near 
Blida two months after his abduction at the end of November. 
  A police statement said agronomist Guitoun Nasser and imam 
Rashid Zerani, 26, an inspector in Algeria's fraud squad, had 
kidnapped the charity leader on the orders of Djaafar al-Afghani 
leader of the Islamic Armed Group (GIA). 
  It said Al-Afghani had ordered the killing after a series of 
discussions with Bouslimani.
