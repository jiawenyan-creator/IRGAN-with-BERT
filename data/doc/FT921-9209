FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Gencor criticised over terms of
issue
GENCOR, the South African mining and industrial group, is facing complaints
that its R2bn (Dollars 740.7m) rights issue is unfair to UK shareholders.
The terms which have been offered to UK shareholders, who account for about
3 per cent of Gencor's issued capital, are very unusual because they are at
a fixed sterling price of 172p a share.
All other shareholders must pay in rand.
Analysts can remember only one other similar offer, by Goldfields of South
Africa two years ago.
Complaints have been made because, since Gencor fixed the terms, the
financial rand has fallen from 5.84 to the pound to 6.3 and virtually wiped
out the value of the 'nil paid' rights to UK shareholders.
In contrast, South African registered, non-resident shareholders, have
rights which are worth about 23p a share.
Gencor's broker, Smith New Court, said a previous Gencor R1.5bn rights issue
in July 1989, met a very bad response from UK shareholders who lost money by
allowing their rights to lapse.
Irate shareholders subsequently told Gencor it had been difficult to obtain
financial rands from UK clearing banks.
'Gencor had many requests to do subsequent rights issues in sterling. We
knew it was risky but we tried to help. This has been done with the best
intentions.
'Currencies can move back and the closing date is not until February 28,'
said a Smith New Court official.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Durlacher West, commented: 'Gencor has
successfully been building a good image with the London financial community
over the past two years. This could put a dent in that process.'
He pointed out that another South African company, Tiger Oats, in a current
rights issue which also has Smith New Court as broker, hopes to solve the
problem in a different way - by pointing small UK shareholders in the
direction of Nedbank for their financial rands.
