addition, there are other responsibilities which must be carried out on behalf of HUD. HUD needs assistance in carrying
out these functions incident to each mortgage sale. To obtain such assistance, HUD provides individuals, corporations
and other entities throughout the country with limited powers of attorney so that they may execute and record each
assignment on behalf of HUD, and engage in other responsibilities as specified.
