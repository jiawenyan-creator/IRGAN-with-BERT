ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared two environmental assessments
and findings of no significant impact for the shipment of unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing.
Risk analyses, which form the bases for the environmental assessments, have led us to conclude that shipment of the
unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of
the human environment. Based on our findings of no significant impact, we have determined that environmental impact
statements need not be prepared.

<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Copies of the environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact may be obtained by writing to the person

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151 

et seq.

) must be shown to be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued.
A field test is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In
order to ship an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization
from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 


In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological products
referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted risk analyses to assess the products' potential effects on the safety
of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on those risk analyses, APHIS has prepared environmental assessments.
APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological products for field testing will not significantly
affect the quality of the human environment. Based on these findings of no significant impact, we have determined
that there is no need to prepare environmental impact statements.
