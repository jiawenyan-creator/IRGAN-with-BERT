No Turner for President: Cable television magnate Ted Turner appreciates his 
freedom too much to go into politics. "I think I can make a greater 
contribution in global communications than I could with a political career in 
one country," Turner said. 
"I want to be free. Politics, particularly in this country . . . is just one 
big series of compromises." Turner spoke Tuesday to businessmen in Marietta, 
Ohio, and said he fears the federal budget problems could trigger the worst 
depression in the nation' history. "I would sure hope that the leadership of 
this country would stand up and say, 'We are mad as hell. We're just not going 
to take it anymore. We are just not going to let our futures go down the 
drain,' " he said. CLAUDIA PUIG
