  [Text] Cuba's ambassador to the Philippines, Jose Luis 
Martin Portal, had been found dead at his Manila home, 
apparently from cardiac arrest. He was 49. 
  The Philippines' Foreign Office said Portal's body was found 
on Sunday evening [19 June] by his household staff, who called 
the police. Portal's wife and children were in Havana, and the 
envoy was living alone in the exclusive North Forbes Park 
district in Metro Manila. Police said they found no sign of 
foul play. 
  Portal assumed his Manila post in October 1990.
