COLEMAN, PENDLETON HIT HOMERS AS CARDS POUND HOUSTON, 10-6 
Vince Coleman and Terry Pendleton each homered, pacing a 10-hit St. Louis 
attack and Bryn Smith won his fifth game as the Cardinals defeated the slumping 
Houston Astros 10-6 today. 
Smith, 5-3, had a no-hitter through five innings against the Astros, who have 
lost six in a row and nine of 10 and scored only 15 runs in their last eight 
games. 
He tired in the sixth when Rafael Ramirez hit a leadoff home run and ended up 
allowing six hits and five runs, three of them earned, in 6 2-3 innings. 
Coleman batting eighth -- the first time he's started out of the leadoff spot 
in his career -- responded with his first home run since Sept. 8. His two-run 
shot off Jim Deshaies, 1-2, highlighted a seven-run fifth. 
Pendleton hit his second home run in the sixth. Willie McGee had a pair of 
RBI-doubles and Todd Zeile had a two-run double for the Cardinals.
