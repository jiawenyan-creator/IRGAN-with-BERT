METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 FIRMS JOIN FORCES TO BUILD HOTEL IN 
MALIBU 
The Adamson Cos. has announced it will join forces with the firm that owns the 
Hotel Bel-Air to develop and manage a luxury hotel the company has long wanted 
to build overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. 
Besides the Hotel Bel-Air, which it purchased recently, the Sazale Corp., a 
Japanese firm, operates several luxury hotels in the United States and France, 
including the Los Angeles Biltmore. 
Adamson officials said they hope to start soon on the proposed 300-room, 
$65-million hotel on 27 acres near Pepperdine University. However, the 
California Coastal Commission has stipulated that a regional sewer system must 
be in place in Malibu before the hotel can be built. Slow-growth advocates are 
opposed to the sewer.
