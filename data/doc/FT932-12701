FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Boots pays Pounds 14.5m for European
expansion
BOOTS, the retail and pharmaceutical group, is paying Pounds 14.5m for two
over-the-counter healthcare companies in Europe.
Boots said the acquisitions would give Boots Heathcare International, the
OTC medicines and consumer products business set up last year, critical mass
in France and Italy.
The French business being bought is La Societe Francaise du Triclocarban,
the main products of which are Nobacter, a shaving foam, and Solubacter, an
antiseptic wash. It has sales of Pounds 5.1m.
Boots will move production to its own manufacturing facility in France and
will sell the products through its existing sales force.
In Italy, Boots is buying Marco Viti, with annual sales of Pounds 4.4m and
products which fit with Boots' existing portfolio.
The purchase includes a manufacturing base near Milan and a sales team.
