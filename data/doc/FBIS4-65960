  [Text] Norway has reacted positively to the Finnish 
Government's decision on the date for a EU [European Union] 
referendum. Norwegian Foreign Trade Minister Grete Knudsen 
denied claims that the Nordic countries planned the order of 
dates for their referendums. Knudsen stressed that each 
country's own needs have been decisive in establishing the 
referendum dates. The Norwegian Government will submit a 
proposal to parliament tomorrow to hold the EU referendum on 28 
November.
