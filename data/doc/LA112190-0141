ART; 
FLIRTING WITH MEANING OF PLASTIC PLANTS 
In 1989, Vincent Shine made large, pure-form sculptures that alluded to 
everyday objects like pianos and teapots. They were shifted subtly to avoid 
becoming a complete representation. 
Keep that in mind when looking at his current pieces which are exact, tiny 
green plant seedlings pinned to the wall or enshrined on tall pedestals. These 
are representations so perfectly contrived -- delicate, thread white roots and 
all -- that it's only the impossibility of their being real, and the long list 
of plastics that make up the materials, that knocks them conceptually out of 
the ring. 
Shine's pieces at the Michael Kohn Gallery in Santa Monica closely mirror 
nature. Yet dangling on the wall or dancing on myriad roots, their presentation 
repeatedly demands that the viewer acknowledge the artificiality of the work. 
This is part of the artist's tactic for getting the viewer involved in the 
process of assigning the work its meaning. 
Coupled with the paring of identical weeds on the wall so that right and left 
offer a stereoscopic view of the same "living" object, Shine pushes hard on the 
futility of observation. 
Shine's choice for faux seedlings isn't the random decision such innocuous 
plants might suggest. Duckweed, a sprawling aquatic patch of tiny green leaves 
and flowers is currently being hailed by environmentalists as an urban water 
treatment "savior" that can also be used for human and animal food. 
Along with Shine's papyrus sprouts, these plants are symbolically loaded 
objects closely tied to the human capacity to recognize things as useful. But 
the underlying irony here, of course, is that appearances can't be trusted. 
Shine may not be trying to be an environmentalist, but this work make's you 
think hard about issues of "usefulness," deforestation and the objectification 
of nature.
