  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Japanese nonlife insurers 
on Thursday [20 January] blasted U.S. trade negotiators for 
calling for targets in market access, saying the demands were 
without any "substantial" knowledge of the country's insurance 
market. 
  The criticism came in a statement issued by the Marine and 
Fire Insurance Association of Japan. 
  The association pinpointed "the U.S. side's lopsided demand 
without any substantial knowledge of the Japanese insurance 
market" as the reason for a deadlock in the negotiations -- one 
of the key issues in the bilateral "framework" talks. 
  "Personal field accounts for three-fourths of the premiums 
in 
the fire and marine insurance market, and even if the government 
decides on numerical targets, they cannot be attained," the 
statement said in reference to U.S. demands for "objective 
criteria." 
  The statement also counterattacked the U.S. market, saying 
it 
was more exclusive than Japan's because each state requires its 
own license for new entries.
