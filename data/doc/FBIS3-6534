  [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Japan had imported 612,300 
tons of table-use rice by Thursday, the Food Agency reported 
Friday [18 March]. 
  It also said sales of imported nonglutinous rice in Japan in 
the March 1-17 period totaled 170,000 tons, about 60 percent of 
the planned sales volume for March, the agency said. 
  Medium- and short-grain rice accounted for 90,000 tons of 
the 
sales and long-grain rice 80,000 tons. 
  Of the imports, 292,900 tons came from Thailand, 184,300 
tons 
from China, 101,100 tons from the United States and 34,000 tons 
from Australia, the agency said. 
  Japan plans to import a total of 1.7 million tons of rice to 
make up for a supply shortage as a result of the worst domestic 
crop last year since the end of World War II and has so far 
contracted to import 1.37 million tons, or 81 percent, of the 
total. 
  The agency said medium- and short-grain rice represented 
900,000 tons of the contract volume and Thai-produced long-grain 
rice 470,000 tons. 
  The Food Agency announced Thursday Japan will import an 
additional 400,000 tons to 2.1 million tons.
