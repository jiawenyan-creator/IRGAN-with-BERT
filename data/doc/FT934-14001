FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Panel clears Owners Abroad over Airtours
bid irregularity
THE TAKEOVER Panel yesterday comprehensively cleared Owners Abroad, the tour
operator, of any suggestion that it misled holders when it fought off a
takeover bid by rival Airtours earlier this year.
The panel said it launched an inquiry when Owners warned last July that
full-year profits were likely to be half market expectations. Owners said
the deterioration was the result of changes in customer preference, severe
price competition and competitors using their own travel agencies to sell
holidays.
Following the profits warning, Mr Howard Klein, chairman, and Mr Roger
Allard, managing director, announced their resignations.
During the takeover Owners did not make any profits forecast. It did base
its defence, however, on its underlying strengths - including a proposed
link-up with Thomas Cook and its trading performance.
The panel said it was 'satisfied that the statements relating to current
trading and prospects in the defence documentation were prepared with the
required standards of care and accuracy and that the information given by
Owners and its advisers in that connection was adequately and fairly
presented'.
'The reasons for the profits warning given by Owners in its interim
announcement were factors which either were not apparent or not material
during the period of Airtours' offer or had not yet arisen and were not
reasonably foreseeable.'
