FT  21 APR 93 / More than 1m covered by PRPs
MORE THAN 1m people are participating in profit-related pay schemes, Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday, Philip Coggan writes.
Mr Lamont, launching a Treasury booklet drawing together the details of the
various schemes - such as PRPs and share options - for promoting the
financial participation of employees, said one in five of the labour force
was covered by at least one scheme. PRP schemes have increased substantially
since the chancellor increased the tax benefits in 1991.
The number of employees covered by PRP schemes rose 20 per cent to 1,167,400
in the first quarter of this year, while the number of schemes rose 11 per
cent to 4,615.
Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, attended
the conference to express his support for the principle of PRP, provided it
did not comprise too large a proportion of workers' pay.
Sharing in success The government's employee financial participation
schemes. Treasury 071-270 5247 or Department of Employment 071-273 4962.
