  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 1/3/1994 -- The result of 27 
February elections is not a surprise, since democratic forces 
are so much divided, told BASAPRESS Vlad Darie, responsible for 
the electoral campaign of the Moldovan Democratic Party of 
Labour [PDMM]. He estimates that the about 30 deputies of the 
Bloc of the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity Movement 
represent interests of another state. Darie thinks that results 
of the voting have been influenced by the anticipate voting of 
the Transdniestrian people and by the opening of additional 
voting sections, against terms provided by law, in regions 
mostly inhabited with Gagauzians. "Now impertinence will be 
ruling. Serious strikes will first of all be applied to the 
Ministry of Education, especially concerning the teaching of 
history and Romanian language," said Darie.
