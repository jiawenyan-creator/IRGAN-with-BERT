WORLD IN BRIEF; 
ISRAEL; 
SOVIET JEWS PROTEST LIVING CONDITIONS 
Dozens of recently emigrated Soviet Jews in Jerusalem braved cold wind and rain 
to protest living conditions. 
The group complained of leaking walls and ceilings, and nonfunctional and 
dangerous heating systems. More than 8,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel 
so far this year, and more than 100,000 are expected by year's end. At the same 
time as the protest, Israeli President Chaim Herzog welcomed a group of 110 
Soviet immigrants in a ceremony at Tel Aviv's airport.
