FT  07 JAN 93 / India probes 'terrorist' link to funds
THE Indian government is investigating whether funds moved out of the
country by Standard Chartered, the British bank, were being used to finance
terrorist activity, the parliamentary committee probing the Bombay
securities scandal was told yesterday.
Mr Ram Niwas Mirdha, a Congress MP and chairman of the committee, said last
night that the Home Ministry's enforcement directorate was probing six
transactions in recent months totalling Rs40.1m (Pounds 899,000) - made
through accounts used for the remittance of money abroad, in violation of
foreign exchange regulations.
In London, Standard Chartered said it was aware of the speculation about
transfers from its Indian operations and that its internal investigation
into the Bombay scandal was looking into this. However, no evidence of
transfers to fund terrorist activities had yet been uncovered. Mr Mirdha
said foreign exchange had been remitted by Standard Chartered against rupee
cheques, violating Reserve Bank guidelines. The investigators had estimated
the exposure of the securities scandal at Rs53.41bn, up Rs7.64bn from the
assessment in October by the Reserve Bank of India.
