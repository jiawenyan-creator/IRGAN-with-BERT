FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (10): 'Intuitive'
Newton launched
APPLE Computer has launched the first product based on its Newton technology
 -the Newton 'MessagePad.' This hand-held communications aid, pictured
right, is designed to allow users to collect, organise and distribute
information with ease and spontaneity.
The MessagePad 'learns' the user's handwriting and work patterns - and then
implements them on cue over a short period of time. Whether it is printing a
letter or faxing a message, the product learns to anticipate the user's
needs. With an optional connection package, users can transfer, synchronise,
back-up and update information between the MessagePad and a personal
computer. Apple plans to introduce wireless messaging and electronic mail
facilities for the product.
