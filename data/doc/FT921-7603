FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disruption threat averted in
German gas supply row
THE THREAT of disruption to natural gas supplies in east Germany from the
former Soviet Union has been averted, thanks to a temporary - and secret -
agreement between suppliers and distributors.
The conflict involved the demand by Gasprom, the Russian gas exporter, and
Wintershall, its German partner, for a big increase in the delivery price of
some 2.8bn cubic meters of gas - roughly half east Germany's consumption.
Agreement was reached in the wings of the first German-Russian co-operation
council which met in Bonn this week, between Gasprom and Wintershall (a
subsidiary of BASF), on the one hand, and Verbundnetz Gas (VNG), the major
east German distributor, and its principal shareholder, Ruhrgas, on the
other.
It is understood that the agreement will be valid for the rest of 1992,
while a more permanent contract is worked out. Wintershall had threatened to
suspend gas deliveries from the beginning of March.
Wintershall and Gasprom, through their joint gas trading house WIEH had
sought an increase in the gas delivery price to 1.94 pfennigs per kwh,
compared with a price of 1.66 pfennigs offered by VNG, according to its
previous (East German) contract. VNG and Ruhrgas claimed that the lower
price was valid for all West European customers, and objected to paying
more.
Mr Klaus-Ewald Holst, chief executive of VNG, said he was now ready 'to
conclude a long-term natural gas contract with Wintershall-Gasprom on normal
market conditions'.
