<F P=106> [Interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, general secretary of </F>
Komeito (Clean Government Party), by a YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; 
date and place not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] So you are looking at two 
possibilities -- of conservatives [from the coalition parties] 
allying with conservatives [in the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP]) and of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
returning to the coalition government? 
  [Ichikawa] The natural course of action requires that we 
call on the SDPJ to return to the government first of all. But 
even when the SDPJ returns, there is the question of whether an 
agreement can be made on such policy issues as those concerning 
the consumption tax, defense, and diplomacy. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will you not be hesitant about 
collaborating with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone or 
former Deputy Prime Minister Micho Watanabe? 
  [Ichikawa] If there are people in the LDP who think the same 
way as we do on such pending issues as tax reform and who want 
to work together with the coalition, there is no reason to 
reject them. The ruling parties do not have much extra room to 
maneuver. As long as the 180 [Diet members] in the ruling 
parties remain unified as a "non-LDP" force, even if these 
parties cooperate with a part of the LDP, the core of the reform 
can be maintained. Consider it as only a phase in the process 
of the reorganization of the political world. You should not 
look at the matter from a narrow viewpoint. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is the possibility of the SDPJ 
returning to the government? 
  [Ichikawa] There is a strong possibility for that in view of 
the given conditions and situations. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the negotiations on their 
return to the government will go well? 
  [Ichikawa] Issues to be dealt with are -- in the order of 
difficulty -- tax reform, the DPRK (North Korean) issue, and the 
parliamentary group "Kaishin." If the SDPJ's intention to 
return to the government is clear and the issue of the Kaishin 
group is a barrier to their return, then that matter can be 
resolved. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will a voluntary resignation of the 
cabinet en masse be acceptable to you. 
  [Ichikawa] We of the ruling parties cannot say we are 
"happy" about it. But we interpret their request on the 
cabinet's resignation as an expression of their willingness to 
return to the government. We appreciate that point. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will the cabinet be overhauled completely? 
  [Ichikawa] This is something that needs to be done with 
people from the SDPJ and other people included and in a way 
which enables the multiple parties to gather around on the basis 
of policies. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will a reorganization be possible within 
the next two weeks of the remaining Diet session? 
  [Ichikawa] It is quite possible. But the situation can 
become explosive or fluid on the slightest motives. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What are the possible motives? 
  [Ichikawa] A no-confidence motion in the cabinet can be one. 
But it is extremely questionable if the LDP can go for it. It 
is equally questionable if the SDPJ can collaborate in it. If 
the LDP leadership pushes and goes ahead for it without proper 
justification, a fight over policy lines will erupt, and the 
party could break up. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you view the move for the LDP and 
the SDPJ to cooperate? 
  [Ichikawa] The differences in policies between them are too 
big. Besides, it [two parties' cooperation] cannot be accepted 
by the supporters of the SDPJ. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you intend to pursue negotiations 
with the SDPJ for their return to the government? 
  [Ichikawa] Once the ruling parties' policy on the tax reform 
issue is decided, we will have no choice but to approach the 
party to gain their understanding on that matter as well as in 
pursuit of the party's return to the government. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Is there a possibility of time passing and 
the Diet session closing with the government remaining a 
minority one? 
  [Ichikawa] If the conditions presented by the SDPJ for their 
return to the govlernment are too tough to swallow, the 
political situation can move in a direction away from what the 
SDPJ expected.
