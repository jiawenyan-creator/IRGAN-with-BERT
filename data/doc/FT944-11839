FT  04 NOV 94 / Manila raises investment limit
Philippine monetary authorities have doubled the ceiling for outward
investment by residents to Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.7m) a year in an attempt to
stem the rise in the local currency. Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of Bangko
Sentral, the central monetary authority, said yesterday that the higher
limit 'is expected to increase foreign exchange demand and directly ease the
appreciation of the peso'. A sharp increase in foreign exchange inflows in
recent months, following improved investment conditions and high domestic
interest rates, has strengthened the peso against the US dollar. Yesterday
the currency traded at 24.693 pesos to the dollar, an increase of 12.3 per
cent against its level at the start of the year.
This has hurt Philippine exporters, who claim the lower peso proceeds for
their exports have led to losses. Some exporters' groups have also warned
that the rising peso has curtailed expansion plans. A policy allowing
Philippine residents more investments abroad is the latest of a series of
Bangko Sentral moves to curb the currency's rise.
