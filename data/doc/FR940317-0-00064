As discussed above, the municipal market today lacks an effective mechanism for dissemination of material information
to investors and the marketplace. To be effective in minimizing the issuer's risk under the antifraud provisions,
the annual financial information and event disclosure should be disseminated in a manner reasonably designed to
inform the holders of the issuer's securities and the market for those securities. 

Trustees can serve as cost effective disseminators of information to the market due to the capacity and duties of trustees
under the terms of the indentures, which positions them to have knowledge of the events requiring disclosure, and
the ability and authority to communicate with bondholders.
<FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission encourages the inclusion of provisions in trust indentures that authorize trustees to transmit information
to the market, particularly in structured financings where the issuer's obligations generally are delegated to
various participants. Trustees also may provide a service to other small issuers, by enabling them to notify the market
in a timely manner and at a lower cost.

</FOOTNOTE>


The common denominator for current proposals to improve secondary market disclosure for municipal securities is
the establishment and designation of one or more information repositories to serve as a collection and access point
for annual and current information.
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>
 Such repositories would serve as predetermined sources for information concerning a particular issuer, allowing
participants to verify that they have the latest available information concerning the issuer before recommending,
purchasing, or bidding for a security. The repositories would supplement, not substitute for, the existing access
bondholders may have to issuers to obtain current information.

Consistent with the recent recommendation of the Joint Statement, the GFOA Guidelines call for lodging secondary
market disclosure with a repository, as did the ABA guidelines published in 1991. GFOA Guidelines, Procedural Statement
No. 8; ABA 1991 Guidelines at 3.

The American Bankers Association Corporate Trust Committee and the National Association of Bond Lawyers, as well
as the Joint Statement, have expressed concern that securities depositories and their participants do not retransmit
notices they receive from trustees and issuers to the beneficial owners of the issuer's securities. The ABA Corporate
Trust Committee sought to address the problem by calling for simultaneous dissemination of the information to the
marketplace through an information repository. The National Association of Bond Lawyers has suggested that the
Commission promulgate a rule mandating that all depositories and their direct and indirect participants promptly
retransmit notices received from the issuer or indenture trustee. While the establishment of information repositories
may address the problem to some extent, the Commission staff intends to work with the relevant organizations to assure
that steps are taken to provide for consistent retransmission of the information. 

</FOOTNOTE>


In the Companion Release, the Commission is proposing an amendment to Rule 15c212 to prohibit, as suggested
by the Joint Statement, underwriting of a municipal securities issue unless the issuer of the municipal security
has covenanted to provide annual and ongoing disclosure to a repository. 



V. Interpretive Guidance With Respect to Obligations of Municipal Securities Dealers



In the Proposing and Adopting Releases for Rule 15c212, the Commission set forth its interpretation of the
obligation of municipal underwriters under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The interpretation
discussed the duty of underwriters to the investing public to have a reasonable basis for recommending any municipal
securities, and their responsibility, in fulfilling that obligation, to review in a professional manner the accuracy
of statements made in connection with the offering. The interpretation was set out in the Proposing Release, and modified
slightly in the Adopting Release. The Commission reaffirms its Interpretation with respect to underwriters' responsibilities
under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
<FOOTCITE>103</FOOTCITE>
 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
In light of the underwriter's obligation, as discussed in the prior releases, to review the official statement and
to have a reasonable basis for its belief in the accuracy and completeness of the official statement's key representations,
disclaimers by underwriters of responsibility for the information provided by the issuer or other parties, without
further clarification regarding the underwriter's belief as to accuracy, and the basis therefor, are misleading
and should not be included in official statements. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Furthermore, the Commission believes that it is also appropriate to emphasize the responsibilities of brokers and
dealers in trading municipal securities in the secondary market. The Commission historically has taken the position
that a broker-dealer recommending securities to investors implies by its recommendation that it has an adequate
basis for the recommendation.
<FOOTCITE>104</FOOTCITE>
 A dealer, unlike an underwriter, ordinarily is not obligated to contact the issuer to verify information. A dealer
must, however, have a reasonable basis for its recommendation.
<FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>
 If, based on publicly available information, a dealer discovers any factors that indicate the disclosure is inaccurate
or incomplete, or signal the need for further inquiry, a municipal securities dealer may need to obtain additional
information, or seek to verify existing information.
