FT  24 AUG 94 / Ozone destruction continues
Destruction of the earth's protective ozone shield is continuing in both
southern and northern hemispheres, according to the World Meteorological
Organisation, Frances Williams reports.
The WMO says that in March this year, ozone levels over western Europe were
10-20 per cent below normal. For the winter-spring 1994 period, levels over
the entire northern hemisphere averaged 2-3 per cent below seasonal
long-term values. While this did not match the record ozone deficiency of 17
per cent in February and March 1993, the WMO says the cumulative ozone
decline since the 1970s over the northern hemisphere is continuing.
In the Antarctic, which experienced the worst-ever ozone 'hole' in autumn
1993, ozone levels also fell well below normal (for pre-ozone 'hole' years)
between February and April 1994.
