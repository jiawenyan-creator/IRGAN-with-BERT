RICHARD GOTTLIEB; 'PEOPLE'S COURT' DIRECTOR 
Richard Gottlieb, a longtime television director whose work on "The People's 
Court" won an Emmy nomination last year, died Saturday in Atlanta of a heart 
attack. 
He was 67 and in Atlanta taping "The People's Court," which he had directed for 
the last eight years. 
A spokesman for Ralph Edwards Productions, producer of "The People's Court," a 
daytime favorite, said Gottlieb had been associated with Edwards for 40 years 
as producer, director and writer. 
His credits include dozens of episodes of "This Is Your Life," "$100,000 Name 
That Tune," "Truth or Consequences" and "Who in the World." 
Gottlieb was credited with finding the winning city in the contest that renamed 
the New Mexico community of Hot Springs as Truth or Consequences, a name it 
carries to this day.
