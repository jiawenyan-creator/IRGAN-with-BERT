 

(2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total 
hundredweight of milk in Class II as determined pursuant to 
1065.44(c) by the Class II differential price for the month;

(3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight 
of skim milk in Class I as determined pursuant to 1065.44(a) by 
the skim milk price;

(4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to 
1065.44(a) by the average protein content of producer skim milk 
received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of 
protein by the protein price; and

(5) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of 
skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to 
1065.44(a) by the average other solids content of producer skim 
milk received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting 
pounds of other solids by the other solids price;

(f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I 
differential price applicable at the location of the nearest 
unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was 
received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of 
concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to 
1065.43(d) and 1065.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds of skim milk 
and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to 
1065.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of 1065.44(b), 
excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid 
milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that 
an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to 
such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk 
order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as 
an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;

6. Section 1065.61 is amended by revising the section 
heading, introductory text, and paragraphs (a) and (f), to read 
as follows:



1065.61



Producer price differential.



For each month the market administrator shall compute a 
producer price differential per hundredweight of milk received 
from producers, as follows:

(a) Combine into one total for all handlers:

(1) The values computed pursuant to 1065.60(a)(1), (a)(2), 
and (b) through (i) for all handlers;

(2) Add values computed pursuant to 1065.60(a)(3), (a)(4), 
and (a)(5) and subtract the values obtained by multiplying the 
handlers' total pounds of protein and total pounds of other 
solids contained in such milk by their respective prices; and

(3) Subtract the value obtained by multiplying the 
difference between the Class III price and the Class IIIA price 
times the pounds of product determined pursuant to 1065.43(e);



* * * * *



(f) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents 
from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section. The result shall be the ``producer price differential.''

7. Section 1065.62 is revised to read as follows:



1065.62



Announcement of producer prices.



On or before the 12th day after the end of each month, the 
market administrator shall announce the following prices and 
information:

(a) The producer price differential;

(b) The protein price;

(c) The other solids price;

(d) The butterfat price;

(e) The average protein and other solids content of producer 
milk; and

(f) The statistical uniform price for milk containing 3.5 
percent butterfat, computed by combining the Class III price and 
the producer price differential.
