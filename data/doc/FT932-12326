FT  29 APR 93 / Curfew imposed in Srinagar
A curfew was imposed in Srinagar and adjoining towns in Kashmir yesterday,
after the Indian army and central government paramilitary forces made over
2,000 striking policemen of the Jammu and Kashmir state constabulary
surrender their weapons after a bloodless all-night operation, writes Shiraz
Sidhva in New Delhi.
The army operation and the week-long police strike that preceded it have
seriously undermined the government's recent efforts to initiate a political
process in the valley, where a separatist insurgency has raged since
December 1989. 'There will now be a further hardening of stance,' said a
senior home ministry official.
Thousands of policemen in Jammu and Kashmir went on a rampage in the streets
of Srinagar after Mr Riyaz Ahmed, a constable of the Jammu and Kashmir armed
police, was arrested by the army and later killed in army custody.
