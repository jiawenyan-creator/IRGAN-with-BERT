FT  27 JUN 94 / Political turmoil averted in Mexico
Mexico averted a political crisis yesterday when Mr Jorge Carpizo, Mexico's
interior minister, agreed to withdraw his resignation that was submitted on
Friday.
Mr Carpizo had resigned after denouncing the 'most diverse sectors' in
politics who opposed democratic reforms. But President Salinas rejected his
resignation, and after two days of talks, persuaded him to stay. Most of
Mexico's political parties and scores of non-partisan groups had urged Mr
Carpizo to change his mind.
As interior minister, Mr Car-pizo heads the Federal Electoral Institute, and
has had a key role in government efforts to persuade the opposition and
public the presidential vote would be fair and credible.
Officials argued the wide backing given to Mr Carpizo has led to an
strengthening of his authority, which will make it more difficult for
hardline factions in both the governing and opposition parties to sabotage
the August election.
However the resignation calls attention to the fragile unity in the ruling
party, and potential for further upsets before or after the election. Mr
Carpizo is allied with the party's reformist wing, and there seems little
doubt that his frustration with conservative elements in the party played a
part in his decision to quit.
Mr Carpizo blamed a particular party for failure to co-operate, but did not
name it. The government has insisted he was referring to the leftist Party
of Democratic Revolution, but the opposition and many analysts argue he was
alluding to the governing party.
