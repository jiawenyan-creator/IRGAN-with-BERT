FT  17 DEC 93 / Macedonia backed by half of EU
Six European Union member-states said yesterday they were establishing full
diplomatic relations with Macedonia, despite strong opposition from Greece.
Diplomats from Germany, France, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark
made separate visits to the Foreign Ministry in Skopje to inform the
Macedonian government.
The move is set to irritate Greece, which takes over the presidency of the
European Union next year, and add an extra edge of controversy to EU
attempts to co-ordinate foreign policy.
Greece has insisted that recognition of Macedonia by its EU partners would
undermine the principle of a joint foreign policy because Macedonia's name
implies a territorial claim on the northern Greek province of Macedonia.
Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, recently
provoked a diplomatic row by accusing Germany of acting like a 'bestial
giant' for pushing for recognition. Although he later apologised, the timing
of the announcement, rushed through just before Greece assumed the
presidency, seems likely to further strain relations.
However, British diplomats yesterday denied that the announcements had been
co-ordinated by Germany or its EU other partners. 'This was an entirely
national matter,' said the British Foreign Office, stressing that
recognition was a 'normal step' given that Britain and other European
countries had accepted Macedonia's entry into the United Nations in April.
Meanwhile, Mr Kiro Gligorev, Macedonian president, stressed that he wanted
'widespread co-operation' with Greece. Macedonia was willing to sign an
agreement guaranteeing the present border with Greece, he said.
