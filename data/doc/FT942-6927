FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fenchurch meets expectations
Fenchurch, the insurance broker which gained a stock market listing in
November, yesterday reported a decline in pro forma pre-tax profits to
Pounds 3.53m for the six months to March 31, compared with Pounds 3.96m in
the same period last year.
But the group stressed that the result was adversely affected by the
transfer of several important insurance contracts from the first six months
to the second half of the year.
Arguing that profits were up on an underlying basis, it declared an interim
dividend of 2.6p, payable from earnings per share of 6.2p (7.4p).
'Our client base continues to expand both here and overseas, where we have
benefited from a higher profile following our public listing,' said Mr Roger
Earl, chief executive.
'The group's trading remains in line with expectations at the time of
flotation,' added Mr Earl.
Turnover for the six months was Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 14.7m). However, the
decision to delay the placing of several contacts - mainly relating to
aviation, energy and industrial business - led to the loss of some Pounds
1.4m in turnover, virtually all of which would have fed through to pre-tax
profits, according to the group. Expenses increased by 9.8 per cent.
Mr Earl said that the group had decided to defer the contracts because of
tightness in the London market.
Investment income amounted to Pounds 874,000 (Pounds 911,000). Discontinued
operations generated income of Pounds 356,000 (Pounds 1.29m). Interest
payable amounted to Pounds 52,000 (Pounds 48,000). Losses from discontinued
operations amounted to Pounds 7,000 (Pounds 61,000).
