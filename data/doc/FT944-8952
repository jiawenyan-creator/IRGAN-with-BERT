FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: 'Generally buoyant' markets help push Volex
to Pounds 5.85m
In a year when markets for its electrical interconnection products and cable
assemblies were 'generally buoyant', Volex Group reported a 22 per cent rise
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 5.85m.
However, stripping out an exceptional Pounds 662,000 profit from the sale of
surplus land, the pre-tax figure rose a more modest 8 per cent.
Although the data processing market had been expanding and was projected to
grow at 15 per cent a year, the group drew attention to strong price
competition in some of its markets and rising commodity prices in its main
raw materials - polymer and copper.
Mr Oliver Chapple, chief executive since October 1993, said copper prices
had risen 50 per cent and polymer 30 per cent in the past 12 months.
However, through efficiencies in manufacturing and purchasing, the group
managed to raise operating margins. Operating profits grew 13 per cent to
Pounds 5.45m (Pounds 4.83m).
Net interest payable was Pounds 263,000, against Pounds 30,000, as
borrowings at the half-way stage jumped to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 800,000) for
gearing of 20.6 per cent.
Most of the rise derived from Pounds 2.7m of deferred consideration for
Cable Products, bought in early 1992, and the Pounds 3.2m cost of increasing
the group's stake in Mayor, the Singapore-based maker of data and power cord
assemblies, from 60 to 75 per cent. Mr Chapple said Volex had the option to
lift its stake to 100 per cent.
In wiring systems, the rise in business from Rover 'more than compensated
for' the expected phasing-out of the Jaguar business, while the customer
base was spreading to commercial, agricultural and off-road vehicles.
Sales at Pencon, the UK power cords maker, were 'disappointing', in spite of
moulded plug fitting legislation due to come into effect next February.
Earnings per share rose 34 per cent to 14.1p (10.5p) and the interim
dividend is lifted to 6.7p (6.5p).
