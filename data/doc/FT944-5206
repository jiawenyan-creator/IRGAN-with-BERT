FT  05 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Potential to challenge Revenue
Sir, The Germans 'face higher UK tax charges on the earnings of their
British subsidiaries' following Budget tax changes ('Japanese and Germans
face higher charges', November 30).
It is ironic that they should do so by virtue of provisions intended,
according to the Inland Revenue press release of November 29, to 'remove any
uncertainty' over existing rules, following the European Court of Justice's
decision that certain Dutch tax provisions gave rise to illegal
discrimination - see Halliburton Services BV (Case C-l/93).
Whether the proposed provisions are as non-discriminatory as they first
appear may be questionable. Of more general significance is the fact that
the UK Inland Revenue is now openly taking account of EC law in formulating
proposals for new corporation tax legislation.
Company tax advisers, for their part, ought to be just as interested in
applying the EC Treaty to tax laws already in force. Many significant
provisions, including those relating to loss-relief for groups of companies,
appear open to challenge in the right circumstances.
