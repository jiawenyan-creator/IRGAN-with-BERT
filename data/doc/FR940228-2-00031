SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The subject study represents a review and evaluation of readily available pertinent technical reports which were
discussed among the participating agencies during the course of the preparation of the study from October to December
1992. After reviewing the hazards posed by plutonium, applicable transportation safety and physical protection
regulations, pertinent research and experience, and contingency plans, the agencies participating in this study
conclude that plutonium can be shipped safely by sea. 



Public Law 102486 also requires the preparation and submittal to Congress of an Implementation Plan that describes
the plan for implementing the recommendations contained in the study. The Implementation Plan must be submitted
to Congress and made available for public viewing 90 days after issuance of the study. Subsequent to enactment of the
legislation calling for this study and Implementation Plan, and subsequent to preparation of the study, several
individual members of Congress have raised additional concerns relating to the shipment of radioactive materials
by sea. These concerns include the safety of shipment of other material proposed to be shipped (e.g., glassified high-level
nuclear waste and mixed oxide fuel), as well as the need to evaluate risk assessment elements. These elements are shipping
routes, adequacy of the revised International Maritime Organization code for radioactive shipments, the consequences
and probability of the ``maximum credible accident'' in shipping by sea, and the examination of threats of sabotage
and terrorism. The participating Federal agencies will address these additional concerns in the Implementation
Plan to the extent that they relate to the recommendations in the study. Where certain issues raised do not fall within
the framework of the study and Implementation Plan, the agencies will ensure that they are addressed through direct
communication with the members of Congress who raised them. 




Issued in Washington, DC, on February 18, 1994.
