FT  08 JUL 94 / Two towns to get city status
The status of city is to be conferred on Armagh in Northern Ireland and on
St David's in west Wales.
The announcement was made by Prince Charles on a visit to Northern Ireland.
He said that Armagh, which is celebrating its 1,550th anniversary, had been
a city from 1226 until a century and a half ago and that St David's had also
lost its city status in the 19th century.
