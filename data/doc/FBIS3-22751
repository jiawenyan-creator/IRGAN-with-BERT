  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Three men were arrested in this 
Thai-Cambodian border district yesterday for allegedly smuggling 
dangerous goods, suspected to be uranium, into the country. 
  A combined unit of police and military officers arrested 
Narong Foitakhu, 48, Thawon Plangkamon, 46, and Khian Phongsi, 
60, near a market in Ban Khlong Luk and seized a tin box 
suspected to contain the radioactive substance. 
  The rusty box, which is 28 cms long, 21 cms wide, and 6 cms 
tall, and weighing about 4.2 kgs, is imprinted with a danger 
sign and a phrase in English which reads: "1974-1994 Uranium 
999X Made in USA 2350827." 
  The police said they have not yet opened the box as they 
fear 
that the contents inside might be dangerous. The box would be 
sent to either the Mineral Resources Department or the Army's 
Chemical Department for inspection. 
  According to the police, the suspects confessed that they 
were hired to bring the box from Cambodia to a customer in 
Bangkok. The suspects reportedly said that Cambodian people 
told them the substance inside the box was a mineral that could 
"eat iron" since nails or metal scrap placed on the box 
decomposed very quickly. 
  The three have been charged with violating the Customs Act 
by 
importing and possessing prohibited articles.
