  [Text] Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin 
called the decree on citizenship adopted recently in Latvia "an 
unprecedented act for modern Europe." 
  "This decree is of a clearly discriminating nature, 
primarily 
with respect to Latvia's Russian population. It precisely 
reflects the aim of creating a mono-ethnic state in Latvia and 
gives precedence to the political interests of the present 
ruling elite at the expense of human rights," Adamishin said. 
He described the move as "playing with fire." 
  He said he was displeased with the West's reaction, which he 
described as "feeble." "One can imagine what a fuss would have 
been made if this had taken place in the former USSR," he said. 
  He also said that U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is 
scheduled to visit Riga on July 6, could find himself "in a 
rather delicate position." "By his visit Clinton will be forced 
to bless this Latvian decree and its provisions which are 
discriminating with respect to several hundreds of thousands 
people, about 30 percent of Latvia's population," he said. 
  Adamishin underlined that Russia would protest to 
international organizations, address parliamentarians, etc. 
"There should be no doubts that such attitude towards human 
rights cannot but affect bilateral Russian-Latvian relations. - 
he concluded [no end quotation marks as received].
