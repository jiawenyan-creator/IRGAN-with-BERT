ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LAGUNA NIGUEL; 
'HISTORIC' $3-MILLION FIRE STATION DEDICATED 
Orange County's newest fire station, at 31461 Street of the Golden Lantern, was 
dedicated Thursday afternoon, with county Supervisor Thomas Riley praising the 
"historic" development agreement that funded the $3-million facility. 
"History is really being made here today," Riley told the audience of about 150 
at the new station. Riley said the station is the first to be built in the 
county's Fifth Supervisorial District using solely private funds from 
developers. 
The 9,200-square-foot fire station was built by Shea Homes, which is paying 
about 48% of the cost for the building and fire equipment. Taylor Woodrow Homes 
California Ltd. is paying 45% of the cost, and the remaining 7% is being paid 
by Standard Pacific of Orange County, O'Hill Partners, C2H2 Ltd., and Shea 
Business Properties. 
The facility, called Bear Brand Fire Station No. 49, is a single-story 
wood-frame stucco building with a concrete tile roof. About a mile north of the 
Dana Point city boundary, the station is designed to add fire protection to 
that city, San Juan Capistrano and the many subdivisions in Laguna Niguel.
