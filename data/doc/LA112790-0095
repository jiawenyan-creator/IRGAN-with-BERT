ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
GOING TO COURT: The Capistrano Unified School District is usually tops in 
grades but near the bottom in state funding. So officials Wednesday will 
announce they are suing for more money. . . . With per-student funding lowest 
among the county's unified districts -- more than $300 per student less than 
Newport-Mesa's, for example -- Capistrano argues that it should be getting more 
money under the landmark Serrano-Priest Supreme Court decision, which mandates 
equal funding for similar districts. . . . To bolster its case, Capistrano has 
hired the Los Angeles attorney who won the Serrano Priest case nearly 20 years 
ago. Tony Marcano and Jim Newton
