FT  23 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Brussels defies oilseeds threat
THE agreement settling the EC-US row over oilseeds subsidies will stay on
the EC foreign ministers' agenda for March 8 despite a French threat to veto
it, the European Commission said yesterday.
The French government, facing defeat at parliamentary elections next month,
warned the Commission and Denmark - currently EC president - on Friday that
it would try to veto the deal if it went to a vote.
The five-year oilseeds dispute with the US was resolved in principle last
November on terms much more favourable to the Community than had been
expected, together with long-running subsidised food export rows holding up
the Uruguay Round world trade reform talks.
'We're concerned that the longer (the draft accord) is left open, the more
likely it is that the US will want to renegotiate it,' said an aide to Mr
Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner.
The commissioner sees delivering the oilseeds accord as an indication of EC
support for the separate Uruguay Round package, regarded by EC farm
policy-makers as vital to protect the reformed Common Agricultural Policy
from challenge by competitors.
Mr Steichen is taking a hard line in insisting the issue be kept on the
agenda, but this does not mean it will be pushed to a vote. The aide
conceded that a decision could be postponed until April 5, when foreign
ministers meet again, eight days after the second round of the French
elections.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, appeared to be invoking the
'Luxembourg compromise' allowing member states to claim overwhelming
national interest, when he said his government 'will oppose approval of such
an agreement by all means agreed between member states'.
