  [Excerpts] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir has described 
the possible approval of voluntary military service proposed by 
President Carlos Roberto Reina as "total destruction" of the 
Armed Forces. The military chief explained that Hondurans are 
not ready for such a step because they do not have enough 
education and culture, aside from the fact that it would weaken 
the Armed Forces. [passage omitted] 
  The military chief said that the money circulating in the 
nation's drug market far exceeds the national budget of a 
country such as Honduras. He reported that the Police, Army, 
Air Force, and Navy are conducting joint operations that have 
led to the arrest of drug traffickers and the seizure of large 
amounts of drugs. He added that efforts have been intensified, 
particularly in Islas de la Bahia, which has become a key point 
for drug contraband. 
  Discua said he could neither confirm nor deny charges by a 
former judge that the traditional political parties paid for 
their campaigns with drug money because he does not have any 
information to that effect. [passage omitted]
