FT  10 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Stock index futures tumbled steeply, ending the week in a soured mood with
the FT-SE 100 December contract significantly adrift of the 3000 level,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the close of pit trading the December contract was 2965, down 51 points
for a net decline on the week of 40 points. The performance produced a
discount to the cash market of 12 points or 14 points under fair value.
Allowing for spread trading into the March contract volume was probably a
bit better than on Thursday with 16,629 contracts traded.
