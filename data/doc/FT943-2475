FT  19 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook 'unaffected' by bankruptcy moves
Tiphook, the transport leasing group, yesterday continued to insist that it
was unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Robert Montague, its
founder and chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has issued a bankruptcy petition over a Pounds
2.3m loan to Mr Montague. Reports at the weekend suggested that he has debts
of about Pounds 30m.
Mr Montague has considerable assets, including a large estate in Oxfordshire
and a home in Knightsbridge. However, his shareholding in Tiphook, once
worth more than Pounds 18m, is now worth about Pounds 1m.
The Royal Bank of Scotland loan is understood to be linked to the farming
businesses in Oxfordshire. Changes in the terms of the loan are thought to
have been under negotiation for some time.
News of the bankruptcy proceedings emerged at last Thursday's annual meeting
and took Mr Montague and the board by surprise. The group's bankers and Mr
Ian Clubb, its newly appointed chairman, are continuing to support Mr
Montague.
If he were to be declared bankrupt, he would have to step down from the
board, which has declared that he is key to the group's survival.
The directors were clearly shocked at the circumstances of the bankruptcy
revelations by a shareholder representative at the AGM, where Mr Montague
was already under attack over his remuneration. However, sources close to
Tiphook remain adamant that he will survive this latest indignity.
