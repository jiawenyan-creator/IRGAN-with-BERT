FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa forecasts much lower
losses in second half
LUFTHANSA, the struggling German airline which is shedding staff to help
stem heavy losses, said yesterday that its second-half loss should be much
lower than in the first half as a result of improved business and capacity
cuts.
It also intends to operate a less conservative depreciation policy, which
will save around DM350m (Dollars 233.30m) this year.
The airline has already announced a pre-tax loss of DM542m for the first six
months, up from DM331m in the same period last year. Lufthansa said the
decision to take aircraft out of service and reduce jobs - by 6,000 over the
next two years after cutting 1,800 this year - would have an increasing
impact in the second half.
The company said traffic performance in July had improved, with bookings
until end-October also rising.
The airline said savings from its new, simplified Lufthansa Express
division, which will take over eight busy domestic flights this winter,
would initially total DM90m a year.
