  [Text] After the recent international polemics and just 
after having held talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the 
president [Scalfaro] has once again stressed that Italy "is 
fundamentally stable and reliable on the international scene," 
in spite of the changes which are taking place in our country 
and the "presence of new political groupings." 
  Scalfaro was addressing 125 diplomats to celebrate Republic 
Day. He repeated that Italy "has the right to be respected by 
all those who think that substance is more important than form; 
it must be more important than form."
