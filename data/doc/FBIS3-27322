  [Text] Pale, February 22 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said today that Serbs want to achieve final 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina through political negotiations. 
  In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, he said that if the 
ceasefire accord between Serbs and Muslims is carefully observed 
by the warring sides, the 22-month-old civil war will come to an 
end "within four or five months". 
  The ceasefire accord was signed soon after the NATO 
ultimatum 
issued on February 9, following the bombing of a crowded 
Sarajevo marketplace on February 5, killing 68 people and 
injuring over 200. 
  Karadzic said the bloodshed in Sarajevo has damaged the 
process of peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
  Meanwhile, he accused NATO of issuing the ultimatum and 
threatening air strikes against Serb positions, saying that the 
West is playing power politics toward small nations by showing 
off their military forces. 
  Karadzic said the Bosnian war could be ended if the 
international community treats all sides equally. 
  He thanked the Chinese government for opposing foreign 
military intervention in Bosnia-Hercegovina and insisting on a 
political resolution to the conflict. 
  Karadzic said the three ethnics (Serbs, Croats and Muslims) 
would be good neighbors provided they become separate states. 
He added that the relations between Serbs and Croats "are good 
now". 
  He urged the United States and Germany to exert pressure on 
Muslims so that "a genuine peace can finally come". 
  The Bosnian war has so far claimed 200,000 lives and 
produced 
millions of refugees. The war has also inflicted heavy blows to 
the economy in the former Yugoslavia.
