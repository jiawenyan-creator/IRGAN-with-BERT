FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hoskins rebels step up bid to remove Hoars
REBEL shareholders in Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer,
yesterday stepped up their campaign to remove Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and
his brother, Mr Robert Hoar from the board.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr Richard Cattermole, leader of the dissident
group, said the company's trading record under the present management had
been 'appalling'.
Since joining the USM in 1990, Hoskins' net assets had fallen from Pounds
4.1m to Pounds 3.18m. Shareholders had received no dividends, and none could
be paid until a Pounds 272,000 deficiency on reserves was eliminated.
Mr Cattermole, chief executive of Ryan Elizabeth, a pubs and hotels
operator, strongly criticised the recent sale of nine pubs - 'the lion's
share of Hoskins' freehold land and buildings' - at a book loss of Pounds
484,000.
'At a time when other small regional brewers are busily purchasing premises
on reasonable terms, it is inexplicable,' he said.
There was no clear strategy for the future prosperity of Hoskins, Mr
Cattermole added. 'It is surely time for a change in the management.'
Mr Cattermole said that if he and his associate, Mr Jeremy Lea, were elected
to the board at an extraordinary meeting on November 18, they would seek to
reverse the company's decline and expand its outlets and beer sales.
Neither would draw any remuneration from Hoskins until pre-tax profits had
been increased from last year's Pounds 83,000 to Pounds 250,000, and a
dividend had been paid.
