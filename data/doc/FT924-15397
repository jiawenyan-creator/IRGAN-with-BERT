FT  05 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
A succession of weak economic indicators, a near-30 per cent widening in the
August current account surplus and the strength of the yen also point to a
further cut in Japan's official discount rate in the not too distant future.
The question, though, is one of timing. The worst of the recent economic
data - including the 7.6 per cent annual fall in August industrial
production announced last week - refer to a period before the Y10,700bn
(Pounds 50bn) emergency government spending package was announced on August
28. The authorities may wish to see whether this package has had any
discernible effect on confidence before they act on monetary policy.
There is admittedly no particular reason that confidence should have risen.
The measures will have only a limited impact, and the additional spending is
not as generous as it looks. Still more disconcerting is doubt whether a
half-point cut in the discount rate, now 3.25 per cent, would give the
economy a new lease of life either. Consumer confidence, already jolted by
the collapse in the property market, is being further undermined as
manufacturing incomes fall in response to cuts in overtime.
Another rate cut might thus be perceived as a sign of weakness, rather than
a signal to buy equities. The government may actually want growth. It can
also afford to spend to achieve it, but Japan seems locked in a similar
spiral to other countries coming to terms with debt deflation. The outlook
for corporate earnings is bleak and the fundamental problems of the banks
are far from resolved. It is instructive to note that the Nikkei is more
than three per cent lower than it was when the fiscal package was announced.
