FT  11 DEC 92 / Many long-term jobless never employed
NEARLY 40 per cent of European Community citizens unemployed for more than
one year - about three million people - have never had a job, according to
the European Commission.
The vast majority are under 25 and concentrated in the southern EC states.
In Italy, 78 per cent of those unemployed for a year or more have never had
a job and in Greece the figure is 65 per cent.
Those out of work for more than a year account for about half of the EC's 16
million unemployed, compared with only 6 per cent in the US and 18 per cent
in Japan, according to the London-based Employment Policy Institute.
These 'outsiders' in the European jobs market cease being part of the
effective labour supply and cannot act as a constraint on wage bargainers,
argues the EPI in an analysis of European unemployment published today.
The EC Commission expects EC unemployment, which is just under 10 per cent,
to rise to 11 per cent and to remain there until 1996. Only the Netherlands
has seen its unemployment rate fall since 1990, from 7.3 per cent to 6 per
cent.
The Commission projects that the population of working age will rise by
between 3 per cent and 5 per cent over the next 10 years and then remain
virtually static until 2010.
The EPI expects most new jobs to come in the service sector and a further
shift away from unskilled employment. That will intensify the need for
vocational qualifications, it says. About two-thirds of EC workers have a
vocational qualification, although less than half of UK workers do.
EC member states spend on average 2.25 per cent of GDP on the unemployed, of
which nearly two-thirds goes on 'passive' assistance such as benefit and
one-third on 'active' assistance such as counselling. The EPI argues that
these proportions must be reversed.
