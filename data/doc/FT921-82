FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Hopping mad - Ballot Box
One party not doing any knocking in the election - and that includes
knocking on doors - is the Natural Law Party. Instead, they are
transcendentally meditating for victory and holding a series of press
conferences this week in Manchester, Skelmersdale - home of the Maharishi's
Golden Dome - Liverpool and London.
The 11-day-old party is fielding 311 candidates, each accomplished in 'yogic
flying', or levitation, and is certain it will form a minority government on
April 10 with 310 members. It cannot have 311 because one candidate, Peter
Leadbetter, is standing in both Chorley and Fylde and will have to step down
from one of them after his dual victory, causing an immediate by-election.
'Standing in more than one constituency is legal, but representing more than
one isn't,' David Saunders, the candidate for Stockport told the media
audience of three in Manchester yesterday.
The 17 candidates on display declined to demonstrate yogic flying because
the carpeted floor at the Midland Hotel was considered too hard. World
harmony is too poor at present to allow anything more than what NLP members
call 'hopping'.
Saunders said people can take off all right, but they keep crashing down to
earth.
