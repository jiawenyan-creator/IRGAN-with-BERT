FT  13 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Building sector upset
News of the 1/2 percentage point increase in UK interest rates shocked the
building and property sectors of the market and caused marketmakers to lower
share prices in those groups to head off any selling pressure.
In the event there was no heavyweight selling in either sector. Shares
embarked on a modest rally later in the session, although they closed well
down on the day.
One leading marketmaker in building stocks said the sector had been under
substantial pressure last week when serious talk of possible interest rate
rises first began to circulate. 'Most of the selling was done then; if
anything, the rate rise has cleared the air,' he added.
Building sector analysts took the view that the market had mostly factored
in rate rises. Mr Simon Brown, building analyst at SGST Securities,
commented: 'The impact on the housebuilders will be more psychological than
actual. If anything it could tip prospective buyers over the edge. If they
think interest rates are going up they will want to move quickly to close
their mortgage arrangements.'
Analysts said the rate rise would have little impact on the big building
materials groups, which derive much of their earnings from overseas.
In the housebuilders, Barratt Developments plummeted to 191p before
steadying to close a net 14 off at 214p; the company reports interim figures
next Wednesday. Wilson Connolly dipped 8 to 203p and Wilson Bowden 11 to
397p.
Land Securities, the premier property stock in the UK market, fell 7 1/2 to
615 1/2 p, with a hefty 3.2m shares traded, and MEPC was 5 easier at 430p.
