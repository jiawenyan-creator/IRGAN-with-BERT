Christo Philipson is to succeed Michael Wates as chairman of BRITISH
BLOODSTOCK AGENCY in September. Philipson, 63, has been managing director
for 12 years and says that his key challenge will be to direct the agency's
affairs during a period when most of the main horse-racing countries are
hoping to shrug off recession.
BBA's four main interests are buying racehorses internationally, insurance,
the management and syndication of stallions, and transport. Bloodstock and
racing have been badly depressed of late, especially in Britain.
Peter Bickmore, who joined BBA three years ago when it bought Pegasus
Insurance Services, became managing director on April 1.

AEROSPACE ENGINEERING, the Swindon-based specialist engineer, has appointed
Ian Brodie, a 40-year old chartered accountant, as group finance director.
Brodie, a Scot, joins the company on March 31, succeeding John Ellison, who
will continue as director and company secretary. John Davis, the chairman,
explains that: 'In the present climate we thought that it would be a good
move to strengthen the financial side.'
In January, the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 271,000 for the
six months ended October 31, but Davis says the search for a finance
director began long before the announcement.
Brodie joins Aerospace Engineering from GEC Plessey Semiconductors, also in
Swindon.
