ROGER &amp; REALITY 
Peter Rainer's article is wonderful. He has clarified the tangle of issues, 
ideas, politics, aesthetics and emotions that emerged in the heated debate 
sparked by the film and he provides information and history on the documentary 
film. 
His is a very thoughtful and much-needed analysis.
