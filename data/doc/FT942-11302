FT  06 MAY 94 / Forecasting urged in property sector
The commercial property industry should develop formal forecasting models to
try to smooth out damaging fluctuations in the property market, says a Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors report.
The cycles in the commercial property industry damage the economy as a
whole, the report says. Owners, occupiers, lenders, borrowers, the
government and the public are affected by sharp declines in property values,
wasted investment in unwanted buildings and mistimed developments.
Although the property cycle feeds directly off the economic cycle,
additional instability in the property market arises from speculative
development. This is because market conditions can change substantially
between the decision to build a building and completion.
The RICS report recommends that the industry improve its timing and
information base. It should focus on 'how the speed of development responses
could be accelerated, how market signals could be read with greater
circumspection and how other ways of meeting occupier requirements, such as
custom building, could be encouraged'.
