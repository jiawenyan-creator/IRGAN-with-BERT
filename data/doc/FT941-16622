FT  08 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT and land
My wife and I own jointly a house and three acres of land, purchased in
1985, which is a registered agricultural holding and on which I have
sometimes kept livestock. The Revenue has records of this, albeit the
venture ran at a loss and was not my primary occupation.
The land has been allocated recently in the unitary development plan for
residential development and I would wish to mitigate any liability towards
capital gains tax.
1. Would roll-over relief be available into other agricultural premises?
2. When does the land assume an enhanced value: (a) when allocated; (b) when
the UDP is adopted formally? or (c) once planning permission is obtained
formally?
I am told the land will be adopted formally in around six months. Would
there be any benefit in any form of disposal at present - perhaps to buy a
pension for ourselves or to benefit our children?
1. The answer appears to be no, from the bare facts given. If the accountant
who prepared your farming accounts cannot help you on the tax aspects, you
could ask your solicitor (whose services you will need in any event, it
seems, when a sale is in prospect).
2. At every stage, there is an increase in hope value, generally speaking.
Financial planning really needs a face-to-face discussion with your
solicitor or another professional adviser. There is no useful comment that
we can offer without knowing far more background facts and figures than
could be supplied by post.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
