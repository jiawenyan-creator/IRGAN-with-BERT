Federal Register 

of Tuesday, December 20, 1994.

Description: As noted in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the public reporting burden for this collection of information
is expected to increase, based upon the Department's operating experience, from an average of one hour per response
to one and one-quarter hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing information/data
sources, gathering and maintaining the information/data needed, and preparing the application. The reporting
burden is expected to increase due to the proposed requirement that employers provide notice to H1B nonimmigrants
of the terms and conditions of employment. The employer will be required to attest that it has provided, or will provide,
to each H1B nonimmigrant a copy of the Labor Condition Application (LCA) under which they are employed no later
than the date the H1B nonimmigrant reports to work at the place of employment. This is the only amendment contained
in the final rule which is expected to increase the reporting burden per response.
Further, at the request of a number of commenters, boxes have been added to Item 7(e), ``Prevailing Wage Rate and Its
Source.'' If the employer is relying on a prevailing wage determination obtained from a State Employment Security
Agency (SESA), the employer will only be required to specify the rate and check the box marked ``SESA,'' as opposed
to writing the name of the agency. If the employer utilized some other source to determine the prevailing wage, the
employer must specify the rate, check the box marked ``Other,'' and specify such other source.
