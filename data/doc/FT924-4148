FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (4): Banks take a tough line -
Lenders are becoming more involved in the structure of the deal
FORGET about the venture capitalists and the other providers of equity
finance: the key to completing a buy-out nowadays is the banker.
The banks are still recovering from the losses and provisions they made on
some of the highly geared deals completed in the late 1980s and take a far
more cautious attitude to any lending secured on future cashflows rather
than more tangible assets.
'Banks are no longer competing for market share but rather are seeking
quality assets and good returns,' says Mr Anton Fawcett, head of buy-out
finance at Barclays Bank.
In the past banks would often allow a buy-out to breach lending covenants
only to see the equity provider walk away when the company's fortunes
continued to deteriorate. If the bank had pulled out when the terms of the
loan agreement were first breached it could have probably recovered all its
money, he says.
The result has been that banks are usually reluctant to lend more than half
of the value of the deal and they insist on interest cover of at least two
times from projected profits.
'It is still difficult to get debt in quantity on larger deals,' says Mr
Robert Smith, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell Development Capital.
Figures from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick show that the ratio of debt and
mezzanine finance to equity fell back to 1.3 to 1 in the first half of 1992
from 1.7 to 1 in the second half of 1991.
The decline from the peak of the buy-out market in 1989 is even more
pronounced. In the second half of that year the ratio was 5.9 to 1.
A more detailed break-down of debt structures carried out by the Nottingham
University Centre for Management Buy-Out Research showed that in smaller
deals, valued at under Pounds 10m, in the first half of 1992 equity and debt
each accounted for 44 per cent of total finance with the balance made up by
small amounts of mezzanine and loan notes.
In deals of more than Pounds 10m, equity accounted for 41 per cent and debt
for 38 per cent.
Growing familiarity with buy-outs has meant that the banks now look more
closely at projected cash flows and the interest cover ratio than at balance
sheet ratios.
This reduction in gearing has meant that the equity providers have had to
reduce their expectations of returns. Some are now starting to worry that
deals are 'under-geared'. The result is that even greater pressure is being
put on the venture capitalists to force down the price of deals. If vendors
will not go along with this then the deal will often not get done.
The role of mezzanine - high-yielding unsecured lending often with equity
conversion rights - has also been squeezed as deal prices have fallen.
Mezzanine came in to bridge the gap between what the equity houses were
willing to provide and bank lending in the 1980s but is now in less demand.
Slightly more mezzanine was used in the first half of 1992 than in 1991 but
over the past four years the trend has been downwards. 'Large deals still
need mezzanine but smaller deals can be put together with just equity and
debt,' says Mr Ian Forrest of Montagu Private Equity (formerly Midland
Montagu Ventures).
He also estimates that nearly 70 per cent of deals have some form of
participation by the vendor company.
'This can be more flexible than mezzanine from an independent institution,'
Mr Forrest says. But some other providers of buy-out finance take the view
that vendor loan notes complicate a deal, especially if something goes wrong
and more money is needed later.
What has become noticeable over the past year is an increased desire on the
part of the banks to involve themselves more closely in the terms of the
deal. This is not always welcomed by the equity providers.
'The bankers are trying to take over the deals,' says one venture
capitalist, who fought off an attempt by one bank to obtain a power of veto
of changes in the company's articles of memorandum.
The banks are acting tough because the shortage of debt finance puts them in
a stronger position and because they realise they needed to take a closer
interest in the deals they were backing.
In the early days the banks relied on the venture capitalist to carry out an
appraisal of the management and the company that they were backing.
'After one or two bad experiences we came to realise that this was a job we
could not delegate,' says Mr Fawcett. Barclays now often commissions a
survey of the market in which the buy-out will be operating as well as
carrying out a financial investigation of the company.
The banks have also grasped the opportunity to increase their interest
charges on buy-out lending and to push up their fees. They would aim for
around 2 per cent over base rate and 1.5 to 2 per cent in up-front fees
although they might not always achieve these levels.
In the longer term, some venture capitalists believe, the financial backers
of buy-outs will have to pay increasing attention to obtaining a running
yield on their investments as well as the capital gain on realisation.
This is because buy-outs are taking longer to reach an 'exit' than some
thought. Less than a quarter of the buy-outs completed between 1981 and 1991
have obtained an 'exit', according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out
Research.
'More deals will have a yield element,' says Mr Gordon MacLean, a director
of 3i. This is likely to lead to increased use of, for example, preference
share capital and will increase pressures on management to perform.
