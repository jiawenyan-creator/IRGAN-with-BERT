  [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (DPA) -- The country's 
teachers and public employees began staggered work stoppages 
today to demand raises and other benefits. The length of the 
stoppages will increase every day leading up to a total strike 
next Monday, Hugo Estrada, president of the National Association 
of Middle School Teachers, announced. 
  Teachers and public employees are joining a strike initiated 
several days ago by public health employees, including doctors 
and nurses. Because of this strike, state and Guatemalan Social 
Security hospitals are providing emergency services only, to the 
detriment of patients who now must go to private medical centers. 
  The state employees are demanding a 40-percent pay raise, 
although it is highly unlikely that Ramiro De Leon Carpio's 
administration can agree to it. Armando Sanchez, secretary 
general of the National Federation of State Workers Unions, 
stated that public employees will stand firm in their demands, 
because "we know the resources do exist to grant a wage 
increase."
