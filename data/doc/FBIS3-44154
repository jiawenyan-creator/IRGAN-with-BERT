  [Excerpts] The minister of external relations, Professor 
Mpinga Kassenda, today received the Congolese charge d'affaires 
in Zaire in order to brief him on the strong protest launched by 
Zaire against the activities of some Brazzaville gunmen who aim 
bullets and shells at Zaire. [passage omitted] 
  Prof. Mpinga Kassenda granted an audience to (George 
Kitokoma 
Futa), acting charge d'affaires of the Republic of Congo in 
Kinshasa. The meeting took place at 1300 [1200 GMT]. Its 
purpose was to register the Zairian Government's strong protest 
against the misunderstanding currently prevailing between 
Kinshasa and Brazzaville. 
  In a press release, the Ministry of External Relations 
informed both the public and international community that during 
the night of 23 January, shells fired from Brazzaville, the 
capital of the Republic of Congo, fell on various spots in the 
city of Kinshasa, especially at Camp Tshatshi. These missiles 
caused very serious material damage. The projectiles injured 
five persons, two of them seriously, because they landed on two 
homes. The Congolese diplomat was asked to inform his government 
about this incident and ask it to immediately take appropriate 
measures to ensure that these acts, which run the risk of 
compromising relations between the two countries, are not 
repeated.
