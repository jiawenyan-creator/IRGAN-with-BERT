FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Postel Investment Management drops US
venture capital link
POSTEL Investment Management, one of Britain's largest institutional
investors, has dropped plans to establish a European venture capital fund
jointly with a US investment company.
Postel, which has Pounds 20bn under management, and Chancellor Capital
Management, a New York-based money management company, have dissolved their
joint venture after failing to reach their minimum fund-raising target of
Dollars 100m (Pounds 70m). Postel was to have provided Dollars 20m of this.
When the project was announced a little less than two years ago it was
hailed as a significant departure for Postel, which has venture and
development capital investments worth Pounds 300m on behalf of the Post
Office and British Telecommunications pension funds. Postel had not
previously managed funds for third party investors.
Chancellor, which led the US fund-raising drive, decided in December that
there was no point in continuing, said Mr Ray Maxwell, venture capital
manager for Postel.
'It was a disappointment,' he said. 'We were over in the US every month in
1992 fund-raising. This sends a rather disturbing message to the European
venture capital community. The Americans have been disappointed with the
results of their investments in Europe.'
The reasons for the failure were a combination of poor economic news from
Europe, currency uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate mechanism and a
change in the attitude of US institutions towards investing indirectly
through venture capital funds.
Chancellor's fund-raising may also have suffered because another large
international fund, launched by Hancock Venture Partners, went to market
first.
