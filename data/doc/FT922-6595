FT  22 MAY 92 / Observer: Life of leisure
Look out Glyndebourne. A rival rural opera house will soon be springing up
in north-east England, if Northumberland miner's son Sir John Hall has
anything to do with it.
The man who turned 120 acres of wet ashes into Gateshead's MetroCentre will
retire from his Cameron Hall Developments company on reaching 60 next March,
handing over to his 33-year-old son Douglas.
'It's very difficult to step down when you have been in power for so long,
but I've made a decision - I've done nothing else but work since I was 16,'
he said from Lisbon.
But what he means to do as a sexagenarian might perhaps not strike everyone
as leisure.
Only part of his plan is the 'northern Glyndebourne', surrounded by what is
intended to be one of England's best gardens. It will be built at his home
Wynyard - the 144-year-old mansion on the Durham/Cleveland border, which he
bought in 1987 from the former coal barons, the Londonderry family.
Another project is to write the story of MetroCentre, still Europe's biggest
out-of-town shopping and leisure complex, which was sold to the Church
Commissioners five years ago.
Meanwhile, Hall will continue as chairman of Newcastle United football club
which, despite its troubles, he intends to expand into the 'greatest soccer
academy in Europe'. On the side, he'll also do consulting for Cameron Hall
and give some backstage help to the Tory party.
