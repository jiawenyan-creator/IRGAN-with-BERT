<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 'Arafat's </F>
political, adviser, in Gaza, by Ya'aqov Ahime'ir from the weekly 
"Popolitiqa" talk show -- live, in English] 
  [Excerpts] [Ahime'ir] In a few years you will learn to 
read the Hebrew press, the Hebrew newspapers in Israel, but 
maybe you saw the headline of the newspaper YEDI'OT AHARONOT 
speaking about Saudi pressure on 'Arafat. The item says that 
'Arafat will have no control over the holy places, the sacred 
placed in Jerusalem. What is your reaction to this news? 
  [Sha'th] No, I really have no evidence at all that there is 
Saudi pressure on us to do anything. The Saudis are gradually 
building up their support for us. You know, after the Gulf war 
there was a period of strained relations and now they have come 
back to be supporters, and really increasing to a great extent 
and improving their relations with us. 
  [Ahime'ir] I see. Do they assist you financially? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, in the last Paris meeting they gave us $10 
million for the urgent recurrent expenses and they have already 
raised their level of contribution to $62 million for this year. 
  [Ahime'ir] Dr. Sha'th, do you think that all the Arabs, all 
the Muslims in the Muslim, world agree that 'Arafat will have 
control on the holy places in Jerusalem, Christian and Islamic 
sites in Jerusalem? 
  [Sha'th] The Christian and Islamic sites in Jerusalem are, 
of course, important for all Muslims and Christians in the 
world. But, once there is going to be a Palestinian 
responsibility in East Jerusalem, that responsibility should and 
will include protection of these holy sites. During the years, 
1,000 years or more of Muslim control of these areas, both 
Christian and Muslim sites were protected by whoever ruled 
Jerusalem. 
  [Ahime'ir] And not necessarily by 'Arafat or by the PLO. 
  [Sha'th] Well, the PLO will have control of East Jerusalem 
only when, after the permanent negotiations, it will be agreed 
to do so. If as a result of the permanent negotiations there 
will be an independent Palestinian state and East Jerusalem its 
capital, then he will have full control. But this is now 
awaiting the permanent settlement. [passage omitted] 
  [Ahime'ir] Mr. Sha'th, when will Chairman 'Arafat arrive in 
Jericho or in Gaza? 
  [Sha'th] This is one of those difficult things to predict. 
He has kept it up till now a secret. I really don't know. I 
think he probably, I am sure, will tell us a few days before his 
arrival so that everybody will prepare. But, up till now he has 
not given that signal. 
  [Ahime'ir] Do you think that he will come to Jericho or to 
Gaza this month? 
  [Sha'th] I had been predicting so. In fact, I have been 
telling people that, but this might not happen. It all depends 
on his schedule. 
  [Ahime'ir] My last question: When do you personally expect 
to visit Jerusalem? 
  [Sha'th] Well, I want to come to Jerusalem as soon as 
possible. I don't want my coming to Jerusalem to be a problem 
to anybody. This visit is of a highly personal nature. I think 
Jerusalem is the most beautiful city in the world and I would 
like to come and see it again. I have not been in Jerusalem 
since 1948 actually, and I have so many friends to visit. I 
would like to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque, but I'll do it in due 
course. [passage omitted]
