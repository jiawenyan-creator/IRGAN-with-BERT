FT  28 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo
Weakness on the Tokyo stock market last week prompted hopes of lower
short-term interest rates and the 10-year benchmark bond fell almost 10
basis points to close at 4.64 per cent on Friday.
While the Bank of Japan is unlikely to lower short-term rates to support
share prices, further weakness in the stock market will boost confidence in
the bond market. Economic indicators this week should also reinforce the
view that bond yields have discounted too much of an economic rebound.
'Data released over the remaining weeks of 1994 will continue to bolster
market sentiment,' forecasts Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. It notes that
yields in the secondary market on Industrial Bank of Japan debentures have
already started declining.
While industrial production figures for October, to be released on
Wednesday, may show a slight month-on-month rise, labour figures for the
same month and retail sales data from large stores, to be released on
Tuesday, are likely to indicate weak support for the economy by consumers.
The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged from September at 3
per cent, while retail sales are expected to fall by around 2.5 per cent.
The small enterprise index, which shows sentiment among small business
owners, is also expected to be weak.
