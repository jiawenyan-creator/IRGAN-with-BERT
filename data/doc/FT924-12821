FT  19 OCT 92 / Construction Contracts: Motorway safety and lighting
projects
EDMUND NUTTALL has been awarded a motorway lane rental contract by
Buckinghamshire County Council, as agent for the Department of Transport,
with a value of over Pounds 5m.
Spread over 23 kilometres of the M1 motorway through Buckinghamshire and
into Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire, the scheme runs from Junction 13 to
a point 10 kilometres north of the Newport Pagnell service area. The
contract combines nine kilometres of central reservation hardening with
about 170,000 sq metres of wearing course replacement.
Included in the contract work is the upgrading of the motorway lighting
system with a total of 182 lighting columns to be erected.
Edmund Nuttall completed a similar lighting contract on the Ml/M6 for
Leicestershire County Council earlier in the year.
Another interesting feature of the contract will be the quantity of safety
barrier. At almost 20,000 linear metres of open box beam, the subcontract
will be one of the largest barrier contracts in the country this year.
Supervising the contract will be Buckinghamshire County Engineer's
Department, and work is due to start in October.
Edmund Nuttall is an operating company of the European construction group
HBC, Hollandsche Beton Croep nv.
