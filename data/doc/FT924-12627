FT  20 OCT 92 / EC law 'will push up building costs'
THE construction industry faces extra costs of Pounds 550m a year to comply
with European legislation which will make clients and architects jointly
responsible with contractors for building site safety for the first time in
UK law, the Health and Safety Commission said yesterday.
The commission said the regulations would reduce accidents by 33 per cent
generally and by 20 per cent on larger, safer sites. It published a
consultative document on the legislation, which must be implemented by the
end of next year.
That would benefit the industry by Pounds 220m a year, based on the 1991
industry output of about Pounds 37bn. The industry will also benefit from a
reduction in ill-health.
The construction industry employs 10 per cent of all European workers and
accounts for 30 per cent of all fatal accidents at work. In Britain, there
were 133 deaths in construction and 3,961 serious injuries reported from
April 1990 to March 1991.
Mr Stewart Campbell, head of the policy section of the Health and Safety
Executive - the enforcement arm of the commission, said: 'The legislation is
designed to aid safety co-ordination in a fragmented industry which has
moved towards many subcontractors on site and lots of self-employment over
the last 10 years'.
The two main areas of additional cost will be the responsibility of
architects to ensure designs do not endanger building workers, and the
responsibility of clients to appoint a planning supervisor and principal
contractor to produce a health and safety plan. The regulations are likely
to affect small, poorly managed contractors worst. Safety standards in the
better-run companies already reflect the regulations and they will incur
little cost, the HSC says.
