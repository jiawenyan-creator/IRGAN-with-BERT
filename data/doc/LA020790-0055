WORLD IN BRIEF; 
NEW ZEALAND; 
MAORI ACTIVISTS HECKLE THE QUEEN 
Radicals campaigning for Maori rights heckled Queen Elizabeth II in New Zealand 
during celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of a treaty between Maori 
chiefs and British colonial authorities. 
One young woman was arrested for throwing a T-shirt at the British monarch. The 
queen, accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, appeared shaken by the 
incident in Waitangi. Maoris are descendants of Polynesians who arrived in what 
is now New Zealand more than 1,000 years ago. Radicals say New Zealand 
governments have not honored the treaty, which guaranteed them possession of 
their lands.
