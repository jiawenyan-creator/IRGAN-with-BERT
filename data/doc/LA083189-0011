SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Police Wednesday were investigating eight other possible incidents of child 
molestation that may have been committed by three Linda Vista men already 
accused of molesting an 11-year-old boy, according to a police spokesman. 
Terry Fallis, 52, Stephen Brady, 33, and William Huggins, 57, all of the 6500 
block of Lanston Street, were arrested Tuesday, Sgt. George Guevara said. 
They were held in the downtown County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail each on 
suspicion of child molestation; using force, fear and intimidation; oral 
copulation; penetration with a foreign object and sexual exploitation, Guevara 
said. They are to be arraigned today. 
At least eight other parents contacted police about possible abuse involving 
their children after learning of the arrest of the three men, Guevara said. "I 
know there will be . . . some more charges, but I don't know how many," Guevara 
said. 
Police confiscated sexually explicit photos of boys when they made the arrests. 
Police said Brady and Fallis worked as private investigators, and Huggins was a 
free-lance photographer.
