FT  21 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
So much for the UK's post-election boom. Yesterday's retail sales figures
confirmed anecdotal and survey evidence suggesting consumers hardly rushed
to the shops following the Tory victory. Perhaps the odd bottle of champagne
boosted the food sector. Clothing and footwear were up, but a drop of 1.4
per cent in household goods sales was disappointing. Even though the effect
of Budget tax cuts and lower interest rates will be felt from this month,
there is not much sign of the consumer-led recovery which Mr Norman Lamont
now urgently needs to meet his modest forecast of 1 per cent growth this
year.
