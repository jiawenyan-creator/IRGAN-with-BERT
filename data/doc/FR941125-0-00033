 



Pleodendron macranthum 

is an evergreen tree reaching 10 meters (33 feet) in height, with leathery, alternate, simple leaves about 8.512.5
centimeters (3.55.0 inches) long and 4.55.0 centimeters (1.72 inches) wide. The blades are
elliptic with the upper surface dark shiny green and the midvein sunken. The lower surface is pale green with a prominent
mid vein and with fine, parallel side veins. The leaf stalks are about 7 millimeters (.25 inch) long. The whitish bisexual
flowers are solitary and axillary, 2 centimeters (.8 inch) wide and with a 2.5 centimeter (1 inch) long flower stalk.
The cup-shaped calyx is persistent in the fruit, and the corolla contains 12 petals. The aromatic purplish black fruit
measures 2 centimeters (.8 inch) in diameter and contains many seeds. 
No observation or collection of the species was made for more than 40 years (Vivaldi et al. 1981). The species was rediscovered
some years ago, and is at present known from fewer than 50 individuals in 7 localities of the subtropical wet and the
subtropical montane wet forests of northern and eastern Puerto Rico. Three localities are within the Caribbean National
Forest and four within the Rio Abajo Commonwealth Forest. All the known sites may be impacted by forest management
practices. The Caribbean National Forest was severely impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. 


Previous Federal Action 




Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

are considered to be critical plants by the Natural Heritage Program of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.
They are also considered rare plants by the Center for Plant Conservation (Center for Plant Conservation 1992). 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

were recommended for Federal listing by the Smithsonian Institution (Ayensu and DeFilipps 1978). 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

were included among the plants being considered as endangered or threatened by the Service, as published in the 

Federal Register

 notice of review dated December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480); the November 28, 1983 update (48 FR 53680), the revised notice
of September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526), and the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184) notice of review. In the 1990 notice, both
species were designated as category 1 (species for which the Service has substantial information supporting the
appropriateness of proposing to list them as endangered or threatened). 
In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6752), the Service reported the earlier acceptance of the new taxa in the Smithsonian's
1978 book as under petition within the context of section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1982. Beginning in October
1983, and in each October thereafter, the Service made annual findings that listing 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions of a higher priority, and that additional data on vulnerability
and threats were still being gathered. A proposed rule to list 

Eugenia haematocarpa, Pleodendron macranthum 

and one other species, published on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49960), constituted the final 1-year finding in accordance
with section 4(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act. 
The proposal to list 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

also included the proposed listing of 

Coccoloba rugosa 

as threatened. After the proposed rule comment period had closed, the Service received information from a private
consulting firm indicating the discovery of additional populations of 

Coccoloba rugosa 

and questioning the appropriateness of protecting the species under the Act. The Service has not been able to fully
verify the new population data and will need additional time to conduct further surveys. This will likely take several
months and cannot be completed in time for the usual 12-month deadline established by the Act for completing action
on a proposed rule. The Act provides for a 6-month extension if there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency
or accuracy of the available data relevant to a final determination on a proposed listing. The Service finds there
is substantial disagreement with regard to the population status of 

Coccoloba rugosa 

and, therefore, is extending the deadline for a final decision on this species. A notice to extend the deadline is published
in the proposed rule section of today's 

Federal Register

. 


Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the September 24, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to
submit factual reports of information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate agencies
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Federal agencies, scientific organizations and other interested parties were
contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting general public comment was published in the ``San
Juan Star'' on October 10, 1993. Three letters of comment were received, one supported the listing, the other two provided
information but did not indicate either support or opposition.
