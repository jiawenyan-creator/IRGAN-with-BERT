Determination of amount and character of loss on sale. 


Assume that E sells the debt instrument for $900 on January 1, 
1998. On that date, E has an adjusted basis in the debt 
instrument of $935 ($1,000 original basis, plus total daily 
portions of $100 for 1996 and $110 for 1997, minus the $275 
projected amount of the December 31, 1997 payment). Because E 
has no other adjustments for 1998, and E's interest inclusions on 
the debt instrument in prior taxable years do not exceed the 
total net negative adjustments E treated as ordinary loss in 
those years, the $65 negative adjustment on January 1, 1998, 
results in a negative adjustment carryforward of $65 for 1998. 
Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, the $65 
negative adjustment carryforward reduces the amount E realizes on 
the sale of the debt instrument from $900 to $835. As a result, 
E realizes a $100 loss on the sale of the debt instrument (the 
difference between the amount realized and E's adjusted basis in 
the debt instrument). Because E's total interest inclusions on 
the debt instrument do not exceed the total net negative 
adjustments E treated as ordinary loss on the debt instrument, 
E's loss on the sale of the debt instrument is treated as a 
capital loss. 



(9) 

Operating rules. 

The rules of this paragraph (b)(9) notwithstanding any other rule of this paragraph (b). 
(i) 

Basis different than adjusted issue price. 

This 
paragraph (b)(9)(i) provides rules for a holder whose basis in a 
debt instrument is different than the adjusted issue price of the 
debt instrument (e.g., a subsequent holder that purchases the 
debt instrument for more or less than the instrument's adjusted 
issue price). 
(A) 

General rule. 

A holder whose basis in a debt instrument 
is different than the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument 
accrues interest under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and 
makes adjustments under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section 
based on the projected payment schedule determined as of the 
issue date of the debt instrument. However, upon acquiring the 
debt instrument, the holder must reasonably allocate any 
difference between the adjusted issue price and the basis to 
daily portions of interest or projected payments over the 
remaining term of the debt instrument. Allocations are taken 
into account under paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(B) and (C) of this 
section. 
(B) 

Basis greater than adjusted issue price. 

If a holder's 
basis in a debt instrument exceeds the debt instrument's adjusted 
issue price, the amount allocated to a daily portion of interest 
or to a projected payment is treated as a negative adjustment on 
the date the daily portion accrues or the payment is made. The 
holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is reduced by the 
amount the holder treats as a negative adjustment under this 
paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B). 
(C) 

Basis less than adjusted issue price. 

If a holder's 
basis in a debt instrument is less than the debt instrument's 
adjusted issue price, the amount allocated to a daily portion of 
interest or to a projected payment is treated as a positive 
adjustment on the date the daily portion accrues or the payment 
is made. The holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is 
increased by the amount the holder treats as a positive 
adjustment under this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(C). 
(D) 

Premium and discount rules do not apply. 

The rules for 
accruing premium and discount in sections 171, 1272(a)(7), 1276, 
and 1281 do not apply. Other rules of those sections continue to 
apply to the extent relevant. 
(E) 

Safe harbor for exchange listed debt instruments. 

If a 
contingent payment debt instrument is exchange listed property 
(within the meaning of 1.12732(f)(2)), it is reasonable for a 
holder of the debt instrument to allocate any difference between 
the holder's basis and the adjusted issue price of the debt 
instrument pro-rata to daily portions of interest (as determined 
under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) over the remaining 
term of the debt instrument. 
(F) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section. In each 
example, assume that the debt instrument described is a debt 
instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is 
intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes 
a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. In addition, 
assume that each debt instrument is not exchange listed property. 





Example 1. Basis greater than adjusted issue price

_(i) 
Facts. On July 1, 1997, Z purchases for $1,405 a debt instrument 
that matures on December 31, 1998, and promises to pay on the 
maturity date $1,000 plus the increase, if any, in the price of a 
specified amount of a commodity from the issue date to the 
maturity date. The debt instrument was originally issued on 
January 1, 1996, for an issue price of $1,000. Z is a calendar 
year taxpayer. The projected payment schedule for the debt 
instrument (determined as of the issue date) provides for a 
single payment at maturity of $1,350. Thus, the debt instrument 
has a projected yield of 10.25 percent, compounded semiannually. 
At the time of the purchase, the debt instrument has an adjusted 
issue price of $1,162, assuming semiannual accrual periods ending 
on December 31 and June 30 of each year. The increase in the 
value of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price is due 
to an increase in the expected amount of the contingent payment 
and not to a decrease in market interest rates. 
(ii) 

Allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted 
issue price. 

Z's basis in the debt instrument on July 1, 1997, 
is $1,405. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, Z 
allocates the $243 difference between basis ($1,405) and adjusted 
issue price ($1,162) to the contingent payment at maturity. Z's 
allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted issue 
price is reasonable because the increase in the value of the debt 
instrument over its adjusted issue price is due to an increase in 
the expected amount of the contingent payment. 
(iii) 

Treatment of debt instrument for 1997. 

Based on the 
projected payment schedule, $60 of interest accrues on the debt 
instrument from July 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997 (the product of 
the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on July 1, 1997 
($1,162) and the projected yield properly adjusted for the length 
of the accrual period (10.25 percent/2)). Z has no net negative 
or positive adjustments for 1997. Thus, Z includes in income $60 
of total daily portions of interest for 1997. On December 31, 
1997, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,465 ($1,405 
original basis, plus total daily portions of $60 for 1997). 
(iv) 

Effect of allocation to contingent payment at maturity. 


Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1998, is 
$1,400, rather than the projected $1,350. Under paragraph 
(b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a positive adjustment of $50 on 
December 31, 1998. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, 
Z has a negative adjustment of $243 on December 31, 1998. As a 
result, Z has a net negative adjustment of $193 for 1998. This 
net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $128 total daily 
portions of interest Z would otherwise include in income in 1998. 
Accordingly, Z has no interest income on the debt instrument for 
1998. Because Z had $60 of interest inclusions for 1997, $60 of 
the remaining $65 net negative adjustment is treated by Z as an 
ordinary loss for 1998. The remaining $5 of the net negative 
adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1998 that 
reduces the amount realized by Z on the retirement of the debt 
instrument from $1,350 to $1,345.
