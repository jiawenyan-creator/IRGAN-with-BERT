FT  25 JAN 94 / Life groups asked to detail exposure
The Department of Trade and Industry has told life companies to make the
best estimate they can of their exposure resulting from mis-selling of
personal pensions to individuals leaving occupational pension schemes.
Debate has focused on concern about mis-selling to people transferring out
of schemes where they had already left the company. However, the DTI wants
also to be certain about life insurers' exposure on sales of private
pensions to people who opted out of schemes where they were still employed.
It has asked the companies to deliver their estimates by the end of the
month.
Although the number of 'opt-outs' is much smaller than the estimated 500,000
pension transfers, in cases where there is a need for compensation,
individual payments are likely to be much higher.
The DTI inquiry is directed at establishing whether the exposure of any life
company threatens its solvency.
The department has advised life companies that where they are likely to have
a liability, this should be recognised either in the mathematical reserves
or in the provisions made in the accounts. Different methods will be
appropriate for different types of company and the business they write.
Companies must file returns within six months of the year-end to the DTI.
Where a specific provision for mis-selling does not appear in a life
office's returns to the DTI or in its accounts the company must provide it
separately to the department.
Both the DTI and the life industry recognise that this first estimate is
bound to contain several uncertainties.
TSB earlier this month made what it called 'prudent' provisions - estimated
to be no more than Pounds 10m - for possible compensation payments to its
55,000 pension transfer customers.
