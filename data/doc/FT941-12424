FT  31 JAN 94 / Top executives criticise government
Many of the senior businessmen who wrote to The Times before the 1992
election to support the Conservatives have doubts about the government's
record. They also feel its policies are poorly presented and that Mr John
Major, the prime minister, lacks authority.
Twenty-two of the 43 executives who signed the letter in March 1992 were
contacted by the FT. Ten of them expressed serious doubts about the
government's grip on policy or said their confidence in ministers had
fallen.
Many said Mr Major should be given credit for helping the UK pull clear of
recession. However, several said his leadership qualities were in doubt.
