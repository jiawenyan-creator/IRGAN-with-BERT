  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- Strengthening 
Hungarian-Albanian ties is a mutual interest, Hungarian 
President Arpad Goncz told Albanian President Sali Berisha, who 
travelled through Hungary to Romania, today. Hungary and 
Albania have no conflicting interests, and the two peoples share 
a centuries-old friendship, Goncz said. The brief talk focussed 
on the Balkan crisis and the state of the Albanian minority in 
Serbia and Montenegro, Andras Farago, President Goncz's 
spokesman said. 
  Goncz stressed the need for a comprehensive solution in the 
region, which would settle the situation of all ethnic 
minorities. 
  The sides exchanged views on the Albanian-Hungarian basic 
treaty, investment protection agreement, and internal security 
treaty to be concluded. Both sides appreciated the agreement on 
the elimination of double taxation which was signed previously. 
  Finally, President Berisha said Hungary's peaceful 
transition 
and transformation set Albania an example. He hoped that the 
Hungarian president would soon visit Albania.
