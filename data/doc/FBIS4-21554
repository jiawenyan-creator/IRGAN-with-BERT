  [Excerpt] There have been new artillery-infantry attacks on 
the defenders' lines on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin 
Vrh, and the Bihac part of the front. The hundreds of howitzer, 
mortar, and tank shells that have landed on parts of the defense 
lines and the shelling of Cazin, Bihac, and the surrounding 
areas this afternoon mark the 43d day of the Serbian aggressor's 
offensives on the Bihac region. 
  Our defenders are heroically resisting the wolves from Mount 
Ozren who have again arrived on the Bihac front. The fact that 
they used chemical agents in attacks today sufficiently 
illustrates the behavior by Karadzic's terrorists. When they 
failed to break the defenders' resistance, they turned against 
city districts. Substantial material damage was caused in Cazin. 
Some civilians were wounded, but fortunately no one was killed. 
  In addition, the rage by Abdic's paramilitary has continued 
in the border areas of the Cazin municipality. The targets of 
secessionists' attacks are the same ones they have been 
mercilessly destroying and torching since last night. They are 
also killing domestic animals and expelling people. A large 
number of refugees from these areas, especially from Krivaja, 
Liskovac, and (?Trzac), arrived in Cazin today. [passage omitted]
