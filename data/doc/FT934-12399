FT  27 OCT 93 / Petrol retailers contest contracts
INDEPENDENT petrol station owners yesterday demanded big changes to their
contracts with leading oil companies because of growing competition from
discount outlets, particularly those at supermarkets.
The Petrol Retailers Association said failure to reach an agreement on new
terms could lead it to call for an investigation by the Office of Fair
Trading or the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Phil Richardson, association president, said the problem stemmed from the
fact that, under current contracts, large oil companies exercised a high
degree of control over the prices retailers can set for branded petrol.
He said some oil companies had responded quickly to fierce competition from
supermarkets by lowering prices. In most cases the effect of lower margins
for retailers had been lessened or offset by higher volumes. But other
companies had maintained margins at individual retailers, even though nearby
discount outlets might have been selling petrol at 5p per litre less, Mr
Richardson said.
In such circumstances retailers had reported sales volumes falling by as
much as 40 per cent, he said, meaning that they could only 'go out of
business quickly or go bust slowly'.
Mr Bruce Petter, association director, said big oil companies had listened
to their complaints with 'sympathy'. But if 'no remedies emerge we would
very reluctantly' have to look for relief from the competition authorities.
The retailers want a force majeure clause added to supply contracts enabling
them to buy petrol from oil companies other than the one to which they are
contracted if the original supplier was 'unable or unwilling to supply at
competitive rates'.
Shell UK last night expressed sympathy for retailers, but 'categorically
denied' that its pricing policy was 'a form of pump price controls'.
