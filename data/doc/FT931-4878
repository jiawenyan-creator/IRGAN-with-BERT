FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Perkins Foods hit by interest turnround
THE GLUT of fresh produce last year and a swing to interest payable cut 1992
pre-tax profits at Perkins Foods by 8.7 per cent to Pounds 22.1m.
However, the final dividend goes up 0.1p to 2.7p, bringing the total to 4.4p
(4.3p). The shares rose 7p to 105p.
Group sales rose 36 per cent to Pounds 353.8m, of which only Pounds 9.2m
came from acquisitions as takeover activity has subsided. Operating profits
were ahead 10.7 per cent at Pounds 23.8m, with Pounds 600,000 coming from
acquisitions.
Mr Howard Phillips, chief executive, said the group had integrated
acquisitions and focused on seven business groups, although it reports
results in four divisions.
An interest charge of Pounds 1.7m compared with receivable of Pounds 2.7m as
sterling cash balances attracted lower interest rates and overseas borrowing
costs rose. Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said gearing was 34 per
cent, up from 12 per cent, if the D-Mark convertible loan notes are counted
as debt.
The frozen food division increased operating profits by 33 per cent to
Pounds 14.2m, but this included a Pounds 1.2m insurance payment.
In chilled foods, the only division to achieve organic profit growth,
profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 4.8m, but this was after a Pounds 1.4m
provision covering the closure of a factory.
Fresh produce profits fell from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 6.7m, although Mr
Phillips said this was a better result than many competitors had achieved.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 11.9p to 9.7p.
COMMENT
Perkins share price has recovered from last year's fall. The group has done
much to allay concerns about the fresh produce division, the lack of
integration of rather hastily acquired businesses, and the balance sheet.
Deferred consideration on acquisitions is beginning to tail off, with Pounds
8.3m paid in 1992 out of a potential Pounds 11m, and a maximum of Pounds
4.3m due in 1993 and another Pounds 5.1m possible over the next four years.
The fall in sterling still raises doubts about the D-Mark convertibles, at
least in the most cynical minds, but the group believes it can cover their
redemptions from D-Mark cashflows if necessary. Forecasts are for a bounce
back to profits of Pounds 25m this year giving a p/e under 10. The historic
yield is still attractive at 5.6 per cent.
