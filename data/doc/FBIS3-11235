  [Text] Certain Voting Table Boards are expelling poll 
watchers [vigilantes] from the premises, an act that goes 
against the law. The poll watchers have been appointed 
specifically to observe the vote count and even vouch for its 
authenticity with their signature, if required. 
  I repeat: Poll watchers cannot be removed from voting sites. 
This is a tremendous mistake that may result in any party that 
may suffer from this filing an appeal for annulment. This is 
taking place in the Republica de Brasil School and the Manuel 
Jose Arce Institute. They have even gone as far as to try to 
expel the press from those premises.
