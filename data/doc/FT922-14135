FT  08 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
LONDON Metal Exchange
ALUMINIUM prices moved to the highest levels for nine months in after hours
trading, although dealers could point to no clear fundamental influences.
They attributed the rise, which took the three months position to Dollars
1,350.50 a tonne, up Dollars 27, at the end of the 'kerb' session, chiefly
to speculative and options-related activity. Early selling had been halted
after news that LME warehouse stocks had risen less than expected. COPPER
prices surrendered early gains, with the cash position ending the kerb at
Pounds 1,309.25 a tonne, down Pounds 3.25. Traders noted, however, that it
had held above support at Dollars 2,250 a tonne. At the London Futures and
Options Exchange COFFEE market sentiment was improved by news that the
International Coffee Organisation working group had reported a consensus in
favour of a price stabilisation pact with universal quotas and that its
report had been approved by the ICO council. In the absence of early news
from the ICO's 5-day meeting in London the July futures price had slipped
Dollars 13 to Dollars 870 a tonne. But it closed only Dollars 1 down on the
day at Dollars 882.
