FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Private bids invited as Italian
catering group rejects offers
The sale of Italy's state-controlled supermarket and catering businesses -
part of the dismembered SME group - has been opened to private offers after
two consortia bids were rejected.
Iri, the state holding company, did not specify why the offers were
unacceptable. But in a statement issued late on Wednesday night after a
board meeting, the company said any of the original potential buyers -
including those which did not lodge a formal offer - could renew their
interest by Monday.
Iri said it hoped to conclude negotiations for the purchase of the GS
supermarkets and Autogrill catering business by October 20.
Both consortia interested in the sale had already suffered setbacks. Pam,
the privately-owned Italian retailer, decided to pull out of its agreement
with Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's holding company, and Movenpick,
the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, at the last moment.
Pam, which could now put in an offer for part of GS-Autogrill, was replaced
in the consortium by Crediop, the investment finance subsidiary of the
banking group San Paolo di Torino.
The other consortium consisted of La Rinascente, the quoted Italian
retailer, Ferrero, the Italian confectionery group, and FinComit, the
merchant banking operation of Banca Commerciale Italiana. In an earlier form
it also included Centromarca, an alliance of Italian consumer brands.
Financial advisers have already criticised the Italian authorities for the
structure of the GS-Autogrill sale, the final part of the tortuous break-up
and privatisation of SME.
Last year, Iri had to abandon a first attempt to sell GS-Autogrill - valued
at more than L2,000bn - because it received inadequate offers.
Iri has successfully used the tactic of private negotiations before in
selling off specialised parts of the state-owned steel industry.
