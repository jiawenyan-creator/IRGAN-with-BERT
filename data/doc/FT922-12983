FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Salary of GM chief cut 30% to
Dollars 1m
MR Robert Stempel, embattled chairman of struggling US car manufacturer
General Motors, saw his salary cut by 30 per cent to Dollars 1m last year in
the wake of the company's Dollars 7bn operating loss.
The cut in salary means Mr Stempel has not enjoyed a pay rise in all his
three years at the helm of the country's biggest car producer.
According to proxy statements released by GM yesterday, Mr Stempel was not
alone in suffering a big pay cut. The company's seven most senior executives
together earned Dollars 4.4m in 1991, down sharply from the Dollars 7.5m
they earned in 1990, and less than half the Dollars 11.3m they made in 1990.
The revelation of Mr Stempel's pay cut comes just a few days after a 'palace
coup' at GM which reduced his power within the company. In a stunning move
on April 6, GM's non-executive directors, impatient at the pace of change
within the company, ousted Mr Stempel from his position as chairman of the
company's key executive committee.
