FT  04 FEB 92 / London heliport site search resumes
Searching high and low: the hunt for a site for a central London heliport
took off again yesterday when the government announced a 12-month study of
the possibilities, Daniel Green writes.
The last proposal for a heliport, to be sited in the City beside the Thames,
was blocked by the government on the ground that the environmental
disadvantages outweighed the benefits.
The Confederation of British Industry said yesterday that London needed a
heliport to maintain its role as a leading financial centre.
The study, announced by Lord Brabazon of Tara, the aviation minister, will
be conducted by government departments, the Civil Aviation Authority, the
helicopter industry and London planning bodies.
