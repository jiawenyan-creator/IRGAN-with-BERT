MOON PASSES OILERS TO VICTORY, 24-10; 
AFC: HOUSTON QUARTERBACK BECOMES CLUB'S ALL-TIME LEADING PASSER IN WIN OVER 
COLTS, ECLIPSING HALL OF FAMER GEORGE BLANDA. 
Quarterback Warren Moon produced a record-setting performance and finally got 
the Houston Oilers' run-and-shoot offense operating efficiently Sunday against 
the Indianapolis Colts. 
After two games filled with mistakes, Moon threw for three touchdowns and 
became the Oilers' all-time leading passer during a 24-10 victory. 
Moon completed 29 of 39 passes for 308 yards and connected on touchdown pass 
plays of 13 and seven yards to Lorenzo White and six yards to Ernest Givins. He 
threw one interception. 
"Really, we needed a win more than I needed to set any kind of records," said 
Moon, a seven-year veteran who now has 19,289 career passing yards, erasing the 
record of 19,149 set by former Oiler quarterback George Blanda. "All this means 
is I've had good receivers and I've been here a long time." 
After both teams spent the first quarter victimizing themselves with mistakes, 
Moon went to White for his touchdowns and a 14-0 halftime lead. 
"We got things going in the second quarter, and that's what we needed," Oiler 
Coach Jack Pardee said. 
The Oilers (1-2) took advantage of four first-half turnovers by the Colts 
(0-3), including fumbles by Jack Trudeau and Clarence Verdin and interceptions 
of passes thrown by Jeff George and Trudeau. 
"We had our chances, and we constantly stopped ourselves," Colt Coach Ron Meyer 
said. 
Trudeau replaced George in the second quarter when George was bothered by a 
stomach ailment. 
But Meyer had to send George back into the game in the final minutes after 
Trudeau and Mark Herrmann were injured. 
The CBS-TV affiliate in Indianapolis reported Meyer and offensive coordinator 
Larry Kennan might be fired, but Colt General Manager Jim Irsay called the 
report erroneous.
