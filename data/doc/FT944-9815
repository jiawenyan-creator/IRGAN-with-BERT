FT  14 NOV 94 / Observer: Playing a joker
Hope that Christopher Walford, the new Lord Mayor of London, is not as
eccentric as some of his predecessors.
Walford, a partner in Allen &amp; Overy's corporate practice, is the first
master of the Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards to make it to
the Mansion House. The only other master of the company to make such a
splash was Albert Altman who was chairman of the Bridge House Estates
committee when the Prince of Wales opened Tower Bridge 100 years ago. It
coincided with Altman's silver wedding and the birth of his 12th child.
The poor man was so overwhelmed that he celebrated by naming his new
offspring Sylvia Bridget.
