FT  02 FEB 94 / People: National Westminster Bank
Stephan Harris, 47, has been appointed group treasurer at National
Westminster bank, though he will also continue in his current position as
managing director, global treasury, for NatWest Markets, responsible for the
global foreign exchange, money markets and currency option businesses.
A US citizen and graduate of the American University, Washington DC, and the
Wharton graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania, Harris started
his banking career in 1973 by joining the First National Bank of Chicago.
There he held a variety of positions, including by 1981 the post of senior
vice-president and head of Asia Pacific, based in Japan. In 1989 he moved to
London, where he was head of international capital markets.
Poached by NatWest in 1992, Harris joined the British clearing bank as
managing director, global treasury, NatWest Markets. His geographical reach
in that role extends across not just Europe but also the US and the
Asia-Pacific region.
Harris says his new role is 'not a completely new function', as Martin Owen,
who tempted Harris to NatWest and is chief executive of NatWest Markets, had
previously absorbed the group treasury responsibilities within his own role.
But with the growth of NatWest Markets' global foreign exchange operations
in the past 18 months - Harris calculates customer volume has increased by
as much as 400 per cent since he joined - it seemed sensible to split the
functions and for Harris to take on a role more widely dedicated to the
bank's expanding global capital markets.
