IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
MOTHER-DAUGHTER LINK FOUND IN OSTEOPOROSIS 
Daughters of women with osteoporosis appear to be at increased risk of 
developing the bone-thinning disease, Australian researchers reported last 
week. Dr. Ego Seeman and his colleagues at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne 
compared 32 women whose mothers had osteoporosis to 22 women whose mothers did 
not have the disease, which affects roughly 20 million Americans. 
In results published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers 
found that daughters of osteoporosis patients were more likely to have thinner 
bones than daughters of healthy women. 
"We conclude that daughters of women with osteoporosis have a reduced bone mass 
. . . and this reduction in bone mass may put them at increased risk for 
fractures," the researchers wrote.
