FT  20 MAR 92 / French students in election manoeuvre
THOUSANDS of French university and secondary school students marched in
procession in the streets of Paris yesterday to protest against the
government's plans to reform the university education system.
The timing of the demonstration, the third such protest march in the past
month, was deliberately chosen by the students to put maximum pressure on
the government in the immediate run-up to Sunday's regional elections, which
are expected to show a substantial loss of support for the ruling
socialists.
Yesterday's student march came in the wake of a demonstration march on
Wednesday night, staged by left-wing and human rights groups protesting
against the regional election campaign of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of
the extreme right-wing National Front. Mr Le Pen's party is expected to make
large gains in Sunday's vote, with perhaps 15 per cent of the total.
A fringe element of the anti-NF march erupted in violence, in which a small
group of left-wing extremists broke shop windows and overturned cars. The
government's educational reform plan is intended to streamline the
university system so as to reduce the very high failure rate for
first-degree students. The first two years of first-degree courses would be
made less specialised, by reducing the number of different degree subjects
from 45 to 12. Courses would be made more modular, with the acquisition of
credits. Students would receive more tutoring in addition to public
lectures; and those who dropped out after a year could receive a certificate
registering the course credits they had achieved.
But this reform plan, like so many previous plans, has met outright
rejection from student activists. Some charge it is a way either of making
the universities more selective, others that it is designed to down-grade
university degrees.
