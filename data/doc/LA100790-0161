3 KILLED, 1 INJURED IN CRASH ON PASADENA FREEWAY 
Three Southland residents were killed early Saturday when their car veered off 
the southbound Pasadena Freeway and struck a tree, authorities said. 
Driver Juvy Angel Malit, 20, of Carson was killed, along with passengers Alden 
Villacorte, 20, of Los Angeles and Cyndy Lyn Balauag, 22, of Norwalk. 
The three were pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, which occurred at 
3:15 a.m. north of the Golden State Freeway, said Officer Richard Perez of the 
California Highway Patrol. 
Witnesses to the accident said the car was traveling about 70 m.p.h. in the 
fast lane, swerved into the number 3 lane and sideswiped another car, forcing 
that car to hit a three-foot-high concrete wall. The driver, Maria C. Peynado 
of Lakewood, suffered minor injuries, and three passengers in her car were 
unhurt, Perez said. 
Traffic was closed between the Golden State Freeway and Avenue 26 until 9:30 
a.m. Perez said the cause of the accident was still under investigation.
