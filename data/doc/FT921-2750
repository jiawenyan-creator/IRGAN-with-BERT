FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Chilean group wins Argentine
power order
TWO privatised Chilean power companies have won the bidding for the first
Buenos Aires electricity generator to come on the market as part of
Argentina's aggressive privatisation programme.
A consortium comprising Chilgener and Chilectra offered Dollars 92.2m in
cash for a 60 per cent stake in Central Nuevo, a company created to manage
two Buenos Aires power stations. The company was carved out of SEGBA, the
state-owned electricity monopoly that serves greater Buenos Aires.
The Chilean companies outbid Spanish, French, US and Chilean rivals. The
second-placed bidder, France's state-owned Electricite de France acting with
a local partner, offered Dollars 84.3m.
Argentina hopes to net over Dollars 6bn by selling seven utilities,
including the entire electricity and gas industries and part of state-owned
oil company YPF.
It plans to create an electricity market in which generation, transport and
distribution are handled by competing companies.
Ten per cent of Central Nuevo's stock will be held in trust for the
employees, while the government will retain a 30 per cent share. It plans to
sell its shareholding in a stock market flotation at a later date.
Stockbrokers in Buenos Aires reported strong demand for shares in Telecom
Argentina on Monday. This was the first day for offers to buy the
government's remaining 30 per cent stake in the country's second largest
telephone company which was privatised in 1990.
