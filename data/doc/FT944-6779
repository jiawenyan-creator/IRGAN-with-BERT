FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: Israel sells 26% controlling
stake in Bank Mizrahi
The Israeli government has sold a controlling interest in Bank Mizrahi, the
country's fourth-ranking bank, for Dollars 110m. The buyers, the
Ofer-Wertheim consortium, purchased a 26 per cent stake with an option to
acquire a further 25 per cent within 18 months.
Mizrahi is the first of the 'big four' banks to be privatised. The
government acquired major holdings in all of them for Dollars 7bn in 1983
after the collapse of an elaborate system run by the banks for ramping up
their own shares.
Mr Gill Leidner, managing director of MI Holdings, the government agency
charged with selling off the state's stake, said yesterday: 'The Mizrahi
sale is a major step forward. It will definitely push things ahead for the
sale of the other three big banks.'
He described the Dollars 110m sale price as 'reasonable' but admitted he had
hoped to raise more. Mizrahi last week reported a 25 per cent drop in net
profits for the third quarter of 1994, to Shk26.1m (Dollars 8.6m) from
Shk36.2m in the same period of 1993. Earlier this year the bank was valued
for MI Holdings at Dollars 450m to Dollars 500m.
The Israel-based Ofer-Wertheim group is controlled by the brothers Mr Sami
and Mr Yuli Ofer and two businessmen, Mr Muzi Wertheim and Mr Abe Feinberg.
The Ofers control 50 per cent of the consortium, with Mr Wertheim and Mr
Feinberg holding 25 per cent each.
Mr Leidner explained that even if they did not take up the option to buy
another 25 per cent of Mizrahi, the chance that anyone else would be able to
buy anything close to it was theoretical.
MI Holdings sold the state's 42.5 per cent stake in IDB Holding, the
industrial investment arm of Israel Discount Bank, the country's third
largest bank, for Dollars 350m in 1992 but has still to sell the bank
itself. In 1993 the government sold the smaller Israel Union Bank for
Dollars 85.5m.
Mr Leidner is negotiating to sell the second biggest bank, Leumi, to
Republic Bank of New York. He expects the sale to be completed during the
first half of 1995. An international tender is to be issued for the leading
bank, Hapoalim, within the next two months.
