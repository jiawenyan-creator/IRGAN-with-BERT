I will greatly mourn the passing of television game show host Bill Cullen. I 
was a veteran game show player with two game shows under my belt when I had the 
privilege of being chosen as a contestant on Cullen's short-lived 1983 game 
show "Child's Play." 
I had won two rounds and was playing the bonus round for $5,000 when in the 
middle of guessing word clues under a 30-second time clock, the producer yelled 
"Cut!" 
Apparently, one of the technicians backstage misheard me and gave me credit for 
a wrong answer. I was told I had a choice of either continuing with the 13 
seconds I had left on the clock or starting a new bonus round. 
I was confused and didn't know what to do. Bill looked at the new set of word 
clues and said, "Marla, start a new game. These clues look easy. I am sure 
you'll guess all of them." 
With a new-found confidence, I asked the producer for a new game, closed my 
eyes and refocused my concentration. Bill's encouragement helped me to win the 
$5,000. He didn't have to go out of his way for me or any other contestant. 
After doing 25,000 TV and radio shows, he didn't have to do anything but show 
up and get paid. But Bill cared about people and their dreams. For that reason, 
I will never forget him or his kindness.
