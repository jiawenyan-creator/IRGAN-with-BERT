  [Text] Murmansk April 9 (TASS) -- Sailor Dmitriy Pulkin, 
who took hostage four servicemen and found shelter on board a 
small cutter after killing four and wounding three people last 
night, has been detained by a counter-intelligence officer and 
two members of a special interior unit. 
  Before the detention Pulkin demanded that representatives of 
the Russian Federal Counter-intelligence Service and the 
Northern Fleet give him spirits and cigarettes. The demand was 
satisfied. A hostage made use of Pulkin's intoxication and 
seized his automatic rifle. The counter-intelligence officer 
and the policemen disarmed Pulkin and brought him to the 
investigation ward. The incident is being investigated. The 
content of Pulkin's note left at his working place has not been 
made public. 
  Although the crime was committed on the territory of a 
Northern Fleet naval base, it has nothing to do with the fleet, 
since the unit Pulkin was in belongs to the Russian Federal 
Counter- Intelligence Service. Pulkin, 21, was a contractual 
servicemen of a military counter-intelligence unit stationed in 
the settlement of Vidyayevo, the Murmansk region, from December 
28, 1991, through April 1, 1994.
