NATION IN BRIEF; 
PENNSYLVANIA; 
LEGISLATURE PASSES STIFF ABORTION CURBS 
The Pennsylvania state Senate gave final legislative approval to the most 
restrictive abortion legislation in the country, and Gov. Robert P. Casey has 
said he will sign it into law. Over the bitter objections of abortion rights 
advocates, the Senate voted 33 to 17 in favor of the measure, allowed under a 
Supreme Court decision in July that gave states wider control over abortion. 
The legislation, attached as a House amendment to a Senate crime bill, would 
bar an abortion after the 24th week of pregnancy, except to prevent irreparable 
harm or death of the mother. It would impose a 24-hour waiting period, require 
husbands to be notified of their wives' intentions to have abortions, eliminate 
abortions performed because of the fetus' sex and strictly control the use of 
fetal tissue for medical research.
