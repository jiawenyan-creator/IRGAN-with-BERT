FT  08 JAN 92 / Honda and Toyota third and fourth in US car sales league
JAPANESE car producers last year increased further their share of US car
sales, adding to mounting US-Japanese trade frictions. Their advance came as
US new car sales fell by 12 per cent to 8.2m, the fourth decline in five
years and the lowest level since 1982.
With the recession in the US car market deepening the big three US car
makers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - all suffered heavy losses.
The chairmen of the big three are accompanying President George Bush on his
visit to Japan this week.
Japanese-badged cars captured 31 per cent of the US new car market last
year, compared with 28 per cent a year earlier. For the third successive
year the Honda Accord, which is produced both in the US and in Japan, was
the best selling car in America with sales of 399,297, ahead of the Ford
Taurus, with the Toyota Camry in third place.
For the first time Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, was overtaken by
two Japanese producers and was relegated to fifth place in the US new car
market.
Its share of US new car sales dropped to 8.5 per cent from 9.2 per cent a
year ago, while Honda increased its share to 9.8 per cent in 1991 from 9.1
per cent in 1990, and Toyota boosted its share to 9.0 per cent from 8.3 per
cent.
GM's share of the US new car market remained virtually unchanged at 35.4 per
cent, but Ford lost ground with its share dropping to 19.9 per cent from
20.8 per cent a year ago.
Ford's new car sales in the US fell by 15.8 per cent to 1,943,603 last year.
Price discounts to retail customers were at record levels in the face of
falling demand and excess capacity. Ford estimates that automotive capacity
in North America exceeded industry sales by more than 5m units last year.
GM's car sales in the US fell by 12.1 per cent to 3,308,983, while
Chrysler's car sales fell by 18.4 per cent to 702,518. Chrysler still sells
more vehicles in total in the US market than any Japanese producer, however,
when light trucks, such as pick-ups, four-wheel drive leisure utility
vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles (minivans) are included.
The total US market for cars and light trucks declined last year by 11.2 per
cent to 12.3m, the worst performance since 1983, from 13.9m in 1990. Only a
slow recovery is forecast by US car makers for 1992.
