ROUNDUP; 
EL CAMINO REAL AVOIDS UPSET 
Sean Boldt's controversial 29-yard touchdown reception with 5 minutes 52 
seconds left capped El Camino Real High's 14-7 comeback victory over Reseda in 
a Northwest Valley Conference game Friday night at Reseda. 
With El Camino Real facing fourth and 21 at the 29, quarterback Evan Howland 
threw to Boldt, who broke from two Regent defenders and made the reception as 
he rolled over in the corner of the end zone. 
"We were very fortunate to win tonight," El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said. 
Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer saw the game's deciding play differently. 
"The man pushed off. It was obvious offensive pass interference," Schaeffer 
said. "My two kids both said (Boldt) trapped the ball. The referee said 
otherwise. It's a tough way to lose a ball game." 
Reseda (3-3, 1-3 in league play) opened the scoring after Maurice Stepter 
intercepted a Howland pass in the first quarter. A seven-play, 18-yard drive 
aided by a 15-yard roughing the kicker penalty on a field-goal attempt was 
capped by Stepter's four-yard scoring run. 
El Camino Real tied the score after junior defensive tackle Herbert Cosey 
recovered a Reseda fumble at the Regent 19. Three plays later, Chris Griggs ran 
for a 10-yard touchdown to tie the score at 7-7. 
El Camino Real (5-1, 3-1) limited Reseda to 23 yards. Griggs led El Camino Real 
with 83 yards in 17 carries and backfield mate Ryan Marine carried 24 times for 
83 yards. GARY HYNES
