FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: RPR to take Dollars 77m charge
in second term
RHONE-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals company formed when the French
state-owned chemicals company took a majority stake in the US drug
manufacturer, announced yesterday that it would take a one-off, pre-tax
charge of Dollars 77m in the second quarter of 1993.
The charge will cover some previously-announced moves, primarily in the
group's European operations.
The overhaul involves RPR in divesting part of its manufacturing facility at
Monts, in France, with the expected loss of 230 jobs.
It is also restructuring the marketing and manufacturing operation of the
German and Italian pharmaceuticals businesses, blaming 'governmental actions
to limit prescription pharmaceutical volumes and prices in these markets'.
Around 130 jobs are due to be lost in Germany as a result.
RPR said yesterday that of the Dollars 77m provision, the cash outlay this
year is likely to be around Dollars 30m. The estimated pre-tax savings from
the streamlining are put at about Dollars 30m a year, beginning in 1994.
The company said that it would use a previously-announced legal settlement
with Baxter International to offset the effect of the restructuring charge
on earnings. As part of the settlement of the patent dispute, Baxter has
agreed to pay RPR Dollars 105m.
