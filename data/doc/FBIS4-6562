  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 20 -- The Mekong River delta 
provinces have got a record rice harvest this year in terms of 
acreage, yield and total output, a source from the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food Industry said. 
  Some 1.09 million ha were put under the 1993-1994 
winter-spring rice crop in the whole region, an increase of 
60,000 ha as compared with the corresponding crop last year. By 
early April, farmers in these provinces harvested more than 
886,000 ha with an average yield of 4.82 tonnes per ha, up 0.3 
tonne over the previous crop. An Giang and Can Tho Provinces 
obtained the highest average yield of 6 tonnes per ha. 
Parlicularly some farmer households got 10 tonnes per ha. The 
Mekong delta provinces are expected to get 4.5 million tonnes 
of paddy, up 700,000 tonnes in comparison with the previous 
crop. The Mekong delta is Vietnam's biggest rice producer. 
Last year its total output of paddy stood at nearly 11 million 
tonnes, double the country's total paddy output in 1975.
