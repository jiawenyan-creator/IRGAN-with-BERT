  [Excerpt] Ari Wong-araya, permanent secretary in the 
Interior Ministry, granted an interview to reporters at a hotel 
in Hue, Vietnam on 17 March. He stressed the need for the Thai 
Government to provide security for Israeli diplomats and the 
Israeli Embassy in Thailand: 
  [Begin recording] [Ari] According to a report, the person 
intended to do something to the Israeli Embassy. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is that true? 
  [Ari] Yes, according to the report. Therefore, an order 
must be issued to provide security for the Israeli Embassy as 
well as Israeli diplomats. 
  [Second unidentified reporter] How about Israeli 
businessmen? 
Do they need to be taken care of? 
  [Ari] Probably. We would if they asked us. They must 
also take care of themselves, though. 
  [Second reporter] Is it necessary for a special request to 
be 
made to provide security for Israeli Embassy officials and the 
embassy? 
  [Ari] All of this is according to agreement. The area 
surrounding the embassy is our responsibility; they have 
exclusive diplomatic rights for the territory inside their 
embassy compound. 
  [Second reporter] Will we only protect outside the embassy 
grounds? 
  [Ari] If they ask us to take care of the inside area as 
well, then it might be necessary. In the process of examination 
and investigation, sometimes it is necessary to go inside. 
  [Second reporter] Could you please elaborate on what you 
mean 
when you say: do something to the Israeli Embassy? 
  [Ari] The dead person was found to be a driver who was 
hired by someone. [passage omitted]
