FT  23 JUL 92 / Boost sought for rented housing
SIR GEORGE YOUNG, the housing minister, yesterday met potential investors
and others in a campaign to revive the private rented sector.
The meeting, with representatives of pension funds and the property
industry, was the first in a series aimed at encouraging investors that
investing in property for renting is worthwhile.
Sir George said: 'We must get away from the image of peeling terraced
houses, shoddily converted into flats, managed indifferently by
inexperienced landlords.'
