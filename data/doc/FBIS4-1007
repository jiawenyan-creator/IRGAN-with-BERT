<F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F>
15 April] 
  [Excerpt] People who wish to vote in the general election 
on April 27th and 28th are reminded that they may not bring 
weapons of any kind into the inner perimeter of the voting 
station, i.e. within a 600m radius of the voting station. 
People who do have weapons should either leave them at home or 
take them to a police station for safekeeping. People entering 
the voting area found in possession of a weapon will not be 
allowed to enter the inner perimeter. 
  Voters are also asked to move out of the inner perimeter as 
soon as possible after casting their votes. 
  Subject to local regulations, street vendors are encouraged 
to set up their stands outside the controlled area, i.e. outside 
of a 1.1 km radius, to sell their wares or foodstuffs to voters 
who may wish to congregate beyond the controlled area. 
  The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] would welcome a 
joyous and peaceful celebration of this extraordinary moment in 
South Africa's history, and believes that the creation of a 
festive atmosphere beyond the controlled areas of the voting 
stations would contribute enormously in this regard. "This is 
an election, the most important and the most hopeful, in our 
history. Nearly one billion people around the world will be 
watching us. Let's give ourselves and them an occasion to 
remember with happiness," said Ben van der Ross, the IEC's 
commissioner tasked with overall responsibility for the 
operations of the election administration directorate. [passage
