FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: Why Mulroney's effect on society means he will not
be missed
Sir, Your leader, 'Mr Mulroney's political legacy' (February 25) suggests
that history will be kind to Brian Mulroney. However, the view from Main
Street is very different from the view from Southwark Bridge in London.
Mr Mulroney pursued policies designed to restructure the Canadian economy.
The results have been: an erosion of the east-west trade which has
historically served as the foundation of Canada's economic logic; a
decimation of the Canadian manufacturing sector; a loss of tens of thousands
of jobs, many of which have shifted south to the US; and the longest,
deepest recession recorded since the 1930s.
By undermining the social solidarity upon which the Canadian federal state
is built, these policies have been instrumental in worsening Canada's
divisions, not only between French and English-speaking Canadians, but also
between eastern and western Canadians.
Mr Mulroney will not be missed.
