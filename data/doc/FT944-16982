FT  11 OCT 94 / People: Asda Property Holdings
Sir Patrick Sheehy, 64, expected to retire as chairman of BAT Industries in
a year's time, has joined the board of Asda Property Holdings, a small
property company controlled by the family of Manny Davidson, the founder.
The company was named after Davidson's mother, Annie Sara Davidson.
Asda Property has survived the recession better than many property companies
and is one of the few not to have lost money. Tony Roscoe, Asda's managing
director, said: 'We can make money out of property in a static property
market but the firm wanted to make sure it did not miss the bigger picture'.
He added that recruiting Sir Patrick would help reassure the company's
outside shareholders.
Sir Patrick takes over from Lord Finsberg, former Tory MP for Hampstead, who
retired earlier this year. Sir Patrick already sits on the boards of BP and
Cluff Resources.
