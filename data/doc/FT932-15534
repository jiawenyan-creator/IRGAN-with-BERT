FT  13 APR 93 / Three arrested at Timex protest
THREE people were arrested yesterday in violent scenes outside the Timex
company's Dundee plant where workers have been campaigning for 11 weeks to
win back their jobs.
Outside the plant an estimated 1,000 supporters joined the 340 workers who
were dismissed by Timex for refusing to accept a package of changes to pay,
benefits and working practices. Later 6,000 people attended a solidarity
rally near the plant organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress.
Mr Willie Lesslie, the deputy convenor at Timex, told the meeting that the
company faced two choices - a negotiated settlement or the permanent
shutdown of the plant.
The company has hired a new workforce which is bussed into the plant every
day under police protection.
The company insists that there is no issue any more because the strikers are
no longer employed by Timex and have been replaced. It says that the
production of circuit boards for televisions is continuing.
