FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japanese steel industry disappointed with
dumping charge
THE Japanese steel industry was disappointed by the decision to uphold a
dumping charge against corrosion-resistant steel sheet, writes Michiyo
Nakamoto in Tokyo.
'The decision is difficult to understand,' the Japan Iron and Steel
Federation said. The industry has focused on exporting high-quality products
to the US and has maintained prices at levels generally higher than those
set by US mills. It has also attempted to keep export volumes at levels
appropriate to meet US demand.
The federation warned that the ITC's ruling risked damaging the
international competitiveness of US steel users as well as prospects for a
new Multilateral Steel Agreement. Talks on an MSA are set to resume in
Geneva in autumn.
Japanese steelmakers face duties of 40.19 per cent on corrosion-resistant
sheet, which accounted for less than 4 per cent of steel exports to the US
last year. Manufacturers said they planned to increase production at their
US joint venture mills to minimise the impact.
Industry officials said the decision could affect the relationship between
US and Japanese steel companies, which have invested heavily in American
steel mills, entered into joint ventures and provided technology in an
effort to shift to higher value added exports.
