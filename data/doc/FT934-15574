FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Interim downturn at Worms
holding group
WORMS, the French holding company, reflecting the gloomy trend in the
corporate sector, announced a fall in net profits to FFr362m (Dollars 64m)
in the first six months of 1993 from FFr397m a year earlier.
The group, which recently reshuffled its interests by selling its
controlling stake in the Financiere Truffaut luxury goods conglomerate to Mr
Bernard Arnault, was affected in by the poor performance of some of its core
holdings, including the Saint-Louis food and transport group.
Profits from Saint-Louis fell to FFr252m in the first half from FFr462m last
year, partly due to high restructuring costs. Worms was also affected by the
problems of Compagnie Nationale de Navigation (CNN) in the oil
transportation sector. The losses from CNN rose to FFr46m from FFr8m.
Athena, the insurance company, suffered from the general pressures on the
French insurance sector. Net profits from Athena fell to FFr217m from
FFr257m. The losses from Arc Union, the property company, were reduced to
FFr49m from FFr167m while net profits from the Demachy Worms banking
business rose slightly to FFr44m from FFr41m.
The sale of the Financiere Truffaut shares yielded a profit for Worms of
FFr187m. The group also expects in the second half to make more exceptional
gains from the sale of its old corporate headquarters on Boulevard Haussmann
in Paris.
