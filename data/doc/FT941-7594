FT  24 FEB 94 / Code adopted for funeral payments
The main representative organisation for providers of prepaid funeral plans
yesterday responded to Monday's launch of an Office of Fair Trading
investigation into the industry by announcing its own code of practice.
The National Association for Pre-Paid Funeral Plans, whose six member
companies represent more than 75 per cent of the industry, said the code
aimed to 'ensure the highest standards of practice are maintained when
dealing with this . . . area of planning'.
The code stipulates that member companies must practise tasteful
advertising, set up independent trust funds with separate custodians, submit
to annual actuarial or accountants' reviews and provide any information
requested by the association. There is also a formal complaints procedure.
Mr Chris Pitchford, sales and marketing director for the company Dignity,
who speaks on behalf of the association, said: 'The industry needs an
association that has teeth. We would like to have the same reputation as the
Association of British Travel Agents.'
