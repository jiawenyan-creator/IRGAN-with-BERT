Nolan Ryan pulled his left calf muscle in a minor league exhibition game at 
Port Charlotte, Fla., and may not be able to pitch when the season begins in 10 
days. 
Ryan, 42, who signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers last December 
for a guaranteed $2 million, said he felt the pull as he ran to cover first 
base for Tulsa of the Class AA Texas League, which was playing a Baltimore farm 
team. Ryan faced three batters, throwing 14 pitches, before departing. 
Bill Zeigler, the Texas trainer, said he did not believe it was a serious pull.
