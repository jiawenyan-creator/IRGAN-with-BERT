FT  24 DEC 94 / Abu Dhabi may buy hospital
An offshoot of the Abu Dhabi government is expected to be named preferred
bidder for Health Care International, the private hospital near Glasgow
which went into receivership in November, only four months after it opened.
Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen, the joint receiver, is close to
finalising an agreement with the Abu Dhabi Investment Company, a subsidiary
of the official Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
