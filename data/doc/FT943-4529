FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring plans boost BBA shares
Shares in BBA Group rose 9p to 198p yesterday as the engineering and motor
components group signalled the first signs of a change in fortunes following
the start of its wide-ranging restructuring programme earlier this year.
Although pre-tax profits fell 54 per cent to Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 50.3m) in
the six months to June 30, the group said operating margins had improved and
cost-cutting should restore earnings growth.
Turnover declined to Pounds 711.1m, against Pounds 742m including Pounds
24.8m from discontinued activities, but operating profits before exceptional
items rose from Pounds 45.3m to Pounds 47.4m.
Mr Roberto Quarta, chief executive, highlighted an improvement in operating
margins from 6.1 per cent to 6.7 per cent following Pounds 18m of
restructuring costs in the first half.
'This is a healthy turnaround, and I believe we can get to double digit
margins by 1996,' he said.
Margins were boosted by an Pounds 11m saving on payroll costs as the group
cut the workforce by 7 per cent to 18,000.
Of the group's core businesses, which have been merged for reporting
purposes into two divisions, the industrial sector, comprising textiles, US
materials and specialist electrical equipment, reported increase profits of
Pounds 30m (Pounds 25.1m) as demand rose in continental Europe and North
America.
Transportation saw profits fall from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 17.4m as a weak
performance by Page Avjet, its aircraft maintenance arm, undermined
improvements by the automotive businesses.
The figures were also dented by Pounds 13.1m of exceptional litigation costs
relating to the settlement of a US lawsuit and Pounds 2m of losses on
disposals.
Earnings per share fell from 6.8p to 1.5p, although they showed an increase
to 5.2p (3.9p) before exceptional items.
The interim dividend, as forecast in March, is cut from 2.25p to 1.5p. The
group said the full year figure would be not less than 4.5p.
COMMENT
BBA has bitten the bullet and these figures were ahead of the gloomy
forecasts. But with disposals, acquisitions, exceptionals and Pounds 72.1m
of provisions all affecting this year's profits, investors will have to make
a leap of faith in Mr Quarta if they expect short-term gains from the
company. Although full year profits should exceed Pounds 75m, the hefty
forward multiple of 19.4 makes the shares too pricey given the on-going
restructuring and redundancy costs. They look a more attractive prospect if
profits reach Pounds 100m next year, on a multiple of 15.8. Even then,
however, they would be no better value than blue chip rivals such as GKN and
T&amp;N.
