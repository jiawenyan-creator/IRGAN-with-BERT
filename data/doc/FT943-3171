FT  15 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Competition calls
The expected approval of a new form of competition between the UK and the US
will shake up the international telephone cartel. With operating margins on
transatlantic calls thought to be over 50 per cent, the scope for price
cutting is huge. But not all operators will fare equally badly. BT could
even emerge a winner. It is required by its regulator to cut its average
price level anyway. So if international charges did not come down, it would
have to cut other rates. Mercury, though, looks a big loser. It is heavily
dependent on international calls for profits.
The impact will also be felt in continental Europe. Operators will have to
cut transatlantic prices or see traffic diverted through the UK. Of the
quoted companies, Italy's STET and Spain's Telefonica are the most
vulnerable. Not only are their international charges particularly high;
approximately 10 per cent of their traffic is with the US. Holland's KPN and
Tele Danmark should not suffer as much. Their charges are relatively low and
only about 5 per cent of their traffic is with the US.
As the old cartel arrangements crumble, the competing global alliances
formed over the past year will come to the fore. Increasing amounts of
traffic will be channelled over their proprietary networks. Again, BT looks
well placed. Its alliance with MCI gives it a presence on both shores of the
Atlantic. AT&amp;T's position is weaker as it so far has no UK presence, while
the alliance between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint is barely
off the drawing board. Non-aligned European operators will now be under
increased pressure to join one of the main alliances. Otherwise, they face
losing some of their most lucrative traffic.
