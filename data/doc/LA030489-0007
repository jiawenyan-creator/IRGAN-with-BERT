72 UGANDAN RUSTLERS KILLED, KENYA SAYS 
The Kenyan government said Friday that its security forces killed 72 of about 
400 cattle rustlers who raided its territory from neighboring Uganda. 
In a protest note handed to Uganda's acting ambassador in Nairobi, the 
government demanded an explanation for the raid, which it said was carried out 
by heavily armed men. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the raiders, some wearing military 
uniforms, were discovered Thursday by a Kenyan security force. Two Kenyan 
security officers were killed and a resident was injured in the gun battle near 
Pokot, a small village in northwestern Kenya, the ministry said. 
Both the Pokot tribe, on the Kenyan side of the border, and the Karamonjong, on 
the Ugandan side, have traditionally raided each other.
