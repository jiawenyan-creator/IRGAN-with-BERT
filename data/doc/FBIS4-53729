  [Text] Okpo, May 21 (YONHAP) -- The nation's fourth 
submarine, the Pakui, was placed in commission in a launching 
ceremony held Saturday at Okpo shipyard on Koje Island with 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Adm. Kim Hong-yol, chief of naval 
operations, and Chairman Kim U-chung of the Daewoo Business 
Group attending. 
  Mrs. Kim Song-ki, wife of Minister Kim [as received], cut 
the 
ribbon for the launching of the 1,200-ton vessel in accordance 
with naval tradition. The submarine, capable of a maximum speed 
of 22 knots per hour, is twice as fast as North Korea's 
W(Whisky)- and R (Romeo)-class craft. 
  The newly built submarine, the navy said, can conduct 
independent operations for two months with 30 crew and torpedoes 
and mines aboard. The other three submarines that have already 
been launched are the Changbogo, Yichon and Choemuson. 
  With the four submarines, the South Korean Navy will be able 
to effectively protect the country's sea routes through 
utilization of a three-dimensional strategy involving the air, 
sea and submarines. 
  The Navy said the submarine's launching will serve as 
momentum to secure South Korea's marine power in the 21st 
century while providing a counterbalance against North Korean 
underseas operations. 
  The new submarine was named after Pak Ui, a Choson Dynasty 
military officer who attacked Tsushima Island where Japanese 
pirates were rampant. The Daewoo shipyard began constructing 
the diesel- propelled vessel in June 1991 with design and 
technology offered by Germany's HDW.
