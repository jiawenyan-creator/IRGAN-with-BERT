WICKER WITCHCRAFT: EASY CARE AND REPAIR 
If you have wicker furniture in your home or on the porch, you already know how 
to enjoy it, but do you know how to take care of it? 
Here's how to help your wicker retain its looks and charm: 
Care and Cleaning: 
* You can wash rattan and willow wicker with soapy water using a soft brush for 
crevices. If the wicker becomes brittle, drenching it with water helps restore 
it. 
* Rush, sea grass or fiber (twisted paper) should only be wiped now and then 
with a damp cloth. 
* Vacuum wicker regularly with the brush attachment. 
* For in-between dusting, try a soft, slightly dampened paint brush. 
* Wash painted wicker with warm, soapy water and a damp sponge. Don't use an 
abrasive cleaner. 
* For stained wicker, spray furniture cleaner on a clean, dry cloth and wipe 
all surfaces. 
* Keep wicker well away from a fireplace, stove or radiator. 
* Bring wicker furniture indoors during freezing weather. 
Repairing: 
* For pliability, soak new strands of rattan and wicker in warm water for at 
least 10 minutes and weave them while they are wet. 
* To repair worn wicker: Remove the damaged strand. From the underside, anchor 
the end of the new strand next to the end of the old strand. Working from 
above, weave the new strand through the spokes in the existing pattern. 
* To repair rattan wrapping: Strip off the old rattan. Tie one end of new 
rattan temporarily into place with string; start wrapping the other end over 
the tied end. Remove the string once the wrapping holds the first end in place. 
To complete wrapping, tuck the second end up through the last few rows of 
wrapping. Pull the end tight and trim. Secure the end with a tack. 
Refinishing: 
* If rattan or willow has accumulated many coats of unsightly paint, consider 
having it stripped by a professional. To do the job yourself, work outdoors and 
use a semi-paste stripper, following manufacturer's directions. Be sure to 
scrub off all traces of the stripper using a stiff-bristle brush dipped into 
detergent and water. 
* If the piece is unfinished, clean it first to remove grease, wax and dirt. 
Let it dry thoroughly before applying finish. For a light, natural finish, 
spray on polyurethane or clear lacquer from an aerosol can. For a darker 
finish, use a stain before applying the finish. 
* Wicker can also be painted any color you choose. Aerosol plastic resin enamel 
works best. 
Here's how to paint wicker or apply a clear finish: 
* Work outdoors on a warm, dry day. 
* Create a screen to confine spray. A large appliance box with the front cut 
off works well. 
* Hold the spray can about 12 inches away. Practice first on newspaper to get 
the feel of the sprayer. Then start at the top and sweep across in one 
continuous motion. Spray inside surfaces first, then sides and top. 
* Apply two or three thin coats, allowing each to dry thoroughly.
