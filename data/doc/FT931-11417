FT  03 FEB 93 / EC aspirants agree agenda
NEGOTIATIONS to admit the EC's first new members since 1986 began in earnest
yesterday at separate meetings between the EC president Denmark and
ambassadors from Austria, Finland and Sweden, Reuters reports from Brussels.
Diplomats said the talks had gone well and the applicants had agreed to an
EC plan to start talks in the first instance in eight areas.
Those areas are the free movement of services, workers, and capital,
external relations, social policy, agriculture and forestry, customs union
and regional policy. They also agreed to seek additional areas where the
applicants' opening speeches on Monday had demonstrated talks could proceed
swiftly. The diplomats said a date was not set for the next set of meetings.
The EC and the applicants hope talks can be wrapped up in a year, allowing
the three, who could be joined soon by Norway, to enter the EC fold on
January 1, 1995.
Talks are expected to focus on the applicants requests' for special
arrangements for their farming sectors and on the implications of the three
countries' policy of neutrality for the EC's plans to forge a foreign and
security policy.
All three countries offered assurances on Monday that they would abide by
the EC's plans laid down in the Maastricht treaty.
Support among Finns for their country's application to join the EC has
fallen in recent months, according to an opinion poll yesterday, Reuter
reports from Helsinki.
The latest results showed 43 per cent in favour, down from 54 per cent.
