168.01 

Purpose. 



(a) This part prescribes regulations in accordance with section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub.
L. 101380). The regulations will reduce the risk of oil spills from laden, single hull tankers over 5,000 GT
by requiring that these tankers be escorted by at least two suitable escort vessels. The escort vessels will be immediately
available to influence the tankers' speed and course in the event of a steering or propulsion equipment failure, thereby
reducing the possibility of groundings or collisions. 

(b) The regulations in this part establish minimum escort vessel requirements. Nothing in these regulations should
be construed as relieving the master of a tanker from the duty to operate the vessel in a safe and prudent manner, taking
into account the navigational constraints of the waterways to be traversed, other vessel traffic, and anticipated
weather, tide, and sea conditions, which may require reduced speeds, greater assistance from escort vessels, or
other operational precautions.
