  [Text] Lima, 25 Dec (NOTIMEX) -- A car bomb explosion, 
which occurred this evening in front of La Polvora Military 
Barracks, located 3 km from the presidential palace in eastern 
Lima, injured six people, Peruvian police reported today. 
  The explosion, which was part of a series of dynamite 
attacks 
that occurred on the eve of Chinese leader Mao Ze Dong's 
centennial--which the rebel group, the Shining Path, threatened 
to celebrate by executing a series of violent actions--destroyed 
three houses and injured five members of a family and a passerby. 
  Security forces have reported that a man and a woman, 
presumably involved in the attack, were arrested in the vicinity.
