<DOCTITLE>Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Notice of Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



October 17, 1994.



Take notice that on October 13, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), tendered for filing to become part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, effective December 1, 1994, the tariff sheets listed on the attached
Appendix A.

FGT states the instant filing proposes changes to FGT's FERC Gas Tariff which primarily correct minor errors and clarify
certain provisions. Specifically, FGT submits the revised tariff sheets as follows:

Third Revised Sheet No. 1 reflects FGT's correction of two page references and adds Sheet No. 8D to the Table of Contents.
Sheet No. 8D was filed September 22, 1994, in compliance with FERC's Order issued August 31, 1994, in Docket No. RP94332.

Fourth Revised Sheet No. 43 and Third Revised Sheet No. 49 eliminate the designation of contacts authorized to perform
day-to-day dispatching from the listing of information required when requesting ITS1 and IPS transportation
service. Due to the changing nature of this information, it is more expedient for FGT to obtain this data at the time
nominations are furnished.

Second Revised Sheet No. 180 clarifies that FGT will retain variable costs, usage surcharges, and fuel charges prior
to revenue sharing and crediting consistent with the sharing and crediting mechanism approved in Docket No. RS9216.

Second Revised Sheet No. 183 corrects an error in the determination of Participating Firm Shippers' total share of
Interruptible Shared Proceeds. Original Sheet No. 183 made effective November 1, 1993, contained the correct determination
of the shared proceeds. When FGT filed First Revised Sheet No. 183 to change certain other provisions of this section,
language from an earlier draft of this sheet, which never became effective, was inadvertently included. In addition,
the term ``Relinquishing Shipper'' has been changed to ``Participating Shipper'' to conform with the terms used
in this section.

First Revised Sheet Nos. 197A and 197C reflect an accounting change required by the FERC in Order No. 552. Two typographical
errors also are corrected on Sheet No. 197C.

Second Revised Sheet Nos. 452, 459 and 462 and First Revised Sheet No. 463 delete references to and eliminate Exhibit
C from FGT's FTS1 form of service agreement while designating and modifying Exhibit B to set forth the Maximum
Daily Transportation Quantities formerly reflected on Exhibit C.

First Revised Sheet Nos. 454, 470, 485, 494A, 500 and 514 have been modified to clarify that the commencement of the
primary term of a transportation service agreement between FGT and a Shipper may be different than the effective date
of the service agreement.

Second Revised Sheet Nos. 499, 502, 504 and 507 and First Revised Sheet Nos. 500, 505 and 506 reflect certain modifications
to FGT's ITS1 form of service agreement solely for purposes of clarification. Second Revised Sheet Nos. 501
and 508 delete references to and eliminate Exhibit A from the ITS1 form of service agreement. Third Revised
Sheet No. 509 eliminates extraneous text from this page previously designated as ``Reserved for Future Use''.

Finally, First Revised Sheet No. 659 corrects two typographical errors reflected on FGT's Index of Requirements
by End-Use Priority.

FGT states that copies of the filing were mailed to all customers serviced under the rate schedules affected by the
filing and the interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before October
24, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.

Any person wishing to become a party must file a Motion to Intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission
and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room.
