FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Falconbridge soars as metal
prices rise and sales improve
Falconbridge, the Canadian metals producer which went public this year, has
reported third-quarter earnings of CDollars 55.5m (USDollars 41.4m), or 32
cents a share, compared with a CDollars 11.4m loss, or 11 cents, a year
earlier, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Operating income more than quadrupled to CDollars 94.6m from CDollars 21.5m,
while revenues climbed to CDollars 526.7m from CDollars 371.1m.
The improvement was due to rising metal prices, higher sales volumes and a
drop in the Canadian dollar. The results were also buoyed by a reduction in
debt-service expenses from CDollars 21.1m to CDollars 10.9m in the wake of
the recent equity issue.
