FT  03 JUN 93 / Reserves rise Dollars 78m on month
THE UK's gold and currency reserves rose an underlying Dollars 78m in May,
the Treasury announced yesterday, Emma Tucker writes.
The overall level rose by Dollars 71m taking reserves at the end of the
month to Dollars 41.7bn compared with Dollars 41.6bn at the end of April.
The underlying change in the reserves excluded a number of factors such as
proceeds from this month's tender of UK Ecu Treasury bills and sales into
the secondary market. These amounted to Dollars 1.17bn.
