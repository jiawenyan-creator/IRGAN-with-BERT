FT  29 JUL 93 / Romania loan tranche withheld
The World Bank yesterday said it was withholding the final Dollars 150m of a
Dollars 400m structural adjustment loan for Romania because of the country's
poor economic performance, Reuter reports from Bucharest. The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has imposed delays on its lending to Romania for similar
reasons.
Last week the government's negotiations with the IMF stumbled when an IMF
team left Bucharest without reaching a new standby credit agreement with
Romania for 1993.
