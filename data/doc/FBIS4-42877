  [Text] What would happen if Turkey had nuclear weapons? 
If I asked my friend at the Cankaya Mansion or Motherland Party 
leader Mesut Yilmaz this question, they would surely answer that 
they do not comment on hypothetical situations. 
  It is indeed necessary to think of hypothetical situations, 
however, in order to foresee the future. For futurists, every 
hypothesis is an alternative. Hypotheses are projections into 
the future, in a way. Refusing to comment on hypothetical 
situations is avoiding the issue. 
  If Turkey had nuclear weapons, the United States and Europe 
would not act like spoiled children in their relations with us. 
The United States would not even dream of slashing its aid to 
us under the pretext of human right violations. European 
countries would beg us to join the European Union. Customs 
restrictions would be lifted immediately and there would be no 
obstacles to the free circulation of Turkish workers in Europe. 
  While slashing its aid to us, the United States does not 
dare 
impose sanctions on Red China, where human rights are violated 
most. Why? Because Red China has nuclear weapons. 
  When the seven rich countries, including the four European 
countries, extended $80 billion in aid to Russia, did they ask 
what the situation was in connection with human rights? 
  Today, China and Russia are the two places where human 
rights 
are violated most. Remember a few months ago, the Russian 
parliament was raided and its members arrested. 
  While extending aid to Russia, did the United States or the 
Europeans question it about human rights? No, because Russia 
has nuclear weapons. 
  Even Vietnam has more prestige than we do today, because it 
has nuclear weapons. 
  Could we not build nuclear weapons? The experts must answer 
this question.
