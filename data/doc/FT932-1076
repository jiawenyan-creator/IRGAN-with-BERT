FT  25 JUN 93 / Council refuses to pay Pounds 5m to bank
A LOCAL authority is refusing to repay more than Pounds 5m to Credit Suisse,
the Swiss bank, on the grounds that the council itself acted unreasonably
and outside its powers when it first guaranteed that it would pay the money.
Allerdale Borough Council in the Lake District faces a claim by Credit
Suisse for Pounds 5.23m plus interest on a loan to a development company the
council set up to build a leisure complex and timeshare lodges at Keswick
railway station.
The project, launched in 1985, failed to keep up with revenue forecasts, and
Allerdale Development Company went into liquidation in November 1990. The
High Court hearing about the issue, scheduled for up to five weeks, is seen
as a test case for councils which have entered into similar guarantees.
Mr Christopher Clarke QC, for Credit Suisse, said the council was suing Mr
Anthony Perry, its former chief executive, to make him liable for any sum up
to Pounds 6m it might be ordered to pay Credit Suisse.
It was also suing Cipfa Services, owned by the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy, which advised the council at the time. Mr Perry had
also made an application against the council to an industrial tribunal. The
case was postponed pending the result of the hearing.
