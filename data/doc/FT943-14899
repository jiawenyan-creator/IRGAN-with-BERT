FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
A squeeze pushed stock index futures above the 3,000 level for the first
time in more than three weeks, but the contract closed below the day's best
as London was unsettled by a faltering Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,962, the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100
moved steadily ahead with UK economic data on output prices for June taken
to indicate inflation remained under control.
Dealers also cited hopes of greater stability in currency markets for the
new positive tone to the market. Demand for September was said to have come
from both independent (local) traders and the large institutions and the
contract pushed through the 3,000 barrier to reach a day's high of 3,012.
However, the poor opening in New York in the afternoon checked a further
advance and September finished the day at 2,997, up 38 on its previous close
and 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 5
points. Volume was 15,720 lots.
Traded options lacked the strong activity seen in futures and volume fell to
23,905 lots. The FT-SE 100 saw business of 8,724 and the Euro FT-SE 100
option traded 4,424 contracts. BP was the busiest stock option with a day's
total of 1,326. It was followed by Glaxo at 1,238 lots and Argyll Group at
1,010.
