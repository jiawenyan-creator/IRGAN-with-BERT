  [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Yi Yong-tok, deputy 
prime minister and National Unification minister, said Wednesday 
the government holds fast to the policy that the North Korean 
nuclear problem must be settled peacefully through dialogue and 
negotiation. 
  "There will be no change in this policy in the days to 
come," 
Yi said. 
  He made the remarks at a meeting with unification advisers, 
most of whom are former unification ministers. 
  "According to those who have recently been to North Korea, 
the economy there is deteriorating and the regime is controlling 
the people's lives more tightly than in the past," Yi said. 
  Also at the meeting, Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae 
said he expects multilateral efforts would be made to solve the 
nuclear problem through dialogue for a specific period of time 
after the United Nations Security Council takes an initial 
action against North Korea. 
  "It is possible that the United States and North Korea may 
engage in behind-the-scenes contacts," he said. 
  Song said North Korea may clarify its position on the 
nuclear 
problem and overall inter-Korean relations at a Supreme People's 
Assembly meeting to be held on April 6. 
  "In the North, public restlessness seems deepening. For 
instance, Army deserters are increasing and many workers boycott 
work or leave workshops earlier than usual," he said.
