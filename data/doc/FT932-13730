FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs back stance on Serbia
LABOUR MPs yesterday rallied around the party leadership's calls for air
strikes on Serb supply and communication lines in Bosnia - but signalled
that still more decisive action may yet be needed.
Mr John Smith, party leader, won support at a meeting of the parliamentary
Labour party for calling for air strikes if the Serbs advance further.
However, more than 50 Labour MP last night signed a Commons motion urging
the UN to issue an ultimatum against the Serbs, 'and, should that fail, to
take decisive military action'. Some Labour MPs continue to press for the
sending of ground troops.
