GROUPS SUPPORT RESEDA EXTENSION 
Your article (July 21) on the extension and paving of Reseda Boulevard to 
Mulholland Drive failed to include the testimony before the Fire Commission of 
the Encino Hillside Traffic Safety Organization and the Encino Property Owners 
Assn. 
These groups jointly and vigorously support the extension of Reseda Boulevard 
into the Santa Monica Mountains. We want road access to Mulholland Drive and 
the paving of Mulholland Drive so that the residents of Tarzana and the West 
Valley will have their own access to the San Diego Freeway and stop using our 
already overly burdened hillside streets as a bypass to the freeway. 
The narrow, winding, hazardous streets in the fire-prone hillside area of 
Encino have become a threat to our public safety and need relief now. 
In no way can our streets absorb increased traffic from the 350 homes planned 
along both sides of Reseda Boulevard around the country clubs of Braemar and El 
Caballero. We protest our street conditions where cars damage our gardens, 
smash our fences, total our cars and crash through the walls of our homes. 
Opponents of the extension and paving of Reseda Boulevard talk about preserving 
hiking trails, while we cannot walk along our streets without getting hit by 
cars. We cannot allow our children to play on the sidewalks in front of their 
own houses. How can we allow them to walk to school?
