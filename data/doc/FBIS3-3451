  [Text] Nanjing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- The Jiangsu 
Provincial Government has pledged its full support for the 
construction of the Suzhou Industrial Park, a Sino-Singapore 
Cooperative Project. 
  Located in the economically-booming city of Suzhou, the 
project covers 70 square kilometers and has a combined 
investment of 20 million U.S. dollars in construction. It is 
expected to develop into a modern international industrial park. 
  "This is the largest Sino-foreign joint venture project in 
China at present," Chen Huanyou, governor of the province, said. 
  He called on all government employees to offer voluntary and 
efficient services. 
  He noted that the provincial government will implement all 
preferential policies granted by the central government, strive 
to help the industrial park in planning, support the park's 
reform program, and do a good job in services.
