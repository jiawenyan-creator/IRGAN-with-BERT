FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): It really is an Augustinian Budget
In previous articles I have urged the case for a Budget along the lines of
St. Augustine's plea: 'Please God make me chaste, but not yet.' The Budget
contains measures which will raise revenue by Pounds 6.7bn in 1994-95 and by
Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96, on an indexed basis. But they will yield less than
Pounds 0.5bn - virtually nothing - in the coming financial year. The
revenue-raising measures are to be enacted in the coming Finance Bill; so
they are not in the category of so many American presidential promises to do
better in later years.
Moreover, most of the tax measures are sensible reforms in their own right -
with the exception of the lower-tier tax band. So if relaxations turn out to
be required, because of the state of the economy a change in the Budgetary
outlook or - a change in fiscal fashion, it would be very easy to reduce tax
rates without going back on the present Budget. The revenue is mostly raised
by removals or restrictions of reliefs, or abolition of exemptions. The two
most important revenue raisers are the extension of VAT to domestic fuel and
power and the increase in employee National Insurance contributions, which
is almost the same thing as an increase in the basic rate of 1p in the pound
for most taxpayers.
I should, however, break off the macro-economics to say that potentially by
far the most important innovation came in a little-noticed paragraph towards
the end. Here, Norman Lamont embraced on, an experimental basis to be tried
in three or four regions, Professor Denis Snower's proposals to allow the
long-term unemployed to transfer their dole money as a wage subsidy to a
potential employer. I receive more letters from intelligent readers on the
absurdity of paying the unemployed to do nothing rather than something than
on almost any other subject. The announcement has the same kind of long-term
potential as Nigel Lawson's embrace of 'profit-related pay' in his l986
Budget speech, which is only now beginning to take off.
It would, however, be idle to pretend that either of these measures, or both
combined, or the other labour-market measures, will be remotely sufficient
if there really is a long-term structural unemployment problem due either to
deficient demand or to changes in the labour market detrimental to jobs and
pay. The Budget speech did not really discuss these far-ranging issues -
either on a British or an international basis. The Budget Red Book does
however provide some material on which to reflect.
Nothing will stop financial readers from paying most attention to the
projections of the public-sector accounts. These show the usual hump-backed
picture. The deficit measured by the public sector borrowing requirement
reaches a peak of Pounds 50bn or 8 per cent of GDP in 1993-94. It then
gradually declines to Pounds 30bn or 3 3/4 per cent in 1997-98. In fact, the
underlying decline is somewhat better, as privatisation proceeds tail off
from Pounds 8bn in the year now coming to an end to Pounds 1bn a year in the
second half of the 1990s.
What this Budget has really done is to substitute a medium-term fiscal
strategy for a medium-term monetary one. This has been achieved by the
device christened by the Treasury as the wedge which imposes very small tax
increases in the coming year, but which build up to large amounts in the two
years following.
The main fault of the Budget speech was that it was much too long and badly
needed subbing. The strategic parts could have been highlighted very much
more; and much of the detail could have been relegated to press notices or
the Finance Bill. The chancellor will have to engage in this kind of subbing
when the new unified November Budgets start. For it simply will not be
possible to introduce yesterday's degree of tax accountants' detail into a
speech which also covers spending.
Having said all this, a closer study of the Red Book reveals a fundamentally
disquieting economic outlook. If one takes the Treasury's central
projection, it is not until 1994-95 that growth, outside the North Sea,
catches up with the present best-official guess of the growth of productive
capacity, namely 2 1/4 per cent a year. Even in the later 1990s growth is
only put at 3 per cent, leaving only a moderate and belated taking-up of the
slack. As the second table shows, the growth projections are a good deal
more pessimistic than those published a year ago. The implication is that
unemployment and unused capacity will carry on rising, at least until 1995.
Not only have growth forecasts been revised downwards, but inflation
prospects have been revised upwards. Underlying inflation is still expected
to be down to 2 per cent by the later 1990s, but it is expected to remain in
the 3 to 4 per cent band - the upper part of the chancellor's range - until
well into the middle of the decade.
In a rather interesting innovation the Treasury publishes alternative growth
assumptions for the medium term, from 1994-95 onwards. These are only half a
percentage point on either side of the central projection. But they make an
enormous difference to the PSBR projections. On the optimistic scenario the
PSBR drops by 1997-98 to 2 1/4 per cent - within the Maastricht guidelines.
On the pessimistic scenario it drops to only 5 1/4 per cent, which most
mainstream analysts regard as unsustainably high.
If the more pessimistic growth rate is due to a low underlying rate of
productivity increase, then there would be little disagreement that still
more public spending curbs and/or tax increases would be required. But
suppose low growth is instead due to deficient demand and a slack British or
world economy, as is quite possible - although not as probable as most of
the businessmen whom I meet seem to think. What would the implications then
be? Surely, in such a case, either the deficit should be allowed to run; or
retrenchment measures would have to be more than offset by a sufficient
loosening of monetary policy.
These issues are entirely dodged by the Treasury documents. Monetary policy
will supposedly be influenced by four main indicators - broad and narrow
money, asset prices and the exchange rate. But despite the 'monitoring'
ranges for the monetary aggregates, we are back to a state where the
Treasury flies by the seat of its pants and weights the four in any way it
likes, or can get away with.
I am not just making the usual teasing point. Nowadays, one should expect
two main features from any monetary strategy. These are some assurance that
demand in nominal terms will grow fast enough to avoid a prolonged
depression, but also some assurance at the other end of the range that
inflation will not be allowed to stray outside the government's own
guidelines. Neither is provided; and the reduction of the section on the
exchange rate to two brief historical sentences speaks volumes. A monetary
strategy has still not been found to replace that of the ERM - which would
in any case have had to be supplemented by a monetary strategy for all the
core member countries.
