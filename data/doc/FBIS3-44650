  [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- China installed power 
generators with a total capacity of more than 12 million kw last 
year, five percent over the state's target. 
  According to the State Planning Commission, altogether 62 
sets of medium- and large-size generators were constructed and 
put into operation, bringing the country's overall generating 
capacity to more than 180 million kw. 
  China has vowed to speed up its power construction to remove 
the bottleneck the present inadequate setup has on economic 
growth. Statistics show that the country's electrical power 
production in 1993 surpassed 800 billion kwh [kw hours]. 
  More emphasis has been put on the installation of medium- 
and 
large-size generators instead of the smaller ones in a bid to 
raise generating efficiency. 
  Meanwhile, the utilization of water energy featured high in 
China's power endeavor last year; hydropower generators with a 
capacity of more than three million kw, or 25 percent of the 
total installed last year, were built. 
  Officials at the State Planning Commission said the 
government has extended preferential treatment to boost the 
development of the power industry. 
  Likewise, they said, local governments have increased their 
investment in power projects.
