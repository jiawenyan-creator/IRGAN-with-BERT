20-STORY TOWER PLANNED; 
AGENCY OKS PLANS FOR HIGH-RISE 
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday approved modified plans to speed 
traffic circulation around the city's largest proposed high-rise office and 
retail development. 
Agency members voted 3 to 2 to permit Homart Development Co. of Chicago to 
proceed with plans to build a 20-story office and retail development at 
Broadway and Brand Boulevard, directly north of the Glendale Galleria. The site 
has been vacant for five years. 
The developer plans to build a second tower 22 stories high after the first 
phase of the project is completed. Construction is tentatively scheduled to 
begin early next year, said Barbara Knight, acting redevelopment director. 
Agency members Larry Zarian and Ginger Bremberg have consistently voted against 
the project on the grounds that the 790,000-square-foot development is 90,000 
square feet larger than the city had deemed suitable for the site and that it 
will worsen downtown traffic congestion. 
In the wake of objections, the developer this week agreed to install additional 
traffic turn lanes, restrict the flow of traffic out of a parking garage to 
right turns only and update traffic signals at major intersections to allow 
protected left turns. 
Despite the changes, Zarian and Bremberg still voted against the project. 
Homart proposes to build the 20-story tower at the southern end of the block 
bounded by Broadway, Brand, Wilson Avenue and Orange Street. A temporary park 
will be built on the northern end of the block, where the 22-story tower 
eventually will be built. The block now is surrounded by a deteriorating 
construction fence.
