  [Text] Sevastopol, 28 Apr -- Mykola Hlushkov, chairman of 
the Sevastopol State Administration, has called on the Ukrainian 
and Russian presidents urgently to settle the issue of the Black 
Sea Fleet. He deems it necessary that city leaders should also 
take part in negotiations, which should address the question of 
purposive economic assistance to the region from the states that 
use the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol for their military 
bases. In his appeal, Mykola Hlushkov says that the situation 
in the region is being further exacerbated because of lack of 
objective information and comments by Ukrainian and Russian 
chief officials regarding actions by the two states' defense 
ministers.
