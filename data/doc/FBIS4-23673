  [Text] Nigerians residing in border areas of the country 
have again been assured of their safety. The director of 
defense information, Brigadier General Fred Chijuka, gave the 
assurance today in an interview with a Radio Nigeria 
correspondent. On alleged invasion of parts of Borno State by 
the Chadian Army, the director said that the report was not 
true. He explained that what happened was that Chadian forces 
clashed with Chadian rebels near the border with Nigeria. 
Brig.-Gen. Chijuka asked people living in the border areas not 
to panic, as the government would ensure adequate protection for 
them at all times.
