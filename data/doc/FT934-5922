FT  27 NOV 93 / Gilt sale 'clue' to tax rises
The Bank of England surprised financial markets yesterday by announcing a
gilt auction for December 8, triggering speculation that next week's Budget
would raise taxes by a large amount, Peter Marsh writes.
The Bank said an unspecified amount of bonds in the maturity range between
2002 and 2006 would go on sale, confounding expectations that the next
auction would not be held until January.
The announcement sparked a surge of buying interest in long-dated gilts,
which closed last night up more than half a point on the view that the
Budget will be positive for gilts.
Many gilt investors would like Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise
taxes on Tuesday by about Pounds 3bn to curb the Pounds 50bn fiscal deficit.
A tightening of this order would be considered good for gilts on the grounds
that it would reduce the volume of bonds to be issued over the next two
years.
The Bank will announce on Budget day the amount of gilts to be sold on
December 8 and the exact maturity.
