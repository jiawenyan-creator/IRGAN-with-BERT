WORLD; 
PERU AID ON LINE, DRUG CZAR SAYS 
Federal anti-drug chief William J. Bennett said today if a reluctant Peruvian 
President-elect Alberto Fujimori refuses to sign a new drug-fighting accord, it 
could cost his nation future U.S. economic aid. 
"One is a condition of the other," Bennett said. "If we don't see serious 
efforts against the drug traffickers, then we aren't going to be inclined to 
offer economic assistance." 
Bennett added, however, that he is hopeful Fujimori will ultimately approve the 
accord under which the United States would provide Peru with $39.9 million in 
military aid in fiscal 1991, all in equipment and training, to help Peruvian 
forces combat cocaine growers, processors and smugglers.
