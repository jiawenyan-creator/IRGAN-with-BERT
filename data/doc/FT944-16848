FT  11 OCT 94 / JP Morgan opens 'black box'
JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is to open up a central component of its
'black box', an internal system for measuring financial risks, to customers
and rivals - indeed to anyone who is interested.
The bank will make the system it uses to measure daily movements in interest
rates - including money markets, swaps, and government bonds - exchange
rates and equity indices available free of charge, even though this has
taken years of work and many millions of dollars to build up. The move is
designed to improve risk management and foster greater stability in markets
for derivatives instruments such as swaps, futures and options whose value
is 'derived' from more conventional assets.
It follows reports by industry bodies, such as the Group of 30 and the Bank
for International Settlements, which have stressed the benefits of a single
consistent measure for calculating market risk. 'This is a tool box rather
than a black box,' said Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, and
head of the G30 study, which recommended the use of a consistent measure to
calculate market risk.
'We believe this is a first step towards better risk management. It should
help companies understand and come to a judgment about their risks,' he
added.
JP Morgan said the system - which it calls 'RiskMetrics' - provides a
consistent methodology for measuring market risks and data needed for daily
evaluation of risk. It provides clients with daily data on both the rate and
volatility of daily movements in rates and measures more than 100,000
correlations between more than 300 financial instruments in 15 markets.
Information will be provided through public access computer networks and
some other channels.
It should allow banks, fund managers and corporate treasurers to assess
their exposure to market risk on a daily basis and estimate the potential
effects of changes in market conditions on the value of their positions.
