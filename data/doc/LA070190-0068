RECORD RACK: *** MANO NEGRA, "PUTA'S FEVER," VIRGIN.: ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE 
OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC). 
This Parisian octet's debut album includes songs in English, French, Spanish 
and Arabic, and sports a rough-edged, sprawling approach reminiscent of the 
Clash's "Sandinista" album. There's a gospel/metal rap about a dead Rasta, a Bo 
Diddley-knows-rockabilly exercise, pure salsa, loopy carnival music. . . . The 
genre-hopping means "Puta's Fever" suffers from an occasional loss of focus, 
but when drummer Santiago Casariego kicks into overdrive, a rowdy verve 
pervades the music. DON SNOWDEN
