FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Confident RPC shows 11% advance to Pounds
4.2m
IN ITS first results since flotation in May, RPC Group, the rigid plastic
packaging company, showed interim pre-tax profits at Pounds 4.24m, an
increase of 11.2 per cent over last time's Pounds 3.81m.
Mr Lindsay Mackinlay, chairman, said during the first half, to
end-September, RPC had traded 'in line with expectations at the time of
flotation'.
The group remained 'confident' about prospects for the second half.
Group sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 36.5m. Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive,
said all the rise represented volume growth.
This sector accounted for 11 per cent of the group's total turnover last
year, and first half volumes had fallen by 23 per cent.
However, this was offset by strength in other markets, such as a 40 per cent
rise in mineral water bottles.
Operating profits were ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 4.39m. Interest charges
rose from Pounds 108,000 to Pounds 154,000 since the company raised less in
the float than it needed to repay preference shares used in part to finance
its management buy-out in 1991.
Earnings per share were 5.4p, after a 28 per cent tax charge, the rate
expected for the year.
A maiden interim dividend of 1p is declared.
