 

This document addresses EPA's proposed action for Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD), Rule
59, Electrical Power Generating Equipment_Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions and Rule 103, Stack Monitoring. Rule 59
and Rule 103 were respectively adopted by VCAPCD on September 15, 1992 and June 4, 1991. The California Air Resources
Board (CARB) submitted these revisions to EPA on November 18, 1993 and October 25, 1991, respectively. The submissions
were found to be complete on December 23, 1993 (Rule 59) and December 18, 1991 (Rule 103), pursuant to EPA's completeness
criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix V,

2

 and are being proposed for approval into the SIP.

EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the
CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216).

 emissions contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. Rule 59 limits nitrogen oxide emissions from
utility boilers in Ventura County, while Rule 103 specifies stack monitoring requirements. The rules were adopted
as part of Ventura County's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and in
response to the CAA requirements cited above. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.



EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 


In determining the approvability of a NO

X

 rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section
110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementation
Plans). The EPA interpretations of these requirements, which form the basis for this action, appear in the NO

X

 Supplement and various other EPA policy guidance documents.

 Among these provisions is the requirement that a NO

X

 rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

 emissions.

 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 ozone and carbon
monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); "Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints,
Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice (Blue Book)
(notice of availability was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 25, 1988).

</FOOTNOTE>


For the purposes of assisting state and local agencies in developing NO

X

 RACT rules, EPA prepared the NO

X

 Supplement to the General Preamble, cited above (57 FR 55620). In the NO

X

 Supplement, EPA provides guidance on how RACT should be determined for major stationary sources of NO

X

 emissions. While most of the guidance issued by EPA on what constitutes RACT for stationary sources has been directed
towards application for VOC sources, much of the guidance is also applicable to RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

 (see section 4.5 of the NO

X

 Supplement). In addition, pursuant to section 183(c), EPA is issuing alternative control techniques documents
(ACTs), that identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources of NO

X

. The ACT documents will provide information on control technology for stationary sources that emit or have the potential
to emit 25 tons per year or more of NO

X

. However, the ACTs will not establish a presumptive norm for what is considered RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

. In general, the guidance documents cited above, as well as other relevant and applicable guidance documents, have
been issued by EPA to ensure that submitted NO

X

 RACT rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
The current SIP-approved version of Rule 59, Electrical Power Generating Equipment_Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions,
has four parts: ``A'' regarding emission limits; ``B'' regarding applicability; ``D'' regarding definitions (approved
on June 6, 1980); and ``C'' regarding exceedance provisions (approved into the SIP on April 11, 1983). The significant
changes in the September 15, 1992 version involve more stringent emission limits, fuel oil provisions, natural gas
curtailment issues, 24-hour rolling average compliance determinations, start-up exemptions, and increments
of progress provisions. In addition, new recordkeeping requirements, test methods, and definitions have been included.
