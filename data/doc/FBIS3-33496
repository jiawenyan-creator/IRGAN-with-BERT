  [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, 
approximately 40 state employees occupied the Guatemalan 
National Palace while hundreds have surrounded the Government 
House to demand a 40 percent salary increase. The move to occupy 
to palace, headed by Armando Sanchez, secretary general of the 
National Federation of State Workers Unions of Guatemala 
[FENASTEG], is part of several pressure measures being carried 
out by the workers, who initiated a 72-hour strike today. 
  Sanchez warned that unless President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
holds an "urgent" meeting with the workers, they will not leave 
the Presidential Palace. The workers at the palace are shouting: 
"We are not leaving." The presidential guard has been increased 
in and around the palace but so far there has been no 
altercations.
