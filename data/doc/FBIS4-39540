  [Text] Dushanbe 9 June TASS -- A border post of the Moscow 
unit on the Tajik-Afghan border came under heavy artillery and 
mortar fire from Afghan territory on Wednesday [8 June] morning. 
Twenty-six artillery shells and mines hit the post between 0610 
and 0915 killing one soldier and wounding another, according to 
Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin. 
  General Chechulin told a press conference here that both the 
soldiers were from a unit of Tajikistan's Defence Ministry 
assigned to reinforce the protection of the Tajik-Afghan border 
at the place. 
  The general stressed that the Russian border troops, none of 
which was hurt in the attack, were returning the fire. 
  The Russian commander said all responsibility for the 
consequences of the action must be taken by the Tajik opposition 
leader and military authorities of the Afghan border region, 
whose silent connivance made the major armed act of provocation 
possible.
