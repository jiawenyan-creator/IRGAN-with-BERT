RESULTS DUE
CONGLOMERATES may be out of fashion, but Tomkins is expected to deliver a
healthy interim profit increase of perhaps 35 per cent today.
With Philips Industries, acquired in August 1990, in for the full six
months, pre-tax profits are estimated to have risen from Pounds 31.2m to
about Pounds 42m. Two thirds of the group's sales are in the US. Murray
Ohio, maker of lawnmowers and bicycles, may have performed well.
Stockbroker analysts in the City expect TSB, the sixth largest UK banking
group, to announce a pre-tax loss of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 60m for
1991, when its annual results are published on Thursday. TSB may have to put
aside about Pounds 665m in provisions against bad loans. A year ago TSB
posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 312m, but heavy losses by Hill Samuel, its
merchant banking arm, drove it into a Pounds 150m pre-tax loss at the
half-way stage.
Asda, the hard-pressed grocery chain, is due to announce a ghastly set of
full-year results on Wednesday.
The food retailing industry has recently been affected by a worrying fall in
sales volumes and Asda has suffered more than most. Small shifts in sales
can have a huge impact on profits because of grocers' high operational
gearing and analysts have therefore forecast a wide spread of profits
estimates ranging from Pounds 5m to Pounds 35m. Last year, Asda made Pounds
58.6m at the half-year stage.
Stakis, the hotel and nursing homes group of which Sir Lewis Robertson took
over as chairman last March, produces its full year results on Tuesday. At
the half year stage, Stakis lost Pounds 45.1m, including Pounds 44m
write-offs as part of Sir Lewis's rescue, which included the sacking of
Andros Stakis as chief executive.
Analysts are forecasting a full year pre-tax loss to the end of September of
between Pounds 47m and Pounds 50m, varying according to their assessments of
how badly Stakis has traded in the second half, during which it has sold its
pubs but not its casinos.
First Leisure is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 30m on Wednesday from its interests in ten-pin bowling, holiday
attractions, discotheques and theatres.
