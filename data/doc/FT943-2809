FT  17 SEP 94 / Move on S Africa exports
South Africa has announced plans to restructure its controversial R2bn
(Pounds 285m) a year General Export Incentive Scheme from next April and
will scrap it completely by the end of 1997. Under the new cabinet-approved
plan, all subsidies currently paid out to exporters under GEIS will be
phased out over three years. The planned cuts are broadly in line with
recommendations by the National Economic Forum, a tripartite group
incorporating representatives from business, government and labour, but have
been strongly opposed by the paper and iron and steel industries. The moves
follow tariffs cuts on various imported goods announced last month and are
part of a sustained effort by the government to increase the competitiveness
of local industry. GEIS was introduced five years ago as part of a programme
to wean South Africa from its overdependence on primary commodity exports by
offering a wide range of subsidies for the export of manufactured goods.
