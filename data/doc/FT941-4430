FT  11 MAR 94 / MPs urge alternatives to job cuts
Employers should consider job-share schemes and flexible working as
alternatives to the 'misery' of redundancies, the Commons employment
committee said in a report published yesterday.
Companies, in consultation with unions, should also consider cuts in
overtime and alternative strategies such as early retirement to try to avoid
compulsory job losses, the committee said.
The MPs underlined the urgency of their conclusions by highlighting the
'evil' of mass unemployment and noting that more than 1m people have been
out of work for more than a year.
Mr Greville Janner, Labour chairman of the committee, urged the Department
of Employment to set up a task force to give advice to employers before
redundancies were made. At present employment department officials give
advice after job losses have been announced - 'mopping up the dead on the
battle-field instead of trying to prevent the slaughter,' Mr Janner said.
He suggested that training and enterprise councils, which deliver government
training schemes in England and Wales, and local enterprise companies, the
Scottish development bodies, should co-ordinate local responses to
unemployment and develop the task force approach with local authorities.
Tecs are one of several partners in local economic development, and the
report said some members of the committee did not consider that they or the
Lecs had yet successfully developed this role.
