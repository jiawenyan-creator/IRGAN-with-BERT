FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Petrochemical sees
loss
MITSUBISHI Petrochemical expects to post a pre-tax loss for the six months
which ended in September, the group's first deficit since 1982, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
The size of the expected loss was not spelled out, but a spokesman said the
company is planning to issue a downward revision of its earnings outlook
early next week.
The company said that the announcement would also clarify if there will be
an interim dividend.
Mitsubishi Petrochemicals had been expecting to pay a dividend of between Y4
and Y6 a share for 1993-94.
Like other companies in its industry, Mitsubishi Petrochemical has suffered
from the decline in petrochemical sales during the economic slowdown.
Mitsubishi Rayon plans shortly to announce revisions to its forecasts as the
six-month results are likely to deviate more than 30 per cent from earlier
estimates. These suggested that the group was heading for a Y800m (Dollars
7.6m) parent net profit in the six months ended September, against Y1.28bn a
year earlier.
