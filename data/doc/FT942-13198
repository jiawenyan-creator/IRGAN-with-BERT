FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro rises to NKr877m in
first term
Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy and fertiliser group, yesterday announced
a rise in first-quarter net profit to NKr877m (Dollars 119.29m) from NKr506m
in the same period last year.
The advance was helped by a positive NKr127m net effect of accounting
changes, higher petroleum production and stronger results from the
agriculture division.
Higher prices for several of the group's main products and a stronger dollar
also contributed to the upturn.
Group operating revenue improved to NKr17.3bn from NKr16.5bn while operating
income emerged at NKr1.6bn, against NKr1.5bn. Hydro said that although
operating income showed little change, the first-quarter result was stronger
than last year's fourth quarter.
The impact of lower crude oil prices was largely offset by increased oil
production. The oil price during the quarter was Dollars 14 per barrel,
compared with Dollars 18 a year ago, while petroleum production  - of which
oil accounted for 77 per cent of total output - rose to 2.9m tonnes of oil
equivalent from 2.2m.
Hydro explained that the lower dollar oil price was also partly offset by
the higher average dollar exchange rate but the oil price stated in
Norwegian kroner for the 1994 first quarter was nevertheless 18 per cent
lower than in last year's first quarter.
The company said there was a general underlying improvement in the economies
of main markets.
For the group's individual segments, agriculture lifted first-quarter
operating income to NKr430m from NKr257m as sales rose to NKr7.6bn from
NKr7.4bn.
The oil and gas division saw operating income fall to NKr863m from NKr902m
as sales increased to NKr3.7bn from NKr3.6bn.
Petrochemicals boosted operating income to NKr133m from NKr112m as sales
rose to NKr1.2bn from NKr1.1bn.
