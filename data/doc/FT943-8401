FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hasbro to merge toy operations
Hasbro, the US toys and games group, is reorganising and merging all its US
toy operations into a single entity, US Toy Group, effective immediately,
AP-DJ reports from Pawtucket.
Mr John O'Neill, chief financial officer, said that the company expected to
take a third-quarter pre-tax charge of between Dollars 10m and Dollars 12m
as a result of the changes.
Under the reorganisation, the Hasbro name will no longer be used as a brand
name for specific products, but reserved for corporate use only.
In last year's third quarter, ended September 26 1993, the company reported
net income of Dollars 75.55m, or 84 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 812m.
Hasbro said the reorganisation would result in the loss of about 100 jobs,
or about 9 per cent of its domestic toy work force. It has a total US work
force of about 7,600.
The reorganisation will merge Playskool, Playskool Baby, Hasbro Toy, Kid
Dimension and Kenner.
The group will report to Mr Alfred Verrecchia, chief operating officer of
all domestic toy operations. Mr Dan Owen, currently president of the
Play-skool division, will be president of the US Toy Group.
The company said the reorganisation would allow it to bring new products to
market more quickly and 'to become even closer partners with our retailers'.
The games segment of Hasbro's US operations, consisting of Milton Bradley
and Kenner Parker, is not affected.
