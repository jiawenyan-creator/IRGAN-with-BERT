FT  31 DEC 93 / Ambulances 'fail to meet targets'
One-third of ambulance services in England and 44 per cent in Wales are
failing to meet minimum response time targets, according to figures
published by Unison, the public-service union.
The union said that the problem was exacerbated by cuts in staffing and
funding. The number of jobs in the ambulance service has fallen by 6.6 per
cent since 1987 and there was a 10 per cent cut in spending between 1980 and
1990, it added.
