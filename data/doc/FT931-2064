FT  22 MAR 93 / Kuwait may cut back independence of KIO
THE Kuwaiti government met yesterday to discuss proposals to merge the
London-based Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) with its parent institution in
Kuwait, the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA).
Mr Abdulla al-Rhodan, the finance minister, has nominated the KIO president,
Mr Ali Rashaid al-Badr, to become chief of both organisations and centralise
decision-making in Kuwait.
The proposal, if successful, could reduce the independence of the KIO and
undermine the positions of many of its non-Kuwaiti investment staff. The KIO
is already considering making redundancies at its London headquarters.
The KIO's Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40.3bn) investment portfolio was cut to less
than Dollars 20bn by the costs of the Gulf War.
Analysts believe the efforts to merge the KIO into the KIA is a direct
attack on the power of the Kuwaiti prime minister and Crown Prince, Sa'ad
al-Sabah.
A public campaign run by the new management of the KIO has convinced
Kuwaitis that former KIO managers lost or mismanaged up to Dollars 5bn in
Spain.
Although the scandal has strengthened critics of the Crown Prince, it is not
clear how quickly Mr al-Rhodan could push through his proposals.
Mr Abdullah al-Gabandi, managing director of the KIA and protege of the
Crown Prince, is understood to have still two years of his term to run.
