FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - Ireland
Any easing of Irish monetary policy is considered unlikely, despite the
punt's much greater freedom of movement, writes Tim Coone.
The government's main concern is maintaining investor confidence in the punt
 -around 30 per cent of Irish gilts are held overseas - and preventing the
value of foreign borrowings rising any higher than the present level of
around IPounds 11bn (Pounds 10.4bn).
According to the finance ministry, the punt will be pegged to a
trade-weighted index of currencies, mainly sterling, the D-Mark and the US
dollar. A policy review is planned in six months. 'At all costs we will be
aiming to squeeze out inflation,' said a spokesman.
Restraining public sector borrowing and pay will continue to have high
priority. Irish interest rates are now at a 30 year low. 'If there is a
consensus in Europe that rates generally should fall further, then we will
follow that trend, but we will not be cutting rates otherwise,' he said. The
principal concern about easing interest rates further would be the danger of
triggering an outflow of funds.
Mr Chris Johns, chief economist at the Bank of Ireland, said: 'There has
been a very bad experience here from the late 1970s and early 1980s with the
go-for-growth approach, with the result that the monetary authorities are
now very cautious and conservative. There is no strong constituency here. .
. . that would argue in favour of a go-for-growth strategy now.'
