  [Text] According to preliminary data, the Slovak state 
budget for 1993 ended in a 22 billion koruna deficit. Julius 
Toth, deputy prime minister and finance minister, said at a 
meeting of the government's economic council that the Cabinet 
had to tackle some problems and release some finances at the end 
of the year. Expenses in health service and education had risen 
considerably, and this resulted in an increase of the overall 
budget deficit. 
  With regard to the unfavourable result of 1993 payments with 
the Czech Republic, Julius Toth said that Slovakia's negative 
balance was caused by pre-Christmas imports from the Czech 
Republic.
