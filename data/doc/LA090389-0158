Federal officials seized a small Lebanese jet that landed without permission in 
Harrisburg, Pa., and questioned three passengers who they feared could be 
terrorists. An investigation showed they were not terrorists but aliens who 
failed to check in with immigration officials, said Henry Brattlie, deputy 
director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service office in 
Philadelphia. He said the jet, with two pilots and at least six others on 
board, left London and landed at Harrisburg International Airport last Sunday 
after disregarding orders to travel to Philadelphia for an immigration 
inspection. Brattlie said the $13-million jet was seized and three passengers 
detained after the jet returned to Harrisburg from Burbank, Calif. A U.S. 
attorney said the three detainees were released while officials decide whether 
to press charges.
