FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
Those Lonrho shareholders who have supported Mr Tiny Rowland through thick
and thin may regret yesterday's resignation. But investors seem set to
benefit financially now that Mr Dieter Bock has finally won his power
struggle. Mr Rowland's buccaneering style had outlived its useful purpose
and he seemed more keen to cling on to a disparate empire than deliver
shareholder value. The fact that Mr Bock has no proven ability to run a
conglomerate may matter little. The best way to add value is probably to
break Lonrho up. Mr Bock should be able to achieve that.
