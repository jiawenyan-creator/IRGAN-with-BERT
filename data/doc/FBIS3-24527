  [Abstract] Screening studies of soil bacteria for 
restriction endonucleases led to the isolation of restrictase 
Bco116 I from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus coagulans 116. 
Determinations of the activity spectrum on a series of phages 
resulted in the identification of the following nucleotide 
sequence as the target site: (5')-CTCTTCN-&gt; NNNN- (3')-GAGAAGN 
NNNN-&gt; -, where -&gt;  indicates cleavage points. Specificity of 
Bco116 I identifies it as an isoschizomer of Ksp632 I. Maximum 
Bco116 I activity was expressed under the following conditions: 
10 mM tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM 
MgCl[.sup]2[/], 1 mM dithiothreitol and 60C. Figures 2;
