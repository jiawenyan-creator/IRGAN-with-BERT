THE MIND BEHIND THE AX IN 'KILLING' ON CBS 
It's perfectly clear as the plot unfolds in "Killing in a Small Town," airing 
tonight at 9 on Channels 2 and 8, that Candy Morrison gave her neighbor 41 
whacks with an ax. Candy finally confesses it all. 
Pretty elementary stuff, Watson. 
But in this true-life murder in Texas 10 years ago, there's a puzzler that 
pulls us into this rather gripping mystery story: Candy had an affair with 
Peggy Blankenship's husband. She admits hacking Peggy. But is she guilty? 
The mystery here is mystery of the mind. We don't want to give away too much 
and spoil your enjoyment of a good ax murder, but as her defense counsel (Brian 
Dennehy) and her psychiatrist (Hal Holbrook) wend their way through Candy's 
psyche, they finally reach her most profound fears and unleash twisting, 
wrenching primal screams. As the sweet and raging Candy, a pleasant young wife 
and mother who sings in the church choir, Barbara Hershey delivers a 
multilayered performance of poignancy and pain that begs for a cascade of 
adjectives. 
The resolve is a mixed blessing. Candy believes she's a monster; the doctor 
assures her that she's just like the rest of us. Candy returns: "Is that 
supposed to comfort me?"IRV LETOFSKY
