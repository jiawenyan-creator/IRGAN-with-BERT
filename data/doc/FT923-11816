FT  22 JUL 92 / Korean row over nuclear and aid issues
NORTH Korea yesterday criticised South Korea for linking economic aid to the
resolution of a dispute over mutual nuclear inspections, writes John Burton
in Seoul.
The criticism, made during a meeting on the nuclear issue, coincides with a
visit this week by the North Korean deputy prime minister, Mr Kim Dal Hyun,
to industrial facilities in the South. Seoul officials are hoping to use the
visit of Mr Kim, North Korea's senior economic official, to persuade
Pyongyang to accept spot inspections of suspected nuclear research
facilities in return for investments by South Korean companies.
