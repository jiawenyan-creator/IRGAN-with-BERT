FT  17 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government must accept risks in
encouraging small companies
Sir, Our confusion between 're-enervating' and 're-energising' the British
entrepreneur, spotted by Observer in his column ('English disease', December
9) may have been a subconscious reflection of our lack of real enthusiasm
for the government's policy towards small companies.
As accountants specialising in advising owner-managed businesses, we welcome
the additional measures introduced in the Budget. However, our fundamental
problem remains to be tackled: lack of finance for small companies. The new
Venture Capital Trusts, for reasons of management economics, will prefer to
make funds available in chunks of hundreds of thousands of pounds rather
than the tens of thousands required by really small enterprises.
One answer lies in the Loan Guarantee Scheme, which the chancellor has
promised to review. The fact that since the beginning of this financial year
only Pounds 121.75m has been lent under this scheme shows how ineffective
and hamstrung by red tape it currently is.
The government must make dramatic changes to simplify procedures and broaden
its availability. In doing so it must recognise that it cannot expect to go
unscathed - reasonable risks must be taken and some losses will be incurred.
But unless a real commitment is made in this way, the small business sector
will never make the contribution to prosperity and employment that it could.
