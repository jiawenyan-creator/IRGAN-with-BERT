<F P=106> [Interview with Independent Electoral Commission Chairman </F>
Johann Kriegler in the Johannesburg studio by announcer Max du 
Preez in the Cape Town parliamentary studio, on the "Agenda" 
program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Du Preez] Judge Kriegler, can 
I ask you: Was there sabotage of the election and of the 
election campaign? We hear of millions of ballot papers 
disappearing and we have just heard about a computer program 
being tampered with. Was there sabotage? 
  [Kriegler] Concerning the distribution aspect I would rather 
keep an open mind. The case is being investigated and there are 
signs indicating sabotage, but at this stage, in my opinion, 
these allegations are not strong enough to base a decision on. 
Concerning the computer -- that was undoubtedly sabotage. It 
was not accidental, the fact that early yesterday morning during 
a specified period, certain false data was fed into the 
computer. [passage omitted]
