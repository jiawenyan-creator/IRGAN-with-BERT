  [Excerpts] The People's Assembly today approved four bills 
and, at the request of the Socialist Party [PS] parliamentary 
group, the deputies questioned Defense Minister Safet Xhulali on 
the recent elections in Zall-Herr. Gezim Qinami, our 
correspondent to the People's Assembly, reports: 
  [Qinami] [passage omitted] The session then posed questions 
to Defense Minister Zhulali that were requested by the PS 
parliamentary group. The question asked was: Besides the 
elections for the commune chairman in Zall-Herr, are there any 
other reasons for the temporary deployment of hundreds of 
soldiers at the Zall- Herr military unit? 
  Taking the floor, Mr. Zhulali said that the movements of 
soldiers in Zall-Herr has nothing to do with the elections; this 
is the first part of the answer. If you want to know why 
soldiers have been deployed there, I can tell you. The 
Zall-Herr unit is a special one. It has a certain staff 
regardless of whether there is a mobilization or demobilization 
of soldiers, and it is always on full alert. I honestly declare 
that, during the elections in Zall-Herr, we did not have a 
single soldier more than the designated staff. 
  Regarding Mr. Zhulali's answer, Deputy Luan Hajdaraga 
rejoined, calling the Zall-Herr elections unlawful. 
  In the name of the parliamentary Commission of Defense, 
Public Order, and ShIK [National Information Service], Mr. Azem 
Hajdari said that the Zall-Herr elections were conducted in 
conformity with the legislation approved by this parliament. 
  After the discussion, the proceedings ended.
