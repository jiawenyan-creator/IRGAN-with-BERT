BRIEFLY 
Cash Offered for Buying American Car: A company chairman grew tired of seeing 
foreign cars in his firm's parking lot, so he offered a bounty -- $1,000 to any 
employee who buys an American-made car or light truck. "All it's got to be is 
an American label on an American-made car," said Peter Rossin, chairman of 
Dynamet Inc. in southwestern Pennsylvania. "A Honda car made in Ohio doesn't 
qualify because the profits derived from that car go back to Japan."
