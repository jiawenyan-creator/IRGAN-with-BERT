FT  05 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Latvia plan
Scandinavian Airlines and a US-based investment firm presented plans on
Friday for a new international carrier based in Latvia.
The plan, which was requested by Latvia and seems assured of approval, calls
for replacing two current Lativan airlines with one system based in Riga.
The new carrier, which has not yet been given a name, would use the Latvian
capital as a hub and initially would fly within the Baltics and neighboring
countries.
