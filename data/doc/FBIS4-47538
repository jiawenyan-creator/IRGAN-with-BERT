  [Abstract] The role of human interleukin-1_a_--a 
polypeptide hormone with a molecular weight of approximately 
17.5 kDa which stimulate thymocyte and B-lymphocyte 
proliferation--and known functional differences between human 
interleukin-1_a_ (hIL-1_a_) and hIL-1_b_--very similar 
proteins 
which share a 26% homology and compete for the same 
cellular 
receptors--necessitated an experiment to clone hIL-1_a_ cDNA 
and 
express the fragment of this DNA which encodes the functionally 
mature hIL-1_a_. As a result, the hIL-1_a_ gene was cloned by 
hybridization screening with chemically synthesized 
oligonucleotide probes from the cDNA library. cDNA was 
synthesized on (poly-A[.sup]+[/])-mRNA isolated from human 
donor blood monocytes induced by additions of concanavalin and 
prodigiosine. Thus, a recombinant plasmid, pET-TGATG0hiL-1_a_, 
was constructed, enabling high-level biosynthesis of 
biologically active hIL-1_a_ in E. coli BL21 (DE3) 
after induction with IPTG of the T7 phage RNA polymerase 
synthesis and subsequent transcription of artificial TGATG 
overlapping with the hIL-1_a_ gene as a distant part of it. The 
resulting recombinant hIL-1_a_ strain can be helpful in 
obtaining large quantities of cukaryotic protein for subsequent 
use in basic research and medical applications. The authors are 
grateful to F.W. Studier for supplying expression vector 
plasmids and to S.V. Kuchin and Ye.V. Velichko for discussions.
