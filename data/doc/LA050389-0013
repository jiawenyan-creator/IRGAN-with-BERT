MINIMUM WAGE 
By his refusal to allow not even a nickel raise in the minimum wage of $3.35 
throughout his two terms, President Reagan added immeasurable suffering to the 
bleak lives of millions of Americans. 
That moral obtuseness is now being addressed by Congress. However, in spite of 
his vision of a "kinder, gentler America," President Bush has vowed to veto the 
proposed increase which will gradually reach $4.55 by 1991. This promised veto 
speaks more clearly than the catchy rhetoric of his speech writers. It looks 
like America's poor are going to have another tough four years.
