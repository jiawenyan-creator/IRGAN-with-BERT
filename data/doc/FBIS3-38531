<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Talks With Syria on Implementing </F>
Fourth Financial Protocol"; as released by Brussels Textline 
database] 
  [Text] Following the vote by the European Parliament, which 
last December issued its assent to the fourth financial protocol 
between the EC and Syria (which had remained deadlocked for a 
long time because Parliament was demanding certain assurances on 
the situation in this country), a European Commission delegation 
has made a trip to Damascus to prepare implementation of the 
protocol. Led by Eberhardt Rhein, the delegation met the prime 
minister and several ministers who will be concerned by the use 
of the protocol funding. 
  According to available information, out of 190 million 
dollars, 140 million will be spent on infrastructures 
(electricity, water, roads and irrigation) and 50 million on 
projects in the areas of trade, tourism, training and the 
promotion of investment. The delegation will next report to 
Jordan.
