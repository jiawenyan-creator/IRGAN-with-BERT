FT  04 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): French stocks in focus move
against the trend
The NAPM index of manufacturing activity in the US gave European bond
markets an uncomfortable afternoon, confirming an established mood of
concern, some pessimism and a general lack of appetite for investment in
most equity markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was already concerned with the lack of scope for further interest rate
reductions, and with worries such as the future of the politicians Messrs
Longuet and Leotard, said Mr Michael Woodcock, French market analyst at
Nikko Europe, as the CAC 40 index fell a further 26.42 to a new 1994 low of
1,852.83.
However, the stocks of the day mostly ran against the trend. In this
category, Credit Lyonnais certificates delivered a rebound of FFr42 or 10.8
per cent to FFr430 after a high of FFr462, and a meeting last Friday between
the chairman of the bank, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, and market analysts. The
latter said Mr Peyrelevade had been more positive about promised state
support.
Thomson-CSF, which owns 19 per cent of Credit Lyonnais, rose FFr8 or 5.8 per
cent to FFr147. At the same time, Chargeurs, the textiles group and former
CAC 40 constituent which owns 17.5 per cent of BSkyB, shot up FFr77 or 6.3
per cent to FFr1,297 on the latter's flotation plans.
On the downside, LVMH continued its correction, losing FFr30 at FFr842 as
trading in its Au Bon Marche, Financiere Agache and Arnault et Associes
subsidiaries was suspended ahead of an announcement; and Pernod, with
results due after hours, dropped FFr12 to FFr291.
ZURICH's attention remained glued to the forthcoming battle between UBS and
Mr Martin Ebner's BK Bank, and the SMI index, also taking its lead from
lower bourses elsewhere, fell 34.9 or 1.4 per cent to 2,499.5.
UBS bearers declined SFr30 to SFr1,170 and the registered shares, which have
five times the voting power of the bearers, slipped SFr20 to SFr283. Late in
the day, the Zurich prosecutor's office said it would launch a preliminary
inquiry into the possibility of insider trading in UBS shares before the
bank announced its plans for a capital restructuring on Friday.
BK Vision, the investment company controlled by BK Bank, dipped SFr100 to
SFr1,300. Other so called BK shares, in which BK Vision has substantial
holdings, extended Friday's losses. Roche certificates gave up SFr155 to
SFr5,630 and Zurich Insurance was SFr37 lower at SFr1,150.
Swiss Re registered picked up SFr18 to SFr644 in continued response to its
decision to sell its direct insurance holdings.
Bearers in Elvia, suspended on Friday on the news that the group was being
sold to Germany's Allianz, rocketed SFr1,555 or 80.1 per cent to SFr3,475.
Allianz has committed itself to offering Elvia's minority shareholders a
maximum price of SFr3,915 per bearer share.
MILAN saw selling accelerate as the day progressed on the view that with the
budget proposals now published, and a largely positive string of six-month
corporate announcements now concluded, all the good news was now in the
market, and political clouds could soon be gathering.
The Comit index fell 12.03 or 1.8 per cent to 667.74 following last Friday's
1.6 per cent drop.
Fiat led the decline with a L189 fall to L6,480. James Capel, which upgraded
the stock after last week's substantially better than expected half-year
results, commented that in spite of the strong performance of the shares
this year - up by almost 40 per cent against the Comit index - the price
appeared to be well underpinned by fundamentals and could move ahead in the
short term as analysts raised their forecasts.
Banks continued to be hit by continuing gloom over their poor first-half
figures. Banco di Napoli fell L182 or 11.5 per cent to L1,498, further hurt
by speculation that it might be about to launch a capital increase. BCI lost
L156 at L3,730 and Ambrovento was L219 down at L4,166.
AMSTERDAM was lower on bond market weakness and London's performance and the
AEX index shed 3.49 to 398.78.
Scattered issues bucked the trend, however, with Royal Dutch Petroleum up 80
cents to Fl 188, helped by the firmer dollar.
KNP BT closed 80 cents down at Fl 51.20 and brokers expected it to come
under further pressure today following news after the market closed that a
proposed merger with Ivan Allen, of the US, was not going ahead.
MADRID's bond and equity markets did better than most, the general index for
the latter falling 2.77 to 294.69. Dealers said investors were very nervous
about trends in other bond markets, and concerned that the real time Ibex
equity index would break positively downwards through support at 3,125,
after which they thought it might fall to 3,000. As it was, the Ibex
bottomed at 3,121.41 before recovering to 3,149.08.
TEL AVIV surrendered 1.8 per cent on profit-taking but this meant little
after two days of gains, especially Sunday's 3 per cent advance following
the announcement of a partial lifting of the Arab boycott by six Gulf
countries. Turnover was low at Shk131m as the Mishtanim index finished 3.41
off at 189.71.
ISTANBUL fell 1.7 per cent on missing signatures from three government
ministers of Turkey's draft privatisation bill. The index dropped 451.86 to
26,373.67 after a gain of 4.1 per cent last week.
