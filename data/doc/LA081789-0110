CHINA SUSPENDS U.S. FULBRIGHT SCHOLAR EXCHANGE 
China has suspended participation in the prestigious Fulbright program, 
forbidding an exchange of American professors and Chinese scholars in the wake 
of strained relations between the two nations over China's internal crackdown, 
officials said Wednesday. 
Richard Ware, chairman of the Board of Foreign Scholarships, said China told 
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that "no American Fulbright professors would be 
permitted to teach in China and that no Chinese graduate students or research 
scholars would be allowed to travel to the U.S." 
Ware said that in recent years, the China Fulbright program has been one of the 
largest in the world, with 24 American professors and a similar number of 
Chinese scholars participating. 
The 24 American professors assigned to China will be offered Fulbright teaching 
posts in other countries that have not been chosen yet, said W. B. Reinckens of 
the U.S. Information Agency.
