  [Text] Beijing, Feb 26 (XINHUA) -- China plans to send a 
research team to the Arctic in a year's time, according a 
scientist in charge of the research program here today. 
  At the first seminar on Chinese scientific research in the 
Arctic, Wei Menghua, director of the research preparatory group, 
said that the team will set off in mid-February, 1995, and is 
expected to reach the North Pole in early May. 
  He said the team's priority will be global change research 
in 
the Arctic, covering fields such as meteorology, maritime 
biology, glaciology and environmental science. 
  The researchers plan to get to the Arctic area via Russia, 
Wei said, noting that nine out of 11 successful expeditions 
internationally to the North Pole since 1909 went via Canada. 
  "It does not make much sense to follow passes others opened, 
as we are an Asian country and it's the first research team from 
China to the Arctic," explained Wei. 
  To ensure success, Wei said, members of the group will 
undergo simulated training at the end of this year along the 
Heilongjiang in north China. 
  According to Wei, the North Pole is ideal for conducting 
scientific research on space, earth and atmosphere, oceans, and 
the structure of the earth, especially on global change. 
  The International Arctic Science Committee, a 
nongovernmental 
international organization, was set up in 1991 to encourage 
cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research. Fourteen 
countries have so far joined it. Wei said China is going to 
promote cooperation with these countries through its scientific 
research.
