ACTION:

 Notice of Implementation of Policy.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that special use permit fees for commercial uses on National Wildlife Refuges (refuges) in
Alaska have been revised. The revised fee schedule became effective on January 1, 1993. Fees equal to 50% of the fee
schedule were charged during 1993, and full fees are being charged in 1994. The public was aware of this fee change through
public meetings and other appropriate notice. However, as a policy matter, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)
desires to publish this Notice through the 

Federal Register

. 


The revised fee schedule has been incorporated into the Service Policy Manual for Region 7 (Alaska). The fee revision
was needed so that the Service could meet Federal mandates. These mandates require fee determinations to be based
on fair market values, and that the Service attempt to recover costs of administering revenue producing commercial
activities on refuge lands. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 This revised fee schedule was effective on January 1, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Service is implementing the following fee schedule for commercial guides, outfitters, and transporters that
are issued special use permits to conduct commercial operations on refuges in Alaska. Fees for other non-recreational
types of commercial activities that involve removing marketable resources or utilizing reserved sites will not
be based on the following fee schedule. Fees for these types of commercial activities will be determined by the Service's
Division of Realty and will be based on fair market analysis surveys. These surveys will be conducted periodically
to assure that fees reflect current market values. 


The Service considered a number of methods for meeting the required mandates. Four alternatives were given serious
consideration and were published in the May 31, 1991, 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 24827) to receive public comment. These alternatives were: (1) A single fixed fee of $350 for all commercial
permittees, (2) a fee schedule based on type of commercial use activity and actual client numbers, (3) a fee schedule
based on permittee calculations, made after the permit use period, of 3% of adjusted gross income derived from commercial
activities that are authorized by special use permit on refuge lands, and (4) a fee schedule based on permittee estimates,
made prior to the permit use period, of 3% of anticipated adjusted gross income derived from commercial activities
that are authorized by special use permit on refuge lands. 
The Service had proposed to adopt alternative 4 because it appeared that it would be (1) equitable to all commercial
use permittees, regardless of the scale of their operation; (2) charging a fair market value; (3) reasonably consistent
with the fee schedule of other Federal agencies in Alaska; and (4) cost effective for the government to administer.
Thirty-five comments were received from individuals, professional organizations, and state and Federal agencies
in response to the published 

Federal Register

 notice. After review and consideration of the comments received, the Service decided not to implement this alternative.
Public comments identified several potential inequities in the originally proposed alternative and strongly supported
a flat fee or a client use-day system. A flat fee was reconsidered but was not selected because the Service believes
it is not equitable to all commercial operators since the scale of operations is highly variable among users. As a result
of public comment, the Service is implementing the following fee system which is based on the type of activity and number
of client use-days. The specific fee for each type of client use-day is based on an adjusted three percent of gross receipts
figure which returns approximately 1.52.0 percent of the typical daily rate charged to clients by commercial
guides, outfitters, and transporters in Alaska. 
The Service's fee schedule system requires a non-refundable $100.00 administrative fee charged at the issuance
of a permit and a predetermined fee for client use-days, based on the activity, charged following each session of use.
Client use-day fees for all guiding, outfitting, and transporting commercial operations on Alaska refuges are:



Guiding-Outfitting 


A. Brown Bear_$15.00 per client use-day ($100 minimum) on Alaska Peninsula, Becharof, Izembek and Kodiak refuges.

B. Brown/Grizzly Bear_$10.00 per client use-day on all other refuges. 
C. Moose and Dall Sheep_$10.00 per client use-day. 
D. All Other Hunted Species_$5.00 per client use-day. 
E. Sport Fishing_$2.00 per client use-day. 
F. River Floating_$2.00 per client use-day. 
G. Photography/Birding/Wilderness Adventures/Other_$2.00 per client use-day. 
H. All Transporters_$2.00 per client use-day. 



The Service will review and issue an adjustment to these fees every three years. Adjustments will be based on the Implicit
Price Deflator Index (IPDI) which is compiled annually by the Department of Commerce and is published in February
of each year as part of the ``Economic Report of the President'' for Congress. 
Permittees will be required to obtain a special use permit from each refuge that they operate on and full fees will be
collected by each refuge. Client use-day fees will be based on actual client use days and be in addition to the $100 administrative
fee. A ``client use-day'' shall be defined as one calendar day, or any portion thereof, for each client using the refuge.
If clients are concurrently participating in more than one activity during the same calendar day, the highest client
use-day rate will be used for that day. 
The permittee is responsible for record keeping and reporting the actual number of client use-days to the refuge manager
and shall be required to report actual use within 30 days of the end of the authorized use period, unless otherwise stated
in the permit. The refuge manager is responsible for computing the actual fees owed the government and issuing a bill
for collection within 30 days of receipt of the use report. Permittees are responsible to pay the fees within 30 days
of receipt of the bill for collection. A permittee will not be issued a new special use permit until all fees have been
paid. Special use permits issued for several year terms may be revoked during the term of the permit if annual fees are
not paid within the required 30 day period. 
Fees for reserved land sites (e.g., cabins, tent platforms, caches, etc.) associated with commercial operations
remained at the $100 flat fee during 1993. The Division of Realty conducted a fair market value analysis survey for
reserved land sites on a refuge-by-refuge basis during 1993. Revised reserved land site fees will become effective
in late 1994.
