On September 27, 1994, the Amex submitted a draft Amex Information Circular to members which discusses the substance
of the amendments to Amex Rules 575, 576, 577 and 585. This draft circular is being approved as part of the Amex's proposal
herein. The Amex Information Circular provides that the written designation of the registered investment adviser:
be signed by the beneficial owner of securities; be addressed to the member organization; include the name of the designated
investment adviser, and specify that the investment adviser is being designated to receive the proxy and related
materials and vote the proxy. It also requires Amex member organizations to assure themselves that the designated
investment adviser is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that such adviser exercises investment
discretion pursuant to an advisory contract, and maintains records substantiating this information. The Amex Information
Circular further specifies that beneficial owners of securities have an unqualified right at any time to rescind
designation of the investment adviser to receive materials to vote proxies. The rescission must be in writing and
submitted to the member organization. The draft Amex Information Circular also added a statement that member organizations
may wish to provide consolidated proxies and related materials to investment advisers designated by beneficial
owners to exercise voting discretion.

II. Description of the Proposal



The Exchange is amending several Amex Rules related to the giving of proxies and the transmission of proxy and other
related materials. Specifically, the Exchange is amending Amex Rules: 575 (``Giving of Proxies Restricted''),
576 (``Transmission of Proxy Material to Customers''), 577 (``Giving Proxies by Member Organization''), and 585
(``Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material'').

The amendments to Amex Rules 575, 576, 577 and 585 will permit registered investment advisers who exercise investment
discretion pursuant to an advisory contract, and who have been designated in writing by the beneficial owner of the
securities, to receive proxy materials, annual reports and other related material, and to vote proxies in lieu of
the beneficial owners. The term investment adviser is defined to include a registered broker-dealer (

e.g., 

a member organization).

This portion of the Amex proposal is substantially similar to a proposal recently approved for the NYSE. See Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 34596 (August 25, 1994), 59 FR 45050 (``NYSE Approval Order''). Although no comments were
received on the Amex proposal, the Commission received five comment letters supporting this change of the NYSE.

</FOOTNOTE>


Currently, Exchange rules prohibit a member organization from voting proxies, on a discretionary basis, on securities
held in its custody, unless the securities are beneficially owned by a member organization, or the beneficial owner
has failed to provide the member organization with voting instructions and the subject of the vote is non-substantive.
Currently, Exchange rules also require member organizations to transmit proxy and related issuer materials, as
well as requests for voting instructions, to each beneficial owner of stock held in the member organization's possession
or control. Rule 576.60 explicitly requires that proxy material be sent to a beneficial owner even though such owner
has instructed the member organization not to do so.
