FT  19 OCT 93 / Defeat on farm quota payments
THE government was defeated in the Lords last night over the introduction of
new farming quota payments.
A motion from Lord Hamilton of Dalzell (Conservative) strongly criticising
the new regime for sheep and suckler cow farming, was approved by 69 votes
to 52. But the government, which is expected to ignore the vote, insisted
that what the Lords wanted was illegal.
The new quotas, which took effect in July, were strongly critised by
landowning peers, who said they would lower land values and harm tenants in
poorer agricultural areas.
Earl Howe, junior agriculture minister, insisted that the government had
done everything it legally could to protect tenants and landowners from the
EC quota regime.
