  [Text] Prague--Czech diplomatic policy considers air 
strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be an extreme means of exerting 
pressure that may contribute to resolving some of the specific 
issues but, obviously, cannot act as a substitute for an overall 
political solution to the conflict. This point of view is 
contained in a statement from the Czech Foreign Ministry issued 
yesterday by its Press Department. The Foreign Ministry is 
extremely alarmed by recent developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
It considers the Saturday [5 February] massacre of the civilian 
population in Sarajevo to be an extreme manifestation of 
brutality. The UN Security Council, of which the Czech Republic 
is a nonpermanent member, has already adopted a resolution that 
makes it possible to use air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
strictly specified cases. The tragedy in Sarajevo's market 
should finally induce all three warring factions to display a 
real political interest in resolving the conflict around the 
negotiating table, declares the Czech Foreign Ministry's 
statement.
