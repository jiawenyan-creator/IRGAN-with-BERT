<F P=106> [Presentation and question and answer session by Ruben Dario </F>
Carles, presidential candidate of the Civic Renewal Party, 
National Renewal Movement, and Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement, with students from the Technological University, Santa 
Maria La Antigua, and the University of Panama at the station's 
studios; moderated by Ricardo Samaniego; from the "Young Vote 
'94" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samaniego] Good evening, Professor Carles, and 
welcome to "Young Vote '94." We are accompanied by students 
from the three universities: the Technological University, Santa 
Maria La Antigua, and the University of Panama. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Samaniego] Here is student [first name not given] Armuelles 
of Santa Maria La Antigua University. 
  [Armuelles] Good evening, professor. We all know that 
history is written by the winners. Former governments have 
traditionally used primary and secondary school textbooks to 
record their own interpretation of history. I would like to 
know how your administration will interpret the 21 years of 
military government, and particularly the U.S. invasion. 
  [Carles] I believe that history is obvious, but it must be 
made public knowledge. There was an obscure period here when 
things were not communicated to the people; they were not 
informed. We must reveal the facts so each person can draw his 
own conclusions. 
  [Armuelles] But Professor, something is missing. What about 
the U.S. invasion? What interpretation will be made of that? 
  [Carles] It depends. Some say it was an invasion; others say 
it was a liberation. The truth is that if U.S. troops had not 
arrived, a military boot would still be trampling us. I was 
exiled for eight years. I hadn't done anything but speak in 
defense of liberty. At that time, anyone who spoke in defense 
of liberty was put behind bars, buried, or exiled. I was exiled 
on two occasions. The military problem intensified. It called 
for a military operation so the Panamanian people could rid 
themselves of that opprobrious, corrupt, and inefficient 
dictatorship. Otherwise, we would still be saddled with it. 
  [Samaniego] [passage omitted] Student Corina Cano of the 
University of Panama. 
  [Cano] Good evening. Your platform says Panama should lease 
the bases to the United States in exchange for an opening of 
U.S. markets to Panamanian products after the year 2000. 
Wouldn't that be the same as not receiving any direct benefit 
from the lease? There are other commercial mechanisms that 
permit the exportation of Panamanian products to U.S. markets, 
such as NAFTA, which Panama has joined [as heard], and the 
Caribbean Basin Initiative, of which Panama has been a 
beneficiary. 
  [Carles] It could take us a long time to join NAFTA because 
of the negotiation process and difficulties we might have in 
meeting some of the conditions. I propose an agreement parallel 
to a free trade agreement in which we would have access to 
certain products in specifically assigned quantities with the 
purpose of increasing investment and jobs in Panama. When there 
is an opportunity to market a product, it attracts investment 
and generates jobs. Nobody is going to invest or produce if 
there is no possibility of exporting. For example, if we had 
such an agreement, and they told us that we were going to export 
1 million quintals of sugar or 2 million quintals of sugar for a 
given period of time, within one year Panamanian sugar mills 
would increase the amount of land used for sugarcane 
plantations. Also, the period for sugarcane harvesting and 
production would increase. I could cite certain cases in which 
we could generate jobs. The purpose of this is to generate 
jobs, to increase production, to increase the income of 
Panamanians, because we have an established market. [passage
