FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Outokumpu slips deeper into red
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday reported a loss of
FM768m (Dollars 168.8m) before extraordinary items, against a deficit of
FM124m in 1990.
The losses came in spite of 12 per cent sales growth to FM12.6bn, and were
heavier than the company had expected. As a result it will not pay a
dividend. Shareholders received FM0.77 last time.
Outokumpu, which is 57 per cent state-owned, said market conditions had
worsened during the last four months of 1991.
Earnings were hurt by the devaluation of the Finnish markka in November,
which cost the company FM90m in foreign exchange losses.
Rationalisation measures in its copper and base metals units also reduced
profits by FM220m.
Outokumpu said it expected earnings to improve this year due to better
market conditions. Exports are also expected to increase due to the
devaluation, while rationalisation measures should increase efficiency.
Base metal production operations incurred a FM120m loss before extraordinary
items, compared with a FM312m profit in 1990. Outokumpu said this division
was especially sensitive to economic cycles and metal price fluctuations.
Outokumpu Zinc achieved a satisfactory result.
Its stainless steel operation achieved new production records in rolled
stainless steel and ferrochrome. Its profit before extraordinary items rose
to FM201m from FM95m.
The technology sector had a difficult year and its loss deepened to FM212m
from FM103m.
