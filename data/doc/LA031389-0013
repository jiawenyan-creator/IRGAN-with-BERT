ETHICS BILLS 
The eight-bill ethics package jointly proposed by the Fair Political Practices 
Commission and Ted Lempert, the young Democratic assemblyman from San Mateo 
(Part I, Feb. 23), is a welcome reform plan that Southern Californians should 
endorse. The FPPC figures on gifts and honorariums collected by the Legislature 
are overwhelming -- $3.2 million worth of gifts and honorariums for 120 
legislators in just three years -- and only underscore the importance of the 
ethics bills Lempert and the FPPC are trying to enact. 
It is not surprising that the California Legislature, awash in all this 
special-interest money, has such a hard time addressing the state's pressing 
concerns. What is amazing is that we've had to wait this long for someone like 
Lempert to raise the banner of reform. Is the answer young blood?
