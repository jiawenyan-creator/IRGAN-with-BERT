safety by providing an additional tool in the effort to promote a drug-free work place in the maritime industry.

Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. James W. Cratty, Project Manager, and Jacqueline
L. Sullivan, Project Counsel, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff.



Background and Purpose



In recent years, several major oil spills from ships have occurred in waters under the jurisdiction of the United States.
Among these were the EXXON VALDEZ in Prince William Sound, Alaska, and the AMERICAN TRADER in coastal waters of California.
These spills caused extensive damage, including the loss of fish and wildlife. In response to these disasters and
others, Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101380).
