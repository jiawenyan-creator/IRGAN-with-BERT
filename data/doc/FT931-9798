FT  11 FEB 93 / Bomb in Colombian oil town: Union threatened over wage
negotiations
AT LEAST 12 people were killed and 20 wounded yesterday in a car bomb
explosion in the Colombian oil refining town of Barrancabermeja, police
said, Reuter reports from Bogota.
RCN radio, in a report from the town about 160 miles north of Bogota, said
the death toll had risen to 14 after two of the wounded died from their
wounds, but there was no immediate confirmation from police.
Reports from the town said the bomb blew up five blocks from the
headquarters of USO, Colombia's powerful oil workers' union. USO is in wage
talks with the state oil company Ecopetrol and planned a national day of
protest yesterday.
Mr Cesar Carillo, president of the oil workers' union, told Caracol radio in
an interview that the union had been threatened with violence during the
last few days as a result of the wage negotiations.
'We don't know if the victims are union members or oil workers,' he said.
'The authorities are still getting information. There is a lot of
confusion.'
Radio reports said Ecopetrol President Juan Maria Rendon was expected in
Barrancabermeja at the time of the blast to inspect company installations
but there was no suggestion that he might be among the victims.
The last bombing in Colombia occurred on January 30 when fugitive cocaine
king Pablo Escobar allegedly set off a car packed with explosives in a busy
Bogota shopping street, killing 21 people and wounding dozens.
There was no indication that drug traffickers might be responsible for the
Barrancabermeja blast. The oil capital is, however, in the centre of a major
guerrilla zone. Guerrillas have attacked gold and coal mines, oil rigs and
pipelines, power lines, government installations and army patrols.
