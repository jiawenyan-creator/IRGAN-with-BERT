  [Abstract] Electron transmission microscopy was used to 
study the ultramicroscopic structure of macrophages involved in 
the reparative regeneration of Wistar rat skeletal muscles after 
a mechanical injury. Two morpho-functional types were 
established, based on the ultramicroscopic features of the 
macrophages and morphometric characteristics of these cells' 
organelles. The first type included macrophages with a 
pronounced lysosomal apparatus and a large number of phagosomes 
that contained a muscular dendrite. They were responsible for 
phagocytic functions and facilitated debridement of tissue 
disintegration products from the wound. The second (secretory) 
type included cells with a developed granular endoplasmic 
reticulum that could exert a regulatory influence on skeletal 
muscle reparative regeneration processes. Immunomodulators 
influenced the level of organelle development in both types of 
macrophages, which facilitated earlier initiation of 
regeneration processes and wound healing. Figures 3; references
