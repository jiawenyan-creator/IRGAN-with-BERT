FT  09 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Spanish issues rally strongly on hopes of
rate reduction
SPANISH government bonds rallied strongly with foreign investors buying on
hopes that the Bank of Spain will lower interest rates later this week.
Dealers believe the Bank of Spain may cut the intervention rate, currently
at 13.25 per cent, by about 25 basis points at Friday's repo.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut its official interest rates last Thursday
helped to ease tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism and has
paved the way for lower interest rates elsewhere in Europe, dealers said.
The yield on the Spanish benchmark bond due 2002 fell from Friday's close of
11.30 per cent to 11.22 per cent, while the futures contract rallied half a
point.
Dealers noted that activity in the main European government bond markets was
rather muted in the absence of important economic data or statements from
the Bundesbank.
In the German market the Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 93.22,
traded in a range of 93.12-93.29 and ended the day at around 93.17 as
investors took profits or switched into Spanish and Danish government paper.
UK government bonds closed slightly weaker in thin trading with the Liffe
gilt futures contract slipping from 101.17 to 101.15 on volume of only about
9,000 contracts. Sterling weakness contributed to the weak tone of the gilt
market, dealers said.
The market appeared to ignore news of the Treasury's review of government
spending. Mr Michael Portillo, treasury chief secretary, told parliament the
results of a public spending review could emerge by mid-1993.
AUSTRALIAN government bond prices fell on concern about the federal
election, the government's planned financial package, and the weakness of
the Australian dollar.
Prime minister Mr Paul Keating has set March 13 as the date for the national
election and he is expected to unveil plans aimed at increasing employment
in today's economic package. Mr Keating's announcement on Sunday took the
markets by surprise, as the poll date was earlier than had been expected.
The Australian dollar weakened against the US currency, from 67.70 US cents
on Friday to 67.10 yesterday. In the bond market, yields rose on fears that
today's financial package would contain measures likely to lead to increased
government spending.
Short-dated bonds were the worst hit, with the yield on the 13 per cent bond
due July 1996 rising from 7.69 per cent to 7.82 per cent, while the yield on
the 10-year issue, the 9 1/2 per cent bond due August 2003, increased from
8.74 per cent to 8.82 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied as money market rates fell and some of the
commercial banks lowered their short-term prime rate by half a point.
The moves reflected last week's cut in the Official Discount Rate, but
prices ended little changed on the day.
The March futures contract ended firmer on the day, rising from its opening
level of 109.65 to a high of 109.84 before ending at 109.70. Dealers expect
the June futures contract to take over as the benchmark shortly.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 moved in a range of 4.275 to 4.30 per
cent, ending the day unchanged at 4.295 per cent.
Rates on three-month certificates of deposit dropped to a new historic low
of 3.20 per cent, while the unsecured overnight call rate slipped 1/32 point
to 3 3/32 per cent.
LONGER-dated US Treasury prices moved lower yesterday afternoon but trading
was fairly subdued through most of the day before this week's important
refunding auctions.
The Treasury will sell Dollars 15.5bn in three-year notes today, Dollars
10.75bn in 10-year notes on Wednesday and Dollars 9.25bn in 30-year bonds on
Thursday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  15/32 lower at
105 3/16 , yielding 7.193 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was off  3/32 to yield 4.150 per cent.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange three-day matched
sales when Fed funds were trading at 2 15/16 per cent, below their perceived
target of 3 per cent.
