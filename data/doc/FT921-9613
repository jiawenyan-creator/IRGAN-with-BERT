FT  11 FEB 92 / Beijing in Indo-China peace role
Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, sets off today on a tour of
Cambodia and Vietnam that highlights Beijing's new role as peacemaker and
trading power in a war-shattered region, Reuter reports from Beijing. He
first flies to Cambodia for a visit delayed since December after a mob in
Phnom Penh almost lynched leaders of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge.
