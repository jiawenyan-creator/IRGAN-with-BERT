  [Text] Kinshasa, 10 Feb (AFP) -- The first vice chairman of 
the Social Christian Democratic Party [PDSC], Mr. Andre 
Bo-Boliko, has confirmed that his party was not canvassing for 
the post of prime minister against Etienne Tshisekedi. 
  At a news conference on 10 February Mr. Bo-Boliko stated: 
"The PDSC considers this post currently not vacant, and the 
party is not obsessed by this fact." 
  The opposition press close to Mr. Tshisekedi had accused the 
PDSC and two other opposition parties belonging to the Sacred 
Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] of "conspiring" against 
Mr. Tshisekedi. USOR has so far considered Mr. Tshisekedi the 
legitimate prime minister through his election by the Sovereign 
National Conference.
