FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television
Some of the earliest jokes I can remember from radio comedies involve Siddi
Berrani, a north African town notable in the 1940s because it had featured
so large in the war between the Afrika Korps and the Eighth Army. Episode 8
in BBC2's repeat of The World At War tells of the struggle in the desert,
not only between Rommel and Montgomery, but against sandstorms, heat, flies,
thirst, and dysentery (7.00 BBC2). That is followed by White Heat, a series
about the development of technology which requires its audience to think a
bit; a novel and pleasant experience. Today's programme considers how
technology has been used to oppose 'Dirt And Disorder', from the Paris
cholera epidemic of 1832, which resulted in a new sewage system, to NASA's
voyage into space (8.00 BBC2). ITV shows the third and final part of its
current Cracker story in which Albie goes on the run and Fitz predicts a
killing spree. This latest contribution has enhanced Cracker's reputation
(9.00 ITV). In Age of Extremes Eric Hobsbawm talks about his new history of
the 20th century (11.30 BBC2).
