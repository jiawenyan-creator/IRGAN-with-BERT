FT  11 MAY 94 / World News in Brief: D-Day retreat
The government, bowing to pressure from second world war veterans over the
tone and date of a D-Day 'jamboree' in Hyde Park, has put the event back
from July 3 to August 14. It has also indicated it will be 'commemorative'
rather than 'celebratory'.
