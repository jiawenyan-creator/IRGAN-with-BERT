FT  06 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Survey highlights
underwriting role of Japanese banks
Newly-established subsidiaries of Japanese commercial banks underwrote 6.8
per cent of domestic straight bonds issued in the half-year to September,
according to a survey published yesterday.
The report, by Thomson Corporation, the US financial news service, showed
the companies concluded 123 deals, worth Y111.6bn, for underwriting such
bonds in the period. The companies took a 4.7 per cent share in the
underwriting of all corporate bonds, with 395 deals worth Y178.7bn.
The report gives the first clear picture of the bond underwriting market
since it was liberalised last year. Previously, under rules that strictly
separated securities and banking operations, banks were not permitted to
engage in mainstream securities business. Last year, however, rule changes
allowed banks to set up subsidiaries which may underwrite bonds, but which
are barred from the main area of securities business - equity trading.
Existing brokers have expressed concern at the potential erosion of their
business by the banks, but the figures published yesterday suggest that so
far the encroachment by the seven new bank subsidiaries has been limited.
However, next month, six of Japan's largest commercial banks will launch
their own units and the brokers' share is certain to fall more dramatically.
In the six months to the end of September, IBJ Securities led the way among
the newcomers with 99 contracts worth Y83.3bn.
