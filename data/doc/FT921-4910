FT  06 MAR 92 / Chinese join leisure venture
THE CHINESE government plans to invest in a leisure development outside
Coventry in co-operation with private Saudi Arabian interests.
Coventry City Council said yesterday it would take part in the redevelopment
of Coombe Abbey Countryside Park, for which the Chinese will provide nearly
Pounds 6m for the Pounds 19m scheme. This is the first Chinese involvement
in a UK leisure venture and a rare expression of interest in the British
property industry.
Beijing is understood to have invested in US leisure developments. In the
late 1980s a Chinese regional government planned to set up a trade centre in
London Docklands, but the project foundered.
Coombe Abbey, where the buildings date back to the 11th century, is owned by
Coventry City Council. The abbey needs immediate expenditure of Pounds 2m to
make it weatherproof. The council said a venture involving external funding
would be the only way to secure its future.
The countryside park will include a hotel, conference and visitor centre, a
golf course and a health farm. Its owners will be the city council; Lumley
Castle Hotel, a Durham company; and a new company set up by the Chinese
government with support from the Saudi Arabians.
The total cost will be met by a Pounds 7m loan from the European Investment
Bank, a city council stake of Pounds 2.3m of which part will be European
Community funding, the Chinese-Saudi Arabian investment and bank loans.
