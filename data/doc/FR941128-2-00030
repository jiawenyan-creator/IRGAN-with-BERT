sumamry: 

The BMDO has finished and is now making available the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Final Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement (FPEIS). The purpose of the BMD Program is to develop the capabilities to protect both the United
States, and those areas of vital interest to the United States (e.g., U.S. troops, allies, and friends) from ballistic
missile attack. The BMD FPEIS analyzes the potential environmental impacts associated with the Preferred Action
and three alternatives.



The BMD Program consists of two segments, Theater Missile Defense (TMD) and National Missile Defense (NMD). TMD,
though part of the BMD Program, has independent utility and is evaluated in its own PEIS. Under all alternatives in
the BMD FPEIS, the acquisition of TMD system capabilities will continue as described in the TMD Record of Decision
published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 11, 1994. Additional details about the TMD program may be found in the Final Theater Missile Defense Programmatic
Life-Cycle Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command.

The Preferred Action in the BMD FPEIS is to continue a focused approach to long-lead time technology development in
the form of the NMD Technology Readiness Program. The Preferred Action is also the No Action Alternative as it is a continuation
of current BMDO policy. The NMD Technology Readiness Program involves the development of existing and new technologies
and test systems for ground- and space-based elements (excluding Space-Based interceptors). Research is to be focused
to ensure the capability to deploy a limited NMD system in the next decade. Basic technology efforts will continue
to infuse new advances as the program proceeds. Contingency planning and options development will also continue
to be conducted to meet unexpected threats.

The FPEIS also analyzes three System Acquisition Alternatives for the continued research and development of a BMD
system capability by the Department of Defense (DoD). The environmental impacts of later life-cycle phases beyond
research, development, and testing for these alternatives are discussed in the FPEIS to enhance future decision-making
on whether and how the DoD could proceed with a BMD system. Alternatives to the Preferred Action analyzed in the FPEIS
include:

&bull;

Ground-and Space-Based Sensors and Ground and Space-Based Interceptors System Acquisition Alternative. 

Under this alternative, BMDO would proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to the Preferred
Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would also allow for the acquisition of a Ground-and
Space-Based NMD system to proceed to the development of a system capability.

&bull;

All Ground-Based System Acquisition Alternative

. Under this alternative, BMDO would also proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to
the Preferred Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would allow for the acquisition of an All
Ground-Based NMD system to proceed to the development of a system capability.

&bull;

Ground-and Space-Based Sensors and Ground-Based Interceptors System Acquisition Alternative

. Under this alternative, BMDO would proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to the Proposed
Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would allow for the acquisition of a Ground-and Space-Based
NMD system (without Space-Based Interceptors) to proceed to the development of a system capability.

A Record of Decision on the BMD PEIS' alternatives will be made available no earlier than 30 days after this Notice of
Availability (of the FPEIS) is published in the 

Federal Register

.
