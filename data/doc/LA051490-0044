Louisiana State basketball Coach Dale Brown said he will announce today in 
Washington a plan to turn over money from his shoe contract to help athletes 
and give lie detector tests to his players and staff. 
Brown is one of eight men's basketball coaches participating in a session of 
the Knight-Ridder commission on intercollegiate athletics. 
It's estimated that his agreement to have his LSU team use a certain brand of 
shoes is worth about $200,000.
