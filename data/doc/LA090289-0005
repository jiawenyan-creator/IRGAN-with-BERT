'HEROIC' VOYAGER, ITS HUMAN GUIDES 
I was thrilled to read about the accomplishments of Voyager II. What 
particularly struck me was how unique our planet is. There are no other planets 
in our solar system which can support and generate life as here on Earth. 
Therefore, it is even more evident how important it is that we manage and take 
care of the scarce resources on our planet by recycling, car pooling, taking 
shorter showers, and so on. The inconvenience of these actions seems small in 
view of the potential environmental obstacles we face at the time Voyager II 
crosses the heliopause and moves into the interstellar medium.
