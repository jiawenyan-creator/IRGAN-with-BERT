  [Text] Some very interesting facts were made public today 
in Moscow's Artillery and Missile Forces Academy. A film crew 
from the Segodnya program were the only journalists present. 
  Correspondent Ivliyev: The nuclear strategic 
missiles based in Kazakhstan belong to Russia -- this is the 
sensational news reported today by the Colonel General Igor 
Sergeyev, commander in chief of strategic missile forces, at a 
briefing for foreign military attaches which took place in the 
Dzerzhinskiy Military Academy. 
  [Begin Sergeyev recording] A month ago, on 28 
March, an agreement was reached during the Russian-Kazakhstan 
talks on giving Russian status to the formations and units of 
strategic missile forces stationed temporarily on Kazakhstan 
territory. A timescale was also agreed for the withdrawal of 
nuclear warheads to Russian territory. [end recording] 
  Ivliyev: The agreement reached means that the 
personnel of the missile forces receive Russian citizenship. 
After the stage by stage withdrawal of missile force units from 
Kazakhstan is completed, the launch shafts will be dismantled, 
apparently by Russian specialists. Thus all three CIS states -- 
Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan -- on whose territory nuclear 
weaponry remained after the collapse of the USSR, now have a 
treaty with Russia on its removal. In a few years, if these 
countries fulfill their obligations, Igor Sergeyev stressed, 
they will become non-nuclear states.
