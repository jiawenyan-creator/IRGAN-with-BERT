FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Fujitsu US sells supercomputer
Fujitsu America, US arm of Japan's largest computer company, has won an
order for what it claims will be the fastest single processor supercomputer
installed in the US, writes Louise Kehoe from San Francisco.
The sale, to Time Slice, a Houston computing services company, is Fujitsu
America's second in the US since it entered the market last year. It outbid
Cray Research, the leading US supercomputer manufacturer.
A long history of US-Japan trade disputes over public sector purchases of
supercomputers makes Japanese efforts to enter the US market politically
sensitive. Fujitsu appears to be avoiding political backlash by focusing on
the commercial sector to establish itself in the US.
