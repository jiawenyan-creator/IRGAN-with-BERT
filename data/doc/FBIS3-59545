in China"] 
  [Text] Worried about the breakthrough made by Boeing on the 
Chinese market this year while the Europeans are marking time, 
Airbus Industrie decided to increase its commercial manpower in 
Beijing. It increased its personnel on station by five, 
considering opening a spare parts warehouse and an aeronautical 
engineering training center. "Our objective is to step up 
cooperation with Chinese industry," emphasized Jean Pierson, 
administrator and manager of the consortium, adding: "We have to 
sell 240 aircraft in that country out of the 800 the market will 
take for the next 10 years."
