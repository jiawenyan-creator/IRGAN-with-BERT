  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 24, ELTA -- Leader of parliamentary 
opposition Vytautas Landsbergis MP released a statement on 
Thursday [24 February] saying the amnesty to Russian putchists 
was not valid in Lithuania. 
  He said in his statement that Russian State Duma had issued 
an amnesty for all the defendants in the case of 1991 August 
coup attempt while there was more and more evidence that the 
former president of the USSR had himself participated in the 
coup. It is an internal affair of C.I.S. but the amnesty does 
not touch Lithuania which restored its independence in March 11, 
1990 after a half-century of Soviet annexation. 
  Actions of Soviet putchists in 1991 in Lithuania will be 
further treated here as international crimes and rude violation 
of Lithuanian law, the statement said.
