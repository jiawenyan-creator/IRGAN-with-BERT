FT  29 AUG 94 / This Week: Film/Video
Whenever summer's 'dog days' officially begin and end, they are right with
us now in the cinema. After a warm-up act from the funniest canine of the
year in The Mask - a mini-mutt capable of as many disguises as star Jim
Carrey - we have a show-stealing Great Dane in the French film Le Parfum
D'Yvonne (stylish if languid '50s love story) and Jack Nicholson going
barking mad in Wolf.
Wolves are not dogs, we know. But Nicholson himself plays a jolly dog of a
New York publisher who turns into something hairy and toothy at each full
moon.
Some critics have ventured that Wolf itself is a dog. But if the special
effects disappoint, Nicholson does not. Here are the suave elan, the teasing
cheese-grater voice (supplied with top-class epigrams) and the irresistibly
mobile, satanic eyebrows.
The most powerful 'dog' film of the year, though, contains no dogs at all:
nor any other animals apart from human ones. It is Reservoir Dogs, now back
on wide release. Like its fellow success de scandale of early 1994, Man
Bites Dog, (the motif is inescapable), it gives a new ferocity and a black
wit to movie violence. Half a dozen robbers hole up in a warehouse after a
heist and then proceed, as quarrels multiply, to put holes in each other.
Quentin Tarantino's searingly scripted film makes the words as deadly and
well-targeted as the ammunition. Modern cinema's answer to Jacobean
melodrama.
You can always cool yourself afterwards in the calm waters of Great British
Acting. London's Barbican cinema mounts an Anthony Hopkins retrospective
this week and next, with all the Welsh master's best films on show from The
Lion In Winter and The Elephant Man to The Silence Of The Lambs. And just to
prove that there are some modern movies without an animal in the title,
Hopkins's great performance in The Remains Of The Day can now be seen both
at the Barbican and on video.
