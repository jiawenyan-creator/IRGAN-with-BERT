FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Argentaria details share
offering
ARGENTARIA, Spain's partially privatised state banking corporation, said
yesterday the subscription period for a second share issue of up to 25 per
cent of its capital would commence on November 3.
The issue, which is likely to inject more than Dollars 1bn into the Spanish
treasury, follows a domestic and international flotation of 24.9 per cent of
Argentaria's capital last May.
Around 60 per cent of the Argentaria 2 shares will be offered on the
domestic market, with a weighting towards small retailers, and the rest will
be placed outside Spain among international institutions. The subscription
period will last seven days and the price will be dictated both by the share
trading during that week and by the book building process in which Morgan
Stanley of the US will act as global co-ordinator.
Argentaria's international road shows will commence next week in London and
the banking group will be seeking to fuel investor interest with impressive
results that, at the third quarter stage of this year, have put Argentaria
at the top of the domestic banking table in terms of net profit growth.
The group said its after-tax profits had totalled Pta61.3bn (Dollars 472m)
at the end of September, a 15 per cent rise on the first nine months of
1992, following a 29.9 per cent increase in its operating margin to
Pta104bn. Argentaria's share price increased by 43.7 per cent between May
12, when it began trading, and September 30 when the share price closed at
Pta5,460 to give the banking group a market capitalisation of Pta885.2bn.
Rival Spanish banks, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, and Banco Santander, respectively
reported third-quarter net profits yesterday of Pta62.4bn, and of Pta67.4bn.
The profits of both banks represented an increase of 8.7 per cent on those
on the first nine months of 1992.
Earlier, Banco Central Hispano reported virtually flat after-tax profits of
Pta45.4bn.
