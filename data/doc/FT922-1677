FT  20 JUN 92 / NSW leader comes under fire
Australia's Independent Commission Against Corruption yesterday found the
New South Wales premier, Mr Nick Greiner, had engaged in conduct which was
reasonable grounds for his dismissal, Emilia Tagaza reports from Canberra.
Mr Greiner has refused to resign over accusations of involvement in the
appointment of an MP to a public service job, but his minority conservative
government next week faces a vote of no confidence in the state parliament.
