FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Eurocom falls 5% to FFr183m
EUROCOM, the French marketing group which recently took over RSCG, one of
its closest competitors, saw its net income fall by 5.2 per cent to
FFr183.1m (Dollars 32.6m) last year because of the depresed state of the
European advertising market.
Eurocom, which is linked to the Havas group of media companies, is the
biggest single player in French advertising and has, in recent years,
pursued a policy of aggressive expansion into other areas of marketing and
other countries.
