talking to potential bidders, lifted interim pre-tax profits 30 per cent

of the company, there has been no such uncertainty in our trading
performance,' said Sir Humphrey Prideaux, the Morland chairman.

government's beer orders were reflected in an extraordinary charge of Pounds

Morland's 300 pubs as part of its tied estate and offload more pubs to meet
the requirements of the beer orders.
