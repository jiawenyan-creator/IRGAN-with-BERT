SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA; 
VALLEY BLVD. PLAN APPROVED 
The City Council on Monday approved a development plan for Valley Boulevard, 
culminating a 14-month effort to establish guidelines that will control the 
types of new buildings permitted along the commercial corridor. 
Members of the Alhambra Business and Residents Assn. complained that the plan 
would not help improve Valley Boulevard and said residents and business owners 
had not been given enough notice of the changes. But council members said the 
public had plenty of notice through newsletters, flyers and community meetings.
