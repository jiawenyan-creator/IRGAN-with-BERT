FT  09 APR 94 / Dragons mark City boundary change
City limits: a dragon marking the edge of the City of London was moved 200
yards north yesterday after boundary changes came into effect. Dragons have
been used to mark the Square Mile's territory since 1870. The changes, which
were made by the Local Government Boundary Commission, increase the City's
population by 1,300 - more than 31 per cent
