FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: Wealth in home-ownership should be welcomed
Sir, I find the concern in your editorial ('Housing and inflation', April
16) over equity withdrawal both complex and perplexing. Given that your
fellow countrymen reside - according to EC statistics - in the poorhouse of
Europe, one would have assumed the relatively recent ability of British
house-owners to utilise prior to death what little wealth they have been
able to accumulate would be welcomed.
The more so since some of that equity withdrawal has been used to finance
management buy-outs and other productive investments. Nor should equity
withdrawal from housing cause inflation through increased demand for
consumer and other goods since there is an adequate supply of foreign
manufactured goods competing to meet that demand.
The resulting trade deficit problems will only be solved by producing more
of those goods in this country to meet home market requirements. Similarly,
the home-grown inflation of house prices will only be solved when there is
sufficient supply of housing for purchase and rent available to meet demand.
The wholesale suppression of the housebuilding industry over the past two
years by inflation fuelling high interest rates which you have often
supported will simply cause house price inflation yet again in the future.
Taxation neither in the form of relief nor additions will not solve your
problems nor will reducing the already low level of wealth of the British
people. Until you recognise that inadequate supply is the main cause of the
inflation problem you are attempting to address you will never solve the
problem.
