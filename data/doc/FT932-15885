FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lelliott in talks with bankers on future
JOHN LELLIOTT, one of Britain's biggest privately-owned construction
companies, was yesterday locked in talks with its bankers. A statement on
its future is expected today, writes Andrew Taylor.
The company ran into trouble following the failure of the Pounds 110m Point
West development of flats, offices, a health club and shops in the shell of
the former British Airways terminal in Cromwell Road, west London.
Lelliott, which was working on the project, is thought to have lost
approaching Pounds 10m as a result of the development being put into
receivership at the end of 1991.
Land &amp; Property Trust the property company developing Point West went into
liquidation shortly afterwards.
Lelliott has still not published its results for the 12 months to end-June
1992. In the previous year it made pre-tax profits of just Pounds 700,000 on
turnover of Pounds 193m. In 1989-90 it made profits of Pounds 5.8m on sales
of Pounds 240m.
It was ranked as Britain's 38th largest construction company by turnover -
and Europe's 144th largest - in a survey conducted last year by Building
Magazine.
Stone Group, the stone restoration subsidiary of Lelliott, was placed into
administrative receivership in February. It was subsequently acquired by the
Peter Cox Group.
Lelliott also recently reached an out-of-court settlement with Forte, the
hotel group, following a dispute over the Pounds 10.8m refurbishment of the
Waldorf Hotel, London.
Mr John Lelliott, chairman, is a director of Wimbledon football club.
