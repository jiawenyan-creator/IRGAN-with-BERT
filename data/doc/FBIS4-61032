  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has approved an 
initiative by Russian legal scholars on conducting research into 
ways and means of strengthenening Russian statehood. The head 
of state's press service reports that the president also 
confirmed by edict the main areas of this research which 
primarily concerns the formulation of legal enactments that have 
to be in line with the constitution. 
  One of the primary tasks envisioned is the drafting of laws 
on the government and on federal ministries. Scholars also 
believe that legal enactments relating to the observance and 
protection of human rights and freedoms need to be brought into 
line with generally accepted principles and standards of 
international law.
