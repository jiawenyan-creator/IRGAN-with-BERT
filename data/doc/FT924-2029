FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Pelican wades in with Pounds 357,000
In the half year to September 30, a period of expansion, the Pelican Group
increased pre-tax profit from Pounds 131,000 to Pounds 357,000.
The USM-traded group, which owns and operates 15 restaurants, including the
Cafe Rouge concept, and a wine bar in the Greater London area, generated the
increases from turnover ahead 35 per cent to Pounds 3.83m. That, said Mr
Roger Myers, chairman, reflected the economies of scale the group now
enjoyed.
Prospects continued to improve. The Whiteleys and Kensington units were
expected to make significant contributions in the second half.
Growth in earnings per share was restricted to 73 per cent, from 1.1p to
1.9p, following the substantial increase in the number of shares in issue.
