FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Geest hit by banana surplus
PRICE DEFLATION affecting fresh produce resulted in a 22 per cent fall in
Geest's pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks ended January 2.
Profits at the fresh produce and prepared foods group fell from Pounds 26.2m
to Pounds 20.4m on lower sales of Pounds 625m (Pounds 626.3m). Trading
profits from fresh produce fell from Pounds 19.3m to Pounds 15m, mainly
because of the surplus of bananas.
Mr David Sudgen, chief executive, is expecting the price of bananas to rise
after July when the new banana regime within the Single Market comes into
effect.
He said: 'For the first time, the whole of the European Community will be
regulated when our significant investment in creating a pan-European
business will pay off.'
Last year the group increased capital expenditure from Pounds 18m to Pounds
43m, primarily in the development of its banana business. A further Pounds
35m of investment has been earmarked for 1993.
As a result of the capital expenditure, a cash surplus of Pounds 19m was
turned into net debt of Pounds 7.2m.
Food preparation increased trading profit from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 6.2m.
Mr Sudgen said he hoped the division, which is to be expanded, would double
profits by 1995.
Macfish, in which Geest had a 50 per cent interest, was sold for Pounds 9.7m
in September and last week the group's two US salad businesses were sold for
Dollars 5.7m (Pounds 3.8m).
The sales gave rise to a Pounds 17.2m extraordinary charge, of which Pounds
16.1m related to goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Earnings per share fell from 26.3p to 20.4p. However, the final dividend is
increased to 4.4p making a total of 8.1p (7.9p).
COMMENT
The new banana regime should have the effect of taking away business from
the big dollar banana importers, such as Dole. In 1994, after the first full
year of the new regulation, Geest may well achieve its aim of becoming the
second or even the biggest importer of bananas into the European market. It
is unlikely, however, to pull off its other stated aim of generating half
its profits from food preparation. It is already facing stiff competition in
this area, not least from the likes of Northern Foods. With forecast pre-tax
profits of Pounds 25m, the shares  - down 4p to 454p - are on a prospective
multiple of 18.2 this year. But in 1994, which is arguably where investors
should be looking, the shares are on a more realistic rating of 13 times
earnings.
