  [Text] An alleged agreement in terms of which the 
Mozambican Government will give an Indian spiritual leader, 
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, nearly a quarter of the country is 
causing controversy. Government sources say plans are being laid 
to amend the stipulations of the agreement. The agreement was 
allegedly signed by the finance minister with the agreement of 
President Joaquim Chissano. Latest speculation is that 20 
million hectares of land is being made available to the 
maharishi for his Heaven on Earth Development Company. The 
maharishi is the former spiritual leader of the Beatles.
