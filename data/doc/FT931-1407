FT  25 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries slip after steep rise for
durable goods orders
US TREASURY prices edged lower at the long-end yesterday afternoon. In late
trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  9/16 lower at 104,
yielding 6.807 per cent. At the short end of the yield curve, the two-year
note was off  1/16 to yield 3.891 per cent.
The market received a morning jolt when durable goods for February were
reported rising 2.2 per cent. Economists had predicted a more moderate gain
of 0.6 per cent. But the unexpectedly sharp increase largely reflected a
rise in orders for transportation equipment, and the market soon regained
its equilibrium. Stripping out a 10.9 per cent rise in transportation
orders, durable goods orders fell 0.7 per cent in the month.
The Dollars 15.25bn two-year note sale in the afternoon was reasonably
successful. The yield of 3.92 per cent was slightly below expected levels of
3.94 per cent.
The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market when Fed
Funds were trading at 2 15/16 per cent, slightly below the Fed's perceived
target of 3 per cent for the rate. The lack of intervention was widely
expected and did not indicate a change in monetary policy.
EUROPEAN government bond markets generally ended lower on the day as various
political and currency concerns hit the Belgian, Italian and Spanish
markets.
Belgian government bond prices were marked down sharply at the opening by
dealers, following the government's offer to resign on Tuesday night over
its budget crisis.
Short-term interest rates rose as the central bank increased its key rates
to protect the Belgian currency. The spread of Belgian bonds over Germany
increased from around 72 basis points to 85 basis points yesterday.
GERMAN government bonds ended little changed on the day as rumours of a high
inflation figure for one of the key German states helped wipe out earlier
gains.
Dealers said the market showed little reaction to the Bundesbank's repo
yesterday as the lowest rate at which it offered securities repurchase funds
was unchanged at 8.25 per cent.
The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM65.4bn at this week's tender for 14-day
securities repurchase funds, representing a net injection of DM10.2bn, and
allocating funds mostly at 8.25 to 8.27 per cent.
Bund prices declined on rumours that the state of Hesse would this week
report a higher-than-expected inflation figure, dampening hopes of a further
easing in interest rates by the Bundesbank.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 95.22, rising to a high of 95.41
before falling back to 95.28 by the end of the day.
THE UK government bond market witnessed further declines among the very
long-dated stocks as investors switched into shorter-dated issues.
Gilt-edged issues with maturities of up to 20 years generally ended the day
firmer with the five- and 10-year stocks gaining  1/32 - 1/16 .
At the long end of the market, the 7 3/4 per cent stock due 2012/15 fell
15/32 to end at 94 1/4 , with dealers pointing out that investors were keen
to switch to higher-yielding issues.
JAPANESE government bonds ended mixed, with cash bonds slightly higher on
the day, while the June futures contract closed lower.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue moved from its opening of 4.07 per
cent, corresponding to the low price of the day, and closed at 4.06 per
cent. The futures contract opened at 109.89 and ended the day at 109.80,
with the decline attributed to heavy selling by dealers.
THE City of London saw a net fall in the number of foreign securities houses
in 1992 for the first time in more than 30 years.
According to a survey by Noel Alexander, the banking consultancy, 22 foreign
securities houses left London last year, while 18 houses set up offices in
the City. The number of foreign houses present fell from 169 to 165 last
year. Noel Alexander attributed the decline to the international downturn in
the securities business and global recession.
