FT  27 OCT 92 / People: Martin Taylor to chair NatWest Life
Martin Taylor, vice chairman of Hanson, has been appointed chairman of
NatWest Life, which will be capitalised at Pounds 150m when it begins
underwriting in 1993.
This is the most important job Taylor has taken on since becoming
vice-chairman of the Anglo/American conglomerate in 1988. While he has been
a non-executive director of NatWest for two years, the new position is
expected to take up an increasing amount of his time.
NatWest says Taylor would be steering its new joint venture company with
Clerical Medical Life Assurance Society through its formative years; he
admits the new job would be demanding. But he added: 'This is time I will
have to squeeze out of my own private time. My responsibilities at Hanson
are unchanged.'
Taylor is also a non-executive director of Vickers PLC and has been a member
of the CBI Council since 1981.
