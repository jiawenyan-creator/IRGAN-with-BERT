  [Text] The Thai Binh Province people's committee has met 
with the sectors concerned and districts, towns, wards, and 
villages with opium addicts to discuss measures to implement a 
rehabilitation program. 
  There are more than 680 opium addicts in 119 villages, 
wards, 
and towns in Thai Binh Province. More than 300 of those addicts 
are seriously affected by the habit. With assistance from the 
central government, the province has obtained a relatively 
sufficient amount of medicines to carry out a rehabilitation 
program. 
  It was reported that following a 40 day-long campaign 
against 
social vices, Thai Binh Province discovered and took action 
against more than 200 opium den owners and drug traffickers. 
Legal proceedings were also initiated against 50 brothel owners 
and 160 criminals.
