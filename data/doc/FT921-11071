FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Nobel to reclaim unit's rescue
cash
THE BOARD of Nobel Industries, the Swedish chemicals and defence group, is
to seek repayment of the SKr1.92bn (Dollars 326m) capital contribution it
made last August under an agreement to help a 14-bank consortium save its
finance subsidiary, Gamlestaden, from collapse.
The company also believes it should not have to pay a further SKr400m to
Gamlestaden, which is now owned by the banking consortium, by the end of
next year.
Nobel's move follows a recommendation to reclaim the money in a report last
week by Mr Jan Ramberg, professor of private law at Stockholm university. He
was commissioned by the company to investigate the crisis that led to the
downfall of Nobel's owner, Mr Eric Penser, and its takeover by the bank
consortium.
Nobel's demand seems likely to involve further negotiations with the banks,
who have suffered substantial losses as a result of their SKr5bn rescue of
Gamlestaden.
Professor Ramberg's report concludes that the terms of last August's
agreement between Nobel and the banks, covering the company's capital
contribution, are invalid. This is because of the pressure applied by the
banks on Nobel, contrary to Swedish law.
In discussions between the two sides last August, Nobel was forced not only
to accept paying a SKr2bn contribution (of which SKr1.6bn would be paid by
the end of 1991 and the rest by December 30, 1993) to help save Gamlestaden,
but also SKr320m in the form of a promissory note.
'Nobel was subjected to hard pressure to comply strictly with the agreement
obligations', says Professor Ramberg in his report. 'The credits were cut
off and the banks refused Nobel the right to deposit the disputed
contribution in a blocked account, pending legal examination, and thus
forced the board members, at the risk of personal responsibility for
damages, to pay the amount to Gamlestaden.'
