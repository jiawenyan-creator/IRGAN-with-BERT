FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hoyts sells cinema side to
US-led consortium
A consortium led by Hellmann &amp; Friedman Capital Partners, a US investment
banking firm, is to buy the cinema interests of the privately-owned Hoyts
entertainments company, which has theatres in Australia, New Zealand and the
US.
No purchase price for the Australian group, owned by the Melbourne-based
Fink family, has been revealed, although a spokesman for the US firm
suggested it might be as high as ADollars 500m (USDollars 372m).
The sale supersedes plans to float the Hoyts business on the stock market.
These were announced in June, when Hoyts indicated that it was hoping to
raise about ADollars 400m.
At the time, Mr David Clarke, the company's chairman, suggested that the
group might consider expansion into south-east Asia, particularly China.
South America, and the Mexican market in particular, could also offer new
opportunities, he added.
In a statement yesterday, Hellmann &amp; Friedman indicated that it supported
this assessment: 'A well-capitalised Hoyts has exciting expansion
opportunities in its existing markets as well as in Asia and Latin America,'
it said.
Hoyts claims to be the 10th largest US cinema operator, with 79 cinemas  -
mainly on the east coast - and 519 screens. In Australia, it is the third
largest operator, taking about a quarter of the country's box-office
receipts.
The Fink family has owned Hoyts since 1985, and had planned to retain a
small interest. At the time of the flotation announcement, Hoyts' pre-tax
earnings were forecast at some ADollars 63m in the 1994 financial year.
