THIRD WORLD POVERTY 
Three recent articles concern Third World debt, and that concerns me. Countries 
deep in debt like Brazil, Haiti, Mexico, Liberia, and Nigeria have cut back on 
social programs in their unsuccessful attempts to make payments. Who suffers 
most -- always, the children. 
Almost 10 years ago UNICEF declared that the '80s would be the Decade of the 
Children. Since then half of the world's children have been immunized and a 
quarter of their parents know how to deal with health threats like dehydration 
and births that come too close together. Still, 14 million kids die needlessly 
each year from chronic undernutrition and preventable diseases. 
Economic strategists are proposing feasible solutions to the debt crisis. We 
can work from our end, the United States, in two ways. The President has the 
authority to forgive debt altogether or to allow repayment in local currencies. 
We must urge him to use his authority. This month Congress will reintroduce the 
Global Poverty Reduction Act that mandates real aid for real development. That 
legislation will ensure that money reaches the poorest of the poor by using 
social goals to track progress. One of the three measures would be the 
under-5-years-of-age mortality rate. We must "lobby" our representatives to 
pass this bill.
