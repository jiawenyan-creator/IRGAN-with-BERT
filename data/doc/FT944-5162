FT  05 DEC 94 / International Company News: Moody's may upgrade two
Norwegian banks
Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, said it has placed the long
and short-term ratings of Den norske Bank (DnB) and Christiania Bank,
Norway's two largest commercial banks, under review for possible upgrade.
Norway's banks have emerged this year from their deepest crisis since the
second world war.
For DnB, Moody's said the review would affect Dollars 160m of long-term
debt. 'This review was prompted by the bank's continued progress in reducing
the level of non-performing loans,' the agency said. In November, DnB
reported nine-month pre-tax profits nearly trebled to NKr2bn (Dollars 291m)
from NKr720m last year.
The volume of non-performing loans fell by NKr3bn to NKr7.2bn from the start
of the year with one third of the fall occurring in the third quarter.
Moody's said the review of DnB would focus on the bank's prospect's for
continued improvement in asset quality and on its ability to sustain
adequate profitability levels.
For Christiania Bank, Moody's said the review would affect Dollars 550m
worth of long-term debt and would focus on the bank's longer-term ability to
maintain sustainable pre-provision profitability levels and on the outlook
for further reductions of the bank's non-performing assets.
Last month, Christiania reported nine-month pre-tax profits nearly doubled
to NKr1.12bn as gross non-performing and doubtful loans were reduced by 27
per cent to NKr11bn. Net non-performers fell 37 per cent NKr3.6bn.
The bank recently announced that it had disposed of one-third of its
troubled fisheries loan portfolio in the US, reducing its outstanding loans
in Seattle to Dollars 127m from Dollars 323.5m, and said it will not have to
report further loss provisions in the fourth quarter.
