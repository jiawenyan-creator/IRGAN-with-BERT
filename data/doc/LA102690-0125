VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COURTS DELAY TICKETS FOR MIDEAST MILITARY 
Military personnel stationed in the Middle East with outstanding citations for 
traffic violations or other misdemeanor crimes will not have to appear in court 
until they return from active duty, authorities said. 
The Ventura County Superior and Municipal courts will allow families of the 
personnel to contact base representatives who will notify the court. 
Putting the cases on hold will avoid the cost and inconvenience involved in 
issuing arrest warrants, said Sheila Gonzalez, the courts' executive officer. 
Until families begin notifying officials, the court will not be able to 
calculate the actual number of people with outstanding citations, she said. 
"We're trying to accommodate them," Gonzalez said. "We don't want them to have 
to worry about their court cases at this time. It's a courtesy." 
The program is patterned after a similar one in San Diego. 
"They're not matters of monumental significance," said Municipal Judge Lee E. 
Cooper. "We're talking primarily about traffic violations." KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ
