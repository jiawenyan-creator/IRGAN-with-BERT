  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has 
declared that the Russo-Georgian Treaty on Friendship, Good 
Neighborliness, and Cooperation, signed in Tbilisi on February 
3, "demonstrates the vital interests both states have in each 
other." 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said that the treaty and 
the entire visit should be regarded "as a strong impetus to 
political efforts to return peace to Abkhazia and South Ossetia 
rather than a substitute for such efforts." 
  Kozyrev stressed that in defining the future status of the 
regions it was necessary to renounce force and seek "a realistic 
compromise."
