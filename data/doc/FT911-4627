FT  18 APR 91 / Commission seeks garbage harmony
More money and greater care will have to be spent on the 2.2bn tonnes of
garbage put into landfill dumps around the EC each year under a plan
unveiled by the Commission yesterday, writes David Buchan in Brussels.
The plan would harmonise environmental and technical standards for
landfills, encourage the raising of disposal charges to cover the full costs
of creating proper dumps and eventually re-landscaping them, and require
each member state to set up a special fund to cover the costs of fighting
pollution from landfills.
