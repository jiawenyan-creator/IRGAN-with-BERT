  [Text] Santiago, 27 May (EFE) -- The police revealed today 
that the most important Chilean drug trafficker, Selim 
Valenzuela Galdames, who got away a few days ago while being 
taken from prison to a hospital for a medical checkup, bribed 
his prison guards to let him escape. 
  Prison guard Alex Valdebenito Carrasco, one of the four 
guards in charge of guarding Valenzuela while he was being taken 
to the hospital, confessed to having received the equivalent of 
$4,700 to let him go. 
  Prison Police Director Claudio Martinez disclosed during a 
news conference today that the four guards involved had been 
dismissed and are now at the disposal of the courts in 
Valparaiso, the main Chilean port, where the drug trafficker 
escaped. 
  Selim Valenzuela is regarded as the mastermind behind a 
shipment to Sweden of 40 kg of cocaine, which was found by the 
Swedish police in the port of Goteborg. 
  The drugs had been packed in 1,750 boxes of raisins, but 
were 
detected by Goteborg customs authorities. 
  Two of the individuals involved in the case, the Chileans 
Jorge Chadwick Vergara and Rene Ramirez Barrientos, who reside 
in Sweden, were sentenced by the Swedish courts to 10 and 9 
years imprisonment respectively. 
  Jose Miguel Vallejos, spokesman for the Chilean 
Investigative 
Police Antinarcotics Directorate, told the local media that 
Valenzuela's escape is "serious," and noted that "he is very 
valuable to the Investigative Police because he is considered 
one of the most important Chilean traffickers due to his 
international links."
