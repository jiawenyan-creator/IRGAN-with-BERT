FT  09 MAY 91 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
Australian wool prices continue to forge ahead from day to day. There is a
long way to go before the old floor price basis of 700 cents is scaled
again, but progress made has been far greater than anyone forecast, and
confidence breeds further buying. The outlook into next season, from July
onwards, is more clouded. Supply still seems quite likely to exceed demand,
and as the pipeline is refilled demand itself could slow down. There are
improvements in UK activity and business, but emergence from the recession
is very far from full yet.
