FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dumez looks for refinancing
THE downturn in the French construction industry has forced Dumez, the
building division of the Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez industrial group, to seek
FFr460m (Dollars 86m) in refinancing.
Dumez confirmed that it had been forced to ask Lyonnaise, its parent
company, for FFr460m in new capital. It also announced plans to streamline
its activities by withdrawing from peripheral businesses and concentrating
on its core construction interests.
This rationalisation plan will be accompanied by more than 500 job losses
among its 30,000 employees, the first at Dumez for over a century. These
cuts are likely to be implemented next March, but a preliminary plan is
expected to be presented to the workforce next week.
Dumez has performed poorly since its merger two years ago with Lyonnaise des
Eaux, one of France's largest industrial concerns.
The Lyonnaise group's construction interests produced a loss of FFr38m in
the first half of this year, thereby depressing the overall increase in
group net profits to just 2 per cent to FFr711m.
Earlier this year, Mr Jean-Paul Parayre, who headed Dumez before the merger,
was ousted as deputy chairman of Lyonnaise.
He has been replaced by Mr Jean-Louis Brault, a Lyonnaise director who
previously worked for Bouygues, France's biggest building group.
BTP, a French bank specialising in building and property, has disclosed
losses of FFr220m for the first half of the year.
The bank has recently been forced to refinance in a FFr1.5bn package. Mr
Jacques Bayle, chairman, said it had called a halt to all new property
development projects and would be shedding 145 of its 668 employees in an
attempt to return to profit.
