FT  15 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses weaken after an
optimistic beginning
Although US stocks moved on a rising trend in the European afternoon,
bourses managed to end weak after a relatively optimistic start. Low
turnover was another feature of the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, unable to find any good news, persisted with its downward correction
following steep gains earlier in the month. The CAC-40 index lost 31.93 or
1.4 per cent to 2,243.16 as turnover sank to FFr3.3bn from Friday's
FFr4.7bn.
There was some interest in Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting: Mr Michael
Woodcock of Nikko Europe said that it remained to be seen whether the French
'would feel able to act unilaterally in cutting rates if the Buba were to
fail to act . . . the market has been anticipating a German rate cut for at
least two months, and while inaction can be understood after the traumas of
last summer, it may be emboldened by the quarter point rate cut in the UK
and the continued strength of the franc against the D-Mark'.
Elf Aquitaine lost FFr2 to FFr415 ahead of the announcement of the
institutional offer price of FFr403 a share after the close of Wall Street
last night. The private tranche was three times subscribed.
There was a further fall in Euro Disney, down FFr2.10 to FFr34.05 as bankers
held talks with Walt Disney, the theme park's parent company, over financial
restructuring.
FRANKFURT began by consolidating Friday's post bourse gains, the Dax index
adding a little more and closing 25.40 higher at 2,116.01 after last week's
2.2 per cent fall. Turnover reflected the carnival season, falling from
DM9.6bn to DM5.1bn.
However, in the afternoon thoughts turned to the prospect of a national
engineering strike after the failure of last Friday's metalworkers' wage
negotiations. Bund and Dax futures weakened and the Ibis indicated Dax
dropped to close at 2,101.93.
Mr Harry Jaarsma of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt said that retailers were weak
after Friday's report that German retail sales dropped by an
inflation-adjusted 6 per cent in December compared with the year before.
After hours, recent favourites held their gains well, BMW ending at DM813
after an official close of DM816.50, up DM16.50 and Degussa at DM490 after
DM494, up DM10.
AMSTERDAM weakened in line with the general trend, the AEX index losing 5.59
at 428.78.
Fokker's downside was limited; the market had already discounted its
announcement yesterday of job cuts and restructuring proposals, and the
shares eased 20 cents to Fl 22.90. Bigger losses were seen among the more
heavily capitalised issues, with Royal Dutch losing Fl 2.80 to Fl 212.60 and
Elsevier Fl 3.20 to Fl 182.80.
MILAN began the first day of the new account broadly lower, but some gains
were featured particularly with companies associated with the forthcoming
privatisation of Banca Commerciale Italiana.
BCI itself moved up L71 to L5,601 as investors anticipated a successful
flotation: the public share offer begins on February 28. Advances were also
seen in Generali, up L175 to L40,680, and Gemina, up L47 to L1,563 on
suggestions that they may take stakes. The Mibtel index lost 1.1 per cent to
10,792.
Domestic investors were still unsettled by the political environment, with
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia making steady gains in opinion polls. Mr
John Stewart of InterEuropa in Milan commented that the weekend arrest of Mr
Berlusconi's brother for alleged corruption was unlikely to have a long-term
effect on his campaign, while his increasing popularity should not be
under-estimated.
ZURICH fell by 1.3 per cent in subdued dealings, the SMI index closing 38.6
lower at 2,947.1. It had risen at the outset on short covering after last
week's index drop of 4.9 per cent, but subsided in the afternoon on a drop
in index futures: the SMI February future ended at 2,951.0.
Individual stocks reflected the day's pattern. The most active, Roche
certificates, fell SFr105 to SFr6,825 after an earlier rise to SFr7,075.
MADRID blamed a gloomy macroeconomic outlook as the general index closed
2.16 lower at 345.82 on a combination of rising unemployment, up from 17.5
to 18 per cent of the total workforce in January and worse-than-expected
January inflation data.
Turnover fell to Pta26.1bn from Pta48.4bn. Weakness in bonds drove equities
down and banks were hit worse than most, with BBV Pta70 lower at Pta3,360
and Banesto down Pta14 at Pta701.
ATHENS dropped 4.1 per cent, the general index closing 43.02 lower at
1,018.55 with investors cautious over the possibility that Nato forces could
become involved in the Bosnian crisis.
ISTANBUL, down 22.5 per cent last week, recovered 8.9 per cent on aggressive
central bank moves in the money and currency markets to check the
depreciation of the lira. The composite index ended at a provisional
15,096.03, up 1,232.33.
