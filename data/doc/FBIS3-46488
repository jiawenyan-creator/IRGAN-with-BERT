  [Text] The government has appointed an agent to send 
workers abroad without charging fees. The agent, with the 
minister of labor and social welfare as its [as heard] head, has 
been set up to cope with the problem of high commission charged 
by private agents. Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Welfare 
Phaithun Kaeothong says there is no serious incident at present 
in Libya. Therefore, Thai workers can continue their work 
there. He says about 2,000 Thai workers returned home recently 
because their contracts expired. There remain some 20,000 Thai 
workers there. Mr. Phaithun says that his ministry will 
cooperate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in sending 
representatives of the committee on labor problem to meet Thai 
workers in Libya soon.
