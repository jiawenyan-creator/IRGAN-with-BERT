FT  22 JUN 92 / France (14): Michel David-Weill of Lazard
even in the back-biting world of French finance - with a bad word to say
about Michel David-Weill.
In many ways he is the epitome of the cosmopolitan corporate financier -
charming, courteous, cucumber-cool and armed with a barrage of amusing
anecdotes. It is these social skills, as much as his business brains, that
have turned Mr David-Weill, senior partner in Lazard Freres bank, into a
pivotal figure in French corporate life.
When another corporate skirmish, between two of his closest contacts - Mr
Gianni Agnelli of Fiat in Italy and Mr Antoine Riboud of France's BSN -
broke out this summer, it was Mr David-Weill who smoothed out a settlement
between the feuding factions.
Under Mr David-Weill, who as one of Concorde's best customers divides his
time between Paris, London and New York, Lazard has made its mark as one of
the world's most powerful merchant banks. It has been involved in most of
the major bids of the 1980s and early 1990s, but it has done so discreetly.
Lazard Freres is, after all, a bank that does not even have a name plate
outside its Paris head quarters on Boulevard Haussmann. A. R.
