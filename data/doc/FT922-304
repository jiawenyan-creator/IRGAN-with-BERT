FT  29 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: European Bonds
GERMAN economic data dominated the European government bond markets last
week, as higher-than-expected M3 figures dashed hopes of lower interest
rates in Germany and in the other European bond markets, writes Sara Webb.
Germany's annualised M3 growth rose to 9 per cent in May, from 8.9 per cent
in April, prompting a sharp sell-off in the bund market as investors and
dealers feared that the Bundesbank would be unable to lower interest rates
before the end of the year.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at BKB International, says: 'Continued
strong monetary growth has reinforced our view that we are unlikely to see
an easing by the Bundesbank until the fourth quarter of the year at the
earliest. And even then it is unlikely there will be a sharp fall in view of
persistent budget and inflation problems.'
The rise in money supply is mainly attributed to the continued strength in
bank lending. Economists see little scope for a sudden slowdown although S.
G. Warburg believes M3 growth will show some sign of deceleration towards 7
per cent over the next six to nine months.
Mr George Magnus, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, says: 'This trend
will satisfy the Bundesbank that some initial monetary relaxation is in
order after the summer - with more to come around the turn of the year and a
lot more in 1993.'
The Bundesbank is due to meet on July 16 to discuss its monetary target,
providing a focus for bond markets, although it is widely expected to stick
to its stated M3 target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent.
