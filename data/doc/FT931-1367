FT  25 MAR 93 / Vietnamese flee Cambodia
Large numbers of ethnic Vietnamese are fleeing their homes in Cambodia
following a massacre blamed on Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the United Nations
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
UN naval peacekeeping patrols have reported movements of Vietnamese on the
Tonle Sap, a lake in the centre of the country, a spokesman for the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia told a news briefing.
About 100 boats were seen travelling down the Tonle Sap River - a tributary
of the Mekong that flows from the lake - towards and past Phnom Penh, the
national capital, at the weekend.
The exodus follows the killing of at least 38 people during an attack on a
Vietnamese village on the Tonle Sap on March 10.
