  [Text] Sidon, Lebanon, April 18 (AFP) -- The authorities 
have arrested 12 Lebanese members of the ruling Iraqi Ba'th 
Party and handed over some of them to Syria, relatives said on 
Monday [18 April]. 
  The men, who were not immediately identified, were seized at 
night last week from their homes in the Sidon region of south 
Lebanon by members of the Lebanese army intelligence services, 
they said. 
  The suspects were not presented with any arrest warrants, 
were not given any reasons for being rounded up and were not 
prosecuted, relatives said. 
  Reports of the alleged arrests coincided with strained ties 
between Lebanon and Iraq, after Baghdad refused to lift the 
immunity of two diplomats suspected of murdering a prominent 
Iraqi dissident in Beirut last week. 
  The Lebanese cabinet held an emergency session on Monday to 
discuss its relations with Iraq amid press speculation that 
Beirut could sever diplomatic ties with Beirut. 
  Iraq has denied any involvement in the murder of Talib 
Suhayl, a leader of the Free Iraqi Council opposition movement. 
  But Lebanese officials have said that Iraqi commercial 
attache Khalid Khalaf and cultural attache Muhammad Kamil Kazim 
had confessed their involvement in the killing. They have been 
detained since last Wednesday. 
  Syria is Iraq's main Arab rival. Damascus deploys some 
35,000 troops in Lebanon.
