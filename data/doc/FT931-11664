FT  02 FEB 93 / Aircraft group to receive Dollars 280m
THE ISRAELI government has agreed to provide a Dollars 280m (Pounds 185m)
restructuring package to Israel Aircraft Industries, the country's biggest
company, in the latest move by the state to bolster its struggling defence
sector.
IAI, which says it will report a loss for 1992 of between Dollars 50m and
Dollars 60m, will use the package to pay for the dismissal of 1,500 of its
17,400 workers and to invest in a new generation of civilian products in a
bid to underpin its strategy of decreasing its traditional reliance on
defence markets at home and abroad.
The defence sector, hit hard in recent years by declining world markets for
military equipment, has become one of the biggest burdens on the Labour-led
government as it attempts to reduce the state's large-scale involvement in
industry.
In December, the government pumped more than Dollars 280m into Israel
Military Industries to back a recovery plan which will cost 2,500 jobs out
of its 7,500-strong workforce.
That followed an earlier injection of Dollars 100m in state funds for IMI.
The government, facing historically high unemployment levels of more than 10
per cent of the workforce, is reluctant to see big closures in the defence
industries, which account for a large proportion of Israel's industrial
output. IAI's annual overseas sales of around Dollars 1.25bn alone account
for some 17 per cent of Israeli industrial exports.
IAI said it had been hit by a Dollars 100m shortfall in expected sales in
1992 - ironically, mainly due to the recession in the civilian aircraft
sector in Europe and the US.
Under the terms of the government package, it will receive Dollars 50m in
cash, will convert a Dollars 30m state loan into cash and equity capital and
will receive Dollars 200m in state loan guarantees.
It will get a further Dollars 3m in research and development grants.
The company said it expected to break even in 1993 on sales of Dollars 1.5bn
and planned to return to profits in 1994.
