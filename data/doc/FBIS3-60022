  Five prefectures and cities in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region, namely, Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Yulin, and Bose, held 
trials on cases of major drug offenses. In accordance with the 
death warrants verified and issued by the Supreme People's 
Court, 13 drug criminals were executed according to law. These 
13 criminals had trafficked in and transported a total of 13.5 
kg of heroin and 28.6 kg of opium. Drug crimes have shown an 
upward curve in Guangxi in recent years with a significant 
increase in big drug cases and increasingly refined narcotic 
products. From 1991 through October 1993, courts at various 
levels in the region processed 367 drug cases in various 
categories and passed sentence on 843 drug criminals, 
effectively deterring drug crime. (Summary) (Beijing XINHUA
