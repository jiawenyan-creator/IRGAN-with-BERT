  [Text] Washington, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Air Force 
today sent a spy satellite into a temporary orbit aboard a Titan 
4 rocket -- the most powerful unmanned vehicle of the country. 
  The liftoff from the Cape Canaveral followed a number of 
delays because of technical problems and weather conditions. 
  The U.S. military refused to disclose details about the 
satellite, but an earlier NEW YORK TIMES report said the craft 
worth 1.5 billion dollars was the most expensive of the kind. 
  Weighed five tons and equipped with a 152-meter-wide dish 
antenna, its mission was to intercept the telecommunications of 
Russian military, intelligence and political officials. 
  The spy satellite was built and would be operated by the 
National Reconnaissance Office, the United States' largest and 
most secretive intelligence service, the TIMES report said. 
  Data collected would be analyzed by the National Security 
Agency using a global network of ground stations and an array of 
supercomputers.
