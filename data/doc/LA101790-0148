ACID SPILL ON ANTELOPE VALLEY FREEWAY SLOWS TRAFFIC TO CRAWL 
Morning rush hour traffic slowed to a crawl on the Antelope Valley Freeway in 
Newhall this morning after a spill of muriatic acid from a truck forced the 
closure of two southbound lanes, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
Johnny Reese, 44, of Palmdale, the driver of the tractor-trailer truck hauling 
pool chemicals, was treated at the scene for inhalation of fumes from the 
spilled chemical but there were no other injuries, the CHP said. 
Officer A. J. Torres said only about five gallons of the chemical spilled from 
the truck about 7:30 a.m. near the freeway's San Fernando Road exit. CHP 
officers and a Los Angeles County Fire Department hazardous materials unit 
blocked off two of the four southbound lanes on the freeway and the spill was 
cleaned up in about two hours, Torres said. 
With motorists on the normally heavy southbound commute crowded into the two 
open lanes, traffic slowed to a crawl and backed up more than a mile. The 
southbound on-ramp from San Fernando Road to the freeway was also closed during 
the cleanup. 
The CHP said the spill apparently occurred when a pallet of muriatic acid 
containers shifted as the truck was heading southbound and several containers 
broke open.
