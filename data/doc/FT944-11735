FT  04 NOV 94 / Fears of closure haunt Paris amusement park: Euro Disney's
results
Euro Disney, the operator of the Paris-based theme park, yesterday
an-nounced full-year net losses of FFr1.8bn (Pounds 214m), down from
FFr5.33bn last time, but said it had suffered a sharp fall in visitor
numbers.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, said fears that the troubled park would
be closed had resulted in large numbers of potential customers staying away.
Visitor numbers fell 10 per cent to 8.8m in the year to September 30. Mr
Bourguignon said: 'The best thing about 1994 is that it's over.' The results
are the first to be released since the company announced a FFr13bn
restructuring with creditor banks in June. Mr Bourguignon remained confident
that the park would break even by 1996.
The losses were broadly in line with analysts' projections, and the shares
rose FFr125 to close in Paris at FFr815.
Mr Bourguignon said the company had still not decided whether to raise or
cut prices over the next year. He admitted, however, that many French
customers still regard the park as expensive and he raising prices would be
difficult.
He said Euro Disney had achieved about FFr500m in cost savings in 1994,
including 900 redundancies. He warned, however, that it was unlikely that
similar cost-savings could be achieved in the current year. The company
realised that cost cuts could not continue indefinitely as quality would
begin to suffer.
About 2,000 of the park's 10,000 employees are now on part-time contracts.
The company is also recruiting staff who are prepared to work on shorter
contracts, which would increase flexibility. Mr Bourguignon said.
Euro Disney was launching a new advertising campaign, which would be
tailored for each of its large European markets. A new FFr600m attraction,
Space Mountain, is to open next June. which will give visitors the
impression of being fired from a cannon.
The company said it had cut queueing times by 45 per cent during the year
through new attractions and the redesign of existing ones.
Mr Bourguignon added that managers would be given greater incentives to
raise profits through a programme to turn 150 shops and restaurants into
individual profit centres. Managers would be given greater autonomy in
running these and would be rewarded for results.
The group had net equity of about FFr5.5bn and total borrowings of
FFr15.9bn, down 23 per cent from last year. The one-off restructuring and
related costs were FFr515m, and it has unused lines of credit worth
FFr1.1bn.
Hotel occupancy rates rose from 55 per cent last year to 60 per cent, which
the company said was in line with the French average and reflected greater
flexibility in tariffs. However, expenditure per bedroom fell 14 per cent to
FFr882.
Euro Disney reported operating profits of FFr332m, against FFr391m, before
financing and depreciation charges. Operating costs fell 12 per cent to
FFr2.96bn and management and administration charges by 23 per cent to
FFr854m.
Revenues were down 15 per cent to FFr4.15bn, including FFr2.2bn from the
park, FFr1.6bn from hotels and FFr322m from other activities - mainly its
corporate 'partners' or sponsorship programme. About half the park income
comes from entrance fees and the rest from car parking, food and
merchandise.
