 

The land on which these 21 plant taxa are found is owned by 
various private parties, the State of Hawaii (including conservation 
district lands, forest reserves, natural area reserves, State parks, 
and the State seabird sanctuary), or is owned or managed by the 
Federal government (including a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
refuge, a U.S. Army military reservation and a military training 
area, a National Park, and a U.S. Coast Guard lighthouse area). 


Discussion of the 21 Taxa Included in This Rule and the One Taxon 
Withdrawn From Consideration for Listing 


Rock (1957) named 

Clermontia hawaiiensis

 var. 

grandis

 on the 
basis of sterile specimens collected on the island of Hawaii in the 
1950s. Later, after examining fertile material, he named the taxon 


C. lindseyana

 and also described a variety, var. 

livida

 (Rock 1962). 
The specific epithet commemorates Thomas Lindsey, a naturalist who 
brought the species to Rock's attention. St. John (1987a) described 
two other species, 

C. albimontis

 and 

C. viridis,

 but the author of 
the current treatment of the genus (Lammers 1990, 1991) considers St. 
John's species to fall within the range of 

C. lindseyana

 and 
recognizes no subspecific taxa. 


Clermontia lindseyana

 of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae) is 
a terrestrial or epiphytic (not rooted in the soil) branched shrub or 
tree 8.2 to 20 ft (2.5 to 6 m) tall. The alternate, stalked, toothed 
leaves are 5 to 9 in (13 to 24 cm) long and 1.5 to 2.6 in (3.8 to 6.5 
cm) wide. Two flowers, each with a stalk 0.4 to 1 in (1 to 2.5 cm) 
long, are positioned at the end of a main flower stalk 1 to 1.6 in 
(2.5 to 4 cm) long. The calyx (fused sepals) and corolla (fused 
petals) are similar in size and appearance, and each forms a slightly 
curved, five-lobed tube 2.2 to 2.6 in (5.5 to 6.5 cm) long and 0.4 to 
0.7 in (0.9 to 1.8 cm) wide which is greenish white or purplish on 
the outside and white or cream-colored on the inside. The berries 
are orange and 1 to 1.6 in (2.5 to 4 cm) in diameter. This species 
is distinguished from others in this endemic Hawaiian genus by larger 
leaves and flowers, similar sepals and petals, and spreading floral 
lobes (Cuddihy et al. 1983, Lammers 1990, 1991). 
Historically, 

Clermontia lindseyana

 was known from the island of 
Maui on the southern slope of Haleakala and from the island of Hawaii 
on the eastern slope of Mauna Kea and the eastern, southeastern, and 
southwestern slopes of Mauna Loa. One population of the species is 
known to be extant on State-owned land on Maui. This population 
extends from Wailaulau Gulch to Manawainui Gulch and contains between 
100 and 150 plants (Robert Hobdy, Department of Land and Natural 
Resources, 

in litt

., 1993). The 14 known populations on the island 
of Hawaii extend over a distance of about 53 by 13 mi (85 by 21 km). 
Populations are found near Laupahoehoe, in Piha, in Makahanaloa, near 
Puaakala, near Puu Oo, near Kulani Correctional Facility, near 
Kapapala, in Waiea Tract, near Kaapuna Lava Flow, and near Kahuku on 
privately and State-owned land. Approximately 125 to 175 individuals 
exist (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1991a1 to 1991a13). This 
species typically grows in 

Acacia koa

 (koa)- and 

Metrosideros 
polymorpha

 ('ohi'a)-dominated Montane Mesic Forests, often 
epiphytically, at elevations between 4,000 and 7,050 ft (1,220 and 
2,150 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, HHP 1991a1 to 1991a13, Hawaii Plant 
Conservation Center (HPCC) 1991a, Lammers 1990, 1991). Associated 
species include 

Coprosma 

sp. (pilo), 

Ilex anomala

 (kawa'u), and 


Myrsine

 sp. (kolea) (HHP 1991a2, 1991a5, HPCC 1991a; Fern Duvall, 
Olinda Endangered Species Propagation Facility, pers. comm., 1992). 
The major threats to 

Clermontia lindseyana

 are competition from alien 
plant species such as 

Passiflora mollissima

 (banana poka) and 


Pennisetum clandestinum

 (Kikuyu grass), grazing and trampling by 
cattle (

Bos taurus

) and goats (

Capra hircus

), and habitat disturbance 
by feral pigs (

Sus scrofa

) (Cuddihy 

et al.

 1983, HPCC 1991a, Pratt 
and Cuddihy 1991; F. Duvall and Arthur Medeiros, Haleakala National 
Park, pers. comms., 1992).
