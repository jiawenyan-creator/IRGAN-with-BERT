FT  26 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
There are two possible explanations for the 4 per cent fall in Euro Disney's
shares in heavy volume yesterday. One is renewed short selling at the start
of the new account on the Paris bourse. The other is that small investors
took advantage of the first day's trading in the newly issued shares to sell
them down to the rights issue price. What seems unlikely is that the
underwriting banks have begun to anticipate a small take-up of the rights
issue and are positioning themselves accordingly. Not only is the Saudi
Prince al-Waleed standing by to relieve them of up to two-thirds of their
exposure. The banks still claim no more than a faint inkling of how the
issue has gone.
That said, it is regrettable that the French system requires a full month
for subscriptions to be added up. A large uncertainty hangs over the shares
meanwhile, and there are plenty of grounds for scepticism. On its own
forecasts Euro Disney does not expect to make a profit before 1996; it will
still be 250 per cent geared even after the rights issue.
Above all, the Saudi prince's intervention holds out no promises to outside
shareholders. So far his presence has been more of a comfort to Walt Disney
and the underwriters of the rights issue.
Perhaps his conference centre will fill up Euro Disney's under-used hotels,
but financing the second phase of the theme park would remain tricky. Just
because the prince made a handsome profit out of his investment in Citicorp
does not mean the same must be true of Euro Disney too.
