 



Collection of racial or ethnic information. 

Regulation C provides that applicants for mortgage and home improvement loans be requested, but not required, to
provide information about their race or national origin, gender, and income. The purpose is to gather data that may
help regulatory agencies to gauge whether a lending institution is complying with the fair lending laws. If an applicant
chooses not to provide the information on race or national origin and gender, the loan officer is required to enter
the information on the basis of visual observation or surname. 

Currently, the categories in Regulation C for data collection on race/national origin of applicants are: 

&bull;American Indian or Alaskan Native 
&bull;Asian or Pacific Islander 
&bull;Black 
&bull;Hispanic 
&bull;White 
&bull;Other 

The categories that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues for government statistical purposes are substantially
the same, except that the ``other'' category is not included. OMB and others have indicated their belief that the presence
of the ``other'' category undercuts the usefulness of the data, in that a data user has no way of knowing what the category
represents. 

In adopting the monitoring provisions of Regulation C in 1989, the Board based the categories used on Regulation B,
which has contained the ``other'' category since it was first adopted by the Board in 1976. The Board believed that
the ``other'' category served a useful function. For example, it provides a choice to applicants who do not identify
with any of the specifically defined categories; in 1992, the ``other'' category was used in roughly 45,000 out of
10 million loan records. The Board notes also that OMB is likely in the next few years to propose changing the list of
categories for the next decennial census. 

Comment is solicited on whether the Board should consider deleting the ``other'' category. The Board notes that if
this change were made for Regulation C, a parallel change would be made in the monitoring provisions of Regulation
B. 

(4) Economic Impact Statement. The Board's Division of Research and Statistics has prepared an economic impact analysis
of the proposed amendments. A copy of the analysis may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, or by telephone at (202) 4523245.
