  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha says a party 
cannot come to power, no matter with what majority, if it cannot 
cope with the economic challenges of Africa. Addressing a 
National Party gathering in Johannesburg's southern suburbs last 
night, Mr. Botha said the ANC [African National Congress] was so 
busy with its internal political work that it was forgetting 
about the world. He said a new government could not afford to 
have large budget deficits or loans that the economy could not 
carry. 
  [Begin Botha recording] Not only South Africans possess 
holiday homes. A vast number of overseas investors possess 
holiday homes. A vast numbner of people from abroad have farms 
in this country. They have invested in this country. Business 
corporations, business companies from all over Europe and from 
America have game farms, they have holiday homes, and the 
government that touches those rights will get into trouble with 
the governments of those citizens whose rights are in this way 
affected, and tax everybody out of existence. [end recording] 
  Mr. Botha went on to say that the ANC was to blame for the 
problems experienced within the peacekeeping force. 
  [Begin Botha recording, in Afrikaans] That is the kind of 
thing you get with the aggressive insistence of the ANC to get 
its way over us. Let the ANC have its way, and the whole 
defense force will end up like that peacekeeping force. [end 
recording]
