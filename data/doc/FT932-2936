FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
STOCK INDEX futures gave up most of Monday's gains as hopes of a cut in
interest rates faded, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 2,895,
Monday's closing level, and pointed towards another strong session.
However, a feeling that cuts in interest rates were unlikely this week led
to selling of the contract. It fell further as independent traders (also
known as locals) went on the offer, and a poor gilts sector, which had
helped to underpin Monday's rise, also played its part in increasing the
downward spiral.
The release of better than expected industrial and manufacturing production
figures had no significant effect on trading. In the afternoon it was a poor
Wall Street opening that brought a further retreat in the June contract and
the day's low of 2,872 was seen at 3.30pm.
June closed at 2,878, an 8-point premium to the underlying cash market.
Volume in the June future was 9,864 lots, while 4,508 were dealt in the
September contract.
Business in the traded options remained uneventful, with volume only
slightly improving to 25,510 contracts. Some 9,006 were dealt in the FT-SE
100 option, which sees its June expiry today. The Euro FT-SE option was also
active and recorded a total of 2,689 trades. In the stock options, TSB led
the way with a total of 1,219 lots.
