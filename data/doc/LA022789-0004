The Bush Administration and Congress were criticized for failing to fill top 
government health jobs. "Almost four months after the elections, we are still 
wondering who will be named to the post of presidential science adviser," Dr. 
James H. Sammons, AMA executive vice president, told the American Medical 
Assn.'s National Leadership Conference in Chicago, "and we don't have an 
assistant secretary of defense for health at the Pentagon." Vacancies delay 
progress on health programs and put the executive branch at a disadvantage in 
dealing with Congress on legislation, said Dr. James C. Todd, AMA deputy vice 
president.
