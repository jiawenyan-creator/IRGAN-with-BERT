describes as low-cost, user-friendly access to the global computer networks
of the Internet.
Mr Eurfron Gwynne Jones, BBC director of education, believes the BBC is the
world's first media organisation 'to open up mass access to the
communications revolution.' Echoing the launch of the 1980s BBC micro
