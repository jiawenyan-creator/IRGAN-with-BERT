FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong turnround at Nordbanken
Nordbanken, which the Swedish government rescued from collapse with a
SKr51bn (Dollars 6.5bn) bail-out operation, yesterday announced a 1993
operating profit of SKr2.7bn, making it the country's most profitable bank
last year.
The profit followed a record loss of SKr16.6bn in 1992 when Nordbanken
became the biggest victim of a loan-loss crisis which swept through the
Swedish banking system in 1992.
The spectacular return to the black outstripped the profit of SKr1.8bn
achieved last year by Svenska Handelsbanken, the bank which avoided the
worst of the credit loss slump. It is bound to reinforce complaints by
Handelsbanken, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and other banks that the scale
of state assistance to Nordbanken gave it an unfair competitive advantage.
Nordbanken's 1993 results show the effects of the state's bail-out. The
off-loading of SKr67bn-worth of bad loans to Securum, a separately-run 'bad
bank', meant credit losses - mostly accrued in the property sector - tumbled
to SKr4.2bn from SKr19.2bn in 1992.
Non-performing loans stood at SKr12.2bn, compared with SKr39.4bn in 1992.
Provisions for problem loans were set at SKr6.3bn compared with SKr22.4bn.
Nordbanken received capital injections from the state worth SKr16bn, while
the authorities used a further SKr35bn of taxpayers' money to capitalise
Securum. In addition, Nordbanken took over Gota Bank, another victim of the
crisis bailed out at state expense, at the turn of the year.
It did not consolidate Gota in its 1993 accounts. But the authorities have
responded to the criticism by the other banks by pointing out that
Nordbanken is having to spend SKr3bn in further recapitalisation at Gota.
Gota earlier this week announced an operating loss in 1993 of SKr13.6bn in
spite of the injection of SKr20bn in state funds and a bad loan laundering
operation similar to the Securum operation at Nordbanken.
At the underlying level, Nordbanken said that profits before credit losses
rose sharply thanks to falling interest rates and higher investment income.
Excluding the effects of the Securum operation, Nordbanken said profits
before credit losses were up 31 per cent to SKr6.9bn.
