FT  23 FEB 93 / Van Miert to crack down on state aid
MR Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, has warned that he will
crack down on selfish state aid schemes aimed at protecting national
industries from the recession.
Mr Van Miert told the European Parliament's economic and monetary committee
on Friday that 'common action at the Community level' was the best way to
deal with member states' economic problems.
His comments, published yesterday, seemed to be aimed at member states
preparing for Thursday's meeting of industry ministers, which will discuss
the Commission's plans to support the EC steel industry.
Mr Van Miert warned in his speech that 'beggar my neighbour' aid schemes
would merely 'export unemployment and push problems on to other member
states', which would then retaliate with their own subsidies.
The Commission has made clear that national and Community steel subsidies
will have to be accompanied by drastic cuts in capacity. But Commission
officials are clearly worried that Spain, which is facing a deep political
crisis if it fails to win EC support for subsidies, Germany and Italy may go
ahead with unilateral aid if a co-operative plan fails.
Mr Van Miert also said he would not favour aggressive use of special
Commission powers to open up national monopolies.
