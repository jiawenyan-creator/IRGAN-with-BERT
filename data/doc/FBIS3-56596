  [Text] Kiev January 18 TASS -- The Ukrainian parliament 
plans to consider an amendment to the constitution at one of its 
upcoming sessions to clarify the status of the Crimea. 
  A proposal to this effect was made by President Leonid 
Kravchuk at a meeting with representatives of local councils in 
Kiev on Tuesday. The proposal was supported by parliament 
Chairman Ivan Plyushch. 
  The amendment would state that bodies of state power in the 
Crimea are to be formed and act on the basis of the Ukrainian 
Constitution and laws and the constitution of the Republic of 
Crimea. The latter should not run counter to the Constitution 
of Ukraine. 
  Kravchuk stressed that no one wants to infringe upon the 
rights of the Crimean people because the Crimea is part of 
Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile, the Crimea held presidential elections over the 
weekend to elect its first ever president. Officials in the 
Ukrainian capital Kiev pinned hopes on Nikolay Bahrov, speaker 
of the Crimean parliament and the sole candidate calling for 
Crimea to remain in a federal Ukraine. 
  However, 38.5 per cent of those who took part in the 
elections voted for Yuriy Meshkov of the Nationalist Russia 
bloc, and 17.5 per cent -- for Bahrov. These two candidates 
will be put up for the runoff elections to be held on January 30.
