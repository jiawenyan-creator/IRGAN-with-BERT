FT  07 NOV 94 / Welsh farmers to resist aid cuts
Welsh farmers will this week try to convince MPs that the way of life of
many rural producers will be threatened if government aid is cut for the
third successive year.
Mr Evan Wilson of the National Farmers' Union said: 'Farmers are often
accused of whingeing, but I honestly believe that a number of hardships will
be created if this aid is cut, with many rural people asking themselves:
'Are we able to carry on farming?' '
Farmers fear that the Pounds 105m paid in Hill Livestock Compensatory
Allowances will be trimmed in this year's Budget. The subsidy, paid to
67,000 farmers in difficult areas covering half the UK's farmland, is one of
few agricultural support payments which is wholly at the government's
discretion.
The government has said that higher subsidies from Brussels, which account
for about Pounds 400m to hill live-stock farmers, should compen-sate for
cuts in UK aid.
Mr John Lloyd Jones, union chairman in Wales, said lamb losses had averaged
Pounds 2,500 for each upland or hill farm after this year's wet spring.
Official figures are likely to show that farm earnings are down about 20 per
cent from last year, which was a good one for British farmers following the
devaluation of sterling. Hill farmers are still quitting at a rate of about
5 per cent a year.
In a recent speech to Welsh farmers, Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture
minister, hinted that the allowances could come under pressure in the next
public-spending round. He said: 'The government needs to consider very
carefully the priority it can afford to give to HLCAs amongst the many other
legitimate claims upon taxpayers' money.'
Mr Lloyd Jones said he wanted the government to restore cuts made in the
subsidy in previous years.
