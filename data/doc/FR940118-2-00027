Northwest states that the purpose of this filing is to supplement Northwest's December 30, 1993 filing in Docket No.

pertained, and upon affected state regulatory commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825

and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before January 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
