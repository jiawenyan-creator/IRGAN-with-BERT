THE SIDELINES; 
HORSEMEN DUCK CRUELTY QUERIES 
Two members of the West German show jumping team today ducked questions about 
their involvement in alleged cruelty to horses. 
German champion Otto Becker said he "was not allowed to comment" on the 
allegations against his employer, Paul Schockemohle, because of the police 
investigation into whether the three-time European champion had violated animal 
protection laws. 
Becker arrived in Stockholm for the Show Jumping World Championships that open 
Tuesday. 
The organizing Swedish Equestrian Federation has called for the withdrawal of 
Schockemohle as coach plus three nominated team members, including Becker. The 
move was triggered by the release this month in the German magazine, Stern, of 
a videotape showing Schockemohle hitting young horses legs' with a wooden stick 
over jumps. The method is banned in international competition and some 
countries, while allowed in others. 
After the footage was shown on German television, Schockemohle was reported to 
police for cruelty to animals and an investigation begun.
