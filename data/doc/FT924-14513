FT  09 OCT 92 / Threat to health pay bodies eased
ABOLISHING the pay review bodies which set National Health Service pay is no
longer a government priority, Mr Eric Caines, the NHS personnel director,
has admitted.
Mr Caines, a strong advocate of abolition of the pay review bodies and the
Whitley Council system, told a recent conference of the National Association
of Health Service Personnel: 'I don't think it will happen in my lifetime.'
According to a report in the Health Service Journal, confirmed by the
Department of Health, Mr Caines repeated his belief that Whitley and the pay
review bodies were of 'supreme irrelevance'. But he added: 'There are a lot
of attitudes around the centre which are about consensus.'
Health department evidence to the Nurses, Midwifery and Health Visitors Pay
Review Body said that the review bodies would continue to set national
'benchmarks' despite trusts' freedom to set their own terms and conditions
for new staff. Existing employees who transferred into trusts would retain
their old NHS terms and conditions.
Mr Caines blamed trusts and health authorities for failing to take control
of their pay systems. He warned that an exceptionally tight public spending
round would force managers to look carefully at how many staff they employed
and how they were paid.
