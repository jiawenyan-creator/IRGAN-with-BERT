POWER STATION BLAST BLACKS OUT TORONTO 
A hydroelectric transformer station exploded Wednesday night, blacking out 
downtown Toronto and surrounding areas in Ontario province, causing traffic 
chaos and sending thousands of people into the streets. Looting was reported. 
The blackout forced theaters, malls and stores in the busy downtown area to be 
evacuated. There was no immediate report of arrests or injuries. 
One Canadian radio report said 90,000 homes and 10,000 businesses were affected 
by the power outage, which officials said began at about 8:10 p.m. and lasted 
about two hours in much of downtown. In other sections of the city, power 
continued to be out past 11 p.m. 
Ontario power spokesman Bill Friday said the power cut out after the explosion 
and fire, which was blamed on equipment failure.
