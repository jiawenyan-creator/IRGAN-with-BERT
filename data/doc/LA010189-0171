COLLEGES; 
AZTECS TAKE LOW-KEY ROAD, BUT GET BY VERMONT 
Vermont certainly is not North Carolina. The first clue came midway through the 
first half of Saturday's Vermont-San Diego State basketball game, when a 
Catamount pass on a fast-break attempt catapulted out of bounds off a Catamount 
head. 
The second clue came early in the second half. SDSU was leading by five with 
17:47 left when Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg called a timeout. Shawn Bell -- in 
the midst of his best game at San Diego State -- walked to the bench and looked 
at the scoreboard. Then he yawned. 
The Aztecs won, 83-76, but the atmosphere in the San Diego Sports Arena wasn't 
exactly as festive as Thursday's 103-92 loss to North Carolina. 
"I would have rather been in a dental chair with no novocaine than endure that 
for 40 minutes," was the way Brandenburg explained it. 
A total of 1,529, the fewest to attend an Aztec home game since 836 watched 
SDSU play Hawaii in the final game of the 1986-1987 season, watched SDSU 
improve to 6-4. Against North Carolina, the Aztecs had set a home attendance 
record of 13,106. 
The fallout from the empty arena reached the court, where it was so quiet you 
could hear the ball drop. SDSU had 21 turnovers and Vermont 18. Both teams shot 
48% from the field. 
"And my New Year's resolution was to not take another drink all year long," 
Brandenburg said. "But I think (the letdown) was very evident -- and 
predictable. We were tremendously emotionally high Thursday, and when you get 
that high, you valley out. We valleyed out really bad." 
One of the spectators at the North Carolina game was on the Vermont bench 
Saturday, and Tom Brennan, the Catamount coach, got exactly what he had hoped 
for. 
"We caught them at the right time," said Brennan, whose team is 1-5 and has 
lost 10 consecutive road games. "After playing in front of 13,000 rockin' and 
rollin' fans Thursday, and then to play in front of (something like) 13 . . . I 
kept saying 'stay ahead, stay ahead' (to the Aztecs) Thursday because I knew 
there had to be an emotional letdown." 
Bell, a transfer from Chicago State, finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds -- 
both personal bests at SDSU. Guard Tony Ross had a season-high 23 points, and 
his four second-half 3-pointers (he had five total) sparked the listless Aztecs 
enough to stop a handful of Vermont comebacks. 
The Aztecs built a 12-point halftime lead, 38-26, as Bell surpassed his 
9.8-point scoring average with 15. Vermont whittled it down to five, 40-35, 
just 2 minutes into the second half and eventually cut it to three, 52-49, with 
12:09 remaining. 
It was 55-51 with 10:38 left, but Ross made three 3-pointers in the next 3:24 
to give SDSU some room to breathe. 
"Shawn and Tony came through for us when everyone else was really struggling," 
Brandenburg said. 
Said Brennan: "Ross and Bell were great tonight." 
SDSU guard Bryan Williams wasn't bad, either. He had 9 assists, giving him 19 
for the last two games. 
"We tried to get up for this game, but a lot of people were tired," Williams 
said. 
Said Aztec center Mitch McMullen: "It was a win. You've got to take every one 
you can get." 
McMullen, who had career highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds against North 
Carolina, managed just 10 points and 5 rebounds before fouling out with 2:41 to 
play. Joe Calavita led Vermont with 20 points.
