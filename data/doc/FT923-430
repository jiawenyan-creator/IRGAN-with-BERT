FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey titanium buy
JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals group, has bought for an undisclosed
cash amount Alta, a Pittsburgh-based company which claims to be the world's
leading supplier of high purity titanium.
Demand for this material is expected to grow strongly in the next five years
as new generations of semiconductor devices using advanced titanium
technology come into production.
Mastering the technology necessary to produce titanium of at least 99.999
per cent purity is difficult and JM, which is one of Alta's customers, is
effectively taking a short-cut.
Mr Richard Wakeling, chief executive of JM, said the acquisition would
strengthen his group's position as a leading electronics materials supplier
and it would help it in its push to win more market share in the Japanese
semiconductor industry.
In 1991 Alta, which employs about 50 people, made sales of Dollars 10m
(Pounds 5.8m) and at the year-end had net assets of Dollars 5m.
Mr Wakeling said it would make an immediate contribution to profits.
