  [Excerpts] In a meeting with His Highness Prince Hasan, the 
regent, Lakhdar Brahimi reviewed UN efforts on Yemen and his 
contacts with the parties to the conflict. His highness the 
crown prince reiterated Jordan's position -- that it supports 
the unity of Yemen and a cessation of hostilities. 
  Speaking to reporters, Brahimi praised Jordan's clear stand 
on and efforts for the sake of Yemen. [passage omitted] 
  Brahimi had earlier called on acting Prime Minister Dhuqan 
al-Hindawi, who told him Jordan supports his efforts as a 
special UN envoy to Yemen to heal the rift and bring the ongoing 
hostilities there to a halt. 
  Mr. Brahimi arrived in Amman last night, and said at the 
airport that it is the UN's and his own role in Yemen to gather 
information and act as a conduit between the parties to the 
conflict. 
  [Begin recording] [Brahimi] We must build on the fact that 
the two sides have accepted the UN Security Council cease-fire 
resolution and that both are amenable to the principle of 
dialogue, although specifics like what, how, and when are yet to 
be agreed on. Now there is talk about a mechanism to be devised 
by the Yemenis to solidify the cease-fire. Each of the two 
sides has put forward ideas of its own. God willing, these will 
take shape on the ground. Now the brothers in the Republic of 
Yemen in Sanaa are talking about a joint committee with members 
other than Yemenis sitting on it. However, it remains for them 
to agree on specifics such as who is to be represented on it and 
how it is going to work. That is all there is for the time 
being. 
  [Dhiyab] Will Jordan and Oman, both of which were on the 
committee, still be there? 
  [Brahimi] I do not think either of the two Yemeni sides will 
object to that. Nor will they mind the presence of the 
Americans, the French, and the Russians. Whether there will be 
other parties may be a bone of contention. [end recording] 
  Lakhdar Brahimi has now left Amman. Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
minister of state for foreign affairs; and the UN representative 
in Jordan were on hand to bid him farewell.
