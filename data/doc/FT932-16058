FT  07 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Singapore hits third
straight peak
SHARE PRICES gave way to profit-taking by financial institutions, and the
Nikkei average lost ground for the first time in four trading days, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index shed 272.66 to 19,486.80, after rising by 6.3 per cent during the
previous three days. It opened at the day's best of 19,748.92 and
profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling pushed it down to a low for the
session of 19,386.71.
Volume fell to 720m shares from 1.19bn, as dealers and foreigners took to
the sidelines. Declines led advances by 704 to 348, with 129 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 21.88 to
1,529.47, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.10 to 1,197.69.
Some brokers welcomed the fall, adding that the market was overheating.
Foreign investors were seen purchasing shares, while domestic institutions
remain net sellers. 'We expect to keep our money in cash for a while,'
commented one Japanese fund manager. However, traders said overall sentiment
remained firm. 'The consensus is that the market will continue to advance,'
said Baring Securities.
Electric power issues were the worst performers of the day, declining 4.24
per cent on profit-taking. Tokyo Electric Power showed some resistance to
the trend, losing just Y10 to Y4,090. Gas utilities were also weak, the
sector dropping 3.43 per cent.
Brokerage shares, which led the recent rally on hopes of better earnings due
to higher market volumes, receded on profit-taking. Nomura Securities
finished Y70 down at Y2,180 and Daiwa Securities Y50 off at Y1,340.
High technology issues were lower, with Toshiba down Y15 to Y720 and Fujitsu
falling Y11 to Y650. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone weathered profit-taking
and advanced Y40,000 to Y1.04m. Telecom-related shares were also popular,
with Fujikura appreciating Y67 to Y1,030 and Nippon Comsys adding Y50 at
Y1,270.
Reports of a gold vein discovery boosted Dowa Mining, which ended Y31 ahead
at Y667. However, Mitsui Mining and Smelting, which had been strong on
higher gold prices, lost momentum, closing Y1 easier at Y520; Sumitomo Metal
Mining weakened Y18 to Y826.
Fishery and drug stocks were sought as laggards relative to the Nikkei's
rise. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical put on Y50 at Y2,350 and Daiichi
Pharmaceutical Y40 at Y1,620.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 258.85 to 21,167.44 in volume of 34.7m
shares. Increasing cautiousness prompted light profit-taking.
