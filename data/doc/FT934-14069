FT  19 OCT 93 / People: McKinnon's new job
Sir James McKinnon, former director-general of the gas industry watchdog
Ofgas, has become chairman of Ionica, the Cambridge-based telecommunications
company.
The appointment is a coup for Ionica, which is building a national telecoms
network to rival BT and Mercury, using radio technology. Ionica is looking
to McKinnon to give some edge to its strategic planning. Fresh from his
battles to breathe competitive air into the gas market, McKinnon says he is
'keenly interested to participate in the growth of competition in other
markets'.
In telecoms, competition is growing so quickly that Ionica may have
difficulty finding a niche. Despite its confidence that fixed radio links
will offer a cheaper means of communication than cable or cellular systems,
the company is more than a year away from offering a service, and it will
come on stream only after a third national operator - Energis - has been
launched on to the UK's telecoms market. Meanwhile, at the local level,
cable companies - mostly US-owned - are rapidly seducing customers from BT
with all-in telephone/cable TV packages.
At any rate, McKinnon could not hope for a broader-based company. Its
shareholders include Yorkshire Electricity, Telecom Finland, Robert Fleming
Investment Trust and Kingston Communications, the Hull telephone company.
