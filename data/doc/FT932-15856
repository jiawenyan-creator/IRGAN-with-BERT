FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: United cuts another Dollars
5.5bn spending
UNITED AIRLINES, one of the 'big three' US carriers, is to cut Dollars 5.5bn
from its capital spending plans over the next three years, by delaying
deliveries of 49 new Boeing aircraft.
This comes on top of the Dollars 3.6bn cut which the carrier announced last
year, through the deferral of 122 Boeing aircraft deliveries in the
1992-1995 period.
United announced the outcome of its latest round of negotiations with the
Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer yesterday, and confirmed that it would
take delivery of 11 of the new 777 wide-body aircraft in 1995 as planned.
However, the delivery schedule for the jets will be revised in later years.
United is a launch customer for the 777, and discussions between the two
companies have been watched particularly closely for this reason.
As far as the 49 aircraft are concerned, United said it would convert these
firm orders into options. These would be exercisable in the 1996-99 period,
whereas the orders would have been delivered between 1993 and 1996. United
would, however, lose 'significant deposits' if it failed to take delivery of
the aircraft before the year 2000.
The aircraft involved are 31 737s, eight 747-400s, two 757-200s and eight
767-300ERs.
United will now take only five Boeing 777s in 1996, instead of nine. Two of
the last four aircraft, originally due to arrive in 1996, will be
rescheduled for delivery in 1998, and two will be delivered in 1999. These
rescheduled aircraft will also be converted from the shorter-range 'A'
version, which United had ordered, to the longer-range 'B' version.
Yesterday, United's chairman, Mr Stephen Wolf, stressed that his airline
would take no new Boeing deliveries until the 777 is introduced in May 1995,
and again blamed 'the immense economic problems' confronting the airline
industry for the cuts. 'Any decision to reinstate these orders will be based
on United's ability to achieve appropriate levels of profitability,' he
said.
Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier and close to emerging
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, is projecting an operating profit of
almost Dollars 170m between May and the end of the year, although it will
have been loss-making up until April.
Finance executives also told the bankruptcy court that the airline's
projections suggest operating profits of almost Dollars 270m in 1994, rising
to more than Dollars 440m by 1996.
American Airlines said it would reduce to 76 the number of daily flights
from its San Jose hub by July. It currently operates 124 flights daily.
Southwest Airlines, the smaller but successful low-cost carrier, has said it
will begin flying from the Californian city, but American said the
retrenchment had been planned before that announcement. Aeroflot, the
Russian airline, is working on a joint venture with US investors to create a
worldwide cargo network, Reuter reports.
