  [Text] A recent opinion poll in Norway shows that 46 
percent of the voters will say no in a referendum to Norway 
joining the EU [European Union], while only 32 percent will say 
yes. However, 55 percent of those surveyed think that Norway 
will eventually be a member by the year 2000. Norway, along 
with its Nordic neighbors Sweden and Finland, have completed 
negotiations with the EU and are scheduled to join in January 
1995, subject to referendums to be held later this year.
