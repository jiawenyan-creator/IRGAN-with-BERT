FT  28 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil coffee boss resigns from
national post
Mr Gilson Ximenes, head of Brazil's National Coffee Department (DNC), handed
in his resignation yesterday to the Minister of Industry and Commerce Mr
Elcio Alvares, Reuter reports from Rio de Janeiro.
A DNC spokesman said Mr Ximenes stepped down for 'personal reasons' after
nine months in the job. A replacement had not yet been named. His
resignation has been linked to that of his former boss, Mr Jose Eduardo
Andrade Vieira, who resigned as industry and commerce minister last year to
pursue political interests.
Reuter also reported from San Jose that Costa Rica yesterday suspended
exports of inferior quality coffee, following the example of Colombia and
Central American producers last week. Mr Guillermo Canet, executive director
of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute (ICAFE), said the aim was to support
coffee prices in international markets. The decision, taken by the ICAFE
governing board, affected coffee varieties whose prices had fallen below
Dollars 80 per 46kg sack.
