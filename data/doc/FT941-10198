a bank last year, reported a rise in 1993 pre-tax profit, to NKr272.5m
(Dollars 36m) from NKr133m in 1992, helped by an increase in net interest
income and a fall in loan losses.
Nevertheless, the bank's shares closed down NKr1.50 atNKr150.50 yesterday on
the Oslo bourse in active trading. Norgeskreditt will pay a dividend of
NKr8.50 per preference share, with the total payout reaching NKr96.4m.
Group net interest income rose to NKr313.7m, or 1.5 per cent of average
total assets, from NKr266.8m, or 1.3 per cent of average total assets.
Realised gains on bonds, certificates and foreign exchange reached NKr29.7m,
against a loss of NKr3.8m in 1992. Profits on shares amounted to NKr26m last
year, against a loss of NKr17.1m.
The bank said a write-down of NKr6.9m of the share portfolio at the end of
1992 was reversed in last year's first quarter.
