<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Arrests" rubric: "Bondarik </F>
Is Suspected of Removing a Party Comrade"] 
  [Text] "There is no politics in it," said St. Petersburg 
Procurator Vladimir Yeremenko, in commenting on the subject of 
detention and subsequent arrest of Nikolay Bondarik, one of the 
leaders of the Russian Party's Petersburg branch. 
  According to Vladimir Yeremenko, the representative of the 
Russian Party and three other St. Petersburg residents detained 
together with him have not yet been charged; nevertheless, after 
the detention period (three days) expired, the procuracy found 
it necessary to formally place Bondarik under arrest. "We have 
all the grounds to bring a murder charge against him within 10 
days," said the city procurator. 
  Nikolay Bondarik and his three comrades are suspected of 
murdering one of the Russian Party members, Tsikharev, whose 
body was found in the Karpovka River in May of last year.
