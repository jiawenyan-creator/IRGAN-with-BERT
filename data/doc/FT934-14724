FT  15 OCT 93 / Bank set to lose plea on closure
THE BANKING Appeals Tribunal is expected today to reject a complaint against
the Bank of England for petitioning to close Mount Banking, a small
Asian-owned bank, Andrew Jack and Richard Donkin write.
Mount Banking asked the tribunal to examine the reasons for the Bank of
England's petition to a High Court judge which led to it being placed in
provisional liquidation in October last year.
The tribunal's findings are expected to be circulated in a report today
after hearings held last month.
The tribunal is believed to have been the first to sit since it was
instituted as part of an appeals process in the 1987 Banking Act.
