  [Text] Turkish Republican People's Party Leader Deniz 
Baykal said yesterday in Thessaloniki that "certain steps" have 
been taken toward "resolution of the problems" of the Muslim 
minority in Thrace. However, once again he used the term 
"Turks" to describe the members of this religious minority. 
  In Thessaloniki, Baykal showed a different face than the one 
described in reports from Komotini and Xanthi. He was milder 
and more conciliatory. 
  At one point, he admitted that he did not express himself as 
he wanted to when, according to reports, he spoke in Xanthi 
about similarities between the Muslims in Thrace and...Bosnia. 
  The government yesterday condemned the incidents against 
Baykal in Thrace, where he was touring. Government Spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos advised Baykal to study the Treaty of 
Lausanne and international law and to keep in mind the Greek 
Constitution when referring to the "Turkish minority."
