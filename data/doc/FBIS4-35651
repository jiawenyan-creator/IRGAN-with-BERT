  [Text] Mr. Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for 
foreign affairs, received Pak Su-chol, special envoy of the 
[South Korean] president in his office this morning. They 
explored ways to further ties between the two friendly 
countries, particularly in the economic sphere. 
  Al-Hasan pointed out to the Korean official the advantages 
of 
investment in Jordan and hoped for an increased volume of 
bilateral trade. He hoped Korea would import Jordanian 
phosphate and potash, noting their high quality and the fact 
that transportation did not present much of a problem. 
  For his part, Pak applauded his Majesty King Husayn's wisdom 
and dynamism as a leader of world stature and promoter of 
stability and security in the Middle East. His country, he 
said, wanted to see investment and cooperation with Jordan 
increased through joint ventures and exchange visits by the 
public and private sectors. 
  The Korean official arrived in Amman this morning.
