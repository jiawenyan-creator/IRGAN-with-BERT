FT  27 SEP 93 / Europe defeated by US in Ryder Cup
AMERICA, captained by Tom Watson, yesterday retained the Ryder Cup at The
Belfry, central England, by 15-13 after being adrift midway through the
final afternoon of the three-day golf event.
The wildly fluctuating fortunes of Europe's golfers were watched by 30,000
spectators - and a worldwide television audience of 250m.
The US side won five of the last six singles to leave the 'home' side
dejected after a confident start in the biennial competition. There was one
moment to savour for the Europeans. Nick Faldo, world No 1, scored a
hole-in-one at the 189-yard 14th - only the second in cup history.
The event is now a big opportunity for corporate entertainment. Over 30,000
tickets a day were sold, 7,500 of these for corporate guests. Some 10,000
baby lobsters met their fate yesterday, while 1,000 sides of fresh salmon
were dished up over the three days, washed down by around 15,000 bottles of
wine on each of the days.
