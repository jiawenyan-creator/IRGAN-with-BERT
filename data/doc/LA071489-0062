INGLEWOOD AWARD IS WELL-DESERVED 
As a longtime resident of Inglewood, I too am proud of the All-America City 
Award, despite its critics (Times, July 7). Yes, it is unfortunate that 
apparently this award was mainly given on the crime prevention programs 
established by the city. The prevention of crime is foremost on people's minds 
everywhere and Inglewood is no exception. 
Let me assure you, however, that there are many other worthwhile programs and 
activities in this city to qualify us as All-American: Inglewood Women's 
Beautification Assn., which, in cooperation with block clubs and individuals, 
is planting and maintaining flower beds three times a year all throughout the 
city; the annual Community Recognition Dinner; the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
festivities and the Memorial Day service; Fourth of July "Picnic in the Park"; 
Inglewood Playhouse; Sister City program; the excellent recreation facilities 
in all the parks; Inglewood Neighborhood Housing Service, a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to improving the housing and living conditions in their 
neighborhood, just to name a few. Citizens are participating on many levels and 
aspects of city life and determined to make a difference. Last but not least, 
as also noted in your paper, the interracial harmony we all enjoy. Inglewood is 
truly a dynamic and vibrant place to live. Let no one tell you otherwise! 
It is too bad that there are always critics gnawing and biting at the heels of 
success. Nevertheless, these folks are also a part of the whole experience that 
makes an All-America City.
