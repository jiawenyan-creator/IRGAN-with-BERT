FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: Context crucial in analysing Ukraine's nuclear
position
Sir, Given the level of attention that the international news media has
placed recently on Ukraine's delay in pursuing nuclear disarmament policies
acceptable to the west, we were pleased to see that your editorial 'Nuclear
rift over Ukraine' (May 5) presented an unbiased and thoughtful analysis of
Ukraine's current position.
As presented in your editorial, failure by western governments to evaluate
some of the underlying motives surrounding Ukraine's position on these
issues, and to pursue policies aimed at satisfying these concerns, threatens
to thwart reaching an agreement which all parties, including the Ukrainian
government, ultimately seek to accomplish: the dismantling of nuclear
weapons on Ukrainian soil.
Further, the inclination of the international news media to report
peripheral events without placing them within a broader context threatens to
present a biased picture to the world of a country with potential strategic
importance which is desperately attempting to define its role in
geopolitical concerns.
With a population of more than 52m people and a land mass about equal to
that of France, Ukraine is in the process of recognising this potential. Its
relatively homogenous balance of 74 per cent ethnic Ukrainians and 21 per
cent ethnic Russians helps to solidify the posture it takes in global
events.
Your perspective also fosters the ultimate goal of encouraging the creation
of a viable, democratic, nuclear-free state that offers opportunities for
investment and trade which benefit both Ukraine and the rest of the world.
As an officer of one of the largest private companies in Ukraine, I found it
refreshing to see that the Financial Times took a complete and responsible
look at the complex underlying issues and presented them in their proper
context.
