  [Text] A column by Fahmi Huwaydi that the newspaper 
AL-AHRAM publishes regularly every Tuesday has been banned. The 
banning of the article headlined "Dialogue on the Application of 
the Shari'ah" has come in the wake of the recent campaign 
against the writer, a campaign which has culminated in the 
publication of two articles in the same newspaper by two of 
Huwaydi's colleagues. 
  [The 12 April issue of AL-AHRAM contains no article by Fahmi 
Huwaydi. In the space allocated for this column on page 9, 
there are two articles by Hasan Duh and Ahmad 'Abd-al-Halim. 
Duh's article discusses the issue of the "repentant youth" who 
recently appeared on television. 'Abd-al-Halim's article deals 
with Arab national security. The two articles make no direct or 
indirect mention of Huwaydi.]
