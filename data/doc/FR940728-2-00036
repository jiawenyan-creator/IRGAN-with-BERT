on TGPL's Main Line ``B'', a 16-inch tap on Main Line ``C'' and approximately 1,200 feet of connecting 12-inch piping.




 TGPL states that it will deliver through the Cardinal Meter Station up to 84,000 Mcf of gas per day on a firm and/or interruptible
basis and that TGPL is not proposing to alter the total volumes authorized for delivery to PSNC or Piedmont. TGPL states
that the delivery point will have no impact on TGPL's peak day deliveries and little or no impact on TGPL's annual deliveries.

 Take notice that on July 18, 1994, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation (MRT), 9900 Clayton Road, St. Louis,
Missouri 63124, filed in Docket No. CP94666000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of
the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to construct
and operate facilities to upgrade a delivery point to serve National Steel Corporation (National Steel), an existing

to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open

 MRT proposes to upgrade its existing facilities at National Steel's plant in Granite City, Illinois, by replacing
the existing 6-inch regulator station with an 8-inch regulator station and making minor changes to yard and station
piping. MRT states that the purpose of the proposed upgrade is to eliminate the pressure drops associated with restrictions
in the existing 6-inch station. It is estimated that the cost of the upgrade would be $100,000. It is asserted that the
upgraded facilities will not result in an increase in the maximum daily volumes that MRT is authorized to transport
for National Steel pursuant to current service agreements. MRT states that it does not anticipate any impact on peak
day or annual deliveries to National Steel.
