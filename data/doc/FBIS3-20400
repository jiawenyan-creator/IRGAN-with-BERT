  [Text] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has 
stated that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller should first openly 
declare to the public that the coalition is dissolved before 
making a call to the rightist parties to unite. 
  Answering reporters' questions at the Istanbul Airport, 
Yilmaz stated that the True Path Party [TPP] was the real loser 
of the 27 March elections. Pointing out that the TPP, as the 
party in power, should have obtained at least an additional two 
to three points, Yilmaz added that the differences between ANAP 
and the TPP is reduced to 1 percent. 
  In answer to a question on Ciller's call at her assembly 
group meeting for the right to unite, Yilmaz said: 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] Ciller should first openly declare 
to the public that the coalition has dissolved before she makes 
a statement like this. As far as I know, they [TPP] are arguing 
that they are working in harmony with their coalition partners. 
Saying they are partners in a coalition, and calling for the 
right to unite, seems contradictory to me. Furthermore, we do 
not share their views regarding the messages that emerged from 
these elections. We do not think the election results call for 
the unification of the right. [end recording] 
  Assessing the election results in Istanbul, Yilmaz said that 
the persistent guidance of the press and the public opinion 
polls contributed to the results and added: What emerged in 
these elections is that all that guidance and efforts actually 
counter reacted. 
  Yilmaz said that it is too early to assess the 27 March 
local 
election results, and added that they will assess the situation 
following the final results.
