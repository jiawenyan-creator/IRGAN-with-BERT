FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Asko cuts debt and returns to
the black
ASKO, one of Germany's biggest retailers, returned to profit in the first
six months of this year and took steps to reduce borrowings.
For the six months ended March, after-tax profits totalled DM255m (Dollars
159m), Mr Klaus Wiegandt, chief executive, told the annual meeting.
This compares with a net loss of DM468m in the nine months to the end of
September and a profit of just DM6m in 1991 - there are no directly
comparable figures because of a change to the year-end.
Mr Wiegandt also said the group had raised nearly DM900m this year by
selling more than 1m shares in AVA, another retailer with a stock-market
listing in which Asko used to have a large stake. The disposal reduces
Asko's holding in AVA to 7 per cent.
The sale has helped cut group debt by DM1.9bn in the first half year. Mr
Wiegandt said it would be possible to pay off another DM500m of debt in the
current half, in line with plans to reduce borrowings from about DM4.7bn at
the end of March to about DM2bn by the end of the year.
Asko's return to profit reflects the absence of the provisions and
write-offs on investments which led to large losses last year. It is in the
middle of a rationalisation programme designed to deal with the consequences
of a spate of acquisitions in the late 1980s.
Turnover for the six months was DM10.58bn, down from the DM10.74bn in the
October 1991 to March 1992 period - but after adjusting for changes to sales
area, turnover rose by 1.7 per cent.
Mr Wiegandt said the group could expect turnover for the full year to be
more than DM20bn.
Asko is controlled by the Swiss-based Metro group, part of the retail empire
owned by the reclusive Mr Otto Beisheim.
