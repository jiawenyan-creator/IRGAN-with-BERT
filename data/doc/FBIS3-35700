<F P=106> [A.N.-signed report: "Airing of Television, Radio Programs </F>
May Stop Unless Government Fulfills Communications Workers' 
Demands"] 
  [Text] Communications enterprises personnel "will have to 
stop airing television and radio programs on Russian Federation 
territory," said representatives of workers collectives of 
communications enterprises that ensure the distribution of state 
television and radio programs. 
  In their appeal to the Russian president, the government, 
and 
the Federal Assembly, the communications workers explain the 
proposed "forced halt" in airing television and radio programs 
by "an emergency situation" that came about at communications 
enterprises. According to the appeal, this situation was caused 
by the television and radio companies' two- or three-month 
delays in payments to communications enterprises because funds 
were not appropriated from the republican budget. As a result, 
all of them wound up in the red, had to stop purchases of 
materials and spare parts, and had to cancel plans to buy 
electronic products. This is why emergency reserves have been 
depleted within the past two years, and why presently no routine 
repairs of mast antennas are being carried out, which in itself 
is fraught with serious consequences. 
  Given that, the authors of the appeal demand that the 
government "approve the amounts of state television and radio 
broadcasting and decide on financing them taking into account 
changes in tariffs and inflation." By the deadline set by the 
communications workers, the Russian Federation Finance Ministry 
is also obliged to fulfill Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
directive of 22 December with regard to repaying debts to 
communications enterprises to the tune of 67.6 billion rubles. 
  If these and a number of other demands are not fulfilled, 
the 
communications workers are intent on halting the airing of 
television and radio programs throughout Russian territory in 
the immediate future.
