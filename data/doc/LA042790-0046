FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A SLICE OF MANHATTAN IN BEVERLY HILLS 
The westward migration of New York restaurants to Los Angeles continues. 
Mezzaluna, 9428 Brighton Way, Beverly Hills, (213) 275-6703, stuck a couple of 
palm trees near the front door, but it's basically the same restaurant as the 
popular Manhattan original: a neighborhood pizza joint for the incredibly chic. 
Carpaccio comes in several guises -- with artichokes, with avocado, even 
briefly sauteed, for those who like their raw meat cooked. Pastas are the 
simple, rustic sort. And pizzas, which emerge crisp and thin-crusted from the 
sculpted mouth of a fire god -- actually a wood-burning oven -- come topped 
with things like pancetta and onions, or radicchio and smoked mozzarella. 
No reservations are accepted -- the idea is to drop in and hang out. While you 
wait for a table, count the Mezzaluna logos. The cheerful renderings of Italian 
half-moon-shaped chopping blades (sort of an 18th-Century version of a 
Veg-o-matic with smiley faces) pop up in the most unusual places. LAURIE OCHOA
