FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Spending on Tower Wharf hits Seacon
Seacon Holdings, the USM-quoted shipping and distribution group, reported a
25 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 1.72m for
the year to September 30, on turnover ahead 3 per cent at Pounds 19.3m.
Mr Chris Roth, chairman, said the figures partly reflected heavy capital
spending on the modernisation and development of Tower Wharf, in Kent, prior
to it commencing trading.
In addition, profits from fleet and cargo handling operations were lower,
caused by tighter margins reflecting depressed levels of inter-European
trade.
However, Mr Roth said that there had recently been some evidence of
improving margins in the short-sea trade.
He pointed out that an exceptional charge of Pounds 972,898 had been made to
cover potential losses on arrangements for the sale of the Golden Lion
Hotel, where it appeared that the purchasers would be unable to fulfil their
obligations.
On prospects, the chairman said that with the coming on stream of Tower
Wharf, he hoped for a marked improvement, though trade in general was only
slightly livelier than a year ago. Export shipments were generally higher,
but competition for freight contracts was fierce.
The recommended final dividend is increased to 3.4p making a total of 5.7p
(5.1p). Fully diluted earnings per share dropped from 14.9p to 11.46p.
To improve marketability, the 25p ordinary shares are to be split into 10p
shares.
The shares fell 6p to 235p.
