FT  14 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Contradictory signals leave
Dow easier
Wall Street
US shares fluctuated in a narrow range yesterday in the wake of
contradictory signals about the strength of inflationary pressures in the
economy, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.03 at 3,715.34. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 0.68 at 450.15, the American
SE composite eased 0.57 to 420.23 and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.36 to
719.48. New York SE volume came to 307m shares.
After falling modestly shortly after the opening bell, the market turned up
on the heels of soaring long bond prices and hovered near Monday's close for
the rest of the day. The 30-year bond gained more than half a point in
morning trading and some believed that the fixed-income market had now
factored in another interest rate increase later this month or early next
year.
Although the producer price index for November grew for the first time since
August, the increase of 0.5 per cent was well in line with economists'
expectations. A sub-index of intermediate goods was up 1.1 per cent, the
biggest monthly rise in four years, suggesting inflationary pressures at
work in earlier stages of the production cycle.
More signs of potential inflation came from strong retail sales figures
released by the Commerce Department. Throughout November, consumer spending
grew at an annual rate in excess of 10 per cent for the fourth quarter, more
than double last quarter's rate. And retail sales grew 1.2 per cent for the
month, more than double economists' forecasts of 0.5 per cent growth.
In spite of the signs of strong consumer demand, shares in retail stocks
were mixed. Sears Roebuck gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 45 1/8 , Woolworth
rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 14 1/4 , Federated Department Stores firmed
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 and the Gap was up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars
32. Retailers posting declines included Kmart, down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars
14 1/8 , Dayton Hudson, Dollars  5/8 off at Dollars 77 7/8 , and the
Limited, Dollars  1/8 softer at Dollars 18 5/8 . Dillard Department Store
was unchanged at Dollars 26 5/8 .
Shares in commercial banks, which tend to be especially sensitive to
interest rate changes, rose sharply. JP Morgan gained Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 59 1/8 , Wells Fargo advanced Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 146 1/2 ,
Chemical Banking put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 37 7/8 , Bankers Trust moved
ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58 7/8 and Citicorp was up Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 41 3/4 .
Philip Morris fell in the morning after a court ruled late on Monday that
airline crews could sue the company over the health effects of passive
smoking. By the close, however, the stock had rebounded to gain Dollars 1 at
Dollars 57 3/4 .
Canada
Equities in Toronto were relatively flat on the mixed economic data out of
the US yesterday. Strength in gold shares, posting their fifth straight
strong session after weeks on the downside, helped to offset a bad day for
metal mining issues and financial services stocks.
The TSE 300 index lost 0.68 point at 4,044.41, while rises led falls by 393
to 367 after volume of 58.7m shares. The golds group added 1.47 per cent.
