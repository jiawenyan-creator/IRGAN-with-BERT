"Companies/Research/Technology": "Polymer Films for 
Light-Emitting Diodes"] 
  [Text] Mainz--Teams at Mainz University's Institute for 
Physical Chemistry (Dr. Muhwald, professor, 
Jakob-Welder-Weg 
11, 55 128 Mainz) together with the Racah Institute of Physics 
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem want to develop a new 
class of materials for light-emitting diodes that are to replace 
the semiconductors primarily used thus far. Components made of 
organic materials are of particular interest here. 
  A thin polymer film is to be used for making these 
components. It will be constructed in two or three separate 
layers depending on its functions. This polymer film will be 
between two electrodes made of inorganic materials. The 
charge-transfer and light-emitting substances will be 
synthetically produced. The new kind of thin-film construction 
is to be combined with typical components for system design. At 
the same time systems will be developed by means of which inner 
boundaries can be characterized. Mastery of the structure of 
these boundaries, which are important for transfer processes, is 
a central mission they say. 
  According to the scientists, still more basic research will 
have to follow in order to be able to understand the film 
structures on the molecular scale, changes in them under strong 
current, and their meaning for charge transfer and luminescence. 
The merits of ultrathin films lie in their light weight, their 
pliability and the size of the components that can be made from 
them. Flat viewing screens measuring several square meters are 
being conceived of.
