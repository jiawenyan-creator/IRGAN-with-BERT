  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Leaders of all factions of 
the State Duma, including Yegor Gaydar, expressed concern over 
the military aspect of the Russian-Georgian treaty which is to 
be signed by President Boris Yeltsin in Tbilisi on Thursday and 
warned him they may not ratify it. 
  "The provisions of the treaty envisaging, in particular, a 
further agreement on assisting Georgia in creating its armed 
forces, in arming them and providing for them weapons, military 
equipment and technologies can, as we believe, detsabilise the 
situation in the Caucasus and become a barrier for the 
ratification of the treaty by the State Duma", they said in a 
letter to the president signed by Speaker Ivan Rybkin. 
  Yeltsin, in his turn, said before departing for Tbilisi on 
Thursday that the treaty will not be submitted for parliament 
ratification until Georgia settles the conflicts in its two 
self-styled regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
