  [Abstract] The most promising avenues for improving 
aircraft nonlinear systems with nonlinear aerodynamics appears 
to be through using on-board digital computers in the control 
loop and thereby creating adaptive digital control systems. For 
this reason, the general stages of methodology for designing 
systems to control highly maneuverable aircraft based on 
step-by-step adaptive control by using the concept of solving 
inverse dynamics problems are considered. The adaptive control 
system considered consists of the following: a nonlinear object 
(i.e., the aircraft), a drive, a booster, a programmer that 
effects the desired change in the state vector of the object 
over time and corresponds to its rudder deviation program, and a 
regulator that uses an algorithm for stabilizing the programmed 
motion and stabilizing the system and ensuring its specified 
dynamic properties in the presence of parametric and external 
disturbances. The system's operation is based on having the 
programmer and stabilization algorithm use information about the 
vector _P_ of the unknown parameters of the object that is 
issued by an identifier during the system's normal operation and 
about the vector _ch_ of the altitude and velocity parameters 
of 
the flight. A logic unit coordinates the adaptive digital 
control system's overall operation, and the programmer 
formulates the desired motion along controlled coordinates given 
random initial conditions of the object as read from transducers 
at specified time intervals. Within the framework of the 
proposed approach, the main stages in developing the required 
control algorithms are as follows: formulating the programmer's 
structure, developing algorithms to identify a model of the 
object, and developing the logic of the system's operation. The 
first stage is considered in detail, and the remaining two 
stages are left for a separate communication. The problem of 
formulating the required programmer entails formulating that 
program control u[.sup]*[/](t) that will, in the 
absence of disturbances, change the object's state vector in 
accordance with a prespecified law x[.sup]*[/](t). 
This is done by using the result of inverse dynamics problems 
and constructing an analytical model of the object used in the 
programmer to calculate u[.sup]*[/](t). A 
simplified nonlinear model of the object is generally used. The 
problem of developing a stabilization algorithm is approached by 
formulating a model of the object's motion that is linearized in 
relation to the control program. The linearized system is 
nonstationary and is formulated with consideration to the 
presence of uncontrollable parametric disturbances arising as a 
result of the inconsistency between the equations of the 
object's motion and the simplified model thereof that is used in 
the programmer. The general adaptive control system design 
principles proposed are illustrated by way of the example of 
formulating algorithms to control the longitudinal motion of an 
aircraft of the Kh-29 type in terms of nonlinear differential 
equations. The example illustrates that formulation of the 
required program control necessitates information about the 
following: the object's initial state (obtained from 
transducers), the required end value of the attack angle 
(specified by the pilot), and estimates of six parameters of the 
object (calculated in the identifier). The function 
u[.sup]*[/](t) is a continuous function of time. 
The importance of delineating acceptable controls is emphasized. 
The proposed stabilization algorithm results in stability of 
maneuvering processes over a broad range of attack angles.
