SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission, under the IOAA, is authorized to establish fees for services and benefits that it provides. The IOAA
states:




(a) ... That each service or thing of value provided by an agency ... to a person ...
be self-sustaining to the extent possible. 

(b) ... Each charge shall be_

(1) fair; and 

(2) based on_

(A) the costs to the Government; 

(B) the value of the service or thing to the recipient; 

(C) public policy or interest served; and 

(D) other relevant facts.

 


31 U.S.C. 9701. 



The primary guidance for implementation of the IOAA is Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') Circular A25,
as revised July 8, 1993. OMB Circular A25 requires that a reasonable charge be made to each recipient for a measurable
unit or amount of Government service from which the recipient derives a benefit, in order that the Government recover
the full cost of rendering that service. 

OMB Circular A25 further provides that full cost be determined or estimated from the best available records
in the agency, and that it cover the direct and indirect costs to the Government of providing a good resource or service,
including but not limited to:

 


(1) Direct and indirect personnel costs, including salaries and fringe benefits such as medical insurance and retirement.


(2) Physical overhead, consulting, and other indirect costs including material and supply costs, utilities, insurance,
travel, and rents or imputed rents on land, buildings, and equipment. 

(3) The management and supervisory costs. 

(4) The costs of enforcement, collection, research, establishment of standards, and regulation, including any
environmental impact statements. 




OMB Circular A25 further calls for a biennial reassessment of user charges, with related adjustment of fees,
if necessary, and the establishment of new fees where none exists. 



The courts have interpreted the IOAA on several occasions, establishing general standards that agencies must meet
in establishing fees. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that a fee may only be charged for a special benefit provided
to identifiable beneficiaries measured by its value to the recipient. The special benefit is also required to have
some connection between the agency and the recipient other than the mere fact of regulation or the adoption of some
practice of general benefit to the industry as a whole. Thus, the Court upheld that portion of OMB Circular A25
stating that there could be no charge where the identity of the beneficiary is obscure and the services can be primarily
considered to benefit the general public. 

See National Cable Television Association v. United States, 

415 U.S. 336 (1974) and 

FPC v. New England Power Co., 

415 U.S. 345 (1974). 

In 1976, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rendered a series of decisions that provided
additional guidance for agencies adopting or revising fee schedules issued under the IOAA. 

See National Cable Television Association v. F.C.C., 

554 F.2d 1094 (D.C. Cir. 1976); 

Electronics Industries Association v. F.C.C., 

554 F.2d 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1976); 

Capital Cities Communications Inc. v. F.C.C., 

554 F.2d 1135 (D.C. Cir. 1976). In those decisions, the court set out the following guidelines:

 


1. An agency may impose a reasonable charge on recipients for an amount of work for which they benefit. The fees must
be for specific services to specific persons. These services include the issuance of a license and assistance in complying
with a statutory duty such as tariff filing. 

2. The fees may not exceed the cost to the agency in rendering the service. 

3. An agency may recover the full cost of providing a service to an identifiable beneficiary regardless of the incidental
public benefits which may flow from service.




Also, when an agency proposes a fee, it must meet the following requirements: 




1. The agency must justify the assessment of a fee by a clear statement of the particular service or benefit for which
it seeks reimbursement. 

2. The agency must calculate the cost basis for each fee by: 

a. Allocating specific expenses of the cost basis of the fee to the smallest practical unit. 

b. Excluding expenses that service an independent public interest; and 

c. A public explanation of the specific expenses included in a cost basis for a particular fee, and an explanation of
the criteria used to include or exclude a particular item. 

3. The fee must be set to return the cost basis at a rate that reasonably reflects the cost of the services performed and
value conferred on the payor. 






Electronic Industries Association v. F.C.C., 

554 F.2d at 1117. 



The above guidelines were followed by the Commission when it last updated its schedule of filing and service fees in
1983. Dockets Nos. 8232 and 8233, 

Filing and Service Fees, 

21 S.R.R. 1517, 21 S.R.R. 1575 (1983). At that time, the Commission conducted cost studies to determine the processing
costs for its various fee items. 

The Commission's current filing and service fees, however, do not include fees for certain services that appear to
provide special benefits to identifiable members of the public. In light of OMB's requirement that agencies assess
fees for 

all 

identifiable special benefits, and, in particular, OMB's direction that the FMC consider implementation of tariff
and service contract filing fees to offset its FY 1996 appropriation,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission is proposing new fees for several services. In keeping with OMB Circular A25, the new fees reflect
the fully distributed cost of those services. The proposed new fees are set forth in this Notice.

</FOOTNAME>
OMB has expressed its desire for the Commission to establish fees through its ``passback'' to the Commission's FY
1995 budget submission for FY 1996. After OMB reviews the Commission's agency budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal
year, OMB ``passes back'' its budget proposal to the agency.
