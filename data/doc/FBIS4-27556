  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Both import and export 
contracts concluded in April by 19 major Japanese trading houses 
fell from a year earlier, an industry group reported Monday [30 
May]. 
  The Japan Foreign Trade Council, which groups major trading 
companies, said the export contracts were down 18.0 percent in 
value to 656.3 billion yen and import contracts fell 24.0 
percent to 906.7 billion yen. 
  Export contracts posted the sixth consecutive year-on-year 
fall and import contracts recorded the seventh such drop. 
  The council blamed the decreased export contracts on a slump 
in auto export contracts, which it said stemmed from the yen's 
appreciation and increased production by Japanese-owned assembly 
plants overseas. 
  The lower import contracts were blamed on declines in 
purchases of crude oil, as well as purchase of petroleum 
products from Southeast Asia. 
  The council said exports are likely to recover in the coming 
months, noting that demand is increasing for automobiles and 
steel in the United States and other markets. 
  Imports may also increase in the months ahead, especially of 
machinery from other Asian countries, the council said.
