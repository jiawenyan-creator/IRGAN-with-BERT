I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



PTC is declaring a dividend payable on January 20, 1994, to stockholders of record as of December 31, 1993.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to report the declaration of a dividend payable on January 20, 1994, to PTC's
stockholders of record as of December 31, 1993.

By letter dated March 27, 1989, from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board of Governors''),
PTC was prohibited from paying dividends to its stockholders. By letter dated June 9, 1992, from the Board of Governors,
PTC was relieved of the restriction on the payment of dividends on the understanding that dividends, if declared,
would be declared periodically by PTC's Board of Directors and paid at a rate not to exceed the 90-day United States
Treasury bill rate in effect at the time the dividend is declared. By order dated January 15, 1993,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission approved PTC's practice of paying such dividends out of net profits subject to the limitations imposed
by the Board of Governors and subject to the further requirements that (i) prior to using excess income from invested
principal and interest (``PI'') to pay a dividend, PTC's Board of Directors be advised of any amount related
to the investment of PI which has not been rebated and is part of the net profits used to declare the dividend, and
affirmatively approve the application of such excess PI income for the dividend, and (ii) PTC file a proposed
rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act each time it declares a dividend. PTC paid its first dividend
on January 18, 1993, in the amount of $.52 per share, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December
31, 1992.

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31746 (January 27, 1993), 58 FR 6319.

</FOOTNOTE>


At its meeting of December 21, 1993, PTC's Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $.525 per share, payable
on January 20, 1994, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 1993. This dividend rate does
not exceed the 90-day United States Treasury bill rate in effect on December 21, 1993 (3.11%, as published in The Wall
Street Journal on December 21, 1993). The dividend does not include any excess income attributable to investments
of PI as all such PI related income with respect to fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 will be rebated to
participants, pro rata, based on the amount of PI disbursements to each participant.

The issuance of a dividend under these circumstances advances the requirements of fair representation of shareholders
and participants under Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act in that it provides an incentive for participants to invest
in PTC shares, and is also consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among participants.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



PTC does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes any burden on competition.
