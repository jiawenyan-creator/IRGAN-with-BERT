VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
ARCHIVES MAY YIELD HOLOCAUST MATERIAL 
Ventura County residents who lost relatives in the Holocaust may get 
information from recently opened Soviet archives through the local chapter of 
the American Red Cross. 
The archives contain material recovered by the Soviet Army during the 
liberation of concentration camps at the close of World War II. 
Included are 70,000 death certificates from Auschwitz in Poland and the names 
of 130,000 prisoners forced into labor in Germany. Also released were the names 
of 200,000 other victims from camps in Sachsenhausen, Gross Rosen and 
Buchenwald. 
A search through the lists would be done by the Holocaust and War Victims 
Tracing Center in Baltimore and could take one to two years, a Red Cross 
representative said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER
