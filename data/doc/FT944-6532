FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr feud continues as deal terms rejected
The family feud at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust flared up yesterday as rebel
shareholders rejected a last-ditch agreement with the board of the motor and
leisure group.
The rebels, led by brothers Nicholas and Robert Barr, rejected the deal
which had been settled at the end of last week. They also voted down the
board's proposals to reform the company's two-tier share structure.
The deal would have paved the way for the brothers to join the board and for
their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, to resign as chairman.
However, the brothers, who speak for more than 50 per cent of ordinary
voting shares, said the board had rejected 'compromise proposals'.
Mr Nicholas Barr said: 'Serious concerns were expressed by management within
the company's two main divisions and the company failed to finalise
essential elements of Friday's deal.'
The board had wanted to enfranchise the non-voting A shares, owned almost
entirely by institutional investors, at an extraordinary meeting in Leeds
yesterday.
It said that the brothers had made unreasonable demands including the
appointment of an additional non-executive director and the payment of their
independent adviser bills, thought to amount to Pounds 245,000.
The rebel shareholders, who want to demerge the company's two divisions,
have requisitioned a further EGM on Thursday to remove Mr Parker and Mr
Brian Small, finance director.
The ordinary shares rose 10p yesterday to 543p, while the A shares rose 8p
to 266p, before news of the enfranchisement vote was released.
