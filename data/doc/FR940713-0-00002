SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The Mediterranean fruit fly, 

Ceratitis capitata 

(Wiedemann), is one of the world's most destructive pests of numerous fruits and vegetables. The Mediterranean fruit
fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can cause complete loss of crops, and losses of
25 to 50 percent are not uncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid development of serious outbreaks.

We established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.78 through 301.7810; referred to below
as the regulations) and quarantined the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles County, CA, in an interim rule effective on
November 5, 1991, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 13, 1991 (56 FR 5757357579, Docket No. 91155). The regulations impose restrictions on the
interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Medfly to noninfested
areas of the United States. We have published a series of interim rules amending these regulations by adding to or removing
from the list of quarantined areas certain portions of Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino,
and San Diego Counties, CA. Amendments affecting the quarantined areas in California were made effective on September
10, and November 12, 1992; and on January 19, July 16, August 3, September 15, October 8, November 22, and December 16,
1993; and on January 10, February 14, and March 4, 1994 (57 FR 4248542486, Docket No. 911552; 57
FR 5416654169, Docket No. 911553; 58 FR 63436346, Docket No. 911554; 58
FR 3912339124, Docket No. 911555; 58 FR 4248942491, Docket No. 911556;
58 FR 4918649190, Docket No. 911557; 58 FR 5310553109, Docket No. 911558;
58 FR 6302763031, Docket No. 911559; 58 FR 6762767630, Docket No. 9115510;
59 FR 22812283, Docket No. 9115511; 59 FR 78957896, Docket No. 9115512;
and 59 FR 1117711180, Docket No. 9115513).
We have determined, based on trapping surveys conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
and California State and county agency inspectors, that the Medfly has been eradicated from the quarantined area
in Riverside County, CA. The last finding of the Medfly thought to be associated with the infestation in this area was
made on December 17, 1993. Since then, no evidence of infestation has been found in this area. We have determined that
the Medfly no longer exists in this area, and we are therefore removing it from the list of areas in 301.783(c)
quarantined because of the Mediterranean fruit fly. As a result of this action there are no longer any quarantined
areas in Riverside County. Portions of Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino Counties remain quarantined.


Immediate Action


The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. The area in California affected by this document
was quarantined due to the possibility that the Mediterranean fruit fly could spread to noninfested areas of the United
States. Since this situation no longer exists, and the continued quarantined status of this area would impose unnecessary
regulatory restrictions on the public, immediate action is warranted to remove restrictions from the noninfested
area.
