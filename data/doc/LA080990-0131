SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: BALDWIN PARK; 
RECYCLING PROGRAM OKD 
The City Council has approved a mandatory residential recycling program to 
begin Feb. 1. 
Webster's Refuse Disposal, which contracts with the city, will provide every 
residence with separate collection bins for newspapers, glass and aluminum. 
The bins will be picked up on regular trash collection days. 
Although the program is mandatory, residents can either participate in the 
curbside effort or take their recyclable materials to buyback centers or other 
recycling programs. 
Homeowners will pay nothing for the service the first year. During the second 
year, they will pay a recycling charge of up to 25 cents a month. The cost for 
the third year has not been determined. 
The program was approved last Wednesday on a 4-1 vote, with Councilman Herschel 
Keyser dissenting because he opposes the mandatory fee.
