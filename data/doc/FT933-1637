FT  23 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Kantor warning on Nafta delay
MR Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, yesterday issued a ringing
defence of the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned that an
opportunity to secure another such pact would not happen for a generation.
If the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada failed to win congressional
approval 'it will be our children negotiating the next Nafta,' he said in a
speech before the American Business Conference.
Both Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance
committee, and Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, have voiced
strong reservations about the pact. They have hinted it might win
congressional approval were it sent back to the White House for
renegotiation.
Mr Kantor characterised Nafta as the administration's top foreign policy
initiative.
For years the US had coped with Mexican tariffs, quotas and performance and
production requirements. 'Why in the world anyone would want to continue
this unfair situation is frankly beyond me. What they are saying is maintain
the status quo,' he said.
Turning to the Uruguay Round, Mr Kantor called French dissatisfaction with
the US-EC farm trade pact, agreed last year at Washington's Blair House, 'an
internal EC matter' in which the US would not get involved. This will not
help Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, when he arrives in
Washington on Monday to request 'clarifications' on the deal.
Uruguay Round negotiations in Geneva had been 'moving quite well,' Mr Kantor
added, although 'the French, of course, have not helped the situation by
raising this Blair House agreement.'
He said in future US trade policy would focus more on Asia where 'we have
not been as successful at building trade regimes around our relationship'.
