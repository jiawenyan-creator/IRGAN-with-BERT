<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Petrenko and A. Oslon, compiled on the basis </F>
of an analytical report of the Public Opinion Foundation: "Is 
the Political Situation in Russia Predictable?"; first paragraph 
is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] The very first appraisals of the results of the 
Russian parliamentary elections announced on the night of Dec., 
13, 1993, on Channel One of the Ostankino TV Center, turned out 
to be shocking. All the forecasts of the election returns 
completely contradicted the real results of the voting. 
Therefore today, on the eve of the local elections (the 
presidential elections are not far off either), sociologists 
prefer simply to abstain from any forecasts, and newspapers -- 
from publishing any. And nevertheless: What has happened? What 
is happening? What may happen? 
<H5>  Error One: Victims of Self-Hypnosis </H5>
  Let us recall just a few attempts by newspapers and 
sociological centers to outstrip one another in predicting the 
outcome of the elections. 
  Komsomolskaya Pravda of Nov. 13, on the basis of a 
survey conducted among 40 prominent personalities in Russia, 
assured us: "No 'dark horses' are expected to emerge on Russian 
political scene. The pack of political leaders is the same: 
Yeltsin, Gaidar, Chernomyrdin, Yavlinsky..." 
  Almost simultaneously two newspapers -- Segodnya 
of Nov. 30 and MK of Dec. 1 -- published their 
conclusions on the composition of the State Duma on the basis of 
the opinion polls carried out by the All-Russia Center for 
Public Opinion and Market Research (VCIOM for short). In both 
publications the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) was 
left out of the picture. The measurements of public opinion by 
different centers, irrespective of their methods and 
technologies, did not vary much from one another. At the 
earliest stage of the election campaign Zhirinovsky and the LDPR 
were mentioned only at the tail of rating lists headed by 
Russia's Choice and Gaidar. 
  True, the first warning appeared already on Nov. 3 in 
Nezavisimaya Gazeta: simultaneously with a growth in 
the President and the government's rating the majority of the 
population wants a return to the situation as it existed before 
1985... Almost simultaneously -- on Oct. 30 -- the poll carried 
out among Russia's urban population by the Public Opinion 
Foundation put on record a reduction by nearly one-third (from 
19 to 13 percent) in the share of those voting for Russia's 
Choice with the simultaneous growth (also by one-third -- from 
13 to 19 percent) in the number of those who refused to go to 
the polls. 
  But at the same time, reports continued to be published 
featuring the results of street polls by VCIOM, according to 
which the popularity of Russia's Choice continued to grow. And 
Komsomolskaya Pravda reported on Nov. 13: Yegor 
Gaidar placed first in the list of top ten leaders, Yeltsin was 
the runner-up, and "Zhirinovsky was far behind somewhere in the 
middle of the remaining names on the list." 
  In the second half of November, on the eve of the TV 
election 
campaign, the fall in the popularity of Russia's Choice was 
already showing up in the results of street polls by the Center 
for the Study and Forecasting of Social Processes 
(Izvestia, Nov. 25), in VCIOM's polls on Moscow 
streets (MN, Dec. 5) and the polls conducted in 
Moscow over the phone by the Institute of Sociology and 
Parliamentarianism (the news program of TV's Channel One, Nov. 
25, 21:00 hrs). 
  But practically no one paid attention to this hardly 
pronounced, barely visible trend at that time. For all intents 
and purposes, researchers and journalists, hypnotized by 
"absolute" figures, did not admit that public opinion could 
change at such a rapid pace. Thus a person, who has never seen a 
storm in a desert, does not guess what the first gentle breeze 
may signal. 
  The same Center for the Study and Forecasting of Social 
Processes predicted in Izvestia on Nov. 25: "Russia's 
Choice... may count on 30 percent of the votes (compared with 34 
percent in mid-October and 32 percent at the beginning of the 
month)... communists may hope for 6 percent... as much as V. 
Zhirinovsky's party... The main struggle for leadership is 
unfolding between RC and Yavlinsky's bloc..." 
  We know of cases when voters, who did not manage to decide 
whom to cast their ballot for, reacted to these kind of 
forecasts in a fully definite manner: as a "joke" they voted for 
Zhirinovsky in the belief that it is this party that had no 
chance to win and that one vote would not change the picture. 
Nobody knows how many voters were guided by such considerations 
on election day. 
<H5>  Error Two: Ban on the Central Electoral Commission: Whom </H5>
Sociologists Were Lobbying For 
  Incidentally, Rossiiskya Gazeta warned in its 
December issues that Zhirinovsky's party was scoring points in 
the regions when it reported figures from Yekaterinburg: "In the 
past two weeks the number of the LDPR's sympathizers had 
increased more than fivefold." With a reference to the findings 
of the Sociograph Institute, Trud wrote about the 
same: "There is a deep gap between the sentiments of the 
inhabitants of the capitals... and those of the inhabitants of 
small towns and rural settlements. The position of the Russian 
provinces will largely determine the outcome of the voting... 
The assertions about the pro-governmental bloc's unconditional 
victory do not look convincing." And on Dec. 11 L. Sedov (VCIOM) 
in the newspaper Segodnya went even farther: "...The 
LDPR's second place may come as a surprise... This party seems 
to have revealed an ability for a powerful finish..." 
  As it has become clear today, some sociological service had 
to take just one step to grasp the scope and speed of this 
spurt. But time was already running out. Ten days before the 
elections (at the very height of events) the ban on publishing 
the results of opinion polls came into force. Notably, L. 
Sedov's forecast about "the LDPR's powerful finish" appeared 
already in defiance of this ban (on Dec. 4 similar data were 
also obtained by the Public Opinion Foundation, but publications 
were discontinued beginning with Dec. 2). 
  The people did not know even what sociologists were 
beginning 
to predict. 
  At this very time sociologist Vsevolod Vilchek called upon 
his colleagues to keep silent: "If my colleagues did not rush to 
the air today with yet another batch of sensations, but demanded 
of the powers that be that they adopt emergency measures to 
protect spectators-electors against demagoguery, including the 
publication of uncontrollable sociological findings... 
Sociological lobbying is already a banality; there are already 
signs of something new: ordered sociological killings, at any 
rate -- assassination attempts... The best thing we can do is 
temporarily halt the publication of findings by any of the 
sociological services." 
  But if sociologists did lobby anyone, then by no means was 
it 
Zhirinovsky. The ban imposed by the Central Electoral Commission 
provoked the publication of obsolete findings and premature 
conclusions. 
<H5>  Error Three: Effect of TV Advertising: Whom the Central </H5>
Electoral Commission Helped 
  Many newspaper pages have been devoted to the election 
advertising campaign on TV, specifically, about the absence of 
dialogues between political leaders both with each other and 
with journalists, which would hinder the effectiveness of the 
most populist promises. It will be recalled that it is the 
Central Electoral Commission that chose a procedure which 
permitted solely the "monologue" forms of broadcasting. 
  The results of the Public Opinion Foundation's polls were 
used to calculate the index showing how successful each party 
was in its advertising campaign. The index was calculated daily 
on the basis of replies to two questions: "Whom will you vote 
for at the elections?" and "Which bloc do you think about the 
most?" Point "1" was awarded if the respondent remembered the 
bloc he was going to vote for, "2" if he remembered the bloc he 
was not going to vote for, "1" if he did not remember the 
opposing bloc, and "2" if he did not remember "his own." 
  Let us cite the average scores for all respondents who 
watched the TV campaign ads of certain blocs and parties:

<H5>  Error Four: Underestimating the Role of the Provinces </H5>
  One of the key conclusions to be drawn by sociologists 
themselves after what has happened is this: in such forecasts it 
is impossible to rely on large cities (where it is easier to 
conduct opinion polls). You may judge the degree of the error 
stemming therefrom by the extent that the electors' preferences 
differed in large cities and small towns, settlements and 
villages: 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                  |Russia            |Large Cities      |Small Cities      | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|LDPR              |23                |21                |26                |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  Error Five: The People Did Not Keep Silent, but Neither Did </H5>
They Tell the Whole Truth 
  There is one more distorting factor: after the sufficiently 
rigid actions in relation to the opposition by far not everyone 
was sincere in answering the blunt questions of the polls on how 
they would vote. According to the results of one of our research 
studies (on Dec. 25), from 12-14 percent (voters favoring the 
Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and Russia's Choice) to 18-37 
percent (those in favor of the LDPR and the Agrarian Party 
respectively) either doubted this sincerity or denied it in 
general. 
<H5>  Error Six: Those Who Climb Fast Fall Quickly </H5>
  Having talked about how the real picture was being 
distorted, 
let us ask this question: how did this distorting, for its part, 
influence public opinion? Who stood to lose by this? 
  Let us cite the breakdown of replies to the question: 
"Knowing the preliminary results of the voting, what party or 
bloc would you have voted for today?" 
  For the sake of clarity the electoral associations are 
grouped in four categories -- the Right (Russia's choice, Party 
of Russian Unity &amp; Accord, Russian Democratic Reforms 
Movement); 
the Center (Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, Civic Union, Russia's 
Future -- New Names, Democratic Party); the Opposition 
(Communist Party, Liberal Democratic Party, Agrarian Party) and 
the "special interest" groups -- Women of Russia, Kedr, Dignity 
and Mercy): 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Right             |Center            |Opposition        |Special Interest  | 
|                  |                  |                  |Groups            | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Before elections                                                           | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|21                |12                |19                |5                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|During the voting                                                          | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|19                |13                |27                |6                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|After elections (knowing the result)                                       | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|24                |13                |27                |5                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  It should be noted that the 5 percent of the votes lost by 
the progovernmental bloc Russia's Choice solely owing to society 
being ignorant of what was going on was one-fifth of the entire 
number of votes which it could have polled.
