FT  05 OCT 94 / Observer: Ready steady
Surprise, surprise. Next year's Derby - first run on the Epsom downs in 1780
 -is to be sponsored by Vodafone, the UK mobile phone mob which has more
money than it knows what to do with. Not surprisingly, Gerry Whent, chief
executive of Vodafone, and Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman, are keen on the
gee-gees - Sir Ernest's horse Cacoethes came in third in the 1989 Derby. At
the launch of the Pounds 3.5m, three-year sponsorship package at the Savoy
yesterday Sir Ernest denied that the decision to back the Derby had
originated at the top, but had been taken by a company committee which had
recommended it to the board. It was unanimously approved. Of course.
