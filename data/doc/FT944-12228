FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cigna sells reinsurance business
to cut losses
Cigna, the US insurer, is withdrawing from the reinsurance business as part
of an attempt to turn round its loss-making property/casualty insurance
operations.
With premiums of Dollars 507m last year, Cigna was among the top 30
reinsurers worldwide.
The company is selling its international reinsurance business, which
generated premiums of Dollars 270m in 1993; transfering its US agricultural
insurance operations, with Dollars 100m of premiums, to its domestic
property/casualty insurer; and closing the rest of the US reinsurance
operations, which had premiums of Dollars 150m.
Its departure from the business echoes moves by other US insurers to reduce
their exposure to property/casualty losses in the wake of big catastrophe
and pollution claims. Prudential Insurance announced plans last year to sell
its own reinsurance company, Prudential Re.
Cigna, which does not publish separate results for its loss-making
reinsurance business, said its overall property/casualty insurance
operations, which include reinsurance, lost Dollars 69m in the third quarter
and Dollars 216m in the nine months to September.
The company closed down its UK reinsurance business two years ago, but
continued to take run-off losses on this business of Dollars 10m last year.
Cigna is selling its reinsurance business in Europe, south-east Asia and
Latin America to St Paul, and its business in Japan and Korea to Employers
Re.
The company reported overall third-quarter net income of Dollars 123m, or
Dollars 1.70 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 94m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, a year ago. The latest figures reflect a Dollars 9m charge and
Dollars 26m of additional reserves to reflect the withdrawal from
reinsurance.
