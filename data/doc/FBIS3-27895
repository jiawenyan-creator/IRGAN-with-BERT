<F P=106> [Interview with Private First Class Kim Chol-chin and </F>
Private Kim Kyong-chol of North Korea's People's Security Forces 
by unidentified reporters at the Metropolitan Armed Forces 
Hospital in Seoul on 29 January] 
  [Text] [SEOUL SINMUN] How is your health? 
  [North Korean soldier] We are fine. We became 
unconscious because we did not drink a single drop of water for 
two days. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] How did you, soldiers, catch fish aboard a 
rowboat and were you adrift? 
  [North Korean soldier] We caught fish with nets used 
during off-duty hours by platoon soldiers serving in our 
guardpost. The weather was good as we were leaving on 25 
January, however, sudden heavy seas prevented us from rowing the 
boat. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] What do you know about South Korea? What do 
North Korean newspapers and broadcasting stations inform you 
about South Korea? 
  [North Korean soldier] South Korea is a society in which 
there are rich people and poor people. North Korea is 
different. It is hard to say, but we know South Korea is not a 
good society in many respects. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Do you want to see South Korean society? 
  [North Korean soldier] Definitely not. All we want is to 
return home. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] You may be punished when you return home. 
Are you afraid? 
  [North Korean soldier] We will return even if we may be 
punished. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Why did you completely shave your heads? 
  [North Korean soldier] All soldiers shaved their heads 
last October under an order from the leadership. We know such 
an order was issued because shaven heads are good for combat, 
personal hygiene, and medical treatment. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Did you feel people you have met here are 
your compatriots? 
  [North Korean soldier] Yes. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] Will reunification be achieved? 
  [North Korean soldier] Reunification will be achieved 
next year. It is definite because the father [oboi] Kim 
Chong-il said so. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] How was the food at the hospital? 
  [North Korean soldier] I serve at an isolated place to 
which there is no train service. The reason the food here is so 
good must be because this is the central hospital. 
  [SEOUL SINMUN] How is your life in the North Korean Army? 
  [North Korean soldier] We must serve in the Army for 10 
years. I have not visited my home since I joined the Army. [end 
soldier] 
  Kim Chol-chin has served in the Army for seven years, and 
Kim 
Kyong-chol, for four years.
