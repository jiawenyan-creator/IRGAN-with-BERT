FT  18 DEC 92 / Panic denounces election rival
The Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Milan Panic, yesterday urged tens of
thousands of cheering Serbs to depose his rival, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Serbia, in elections on Sunday, writes Laura Silber in
Belgrade.
About 100,000 people braved freezing temperatures to show their support for
Mr Panic, the strongest challenger to Mr Milosevic.
Mr Panic said Mr Milosevic had 'built a Chinese wall around Serbia' through
war.
