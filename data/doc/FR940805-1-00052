The Coast Guard encourages interest persons to participate in the rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD
87069) and the specific section of the proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment.
Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, no larger than 81/2 by 11 inches, suitable

Reopening of Comment Period



On April 12, 1994, the Coast Guard published an NPRM proposing to amend its regulations for the carriage of certain
bulk solid materials by adding materials carried under Coast Guard Special Permits, and other materials contained
in the International Maritime Organization Code of Safe Practice for Solid Bulk Cargoes, including coal, to the list
of materials permitted under the regulations (59 FR 17418). The original deadline for submission of comments was
July 11, 1994. The Coast Guard received a number of requests that additional time be provided for comment. The Coast
Guard is very interested in receiving information and opinions from persons who have an interest in the safe handling
of bulk solid materials and may not have had an opportunity to submit comments. Therefore, in order to encourage meaningful
participation by interested parties, the Coast Guard is reopening the comment period for an additional 30 days.
