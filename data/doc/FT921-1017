FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Ford optimistic on 1992 results
FORD MOTOR, the US vehicle manufacturer, said yesterday it expected a
substantial improvement in 1992 operating results if the US economy
recovers.
The company's statement, made in its annual report, follows a growing belief
among Wall Street analysts that the company might return to profit as early
as the first quarter of 1992.
Ford suffered a record Dollars 2.3bn loss last year, which it blamed on weak
sales and intense competition from both Japanese and rival US car-makers.
However, the company said that its 'cost-reduction programme, coupled with
an assumed gradual economic recovery, gives Ford reason to believe that 1992
operating results will show substantial improvement'.
In December, Mr Philip Benton, president, said: 'We will surprise you, when
the market comes back, how quickly we will make a profit.'
Ford, which rationalised its plants heavily during the 1980s, has long been
regarded as having the factories with the highest productivity in North
America among the big three US manufacturers.
US car sales figures for mid-March, released on Tuesday, showed a 6.9 per
cent drop compared with the same period of 1991, underlining that the
improving trend in vehicle sales seen in recent months is likely to prove
slow and spotty.
However, manufacturers seem to have been able to reduce the huge rebates
offered last year to lure customers into buying cars. Ford has also been
helped by keeping inventories lean last year and by a gain in market share
through the revamping of its model range last autumn.
The company noted that higher marketing and new product development costs
had been offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies and other
cost-cutting programmes.
Its cash and marketable securities at the end of 1991 rose to Dollars 9.8bn
from Dollars 6.1bn at the end of 1990 as a result of Dollars 1.7bn in
additional automotive debt and Dollars 2.3bn from a preferred stock
offering.
