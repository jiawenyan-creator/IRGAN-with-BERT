FT  28 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television
Having originally concent-rated almost entirely on the musical abilities of
its contestants, BBC2's Young Musician Of The Year competition was then
turned into a second rate chat show. The presenter would take the musicians
out on pretty locations and inquire earnestly about their hobbies. Naturally
enough music lovers switched off in their droves, but mindless gossip freaks
switched on. Which way will it go this year, with the competition held for
the first time in Birmingham? We shall see today when the first semi-final
(pianists) is televised (6.50).
It is fashionable to criticise Jeremy Brett for having turned England's most
famous detective into an over-emotional poseur, but to me The Memoirs Of
Sherlock Holmes still seems the best screen interpretation ever made.
Today's case: 'The Red Circle' (9.00 ITV).
Given the high quality of Malcolm Brinkworth's documentaries about British
ex-pats living in Spain, his new pair of programmes about the British in the
Dordogne, A French Affair, ought to be worth watching (9.00 C4).
