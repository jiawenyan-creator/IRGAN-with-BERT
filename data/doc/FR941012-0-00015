 

II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment


By letter dated February 23, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH1990), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 65 (PA 65). In that submission, Ohio
proposed to revise two rules in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) to correct outdated rule references and to adopt
language similar to corresponding Federal regulations concerning the availability of documents for public view.
As part of PA 65, Ohio provided a draft example of the public notice on availability of documents which Ohio would post
at one of the two locations specified by OAC section 1501:13110(B).
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the March 10, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 11227), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public
hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on April 11, 1994.
By letter dated June 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH2029), OSM provided its comments to Ohio on the February
23, 1994, submission of PA 65. By letter dated July 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH2033), Ohio resubmitted
Program Amendment Number 65 Revised (PA 65R) which is intended to resolve the requirements in OSM's June 17, 1994,
letter. Ohio proposed new revisions to one rule and modified the draft example of the notice on the availability of
documents.
OSM reopened the public comment period in the August 5, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 39994). The public comment period closed on August 22, 1994.
In response to a comment made by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), United States Department of Agriculture (Ohio
Administrative Record No. OH2056), OSM requested that Ohio provide a written statement for the Administrative
Record clarifying the points of agreement between the Division and the SCS. By letter dated September 23, 1994 (Ohio
Administrative Record No. OH2058), Ohio provided OSM with its intentions regarding the filing of coal mining
related documents at SCS field offices.
