THE WORLD 
Canada held its first meeting with a PLO representative but said it is stopping 
short of recognizing the new state of Palestine declared in Algiers last 
November. Yves Portier, the Canadian delegate to the United Nations, met Nasser 
Kidwa, the alternate representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
observer group to the world body, at Canada's U.N. Mission in New York. 
Previous meetings were confined to officials below the rank of ambassador. 
External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said Canada is removing restrictions on 
contracts with the PLO because of its new "moderate" course.
