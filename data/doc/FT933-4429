FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: China faces steep EC duties on bikes
THE European Community is poised to impose heavy duties on imports of
bicycles from China, in spite of claims that retail prices will rise as a
result.
One Chinese diplomat in Brussels yesterday described the duties as unfair,
and a leading exporter of Chinese bicycles warned that EC producers might
try to increase prices of popular models as supplies were squeezed.
But the European Commission said the duties would protect the long-term
health of the EC industry by stopping the Chinese from 'dumping' bicycles on
the market.
The Commission, which examines dumping complaints, has calculated that EC
producers' share of the market fell from 37.8 per cent in 1989 to 30.2 per
cent in 1991, while Chinese market share rose from 4.6 per cent to 10.5 per
cent, or 2.1m bikes.
About 20m bicycles are sold on the EC market annually, but the Commission
says sales have stagnated since 1991.
Chinese officials will pay a final visit to the Commission today in an
attempt to defer the action, which is the latest in a series of dumping
inquiries to have gone against Beijing. Definitive duties, which will
increase the price of incoming Chinese bicycles by 30.6 per cent, should be
imposed today or tomorrow, following approval by member states. A
provisional duty of 34.4 per cent was imposed in March.
Chinese bicycles are not necessarily a cheap alternative to the popular
mountain and city bikes which have dominated the EC market over the last few
years. Many Chinese-made bicycles are imported into the EC and resold under
well-known brand names. Such models can cost between Pounds 200 and more
than Pounds 1,000 in department stores.
Mr Stephen Codron, a director of China Bicycles Company, believes importers
will switch to other Asian suppliers - leaving the EC industry in the same
predicament - while EC producers will take the opportunity to increase
prices.
