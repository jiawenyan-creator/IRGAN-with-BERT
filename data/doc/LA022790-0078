BRIEFLY 
T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell in 
Monday's auction to their lowest level in two weeks. 
The Treasury sold $8 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount 
rate of 7.72%, down from 7.80% last week. Another $8 billion of new six-month 
bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.70%, down from 7.77% last week. 
The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.98% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,804.90, and 8.12% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,610.70. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.
