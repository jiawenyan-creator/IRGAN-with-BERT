FT  19 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee and copper get
over the jitters
London coffee and copper prices, leaders of the recent commodities boom, got
over bad cases of the jitters yesterday to end with their bull runs
basically intact.
As coffee futures plunged Dollars 113 a tonne in early trading at the London
Commodity Exchange and the London Metal Exchange copper price lost Dollars
50 it looked like the long-awaited technical 'corrections' had finally
arrived.
But the opening strength of the New York market rescued coffee prices, with
the July position finishing at Dollars 2,119 a tonne, down Dollars 24 from
Tuesday but Dollars 89 off the day's low. And copper prices actually rallied
to fresh 15-month peaks.
'The market went in search of the buying and found it,' one coffee trader
told the Reuter news agency. 'It looks very constructive but I don't know
how far we can go on the upside.'
'In a rally like this we will see bouts of profit-taking which will knock
the market around, especially in New York, but it's still the same story -
buy on the dips,' said another.
The emergence of fresh investment fund buying in New York, after an early
sell-off, was also instrumental in reviving flagging spirits among LME
copper traders. At the LME close the three months position was still more
than Dollars 20 down at Dollars 2,201.50 a tonne, but after hours it climbed
as high as Dollars 2,255, beating Tuesday's peak by Dollars 25.
