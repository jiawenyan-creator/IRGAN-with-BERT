FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Exchanges study services merger
THE AMSTERDAM Stock Exchange and the European Options Exchange (EOE) in
Amsterdam plan to ask a consultancy firm to investigate a merger of their
off-floor support services.
Coopers and Lybrand Management Consultants will report on the findings in
the autumn. The support services to be investigated will include legal
advice, financial administration and accounting.
The exchanges, which are eager to cut costs to remain competitive within
Europe, established a joint executive committee in 1991 to look into closer
links. Reports appeared in the Dutch press recently saying that the bourse
and the options exchange might be planning a full merger. Spokesmen for both
sides, however, have played downed the suggestion, saying it was premature.
Both exchanges are preparing for changes prompted by the dual necessity of
reducing costs and bolstering competitiveness with rival exchanges in
Europe.
The EOE plans to alter its trading system to combine traditional open-outcry
floor trading with a new computer screen option. The stock exchange plans to
split the wholesale and retail segments of the market.
The stock exchange in particular is concerned about the loss of business to
London.
