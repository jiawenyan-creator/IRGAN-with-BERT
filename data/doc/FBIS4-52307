  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Top government and ruling 
coalition party officials will endorse a 40-day supplement to a 
stopgap budget for fiscal 1994 Tuesday afternoon, government 
officials said. The supplementary program will cover government 
finances over a 40-day period through June 29 when the current 
regular Diet session closes, the officials said. 
  The government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
had 
been forced to draft a 50-day provisional budget for fiscal 
1994, which began April 1, because political turmoil delayed 
Diet approval of the main budget program. It has become very 
unlikely that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who took over from 
Hosokawa last month, will be able to clear the main budget 
through the Diet by May 20. 
  It will be the first time since fiscal 1990 that the 
government has had to adopt a supplement to a provisional budget.
