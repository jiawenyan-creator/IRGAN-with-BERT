A HORSYMORON 
About the picture of the Pony Express stamp (see photo) in the Book Review of 
Oct. 21: 
As a ranch-born horseman, I am dismayed that our government would commission an 
artist with so little knowledge of the modus operandi of a running horse to 
design this stamp. 
The horse portrayed on the stamp is running rapidly with its hind legs (note 
position of the tail), while trotting sedately with the forelegs! I have 
concluded that the picture constitutes a photographic oxymoron.
