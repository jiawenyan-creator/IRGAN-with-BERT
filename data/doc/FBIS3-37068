  [Text] Sevastopol, 12 Feb -- Ukraine's Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy arrived in the city on the occasion of the 
flag-hoisting on board the new anti-submarine ship "Lutsk". 
This is already the second visit by the minister to Sevastopol, 
however, this time his meeting with the Black Sea Fleet 
Commander Eduard Baltin again failed to take place. 
  Replying to a question from the journalists on whether the 
statement by President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov, on the beginning 
of the peninsula's demilitarization at the expense of reducing 
Ukraine's Armed Forces in the Crimea would cause aggravation of 
Ukrainian-Russian relations, Vitaliy Radetskyy stated that such 
decisions are outside Yuriy Meshkov's competence. Only the 
president and the Supreme Council of Ukraine can take such 
decisions. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy told the journalists about the development 
of the naval forces. The headquarters and the main naval base 
will be in Sevastopol. The defense minister positively assessed 
Ukraine's accession to the "Partnership for Peace." He pointed 
to the erroneous nature of the idea that the Black Sea Fleet was 
almost the only guarantor of Ukraine's security. "The guarantor 
of Ukraine's security is its people," pointed out the defense 
minister. 
  Replying to the journalists' questions, Vitaliy Radetskyy, 
in 
particular, stated that in solving the fate of the fleet one 
should, first and foremost, draw up an inventory of the fleet 
and carry out its reduction.
