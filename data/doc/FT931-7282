FT  25 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television
This year Channel 4 has been taking an increased audience share: as much as
12 per cent, more than twice that claimed by all the satellite channels put
together. In peak hours C4 has always largely ignored its flaunted 'remit'
to offer something different and serve minorities, so that its share has
grown steadily, and when you consider peak time schedules like tonight's its
ratings success is scarcely suprising. Tim Hunkin's Secret Life Of ..
reveals why a lift doesn't fall even when the cables supporting it are cut
(8.30). Turning The Screws which follows (9.00) is Roger Graef's verite
documentary series ostensibly about Wandsworth Prison but really about
Graef's old passion: human communication. Those are followed by two of the
best comedies now on British television: Drop The Dead Donkey (10.00) set in
a television newsroom; and Whose Line Is It Anyway? (10.30) in which people
parade their powers of improvisation. Top those off with a repeat of the
original sixties' series of The Avengers (11.05) with Honor Blackman playing
Gale to Patrick Macnee's Steed, and you have a very competitive line-up
indeed.
