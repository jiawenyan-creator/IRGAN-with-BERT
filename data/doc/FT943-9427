FT  11 AUG 94 / Observer: What a carillon
Is Sir Michael Edwardes beginning to make a habit of this sort of thing? If
Charter, the industrial group of which he is chairman, has to walk away from
its Pounds 260m bid for Esab of Sweden, despite having 53 per cent of the
target already in the bag, Edwardes will have been there before.
Five years ago Sir Michael, as deputy chairman, was leading Minorco's Pounds
3.5bn bid for Consolidated Gold Fields. Minorco had bought shares and won
acceptances that added up to more than 50 per cent of Gold Fields. But it
had to admit defeat because the whole business became mired in US litigation
and could not meet deadlines imposed by the UK Takeover Code.
On that occasion a New York judge proved to be the insuperable barrier. This
time it is a few big institutional shareholders in Esab who are causing all
the trouble.
But the common thread, some would suggest, is that, had Edwardes offered a
little more, he would have sailed through without opposition.
