FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BM poised for losses after heavy
write-downs
BM Group, the construction equipment and engineering concern, is likely to
fall into the red this year after substantial losses on business disposals
and other write-downs.
The group announced yesterday that it would take an exceptional loss of
about Pounds 13m on the recent sale of Blackwood Hodge UK and Spain to
International Machinery Company.
The share price, which collapsed last summer after the departure of the
chairman Mr Roger Shute, fell 6p to 54p yesterday.
A root-and-branch review has been carried out under the new chairman Mr
Moger Woolley, with the help of a new merchant bank - Robert Fleming has
replaced Hambros - and new auditors - Price Waterhouse for Kingston Smith.
Analysts estimate that exceptional losses could run to Pounds 20m-Pounds
30m. This would push the group into the red even before interest costs on
trading profits thought to be running at Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m for the year
to June 30. Last June net debt stood at Pounds 61.1m.
The interim results have been delayed until April.
