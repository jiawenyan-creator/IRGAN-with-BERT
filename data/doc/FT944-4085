FT  09 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong at 14-month
low on fears of US rate rise
On a day of little real movement the Nikkei 225 average finished slightly
higher but first section stocks as a whole eased a shade, most investors
staying on the sidelines in the absence of market-moving news, writes Robert
Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 5.81 firmer at 19,180.04 after a day of quiet trading.
There was little activity other than arbitrage buying, but some brokers
pointed to the recovery of the US dollar above Y100 as an encouraging sign.
Throughout the day the index traded in a narrow range from a high of
19,288.36 to a low of 19,135.33.
Volume dipped to an estimated 210m shares from Wednesday's 222.17m. The
Topix index of all first-section stocks ended 4.29 off at 1,521.06, while
declining issues outscored advances by 586 to 358, with 227 stocks
unchanged. The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 slipped 0.95 to 280.50. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 4.52 at 1,263.59.
Steel shares lost ground on news that three Japanese carmakers will shift
some steel purchasing from Japan to South Korea, where prices are about 20
per cent lower.
Nippon Steel, which has agreed to reduce prices to carmakers by next spring,
fell Y6 to Y368 in the day's highest volume of 5.2m shares. NKK was off Y9
at Y269 and Kobe Steel shed Y5 to Y311, both in active trading. Sumitomo
Metal Industries slipped Y3 to Y320, but Kawasaki Steel ticked up Y1 to
Y410.
Most privatised issues lost ground. Japan Tobacco fell Y6,000 to Y950,000, a
new low following its October 27 listing. East Japan Railway receded Y4,000
to Y469,000, but NTT recovered Y5,000 to finish at Y469,000.
High-technology groups and integrated electricals declined across the board.
Toshiba lost Y13 at Y713, Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 at Y1,580, Sony
Y50 at Y5280, NEC Y10 at Y1,140 and Sharp Y10 at Y1,710.
Game makers advanced. Sega Enterprises moved up for the ninth consecutive
day, climbing Y160 to Y5,710. Nintendo added Y100 at Y5,900.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 31.40 to 21,182.10 in volume of 58.3m
shares.
Roundup
US interest rate fears again cast a shadow over the region yesterday, with a
number of markets showing sharp downward swings.
The Pacific Basin region, excluding Japan, has delivered a disappointing
performance this year, and after staging a modest bounce between August and
October, has returned to levels seen at the start of July.
HONG KONG closed at a 14-month low as the spectre of rising US interest
rates continued to undermine sentiment. The Hang Seng index ended 200.19 or
2.4 per cent down at 8,068.31, taking its decline from January's peak to 36
per cent.
The December index futures contract heralded further market falls, dropping
to a discount to the physical market at 7,980, down 285 in heavy volume. In
subsequent London trading, prices steadied and the indicative index eased
another 27 to 8,042.
Brokers expressed concern that local stocks would fall further if Wall
Street continued to slide on fears of rising rates, and if funds migrated to
US bond markets from Asian equities. Reports this week of sinking demand for
residential properties also weighed on the market.
The property sub-index fell 467.76 or 3.3 per cent to 13,653.80. Cheung Kong
dipped 80 cents to HKDollars 30.80 and Sung Hung Kai Properties retreated
HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 47.90.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further heavy falls in Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga Nasional
which dragged the composite index down 26.34 or 2.8 per cent to 925.34, its
lowest close of the year.
The declines in Telekom and Tenaga were attributed to redemption of funds
and hedge-selling by foreign institutions, particularly in the US.
Tenaga Nasional finished 30 cents down at MDollars 9.80, falling below the
MDollars 10 level for the first time since mid-1993. Telekom relinquished 70
cents at MDollars 16.40.
SINGAPORE declined 1.9 per cent on continued selling by foreign investors in
anticipation of redemption of funds and on the withdrawal of retail
investors.
Brokers said overall sentiment was weak, hit by the Dow's overnight fall,
inflation warnings from the US Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan
and redemption-led selling in Malaysia.
The Straits Times Industrial index fell 40.70 to 2,139.68, while the UOB OTC
index, tracking Malaysian stocks, shed 17.67 to 1,066.11.
SEOUL encountered further institutional selling of blue chips, amid worries
about the market's direction, but demand remained strong for shares with
good earnings prospects. The composite index lost 15.23 or 1.4 per cent at
1,053.70.
Institutional investors were also worried that the central bank would
tighten its money supply policies after the bank penalised a commercial bank
with a large amount of one-day penalty funds for failing to meet its Won
reserve oblig-ations.
Most blue chips fell by their daily limits, Samsung Electronics and Posco
dipping Won3,000 and Won2,000 to Won112,500 and Won66,100 respectively.
BOMBAY extended its slide in sluggish trade on the last day of the current
account period, the BSE 30-share index weakening 52.66 or 1.3 per cent to
3,925.73, off 158.50 since Tuesday and 15.2 per cent down from its all-time
peak of 4,628.75 set on September 12.
SYDNEY was led higher by gains among non-resource issues, with light bargain
hunting following recent declines. The All Ordinaries index improved 5.8 to
1,875.0. Turnover was estimated at ADollars 361m.
An increase in November unemployment to 9.3 per cent, from 9.1 per cent a
month before, was said to have had little effect on sentiment, even though
it was at the top end of expectations.
Among the main movers, BHP rose 16 cents to ADollars 19.02, News Corp 14
cents to ADollars 5.06, and Fairfax a cent to ADollars 2.64.
In the banking sector, NAB firmed 6 cents to ADollars 10.70 and ANZ put on 3
cents at ADollars 3.98.
TAIPEI did not build on Wednesday's gains as some investors decided to take
profits. The weighted index eased 2.3 to 6,775.38 in turnover of TDollars
82.06bn.
Textile shares, which had been benefiting recently from price rises in the
sector, reversed early gains on profit-taking. Shinkong Synthetic Fibres
lost 20 cents at TDollars 35.40.
Cements outperformed the weak industrial sector, with Taiwan Cement adding
TDollars 1.20 or 2.4 per cent at TDollars 50.50.
MANILA also succumbed to profit-taking, following gains over the last three
sessions. The composite index surrendered 6.81 at 2,656.36.
Among sector indices, the commercial and industrial index retreated 8.24 to
3,922.14, while mines rose 16.50 to 4,543.68. Turnover was thin at just
968.7m pesos, against Wednesday's 1.42bn pesos.
