DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDING MORATORIUM URGED AT HANSEN DAM RECREATION 
AREA 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi on Wednesday called for a 90-day moratorium on 
construction and demolition in the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, which he hopes 
will prevent owners of property near the park's entrance from building an 
auto-repair shop. 
The city of Los Angeles wants to acquire the 0.85 of an acre in Lake View 
Terrace for use as a park gateway. A used-car lot and a fast-food restaurant 
now occupy the parcel. 
"I can't think of anything that would be more undesirable than to have that 
kind of auto activity at what should be the key entrance to this recreational 
area," Bernardi said. 
A deal to buy the land for $525,000, which was to have come before the City 
Council on Wednesday, fell through unexpectedly when the city discovered that 
the former owner had sold the property in April. The new owner, Hayden 
Hamilton, filed papers with the city zoning administrator's office to begin the 
hearing process Oct. 2 for an 18,000-square-foot auto-repair shop. 
Hamilton paid more for the land than the city's estimated value -- about 
$675,000, according to Bernardi -- and the City Council voted Wednesday to try 
to renegotiate a sale with him. Bernardi said the city will turn to seizing the 
land through eminent domain if necessary. 
Hamilton could not be reached for comment. 
Bernardi said he thought that Hamilton's land was the only parcel that would be 
affected by the moratorium, which is scheduled to be considered Tuesday by the 
council.
