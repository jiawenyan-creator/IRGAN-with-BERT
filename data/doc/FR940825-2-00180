SUMMARY: 

The Russia/Eurasia Division of the Office of Citizen Exchanges of the United States Information Agency's Bureau
of Education and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance award program. Public or private
non-profit organizations meeting the provisions described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply to conduct at least
three five-week, U.S.-based internship programs for Russian business people and local government officials. A
minimum of ten Russian participants must be included in each internship cycle. Programs may not begin any earlier
than March 1995. Pending the availability of funds, the program may be extended through December 1997.


This program is a continuation of a pilot project conducted in 1994 and seeks to provide Russian business people with
knowledge of a market economy and promote a supportive business environment for the participants upon their return
to Russia. The participants will be recruited, through an open and competitive process, from selected regions of
Russia and will begin arriving in the United States in March 1995.
Overall grant making authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act
of 1961, as amended, Public Law 87256, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act. The purpose of the Act is ``to enable
the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the
people of other countries ***; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating
the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other
nations *** and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful relations
between the United States and the other countries of the world.''
Programs and projects must conform with Agency requirements and guidelines outlined in the Application Package.
USIA projects and programs are subject to the availability of funds.
