 

Previous Draft and Comment 



The availability of the first draft report for public comment was announced on October 7, 1991 (56 FR 50598). The comment
period, which was extended on November 25, 1991 (56 FR 59303), expired on January 31, 1992. 

The issues raised by public comments were discussed at a meeting on May 7, 1992, and consensus was reached for a number
of the issues. The NRC staff's summary of the May 7, 1992, meeting is provided in a memorandum for T. Novak from P. Baranowsky,
dated June 3, 1992, Subject: Summary of Meeting with NUMARC, BWROG LER/JCO Committee, and Others on Comments on Draft
NUREG1022, Revision 1. 

On April 8, 1993, the NRC staff issued an agenda for a second meeting (58 FR 18167) which provided proposed resolutions
for remaining issues. These matters were then discussed at the second meeting on May 6, 1993, where consensus was reached
for a number of additional issues. The NRC staff's summary of the May 6, 1993 meeting, which includes a verbatim transcript,
is provided in a memorandum for G. Holahan from P. Baranowsky, dated May 20, 1993, subject: Summary of Public Meeting
on the Issues Raised by Public Comment on Draft NUREG1022, Revision 1. 



Noteworthy Issues 



Reviewers should note that, in the second draft, shaded text indicates reporting guidance that is considered to be
new or different, in a meaningful way, from previously published generic reporting guidance. It does not indicate
changes made relative to the first draft. 

Reviewers may wish to take note of the following principal differences from the positions proposed in the previous


Federal Register

 notice of April 8, 1993 (58 FR 18167): 

(1) Actual threats. Following discussions at the meeting of May 6, 1993, the text has been revised so that minor events
are not portrayed as constituting actual threats to plant safety. (Section 3.2.5 beginning on page 40 and Section
3.2.8 beginning on page 50.) 

(2) Timeliness. As discussed at the meeting of May 6, 1993, text has been revised to specifically state that the timeliness
guidance in Generic Letter 9118, which applies primarily to operability determinations, is also appropriate
for reportability determinations. (Section 2.11 on page 17) 

(3) Outside design basis. As discussed at the meeting of May 6, 1993, the text has been revised to make it clear that the
staff's position regarding long-term incapability of a single train does not include cases of technical inoperability
or minor time infractions. In addition, as a partial response to industry comments, the wording of this position has
been revised to eliminate statements about ``assuming an additional single failure'' within the system. Instead,
the wording now indicates that the plant is outside of its design basis because the system does not have the ``suitable
redundancy'' required by the General Design Criteria as a minimum design criterion for the system. However, the position
has not been retracted. (Section 3.2.4 on page 37.) 

Reviewers may also wish to note the following points: 

(1) Section 2.1. Engineering judgment should be supported by a logical thought process. (page 11) 

(2) Section 2.7. Discussion has been included to address multiple relief valve failures. (pages 13 and 14) 

(3) Section 3.2.7. Eight hours is considered a ``short time'' with regard to loss of assessment equipment which is
rarely used. In addition, individual licensee procedures are, in essence, cited as the authority with regard to loss
of response equipment such as sirens. (page 47) 

(4) Section 3.2.8. Significant hampering includes hypothetical demands, i.e., site personnel were or ``would be''
significantly hampered. In addition, precautionary evacuations are not reportable unless there is significant
hampering. (page 51) 

(5) Section 3.3.2. The logic indicates that automatic or inadvertent actuations of single ESF components are generally
not reportable because single components of complex systems usually do not mitigate the consequences of an event.
However, deliberate operator actuations of one or more components of an ESF in response to plant conditions in order
to mitigate the consequences of an event, such as starting an ECCS pump in response to rapidly dropping pressurizer
level, are reportable. (page 57) Also, the text requests that licensees report, on a voluntary basis if need be, actuations
of specific listed systems. This is the same position as proposed previously by the staff. (page 59) In this regard,
the staff also intends to communicate clearly that guidance regarding voluntary reporting is not enforceable. 

(6) Section 3.3.3. The text now provides considerable discussion and a number of examples taken directly from previous
guidance. (Section 3.3.3 begins on page 65) 

(7) Section 4. The text reflects recent changes in the telephone systems used for emergency telecommunications.




Organization of Comments 



Commenters are encouraged to be specific. Comments may be submitted as proposed modified text for the NUREG that encompasses
their comments, or as discussions of example conditions or events that illustrate a particular point regarding reportability.
To assist in producing efficient and complete comment resolution, commenters are requested to reference the numbered
section(s) in the draft NUREG (for example, Section 3.3.4) and page number(s) related to their comments, where possible.




Submittal of Comments in an Electronic Format 



Commenters are encouraged to submit, in addition to the original paper copy, a copy of their comments in an electronic
format on IBM compatible, DOS formatted 3.5 or 5.25 inch diskettes. The text format and software version should be
identified on the label of the diskette.
