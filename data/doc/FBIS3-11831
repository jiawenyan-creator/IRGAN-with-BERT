  [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] sources have 
revealed with the assistance of the National Civilian Police 
[PNC], the Usulutan Departmental Electoral Board was able to 
recover the Jucuapa ballot boxes which party poll 
representatives were retaining. 
  Riot agents entered the "Saul Flores" Coed Urban School 
where 
members of the municipal electoral board were holding the boxes. 
  Reports have indicated militants of the Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front, Unity Movement, and Democratic 
Convergence have tried to keep the boxes from the PNC members, 
who succeeded in their objective without any major incidents. 
  Representatives of the above parties did not allow TSE 
delegates to remove the ballot boxes on 20 March, claiming 
"fraud" was committed in the elections and that they should have 
been held in Jucuapa. 
  The disgruntled party representatives warned if the TSE does 
not cancel the Jucuapa elections, the political parties that 
participated in the elections in that region "will adopt a 
municipal government elected by consensus." 
  TSE Magistrate Dr. Jaime Romero Ventura has told EL DIARIO 
DE 
HOY "today (yesterday) at 0800 in the morning, all the voting 
material from Jucuapa reached the TSE." 
  Romero added "because the vote counting could not take place 
in Jucuapa, they are doing it here in the hotel (Presidente)... 
but all (the information from) from Usulutan Department is 
indeed at TSE installations."
