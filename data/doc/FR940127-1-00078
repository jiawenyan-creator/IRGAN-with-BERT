20.63 

Personnel, medical, and similar files, disclosure of which constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy. 



* * * * * 



(f) The names and any information that would identify the voluntary reporter or any other person named in any adverse
event report associated with a human drug, biologic, or medical device product shall not be disclosed by the Food and
Drug Administration or by a manufacturer in possession of such reports in response to a request. Information that
would identify the voluntary reporter or persons identified in the report includes, but is not limited to, the name,
address, institution, or any other information that would lead to the identities of the reporter or person identified
in a report. This provision does not affect disclosure of the identities of reporters required by statute or regulation
to make adverse event reports. Disclosure of the identities of such reporters is governed by the applicable statutes
and regulations. 

(1) 

Exceptions.

 (i) Identities may be disclosed if both the voluntary reporter and the person identified in an adverse event report
or that person's legal representative consent in writing to disclosure; or 

(ii) Identities may be disclosed pursuant to a court order in the course of medical malpractice litigation involving
both the person who experienced the reported adverse event and the voluntary reporter; or 

(iii) The report shall be disclosed to the individual who is the subject of the report upon request. 

(2) 

Preemption.

 No State or local governing entity shall establish or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation or other requirement
that permits or requires disclosure of the identities of the voluntary reporter or other person identified in an adverse
event report except as provided in this section.
