The United States Air Force (AF) will conduct a public scoping meeting to provide a forum for public officials and the
community to provide information and comments concerning the disposal and reuse of portions of Newark AFB, OH. The
meeting will be held May 10, 1994 beginning at 7 p.m. at the Heath City Hall, 1287 Hebron Road, Heath, Ohio. 

The purpose of this meeting is to: (1) Identify the environmental issues and concerns that should be analyzed to support
base disposal and reuse; (2) solicit comments on the proposed action; and (3) solicit potential disposal and reuse
alternatives for consideration in developing the EIS. In soliciting disposal and reuse alternatives, the AF will
consider all reasonable alternatives offered by any federal, state or local government agency, and any federally-sponsored
or private entity or individual. The resulting EIS will be considered in making disposal decisions that will be documented
in the Air Force's Final Disposal Plan and Record of Decision for Newark AFB. 

To ensure sufficient time to adequately consider public comments concerning environmental issues and disposal
alternatives to be included in the EIS, the AF recommends that comments and reuse proposals be presented at the upcoming
meeting or forwarded to the address below by August 1, 1994. The AF will, however, accept additional comments at any
time during the environmental impact analysis process. 

Please direct written comments or requests for further information concerning the base disposal and reuse EIS to:
Lt Col Gary P. Baumgartel, HQ AFCEE/EC, 8106 Chennault Road, Brooks AFB TX 782355318, (210) 5363869.
