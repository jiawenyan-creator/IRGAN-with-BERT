ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 
BODY DISCOVERED IN CHURCH PARKING LOT 
Authorities on Sunday were investigating the death of a Buena Park woman whose 
body was found in the parking lot of the Melodyland Christian Center. 
Jeanne Annette Hays, 40, had suffered a "blunt force trauma" to the head and 
was found about 9:36 p.m. Saturday lying fully clothed in the southeast part of 
the Melodyland parking lot on 400 W. Freedman Way, said Police Lt. John Cross. 
Police were called to the scene by a passer-by who reported seeing the woman's 
body, police officials said. Police found the woman lying dead with a deep 
wound to her head. Cross said an autopsy is being conducted to ascertain exact 
cause of death. He said that no suspects are in custody and that a motive for 
the apparent killing has not been established. 
The body was found while the Melodyland church was closed for the night. Church 
officials said they were not made aware of the death until early Sunday and 
added that they believed that it had no relation to the church. One church 
official who asked not to be named said that the parking lot adjoins a vacant 
lot and that it is possible the body was dumped. 
Pastor Ralph Wilkerson announced news of the death to 2,000 congregation 
members attending 10:30 a.m. Easter services. 
"There were a lot of gasps and people looking at each other," said Melodyland 
usher Christopher Werrett. JIM CARLTON
