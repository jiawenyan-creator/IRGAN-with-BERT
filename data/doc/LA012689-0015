LEGISLATION GAP 
Amazing! Baker, a professor of political science from Rutgers University, can 
devote most of two columns to the puzzling contrast between President Reagan's 
great popularity and his meager program accomplishments without once mentioning 
the bias of that prism that largely defines the American people's perception of 
political reality, i.e., our corporate warfare state's own corporate mass media 
of communications.
