FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Asprey Pounds 1m
Asprey, the up-market jewellery retailer which also owns Garrard and Mappin
&amp; Webb, increased pre-tax profits by Pounds 1m to Pounds 12.2m in the half
year to September 30.
The rise was achieved, the company said, in spite of persistent difficult
trading conditions.
In July, Sears, the retail group, sold its 25 per cent stake in the company,
and Asprey shares moved from the USM to the Official List. Yesterday the
shares rose by 2p to 315p.
Sales rose 45 per cent to Pounds 87.4m (Pounds 60.2m) but margins were under
pressure. Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, said that now 'the richer the
person is the more he wants value for money.' Valued, high-spending
customers were asking for and getting discounts.
Sales at Asprey rose by more than 30 per cent, at Garrard by 18 per cent and
Mappin &amp; Webb by 24 per cent.
The group benefited from a full six months' contribution from Watches of
Switzerland, acquired in June 1992, and three months from Les Ambassadeurs,
the Swiss chain, bought on July 1. Mr Attallah said losses at Asprey's New
York shop were lower.
Since July, Asprey had acquired Ronald A Lee (Fine Arts), a specialist
antique clock dealer, for Pounds 300,000 and Tomasz Starweski, a dress
designer, for Pounds 120,000.
Following the Les Ambassadeurs deal, net interest receivable fell from about
Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 300,000.
Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 8.04p (6.97p), and the interim
dividend is lifted by 14 per cent from 1.1p to 1.25p.
