ENLARGING THE COUNTY BOARD 
Shout loud enough and long enough, the old axiom goes, and you can sell the 
people anything. That appears to be exactly what your editorial attempts. 
The gist of your message is that the five-member Board of Supervisors must be 
expanded to at least seven members, perhaps even nine. There was even a mention 
of the need for an elected executive. Your reasoning is that it would provide 
better representation. 
May I suggest a lesson in history and another in civics? First, the history. 
Four times schemes to expand the Board of Supervisors and/or to establish an 
elected executive have been put before the voters. The measures were defeated 
by the voters each time. 
As a footnote to the history lesson: It just might be that the voters do not 
view making government bigger as a panacea. 
And now for the civics lesson. 
If county government was the only local representation for 8-million-plus 
people, then your call for more supervisors might have merit. But there are 86 
elected city councils serving the vast majority of Los Angeles County 
residents. It is these bodies who determine local zoning laws, levels of police 
and fire protection, the amount of development, and many other vital issues 
within their boundaries -- not the Board of Supervisors. 
County government is an umbrella organization responsible for such countywide 
areas as public health, mental health and welfare. There are added 
responsibilities in law enforcement, prosecution and the judiciary.
