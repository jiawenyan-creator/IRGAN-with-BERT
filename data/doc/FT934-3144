FT  10 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Canadian fears of impact on Quebec
Canada is scrambling to blunt the political impact of the Uruguay Round on
the separatist debate in Quebec.
Officials confirmed yesterday that Ottawa was pressing its trading partners
for a clause in the proposed multilateral trade agreement which would allow
Canadian provinces to continue providing regional development subsidies.
In addition, prime minister Mr Jean Chretien sent his foreign minister and
chief Quebec lieutenant, Mr Andre Ouellet, to Quebec yesterday to placate
the province's dairy farmers, who have strenuously objected to the proposed
replacement of import quotas by tariffs on dairy on other farm products.
The separatist Bloc Quebecois, which won 54 seats in the House of Commons in
last October's election, has seized on the development grants and dairy
quota issues as evidence that Quebecois have more to lose than gain by
remaining part of Canada.
Under the Uruguay Round proposals, the Quebec government would be able to
provide subsidies if it was an independent state, but cannot do so as a
province of Canada. The Canadians now acknowledge they have little hope in
the Uruguay Round of retaining the import quotas which protect dairy,
poultry and egg farmers.
The government is now assuring farmers that it will maintain the
'supply-management' system by other means, such as the variable levies used
by the European Union. An official said yesterday the transition might also
be smoothed by changes to existing adjustment programmes.
Farm groups fear that tariffs will decline over time, and that production
quotas will be worthless. The official noted however, that the price of
dairy quotas has shot up by about 30 per cent in a year.
