FT  21 SEP 93 / Support for China Olympics bid
BUSINESSMEN in Taiwan and Hong Kong believe Beijing should be awarded the
Olympics so as further to entrench China's move away from communism.
Businessmen claim the west has an interest in supporting China's current
leadership which has committed itself to economic reform and the award of
the Olympics would secure the leaders' position.
China's failure to win the 2000 Olympics would also create widespread
resentment among Chinese communities outside the mainland.
Many people in Taiwan and Hong Kong see the Olympics as a recognition of
Chinese culture and civilisation, not the government in Beijing.
In Taiwan especially, pride in being part of China's civilisation transcends
anti-communism and dislike of the current regime. A rebuff by the
International Olympic Committee, which votes on Thursday, would be seen as
just another rejection of China by the west. Disappointment would be further
reinforced as Beijing has promised to stage some events in Taiwan and Hong
Kong.
It is claimed that Beijing will be more careful in its treatment of Hong
Kong and in the wooing of Taiwan with the games than without them.
China has bowed to world pressure by agreeing to a human rights probe just
days before the Olympics decision, the International Federation of Human
Rights (FIDH) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Daniel Jacoby, FIDH president, told a news conference his group had
received an invitation to investigate claims of human rights abuse from Chen
Xitong, president of the Beijing Olympic Bid Committee, during weekend talks
in Monte Carlo.
