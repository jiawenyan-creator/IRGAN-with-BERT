FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Trade committee to speed responses
AN INFLUENTIAL committee of MPs is to start holding snap one-day inquiries
in a move to step up its speed of response to emerging issues, David Owen
writes.
The Commons trade and industry committee will earmark one additional session
a month for the inquiries after MPs return from the summer recess in
November.
As well as examining issues that emerge at short notice, the sessions are
expected to be used to scrutinise how money is spent by the collection of
agencies and quangos monitored by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The intention is to gather written evidence before witnesses appear.
The committee effectively held one such inquiry earlier this year when it
used an unexpected gap in its schedule to interview senior Post Office
executives about the organisation's possible privatisation.
