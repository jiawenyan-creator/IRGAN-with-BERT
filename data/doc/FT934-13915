FT  19 OCT 93 / LA beating trial goes back to jury room
THE JURY in the trial of two black men accused in the beating of a white
truck driver unexpectedly said yesterday it had resumed deliberations,
agencies report from Los Angeles.
The jury said at the weekend it had reached verdicts on some charges
stemming from the attack on trucker Reginald Denny during last year's Los
Angeles riots but was deadlocked on others and further deliberations would
be pointless.
Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk had said he would take partial verdicts
from the racially mixed jury at yesterday's hearing 'unless something
unusual happens or I receive some kind of communication from the jury'.
On the streets, police stepped up patrols as a precaution against violence
in the wake of the expected verdicts, though officials said they did not
expect trouble. 'We're heavily deployed,' said Lt John Dunkin. 'But I want
to stress that we are very optimistic we are not going to have any problems
today.'
The alert was modest compared with the one in place in April, as the federal
trial of four white policemen accused of violating black motorist Rodney
King's civil rights neared its end. There was no trouble when two of the
officers were convicted and the other two acquitted.
