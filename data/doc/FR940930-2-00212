 

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission believes that accelerated approval of the extension of the pilot program furthers the protection
of investors and the public interest because it allows the Exchange additional time to evaluate the effectiveness
of the pilot program on an uninterrupted basis during the Commission's consideration of the Exchange's request for
permanent approval of its rules for reviewing proposed specialist combinations and because the BSE's concentration
policy may result in higher quality markets and improved standards of specialist performance. Further, the substance
of the proposal has been noticed previously in the 

Federal Register

 for the full statutory period and the Commission did not receive any comments on it.
