FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: Funds for business support
Sir, Your article 'Brown warns of cut in spending on unemployed' (March 16)
suggested that government funding for business support services, including
those that will be delivered through the pilot One Stop Shop business
centres, will be reduced by 14 per cent for the coming year.
This is not the case and is based on a misunderstanding of the basis for the
supply estimates figures which, because of the transfer of small firms
responsibilities between departments after the election, do not necessarily
compare like with like across the 1992-93 and 1993-94 financial years. The
position is that the 1992-93 budget for local business support in England
was Pounds 154m in 1993-94 and in 1993-94 will be Pounds 169m, an increase
of Pounds 15m.
