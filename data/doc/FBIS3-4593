  [Text] Washington, Feb. 27 (YONHAP) -- The United States 
is steadfast about not holding high-level talks with North Korea 
next month unless the two Koreas exchange presidential envoys 
first, sources here said Sunday. 
  Washington is expected to issue a statement supporting 
Seoul's announcement Tuesday suspending the South Korea-U.S. 
joint military drill "Team Spirit" this year, the same day that 
an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection team 
arrives in North Korea. 
  Washington will also clarify its position regarding what was 
agreed with Pyongyang at the New York contact on Saturday and 
reaffirm that the exchange of presidential envoys is a 
prerequisite to the high-level talks, sources said. 
  The United States and North Korea ended grueling 
negotiations 
that ran past midnight Saturday, when the latter agreed to 
permit IAEA inspections and reopen talks with South Korea on the 
envoys' cross-visits in exchange for Team Spirit's suspension 
and North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue. 
  The date for the third-round meeting between Washington and 
Pyongyang, when they will discuss overall improvement in 
relations, was set for March 21 in geneva. But some diplomatic 
observers say uncertainty remains over whether the third round 
of high-level dialogue will start as planned or be delayed if 
the inter-Korean envoy exchange does not occur by March 21. 
  President Bill Clinton reportedly convened a meeting of his 
national security advisers at the white house Saturday to 
discuss the North Korean nuclear situation. 
  Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci and deputy 
assistant secretary Tom Hubbard, both representatives at the 
talks with North Korea, will fly to South Korea early next month 
to coordinate a stance on the Pyongyang-Washington high-level 
meeting, sources said.
