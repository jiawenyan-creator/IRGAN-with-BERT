FT  12 NOV 94 / World News in Brief: Arafat cracks down on militants after
bomb kills Israelis
Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, ordered a
roundup of Moslem militants after a Moslem fundamentalist killed three
Israeli soldiers in a suicide bomb attack in the Gaza Strip. Four other
Israelis and six Palestinians were wounded. The Islamic Jihad group claimed
responsibility and said the bombing was a 'first' act of revenge for the
assassination of the Jihad strategist and newspaper publisher Hani Abed.
