ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
Those streaking Lakers hope to extend one string and break another tonight 
against San Antonio. They have won four consecutive games and failed to sell 
out the Forum seven consecutive times. . . . 
The Boston Celtics' new offense is the run-and-win. . . . 
Portland has the best record in the NBA but doesn't have a scorer or rebounder 
in the top 10. . . . 
Those disappointed by Michael Jordan's unspectacular performance against the 
Clippers at the Sports Arena Friday should be aware that he was suffering from 
the flu. That's also why the Denver Nuggets held him to 38 points the next 
night. . . . 
Remember the Clippers' famous draft class of 1987? None of the first-rounders 
are on their active roster today. Ken Norman is injured, Reggie Williams is 
with San Antonio and Joe Wolf is with Denver. . . . 
In beating Virginia, UCLA looked improved from last season's sweet-16 team 
because of a tighter defense and a more disciplined offense. . . . 
Keith Owens could be the Bruins' first genuine shot blocker in quite a while. . 
. . 
Hold off the induction of Indiana freshman Damon Bailey into the Hall of Fame. 
. . . 
USC freshman Lisa Leslie didn't dunk, but scored 30 points in her debut against 
Texas. At 6 feet 5, she can dominate the women's game in the manner of a 
seven-footer in the men's game. . . . 
From Coach George Raveling, who is on the last year of his contract with USC: 
"Like Tommy Heinsohn once said, if you listen to the people in the stands, 
pretty soon you'll be up there with them." . . . 
Every year, the three-point line in college basketball seems closer to the 
hoop. . . . 
Among the most important numbers the winner of the Los Angeles Athletic Club 
John Wooden Award must have is a cumulative grade-point average of at least 
2.0. . . . 
Those fines levied against the New England Patriots in the Lisa Olson case were 
worth the long wait. . . . 
Is every NFL game refereed by Jerry Markbreit, Jerry Seeman or Jim Tunney?. . . 
. 
The Rams have won 16 of 20 games from the 49ers in San Francisco since the 
rivalry shifted from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park in 1971. . . . 
What do Mike Lansford and Milli Vanilli have in common? . . . 
It was refreshing to see two coaches, Houston's Jack Pardee and Buffalo's Marv 
Levy, shake hands after a game as though they really meant it. . . . 
Warren Moon excites me like no other quarterback in the AFC. . . . 
Quietly enjoying a good season is Buffalo's James Lofton, who is catching 
passes and carrying defenders on his back. . . . 
Philadelphia, which already has a great pass rush, put a claim in on Dexter 
Manley. . . . 
Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Joe Walton, who took so many knocks early in 
the season, deserves to take a bow or two. . . . 
The same network, ABC, has the best pro football announcer -- Al Michaels -- 
and the best college football announcer -- Keith Jackson. . . . 
When Notre Dame beat USC, 10-6, the first time in 1940, all the points were 
scored by fullbacks. Milt Piepul had a touchdown, a field goal and an extra 
point for the Irish, and Bob Peoples had a touchdown for the Trojans. It was 
the last game ever coached by USC's Howard Jones. . . . 
This is the kind of year it has been in college football: Miami whipped 
Syracuse, 33-7, and was dropped from second to third behind idle Georgia Tech 
in the Associated Press poll. . . . 
It made a lot of fiscal sense for Virginia to lose to Georgia Tech. Instead of 
representing the Atlantic Coast Conference in the Citrus Bowl, the Cavaliers 
will make more than twice as much money in the Sugar Bowl. . . . 
Of the 106 players listed in the Notre Dame football media guide, only six hail 
from the state of Indiana. . . . 
Grambling's Eddie Robinson boasts two pro running back prospects in Walter Dean 
and Jake Reed, who also plays wide receiver. . . . 
Last Big Ten team to win the national championship was Ohio State in 1968. . . 
. 
BYU is hoping the Heisman Trophy balloting ends in a Ty, not a tie. . . . 
Is it my imagination or has defense returned to the NHL? . . . 
The Nordiques have the worst team in hockey, but the best arena name: Le 
Colisee de Quebec. . . . 
Laffit Pincay is aiming for a Dec. 12 return to Hollywood Park. . . . 
Oakland pitcher Dave Stewart and Anita DeFrantz, executive director of the 
American Athletic Foundation, will be honored by the Boys and Girls Clubs of 
America at a dinner Dec. 5 at the Beverly Hilton. . . . 
Farr out: It sounds as though George Steinbrenner is still making the decisions 
for the Yankees when they give 34-year-old free-agent pitcher Steve Farr a 
three-year, $6.3-million contract. . . . 
I wonder if the Dodgers' new psychiatrist will ask to renegotiate his contract 
if they win the pennant. . . . 
Better that Ray Perkins, not that radio guy, stay atop a billboard until the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers win another game.
