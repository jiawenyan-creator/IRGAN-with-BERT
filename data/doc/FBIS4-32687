  [Text] Podgorica, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Montenegrin 
Foreign Affairs Ministry has announced that Miodrag Lekic met 
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino in Belgrade today. 
  Lekic "voiced the opinion that the peace process in 
connection with the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict is entering its 
most delicate stage to date, and that its end will either mean 
qualitative improvement or a plunge into an even deeper crisis 
and uncertainty." According to the Montenegrin foreign minister, 
by accepting or rejecting the furure peace plan, the warring 
sides in Bosnia will definitely declare themselves either for 
peace or for the continuation of the war. 
  The Italian foreign minister was reported as having said in 
talks with Lekic that his country holds Montenegro's 
constructive contribution to the current peace process in high 
esteem and he expressed Italy's readiness to go on aiding 
Montenegro in alleviating its difficulties. Contacts between 
Italian and Montenegrin representatives so far have been 
assessed as positive, and it was concluded with pleasure that 
they have lately been registering an upward trend. 
  Hope was expressed that cooperation between Montenegro and 
Italy will be promoted after the sanctions are lifted.
