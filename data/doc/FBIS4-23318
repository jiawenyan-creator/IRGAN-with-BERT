  [Text] Jonas Savimbi's negotiators have already received 
the document containing the latest government offers to the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
UNITA negotiators received the document almost one week ago, 
but it has not yet been discussed. Our correspondent Manuel da 
Conceicao has further details. 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] UNITA says, however, that it 
only 
received the goverment's reply on its participation in the 
government on 31 May. The mediators say: That is not true. 
UNITA received the document on 28 May. 
  When Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN 
secretary general in Angola, left for Luanda on 29 May, they had 
already handed the document to UNITA. Sources close to Alioune 
Blondin Beye said the document was handed to the UNITA 
negotiating team a few hours after Beye received it from the 
special envoy of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on 28 May.
