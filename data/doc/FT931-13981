FT  20 JAN 93 / Opel to cut car production by 15 per cent
Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is to cut car
production by about 15 per cent this year to allow for an estimated 19 per

to Mr David Herman, managing director, total west European new car sales
will fall 8 per cent this year, from 13.4m to 12.3m, mainly as a result of a

cent in 1992. Opel's turnover rose 7 per cent to DM29bn (Pounds 12bn) last
year,
