FT  13 APR 93 / Observer: Value for money
A Barclays banker writes. 'We enclose your cheque for Dollars 8.15. We feel
that it is not in your best interest to negotiate this cheque for you as its
sterling value totals Pounds 5.43 and our charge for negotiating the cheque
is Pounds 8.'
So who gets to keep the Dollars 8.15?
