  [Text] Jerusalem -- The Orient House yesterday issued a 
press statement in which it expressed its concern and 
disappointment over recent Israeli statements and political 
maneuvers aimed at driving a wedge between sectors of the 
Palestinian people. 
  The statement said that Israeli protests and warnings 
relating to coordination between Palestinians who support and 
oppose the peace process and the attempts to discriminate 
between Palestinian prisoners and set preconditions for their 
release are totally rejected and are considered Israeli 
interference in Palestinian internal affairs. 
  The statement said that the PLO, which is recognized even by 
Israel as the responsible party representing the Palestinians, 
has every right to strengthen and enhance relations and ties 
between various sectors of the Palestinian people regardless of 
their political or religious affiliations. 
  The statement added that these efforts by the PLO are an 
internal Palestinian affair and Israel has no right to interfere 
in them. We reject any Israeli attempts to intervene in any 
national dialogue and agreement between Palestinian national 
movements in the occupied territories.
