  [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 28 Jan, CANA -- Japan, Jamaica's 
second largest bilateral creditor behind the United States, has 
rescheduled 1.4 billion yen (about 14 million US dollars) of the 
island's debt. 
  The agreement, signed this week, is part of arrangements 
with 
Paris Club member countries allowing Jamaica to receive support 
for its economic reform programme through debt-resheduling 
arrangements. 
  Under the agreement signed by Finance Minister Omar Davies 
and Japan's Charge d'Affaires in Kingston, Hiroshi Funakoshi, 
repayments of the debt will begin in September, 2000 and should 
be in 18 installments at an interest rate of 8.2 per cent 
annually. 
  Up to October last year, Jamaica owed Japan just over 350 
million US dollars. Jamaica's external debt currently stands at 
3.64 billion US dollars.
