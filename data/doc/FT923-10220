FT  31 JUL 92 / Zimbabwe seeks aid to pay drought bill
ZIMBABWE is seeking a hefty increase in foreign aid to help cover emergency
drought relief in a year of economic gloom, according to the 1992-93 budget
which was presented to parliament yesterday.
The finance minister, Mr Bernard Chidzero, said public spending would be cut
to 41 per cent of GDP from 49 per cent last year, and the budget deficit
(before aid grants) is forecast at 9 per cent of GDP in 1992-1993, the same
as in the previous year.
Mr Chidzero has budgeted for an increased deficit of ZDollars 2bn (Pounds
209.4m) after aid grants of ZDollars 800m. Aid in the past year amounted to
ZDollars 349m.
The main tax change in the financial package is the imposition of a 5 per
cent drought surcharge on individual taxpayers for the current year and
payable by companies during both the 1992 and 1993 tax years.
During the current year individuals will pay a top rate of 57.75 per cent,
while the effective rate of corporate tax rises to 44.6 per cent for the
next two years when the drought levy is included.
Mr Chidzero said inflation was the country's number one problem. It was
running at more than 36 per cent on an annual basis at the end of May and
was expected to average 40-45 per cent for 1992. He added, however, that the
government was committed to its 18-month-old economic reform plan as 'the
only way forward even in these difficult times'.
