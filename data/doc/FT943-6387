FT  30 AUG 94 / Albania presses on with trial
Albanian prosecutors yesterday demanded jail terms of between seven and nine
years for five ethnic Greeks accused of spying for Athens. If they are
convicted, it could put Albania on a collision course with Athens, which has
already deported thousands of illegal Albanian immigrants from Greece in
retaliation for what it calls a political trial. The five accused, all
members of the ethnic Greek organisation Omonia, based in southern Albania,
were arrested in April following a raid on a military camp close to the
Greek border. Tirana blamed Greece for the raid but Athens denied the
charge. The prosecutor said the men were found in possession of illegal
weapons with the intention of arming the Greek minority 'at a certain time
according to orders'. He alleged: 'They have all committed the crime of
serving the Greek secret service.' The trial has rekindled deep-seated
tensions between Albania and Greece, which accuses Tirana of mistreating its
Greek minority, estimated by Athens at 300,000 and by Tirana at 60,000.
