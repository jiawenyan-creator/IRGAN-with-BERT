LESS SMOKING, LESS DRINKING; 
O.C. HEALTHIER THAN REST OF U.S. 
Orange County residents drink less, smoke less and are healthier than Americans 
around the country, according to a comprehensive health survey released by UC 
Irvine researchers on Wednesday. 
Of residents polled, 58.6% said they were free of nine major diseases, 
including diabetes, heart disease and cancer, compared to 56% nationwide, the 
researchers said. 
But ironically, when Orange County residents do describe a health problem, they 
are more likely than residents elsewhere to report several major medical 
conditions rather than one. 
These findings indicate that "perhaps the health care system (in Orange County) 
is superior, so we diagnose more diseases," frequently discovering an illness 
earlier -- "before people die from it," said Dr. Hoda Anton-Culver, a UCI 
professor of community and environmental medicine who was part of the 
four-member survey team. 
Their poll, the 1989 Orange County Health Surveys, was the first in a five-year 
series of surveys assessing the health of Orange County residents. 
Funded by $160,000-a-year grants from the Irvine Health Foundation, the surveys 
not only look at the incidence of disease here but also consider risk factors 
for illness such as smoking, drinking and obesity. The results released 
Wednesday were taken from random telephone interviews with 800 residents last 
October and another 800 residents this June. 
The researchers said they hoped that Orange County hospitals and health 
agencies could use the information -- "snapshots" of the county's health -- to 
shape strategies for preventing illness. 
Wiath a poll that focuses on Orange County, "you see problems you would not 
have expected in the federal data," said Ray Catalano, a former UCI professor 
of social ecology who plans to continue work on the health surveys even though 
he recently accepted an appointment at UC Berkeley. 
The surveys revealed some problem areas, researchers said, including 
indications that young women in Orange County are more likely to be depressed 
than men or women in other age categories. Some 14.6% of women ages 18 to 34 
reported they were depressed contrasted with only 6.2% of men in the same age 
group, according to the survey. 
Social ecology professor David Dooley said the reason for their depression was 
unclear, but he theorized that "maybe it's more difficult for these young women 
to combine the role of worker and young mother -- and achieve a family 
relationship." 
Still, the overall findings on depression showed that fewer Orange County 
residents were depressed than residents elsewhere -- only 7.2% here compared to 
13% in Los Angeles County and the nation. Dooley attributed the difference to a 
"higher level of affluence" in Orange County. Also, he said, statistics on 
depression in the Los Angeles area were gathered from 1978 to 1982 during a 
period of economic recession, when unemployment rates were high. 
Other findings from the survey: 
*Concern about AIDS is rising. When the interviews began last October, 10% of 
those surveyed said they knew someone with AIDS, but by the second set of 
interviews ending in June, 15% reported they knew someone with AIDS, Catalano 
said. 
*About 10% of residents who needed to see a doctor said they did not do so 
because "it cost too much," Catalano said. He said later surveys will include 
questions on obtaining medical care, including whether complicated insurance 
policies discourage patients from using them. 
*Only 17.3% of Orange County residents are overweight, compared to 21% 
nationally. Of those, 21.2% of Orange County men were overweight compared to 
21.8% nationally, but only 13.8% of women are overweight compared to 21.1% 
nationally. Asked why so many Orange County women were slim, Catalano admitted: 
"I have no idea." 
*According to the survey, 24.5% of men and 20% of women in Orange County smoke 
compared to 32.6% of men and 27.9% of women nationally. Also, fewer Orange 
County residents drink alcohol than nationwide, with 63.6% of men and 46% of 
women here reporting they drink compared to 76.1% of men and 55.5% of women 
nationwide. 
Anton-Culver said she believed that the rate of alcohol consumption here was 
still uncomfortably high, but the low smoking rate showed that "people in 
Orange County are more concerned about their health." 
*When residents reported their medical conditions, the greatest percentage, 
19.2%, reported they were suffering from arthritis. That was followed by kidney 
and bladder disease (12.4%), heart disease (9.9%), asthma (7.3%), emphysema and 
bronchitis (5.9%), cancer (5%), diabetes (3.3%), liver disease (2.3%) and 
stroke (1.4%). 
The incidence of arthritis here is higher than the national rate of 13.8%. "It 
could be that people (with arthritis) migrate into Orange County," Anton-Culver 
said. 
*In a look at medical problems and smoking, UCI researchers found that many of 
those with significant medical conditions had given up the habit. "If a disease 
is probably fatal, they stop smoking," Anton-Culver said. 
At the same time, however, a relatively high number of those with arthritis -- 
26.9% of women and 11.5% of men -- were continuing to smoke. She called that 
finding surprising and worth additional study.

Prevalence of Medical Conditions in Orange County and the Nation 
Residents in Orange County and across the nation were asked if they had any of 
these diseases-diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, COPD*, asthmas, 
kidney and bladder disease or cancer.
