FT  24 MAY 93 / Letter: Audit Commission strives to be open and accessible
Sir, Your correspondent, Mary Bowerman (Accountancy Column, May 20),
correctly identified that the National Audit Office audits The Audit
Commission, but questioned whether this was not 'a rather incestuous
relationship'.
We have no evidence to support this assertion. We have attempted to be
accessible by promoting the publication of internal and external assessments
of our performance. We are subject to periodic financial management and
performance reviews by our sponsoring ministry, the Department of the
Environment. One such review has just been completed and we are encouraging
the ministry to publish the report as part of the process of opening up the
Audit Commission to public scrutiny.
It is for government, and not the commission, to define our audit
arrangements. If it were to respond to this demand and create a new
independent auditing body for this purpose then we would welcome the new
arrangement.
But I wonder how long after its formation we may expect a further article in
the FT asking who audits the new auditing body?
