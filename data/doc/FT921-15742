FT  08 JAN 92 / Institute of British Geographers' Conference in Sheffield:
Reluctance over Sunday work seen
NEARLY 75 per cent of women shopworkers would be unhappy if they were
required to work on Sundays, and 42 per cent would try to change their job,
according to a study of the effects of Sunday trading.
For more than 70 per cent of a sample of 483 retail employees, Sunday is the
only day of the week when their partner is not working, Professor David
Kirby of the Durham University Business School told the conference.
The workers questioned were employed by six retail companies with outlets
around the country. Most said they objected to the effects on their family
of working weekends.
More than half said they would want to be paid double-time to to work over
the weekend. Most women retail workers would prefer to work later on weekday
evenings or Saturdays rather than Sundays.
However, most of the workers did not have formal qualifications, and would
find it difficult to find alternative employment, the study found. Few were
members of unions, and most could not afford to become unemployed. As a
result, 'they are vulnerable to the market place', Prof Kirby said.
He said the 1950 Shops Act, which restricts Sunday trading, was introduced
mainly to protect employees from working unsociable hours, and recommended
that any changes to the law should cover these pressures.
