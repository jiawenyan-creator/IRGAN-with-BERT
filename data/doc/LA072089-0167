SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL; 
BLASZCAK SUIT ATTACKS RECALL 
Former San Gabriel Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak has sued to overturn the recall 
election that threw him out of office in May. 
Charging that there were widespread irregularities in the city-run election, 
Blaszcak, who was recalled by a nine-vote margin on May 23, is seeking to be 
reinstated on the City Council. A hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 10 in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
City Atty. Stephanie Scher said that Blaszcak's legal action was "without 
basis." The City Council has scheduled a special election for Sept. 12 to fill 
Blaszcak's seat. 
Mark Rosen, Blaszcak's attorney, said that the election, which was supervised 
by Assistant City Clerk Cindy Bookter, had been "contaminated" and that the 
result was not accurate. He said enough voters either had been prevented from 
voting or allowed to vote improperly to raise questions about the final 
results. 
Bookter says that she strictly adhered to state elections laws.
