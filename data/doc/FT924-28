FT  31 DEC 92 / International Company News: Buster Brown to go it alone
BUSTER Brown Apparel, the Tennessee-based clothing group which has clad
American schoolchildren for decades, is letting go of its parent's hand and
stepping out alone.
Gerber, the large US baby food company which has owned Buster Brown since
the early-1980s, announced yesterday it was selling the company to
management, backed by Chemical Venture Partners and Apollo Advisers.
Chemical Venture, with around Dollars 1.5bn under management, is the venture
capital arm of Chemical Banking Corporation, while Apollo Advisers is part
of the investment business run by Mr Leon Black, previously a senior
investment banker with the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert.
Gerber, which is caught up in a price-war in its baby foods business, has
been trying to sell the Buster Brown business since early summer. Analysts
had suggested it might fetch around Dollars 160m, although neither buyer nor
seller would disclose the acquisition price yesterday.
Buster Brown, which was founded in 1904, has annual sales of about Dollars
165m. Profitability, however, is understood to have waned in the current
financial year to end-March.
