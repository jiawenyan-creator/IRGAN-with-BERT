  [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service denied reports that a group of famous US 
A-bomb designers had sold the secrets of the weapon to the 
former Soviet Union and added that Soviet spies had played only 
a "support role" in the creation of the mass destruction arms in 
the USSR. 
  "Allegations that Soviet intelligence received information 
on 
atomic bomb directly from such noted scientists as Enrico Fermi, 
Leo Scillard, Robert Oppenheimer and others do not correspond to 
reality", the press bureaus of the Foreign Intelligence Service 
said in a statement for TASS on Thursday. 
  It was commenting on the allegations published in a book of 
former Soviet top KGB agent Pavel Sudoplatov. 
  The intelligence service also said that the book is a 
"mosaic 
of truthful events, semi-truth and open inventions". 
  "The very events and the role of many participants are 
interpreted in a free and often the wrong way", it said adding 
that the author exaggerates his role in the creation of the 
Soviet A- bomb. 
  "The atomic and thermonuclear weapons were created in the 
Soviet Union mostly thanks to a mighty scientific, technical and 
intellectual potential. The decisive contribution was made by a 
big group of scientists", the press service said, but admitted 
that Soviet intelligence learned in September 1941 about the 
nuclear research which was going on in the United States and 
Great Britain. 
  "Later in close contact with scientists it organised the 
delivery of secret information from abroad which helped Soviet 
experts in solving a number of complicated scientific and 
technical problems and decreased the time in which the Soviet 
Union designed its own atomic weapons", the press service said. 
  It added, however, that "as far as the contribution of the 
intelligence to the creation of the Soviet A-bomb is concerned, 
its important and skilled work in the interests of the state 
played a support role".
