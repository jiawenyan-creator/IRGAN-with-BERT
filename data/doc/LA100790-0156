VETO MESSAGE NEARLY A SHUTDOWN CASUALTY 
President Bush wanted to veto Congress' stopgap money bill Saturday to 
underscore his determination to shut down the government until a 
deficit-reduction deal was done, but he apparently had trouble finding someone 
to type up the veto message. 
It seems the "non-essential" clerical staff had been sent home already. 
At the White House, many of the offices were dark and tourists with tickets for 
tours were left standing on the sidewalk as the impact of the budget breakdown 
was felt. 
When Bush made an unusual appearance at the White House driveway to announce 
his rejection of the continuing resolution, he said he hadn't actually vetoed 
it yet. "Need a typewriter in there to get it done," he said. 
Later, his personal secretary, Patricia Presock, could be seen typing 
frantically at her desk just outside the Oval Office.
