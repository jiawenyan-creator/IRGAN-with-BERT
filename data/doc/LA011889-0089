THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
DEADEYE OF A PUPIL PROVES HAYES A FINE TEACHER 
Lance Moore of Burroughs of Ridgecrest shot down Canyon, 57-54, in a Golden 
League game last week with a shooting technique that he learned from Canyon 
Coach Greg Hayes. 
Moore scored a game-high 14 points, including 12 in the second half, to lead 
the first-place Burros. Moore also hit a critical fourth-quarter 3-point shot 
that proved to be the difference in the game. 
When Moore approached Hayes afterward, the player attributed his performance to 
his one-time instructor. 
"He said, 'You're the one who taught me how to shoot,' " Hayes said. "I didn't 
remember him until he said that. He was really sincere." 
And a good pupil. During a 1987 "Shot Doctor" clinic at Thousand Oaks High, 
Hayes helped Moore sharpen his shot. "He worked really hard at it," Hayes 
remembered. 
Then he shot down Canyon. 
"It was real mixed emotions," Hayes said. "I grabbed him in a headlock and 
said, 'If I knew you'd have gone to Burroughs, I would have screwed you up.' " 
Game rescheduled: Friday night's San Fernando Valley League boys' basketball 
showdown between Notre Dame and Bell-Jeff has been rescheduled for Saturday 
night at 7 because of a scheduling conflict with the Bell-Jeff gym. Notre Dame 
(9-8 overall) and Bell-Jeff (15-1) are both 3-0 in league play. 
Add schedule change: The Delphic League game between Crossroads and Faith 
Baptist scheduled for Tuesday has been postponed until Jan. 28 because of final 
exams at Crossroads. 
Although Crossroads requested the change, Faith Baptist may benefit. Jason 
Henderson, the Contenders' 6-10 center, was injured in last week's victory over 
Providence and did not play in a loss to Bel-Air Prep on Saturday, the team's 
first defeat in league play. 
"I hate to be accusing," Faith Baptist Coach Dean Lobdell said, "but it seems 
every year we play Crossroads they try to reschedule one of our games. I have 
been coaching here for five years and it always happens. This time it may help 
us, though, because Jason should be recovered." 
Last add schedule: Taft's game at El Camino Real, originally scheduled for 7 
tonight, has been rescheduled for 4 p.m. Taft Coach Jim Woodard voiced 
objections over playing a midweek night game because players who are bused get 
home at 11 p.m. or later. 
"Those guys don't get home until real late, and if they have homework or 
something they're up even later," Woodard said. "Then they get up at 5 or 5:30 
the next day and it's just too tough on them." 
Rescheduling the game, however, will hold down attendance, El Camino Real Coach 
McNulty said. 
"It's too bad because it's our best rivalry and we'd like to play in front of 
more people," McNulty said. 
Last season, the rivalry was especially close. Taft won the first game, 58-57, 
in double overtime, and the second, 45-42. 
Sidelined: Sophomore David Harbour, who leads Camarillo in scoring, assists and 
is second in rebounding, probably will not play in tonight's Marmonte League 
game against Simi Valley. 
Despite spraining his left ankle in the fourth quarter of the Scorpions' 77-47 
win over Channel Islands last week, Harbour scored 37 points. He did not play 
in Friday's 66-62 win over Thousand Oaks.
