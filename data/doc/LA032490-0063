METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERS HOLD UP ARMORED CAR GUARD IN STORE 
Two robbers waylaid an armored car guard carrying cash into a home improvement 
store in Van Nuys Friday, shot him in the hand and fled with a bag of money, 
witnesses and Los Angeles police said. 
It was at least the 19th such robbery in the Los Angeles area since 1988. 
A suspect, who was not identified, was later arrested, police said. 
The robbers -- guns drawn -- followed the guard through the Home Depot store on 
Roscoe Boulevard, said an employee, who asked not to be identified. When the 
guard did not surrender his money "they shot him," the employee said. The 
guard, who was not identified, was treated at Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center.
