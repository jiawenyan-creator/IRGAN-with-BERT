Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, expects to
achieve a large increase in net profits during the first half of this year,
according to Mr Jean Louis Beffa, chairman.
Mr Beffa, speaking at the group's annual general meeting in Paris, said the
pick-up in activity which started during the final quarter of 1993 had
continued in 1994.
Saint-Gobain last year suffered a sharp fall in interim profits to FFr452m
(Dollars 79.3m) from FFr1.4bn during the same period of the previous year.
