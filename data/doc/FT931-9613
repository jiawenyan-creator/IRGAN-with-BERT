FT  12 FEB 93 / BP upbeat as cost-cutting reduces debt
BRITISH Petroleum said yes-terday that its stringent cost-cutting measures
adopted to tackle its huge debt burden were beginning to show up in the
company's results. At the same time, BP has managed to arrest its large cash
haemorrhage in spite of extremely difficult market conditions.
In an upbeat presentation yesterday, Mr David Simon, group chief executive,
said: 'There are signs we are following the track we chose in the middle of
last year more confidently now.' He was referring to targets set for the
company to make profits of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) by 1995 and pay down
its debt at the rate of Dollars 1bn a year.
Under the new FRS 3 accounting rules, BP reported a loss for 1992 of Pounds
352m on a replacement cost basis - which strips out the losses and gains
from stockholding - after a restructuring charge of Pounds 994m. Net profit
a year earlier was Pounds 1.035bn under both new and old accounting
standards.
But fourth-quarter profit more than doubled from the previous year and the
company had a net cash inflow in the final quarter of Pounds 135m. This
compares with outflows of Pounds 607m for the full year and Pounds 1.14bn in
1991.
The company said it would pay a dividend of 2.1p for the final quarter,
making a full year payout of 10.5p, down 37.5 per cent from 16.8p in 1991.
The loss per share was 8.5p against earnings of 7.7p in 1991.
Lord Ashburton, the company's chairman said: 'The company is occupied with
reaching the targets it set itself and only then will it look at increasing
the dividend.'
Mr Fergus McLeod, oil analyst at NatWest Securities, said the figures showed
some evidence that the pain the company was going through was worthwhile.
'It's encouraging, it suggests that what is being done on costs is having
some positive impact on the bottom line.'
The company has cut 14,500 jobs and will restrict capital expenditure to
Dollars 5bn this year from Dollars 6.1bn last year.
But in spite of paying down almost Dollars 1bn of the company's Dollars
15.3bn debt burden, BP's debt to equity ratio rose to almost 100 per cent
following the devaluation of sterling - most of the company's debt is
denominated in dollars.
