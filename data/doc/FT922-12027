FT  22 APR 92 / Company failures rise by 31%
THE NUMBER of company failures rose sharply in the first three months of
this year after remaining steady on a quarterly basis throughout last year,
according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
Receiverships rose 31 per cent to 1,362 in the first three months of this
year from 1,037 in the final quarter of last year. One reason for the
increase was a rise in the number of retail companies forced into
receivership after making unsuccessful attempts to stave off collapse with
pre-Christmas and new-year sales, KPMG said.
Manufacturing companies fared better in the first quarter, accounting for
only 25 per cent of failures. This compares with nearly 29 per cent over the
same period last year. Finance and business services companies accounted for
17 per cent of failures compared with 12.5 per cent, while retailing
companies accounted for nearly 10.5 per cent compared with nearly 8 per
cent.
