  [Text] Recent press reports have prompted the Greek Embassy 
in Cyprus to issue a statement saying that it is authorized to 
announce that Athens-Nicosia relations and the personal 
relationship between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou are excellent. 
  In its statement, the Greek Embassy says that the Greek 
prime 
minister never expressed, either directly or indirectly, any 
hint regarding the honesty of their cooperation or any lack of 
mutual briefing. Therefore, it adds, the relevant reports are 
pure fantasy. 
  The statement finally adds that with this opportunity the 
Greek prime minister once again expresses his particular respect 
for Kliridhis.
