SEN. TORRES TO LOSE LICENSE IN ARREST FOR DRUNK DRIVING 
State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) will lose his driver's license Oct. 10 
because he refused to be tested for alcohol when Sacramento police officers 
stopped his car earlier this month, the Department of Motor Vehicles reported 
Thursday. 
The Sept. 6 incident marked Torres' second drunk driving arrest in Sacramento 
County. He is on probation for the first incident in 1987. 
In the most recent case, a Sacramento police officer said Torres, 42, was 
driving without lights and was arrested for drunk driving. According to the 
officer, Torres refused to submit to chemical tests to determine his blood 
alcohol level.
