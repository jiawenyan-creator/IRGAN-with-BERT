  [Text] Elyaqim Rubinstein, who heads the Israeli delegation 
to the talks with Jordan, has expressed cautious optimism about 
Jordan's readiness to make progress in the negotiations. 
  [Begin Rubinstein recording] We are leaving for a very 
official trilateral -- Israeli-Jordanian-American -- meeting, 
which is a continuation of previous trilateral meetings. It 
will deal with commercial ties and development of the Jordan 
Rift Valley, which are real and complex issues. What other 
issues on the periphery of those talks will be discussed? We 
meet with the Jordanians on all sorts of things linked to the 
agreed upon agenda, but I think that the main focus is in those 
trilateral talks. 
  What chance does such a meeting have? The likelihood is 
there will be slow progress -- like the negotiations with Jordan 
in general. These negotiations can be implemented, but are 
constantly under pressures, which do not come from Israel, but 
from the other side. We try to make as much progress as 
possible, taking into account those pressures. [end recording] 
  That was Elyaqim Rubinstein prior to his departure for 
Washington.
