Applicant's Representations


1. Applicant, a Massachusetts trust, is an open-end management investment company. On October 3, 1989, applicant
filed a notification of registration under section 8(a) and a registration statement on Form N1A under section
8(b). Applicant registered the following portfolios under the Securities Act of 1933: Yankee U.S. Government Income
Fund A; Yankee U.S. Government Income Fund B; Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund A; Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund B; Yankee
Equity Fund; Yankee Equity Income Fund; and Yankee Funds (the ``Yankee Money Market Fund''). 
2. Applicant's portfolios were organized as feeder funds in a master/feeder arrangement with seven registered management
investment companies (the ``Master Funds''). In early 1993, the investment adviser to the Master Funds recommended
to the boards of trustees of applicant and the Master Funds that the non-money market portfolios of applicant and the
corresponding Master Funds be reorganized into the Galaxy Fund and that the Yankee Money Market Fund be liquidated.

3. On February 22, 1993, the boards of trustees of applicant and the Master Funds approved the plan of reorganization.
A combined proxy statement and prospectus was sent to applicant's non-money market fund shareholders on April 11,
1993. Definitive copies of such materials were filed with the SEC as part of The Galaxy Fund's registration on April
23, 1993. A majority of applicant's shareholders, excluding the shareholders of the Yankee Money Market Fund, approved
the reorganization at a meeting held on May 6, 1993, and applicant, as holder of a majority of the units of beneficial
interest of the Master Funds, approved the reorganization by written consent dated May 6, 1993.
4. On May 7, 1993, applicant transferred all of the assets and liabilities of: (a) Yankee U.S. Government Income Fund
A and Yankee U.S. Government Income Fund B to Galaxy Intermediate Bond Fund; (b) Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund and
Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund B to Galaxy Tax-Exempt Bond Fund; and (c) Yankee Equity Fund and Yankee Equity Income
Fund to Galaxy Equity Growth Fund (Galaxy Intermediate Bond Fund, Galaxy Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, and Galaxy Equity
Growth Fund together, the ``Acquiring Funds'') in exchange for shares of the respective Acquiring Funds. Thereafter,
applicant distributed the appropriate Acquiring Fund shares to its shareholders. Applicant's shareholders received
shares of the Acquiring Funds with an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their respective
interests in applicant. 
5. On or before May 10, 1993, the three holders of beneficial interest in the Yankee Money Market Fund gave notice that
they wanted to redeem their entire holdings. The corresponding Master Fund's investment portfolio consisted entirely
of short-term investments all maturing on May 10, 1993. On May 10, 1993, a complete redemption totaling $65,585,130
was paid by applicant to its shareholders on a 

pro rata 

basis. 
6. In connection with the reorganization, applicant incurred expenses such as professional fees, custody and administration
fees and expenses totaling $164,666. These expenses were allocated to applicant's non-money market portfolios
based on the relative net assets of such portfolios and paid by applicant. In connection with the liquidation, applicant
incurred expenses such as professional fees, custody and administration fees and expenses totaling $13,401. These
expenses were allocated to the Yankee Money Market Fund and paid by applicant.
7. Applicant has no outstanding debts or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative
proceeding. Applicant has no shareholders and is not engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities
other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.
