  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has held a telephone 
conversation with Saudi King Fahd and has stated that the 
Islamic world should once more be mobilized to make the 
international community take the necessary steps regarding the 
Geneva talks on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina. King Fahd said 
that he fully shares these views and that he will initiate the 
necessary moves on the issue. 
  According to a statement issued by the Presidential Press 
Center, Demirel informed King Fahd of Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic's concern regarding the course of the Geneva 
talks. Demirel reiterated the view that if the talks prove to be 
unsuccessful then there will be no valid reason to continue the 
arms embargo imposed on Bosnia-Herzegovina.
