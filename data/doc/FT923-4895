FT  04 SEP 92 / Council tax values too high says report
FIGURES released yesterday by the Labour-controlled Association of London
Authorities reveal that the government has over-estimated property values
for the new council tax - some by a wide margin.
The lower than expected valuations mean that the tax rates for each band
will be higher than the government's original estimates if the council tax
is to raise the planned total when it replaces the poll tax next April.
However, while this will mean higher bills for some, others will gain by
finding themselves in a lower tax band than expected.
The figures are the first to include valuations for every local authority in
England. They show that values have been under-estimated in some inner-city
areas. In Liverpool, for example, the tax base will be 15 per cent below the
1991 estimate; in the London borough of Hackney, it will be 22 per cent
below.
Mr Mike Williams, deputy city treasurer of Birmingham City Council, said the
valuations had put more properties in the lower bands than had been
expected. He said: 'The numbers in Band A (the lowest category) are
particularly high at over 40 per cent . . . I think the DoE is in real
trouble over this.'
The figures were released two days after the Department of the Environment
sent the draft council tax valuations to local authorities, requesting that
they should not go on general release. Ministers have consistently refused
to publish the data, or comment on reports based on results sent to some
councils.
The history of the poll tax has made ministers and civil servants wary about
publishing projections. One of the reasons for the tax's unpopularity was
that when the bills came in they were much higher than estimates.
