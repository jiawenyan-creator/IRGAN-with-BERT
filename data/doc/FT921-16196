FT  06 JAN 92 / Somalian ceasefire eludes UN envoy
UNITED NATIONS efforts to bring peace and humanitarian assistance to
war-ravaged Somalia appeared destined for failure last night after a special
envoy completed a three-day tour of the country without reaching agreement
on a ceasefire or relief efforts.
The failure, in the face of objections by Somalia's battling factions, is
bound to lead to further clan warfare and worsen the plight of hundreds of
thousands of Somali civilians.
Mr James Jonah, UN undersecretary general, said there was no common ground
between the two battling warlords - Mohamed Farah Aideed and Ali Mahdi
Mohamed - in the shell-blasted capital, Mogadishu.
Fighting continued during Mr Jonah's trip, despite assurances that a de
facto ceasefire was in place. Mr Jonah said Mr Ali Mahdi had asked the UN to
send a peacekeeping force into Mogadishu and attempt to broker a
reconciliation. Both proposals were ruled out by Mr Aideed. At least 5,000
people have been killed and 11,000 wounded since the latest bout of clan
warfare erupted last November.
The failure of the UN - which was absent from Mogadishu for most of last
year - will lead to initiatives by other bodies. The Arab League, of which
Somalia is a member, agreed at an emergency meeting yesterday to appoint a
ministerial committee to attempt to reconcile the factions.
Mr Meles Zenawi, the transitional president of Ethiopia, has also given his
support to calls for an international force to enter Somalia to facilitate
humanitarian operations.
