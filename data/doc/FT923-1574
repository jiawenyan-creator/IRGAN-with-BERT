FT  22 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Politics move Pacific
Basin equities as Nikkei eases
LATE AFTERNOON arbitrage selling left the Nikkei average lower yesterday, in
slow trading ahead of a national holiday tomorrow, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei shed 100.56 to 18,066.24, dragged down by the fall in the futures
market in the final hour, after setting a day's high of 18,414.09 in the
morning on dealer buying, and a low of 18,050.48 just before the close.
Volume was still thin, at 280m shares against 333m, as most institutional
investors remained inactive. Rises maintained a small lead over falls by 489
to 450, with 184 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first
section stocks closed a slight 1.46 up at 1,355.51. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 1.41 to 1,088.57.
Rumours that a second tier broker was liquidating an arbitrage portfolio
depressed the futures market. But traders said overall sentiment stayed firm
as many investors believe that public funds will be invested in the equity
market at the end of this month.
Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities said: 'It is a historically firm
period. Share price movements will be dependent on progress of the land
buying corporation and interest rate movements.' Last week's comments by
Prime Minister Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, supporting the use of public funds to
finance a Japanese version of the Resolution Trust Corp-oration in the US,
have indicated that the plans for the establishment of the organisation are
progressing.
Trading was short term. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the day's most active
issue, fell Y30 to Y440 on profit-taking. Mining shares gained last week on
reports of a gold mine discovery in southern Japan.
Aoki, the construction company, jumped Y46 to Y550 on active buying. The
issue will replace Nippon Stainless Steel later this week as a component of
the Nikkei 225-stock average. Speculators sought issues rumoured as
candidates for inclusion in the near future. Minebea rose Y16 to Y500 and
Seika, a machinery trader, advanced Y26 to Y684.
Itoman, the Osaka based textile trading concern, did not trade due to the
lack of buyers, and closed offered at Y268, down Y80. The company, under
financial restructuring due to losses on its extensive property and stock
speculation, last week announced that it will be merged with Sumikin Bussan,
a steel trading subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Industries, a core company of
the Sumitomo group, which is aiding the restructuring.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 92.87 to 19,484.02 in volume of 14.8m
shares. Roundup
DOMESTIC AND international politics had a lot to do with the way markets in
the region moved yesterday.
BANGKOK trading attained a new record, and stocks climbed by 4 per cent on
weekend progress towards the formation of a new government coalition,
following the general election nine days ago.
The busiest day in the 17-year history of the Thai stock market saw turnover
of Bt22.62bn as the SET index closed 33.30 higher at 868.75, bringing the
total gain to 15 per cent since September 1.
HONG KONG was pleased with the French Yes vote on Maastricht, and the Hang
Seng index added 52.21 at 5,741.53, following Friday's 51-point gain, as
turnover eased from HKDollars 1.81bn to HKDollars 1.754bn.
Conglomerates and properties showed above-average rises.
AUSTRALIA was also influenced by the French vote, as well as by stronger
markets abroad last Friday. The All Ordinaries index firmed 7.9 to 1,531.6
but turnover was thin, falling from ADollars 166m to ADollars 136m as
investors awaited international reaction to European events.
SEOUL dropped 3.5 per cent amid political uncertainty. The composite index
shed 19.01 to 521.54 in active turnover of Won240bn on the after-shock
following President Roh Tae-woo's decision last week to leave the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party and form a neutral cabinet to ensure fairness in
the presidential election late this year.
BOMBAY saw heavy selling after last week's gains, the BSE index losing
108.88, or 3.2 per cent, to 3,274.74. MANILA blamed flash floods in the city
as the composite index slid 10.68 to 1,410.65.
TAIWAN heard that Lei Po-lung, who plays a leading role in a TDollars 8.1bn
default case, had been arrested on Sunday and that Oung Ta-ming, textile
tycoon and head of the Hualon group, was too ill to attend a court hearing
yesterday, and the weighted index receded 88.03 to 3,481.90 after a
132-point gain on Saturday.
