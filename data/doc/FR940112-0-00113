 

A. Section 500.2Terms Defined 



The Commission is making both significant and minor technical changes to this section. The Commission amends subsection
(a) to include a reference to the 1992 statute amending FPLA and subsection (c) to reflect that the Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency rather than the Secretary of Agriculture enforces the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Subsection (d) deletes references to repealed statutes. In addition, throughout
these proposed amendments, a few non-substantive, technical changes have been made. In subsection (h), as in other
proposed amendments, the metric equivalent for an existing inch/pound reference is added. The use of both systems
in the regulations is called for by the FPLA and is consistent with the requirements of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness
Act of 1988 (Public Law 100, 15 U.S.C. 205b). 

Subsection (j) is new and defines the term ``SI metric,'' a term used throughout the proposed amendments to the regulations.
The definition is derived from official Federal Government publications relating to metric terminology.

11

 The definition makes reference to the statutory authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce to interpret and modify
the International System of Units (SI) for the United States.

Two comments addressed the use of the term ``SI metric'' in the regulations. NIST wrote that it is confusing and redundant:
a) to use the term ``SI metric'' system because it implies that there are metric systems other than the International
System of Units (SI), and b) to use ``SI metric'' to modify a metric unit name.

12

 (An example of the latter would be the reference to ``SI metric kilograms'' in 500.8(d) of the new rules). NIST
recommended using either ``SI'' or ``metric.'' NCWM recommended that ``you consider eliminating use of the terms
`SI metric' in association with the metric units *** because the terms stand by themselves as metric
units.''

The Commission has decided not to accept these suggestions. The substantive 1992 amendments to section 4 of the FPLA
repeatedly make reference to ``the SI metric system,'' and the Commission in its amendments is merely adopting the
statutory language. While the comments offer other acceptable means of expressing metric terms, the Commission
believes its amendments must be consistent with the statutory language. The rules do not require that labels use the
term ``SI metric'' or any other name for the measurement system. The rules only require the disclosure of the contents
using the units of the SI metric system and the customary inch/pound system.

Subsection (k) is new and defines the term ``customary inch/pound,'' which is used in the 1992 metric amendments to
section 4(a)(2) of FPLA (15 U.S.C. 1453) and throughout the proposed amendments to the regulations. One comment addressed
this matter. NIST wrote: ``the term `customary inch/pound' should not be used as a compound adjective (e.g., customary
inch/pound system or customary inch/pound statement). Both terms are independent descriptors for the collection
of measurement units we currently use in the United States and their use together is confusing.''

14

 The Commission has decided not to accept this suggestion. Congress in amending the FPLA in 1992 used the term ``the
customary inch/pound system of measure.'' The Commission intends to be consistent with the statutory terminology.

Subsection (l) is new and defines the term ```e' mark.'' This is a certification mark used in the European Community
(EC) to establish that the package is appropriately filled in accordance with EC standards. The term is defined because
the amendments to section 500.6 (Net Quantity of Contents) allow the term to be used in addition to the mandated content
quantity disclosure. Failure to allow the use of the mark could be an impediment to American companies selling in the
EC.
