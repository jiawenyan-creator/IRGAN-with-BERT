FT  10 DEC 92 / Arts: Thom Gunn wins the Forward Prize - Poetry
This week the largest prize for poetry ever to be awarded in the UK - Pounds
10,000 - was given to Thom Gunn for his poem 'Lament', one of a sequence of
elegies to friends who died of AIDS that conclude his fine new book, The Man
with Night Sweats (Faber, Pounds 5.99 and Pounds 11.99). The Prize was
awarded for an individual poem, but the judges also decided to honour the
book as a whole, in the manner of the the Booker and the Whitbread awards
(in the past, poetry prizes have been awarded to single poems published
ephemerally in a newspaper or a magazine).
The Forward Prize is the idea of William Sieghart of Forward Publishing, and
it was directly modelled on the annual Guinness anthologies of poetry that
were published in the 1950s. At the prizegiving Sieghart said that his aim
was to 'bring poetry out of poetry corner'.
To give the prize to Thom Gunn was an excellent decision for two reasons.
In the first place, The Man with Night Sweats is the best collection of
poetry to have been published in the last 12 months. Second, Gunn is
acknowledged as a poet of unusual power in a career that has spanned almost
four decades - ever since those heady post-Cambridge days of the early
1950s, when he and EJ ('Ted') Hughes seemed to be the finest poets writing
in England - means that the award is likely to attract the maximum amount of
publicity.
Gunn's subject in The Man with Night Sweats, AIDS, is one of the great
tragic themes of our time. His control and precision are reminiscent of the
masters of the 18th century. The subject has profoundly shocked him, living
as he does at the heart of San Francisco's gay community.
The judges' selection of the best poems of the year have been collected in
the new Forward Book of Poetry (Pounds 5.95, Forward Publishing), copies of
which will be distributed free to every school in the UK thanks to the
sponsorship of the Midland Bank.
