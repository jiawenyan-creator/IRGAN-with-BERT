SHOCK OF LAKER FANS OVERCOME BY WONDER: WHERE TO PLACE BLAME 
How ironic that Pat Riley gets the NBA coach-of-the-year award right before his 
coaching (or lack thereof) contributed greatly to the Lakers' downfall against 
Phoenix. 
Example A: Games 1 and 3 are lost because Riley double-teams Kevin Johnson with 
the men who are guarding Tom Chambers and Jeff Hornacek. 
Solution: Double-team Johnson with the man guarding Kurt Rambis. Riley finally 
does this in Game 5. What took him so long? 
Example B: Games 4 and 5 are lost because Riley has Byron Scott "guarding" 
Johnson instead of Cooper. With Cooper on Johnson in the fourth quarter, the 
Lakers take a five-point lead. Riley substitutes Scott and puts him on Johnson, 
who scores eight of the Suns' final 14 points. 
I'm a six-year season-ticket holder whose seats were just converted to Senate 
Seats next year with a raise in price from $14.50 to $60 per game. I'm more 
upset about Riley's defense than the 400% increase in ticket price.
