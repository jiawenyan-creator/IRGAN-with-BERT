  [Text] The second election assembly of the Democratic 
Alliance of Vojvodina Croats [Demokratska Zajednica 
Vojvodjanskih Hrvata -- DZVH] was held in Subotica this 
afternoon. Bela Tonkovic was reelected the party president with 
a majority of votes. Zvonimir Nesic from Petrovaradin, and 
Stanka Kujundzic and Lazo Vojnic-Hajduk from Subotica were 
elected deputy presidents. 
  The DZVH will continue its struggle for cultural autonomy 
through democratic means, and not only for the cultural autonomy 
of Vojvodina Croats, but also for all members of the Croat 
people who live in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it was 
concluded today at the assembly of Vojvodina Croats. The main 
objective is to stay and survive in the areas where the Croats 
have lived for centuries. 
  With the reelection of Bela Tonkovic as the party president, 
the DZVH assembly opted for continuity in its work. The DZVH 
has established itself at home and abroad as the only legitimate 
representative of the Croat people in Serbia, so sooner or later 
even Belgrade will have to accept it as a partner in talks, it 
was said at today's assembly in Subotica. 
  In his acceptance address, Bela Tonkovic called on all 
Croats 
who live between Subotica and Boka Kotorska to unite even more 
than before in order to join forces in their struggle for human 
and national rights which belong to them by all international 
norms. 
  Other members of the presidency and council of the DZVH were 
also elected today.
