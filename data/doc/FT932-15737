FT  10 APR 93 / Letter: Defer to the text for proof of Duncan's saintliness
Sir, Malcolm Rutherford asks (Arts: 'Macbeth with no scruples', April 3) why
English producers accept Duncan as 'someone close to sainthood'. He suggests
that it could be due to a 'curious act of national deference'.
What about a respect for Shakespeare's text? After all, Macbeth tells us:
'. . .this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off.'
One can only pity any actor who had to deliver these lines after a scene in
which the old King mimed 'a pass at Lady Macbeth' - as suggested by your
critic.
