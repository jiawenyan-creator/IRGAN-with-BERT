FT  14 FEB 94 / International Company News: Advance by Pacific Dunlop
Pacific Dunlop, the large diversified Australian industrial group, has
reported a 24.5 per cent increase in first-half profits after tax but before
abnormal items, to ADollars 150.5m (USDollars 107.8m), thanks to a strong
performance in most of its divisions.
Sales for the six months to end-December rose by 9.2 per cent to ADollars
3.5bn.
Abnormal items had no impact on the 1993 period but did dent profits
slightly in the previous year. After abnormal items, net profits increased
by 25.5 per cent. Earnings per share, at 14.4 cents, rose by 21 per cent.
Pacific, which is based in Melbourne, said the resurgence in the US car
industry had greatly helped its GNB Battery Technologies division.
The company's South Pacific Tyres business - a joint venture with Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber - also contributed strongly to results, as a result of
productivity gains and higher sales.
The clothing, footwear and sporting goods businesses benefited from the
upturn in Christmas trading.
