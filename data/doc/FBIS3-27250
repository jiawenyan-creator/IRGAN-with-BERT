  [Text] Hefei, February 19 (XINHUA) -- Tens of thousands of 
surplus rural laborers in East China's Anhui Province are being 
sent to work in coastal areas in a planned way soon after the 
spring festival, the traditional Chinese New Year earlier this 
month. 
  One of China's agricultural areas, the economically backward 
Anhui Province has more than 12 million surplus rural laborers. 
  "To help these farmers find new jobs is one way to help lift 
them to a well-off life," said a provincial official in charge 
of rural economic development. 
  Encouraged by the provincial government, all village 
committees, local governments and labor service departments have 
singed contacts with enterprises and organizations outside the 
province before sending surplus laborers. 
  A survey shows that more than 500,000 rural people from the 
province worked across the country last year. Many of them had 
received technical training before going out to their new jobs.
