P.M. BRIEFING; 
GLOBAL NUCLEAR SAFETY GROUP FORMS 
Leading nuclear power operators today formed a worldwide organization designed 
to prevent nuclear accidents and improve their industry's public image. 
Organizers said nearly all 150 authorities operating nuclear plants in 31 
countries had gathered in Moscow to sign the charter of the World Assn. of 
Nuclear Operators. 
"The world would be a better place if we, the utilities, had set up this school 
in earlier years," Lord Marshall, chairman of Britain's Central Electricity 
Generating Board, told the meeting's opening session. "It is sad that we have 
needed accidents to persuade us of the necessity of it, but we are now 
persuaded." 
The association will operate from Moscow, Paris, Tokyo and Atlanta. A small 
coordinating center is to be set up in London.
