  [Text] Port Elizabeth March 22 SAPA -- The point of no 
return had been reached and the election must now take place 
without the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], State President F W de 
Klerk said on Tuesday [22 March]. Outlining his most recent 
approach to IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, he told a press 
conference in Port Elizabeth he had mooted the possibility of 
the IFP contesting the election in the kwaZulu/Natal region. 
  By not fighting the national election, the IFP could still 
register its opposition to the interim constitution. The IFP had 
rejected his suggestion, Mr de Klerk said. "The point of no 
return has been reached. The matter must be settled 
democratically in the election." 
  Contingency arrangements were in place if violence erupted 
in 
kwaZulu, but he said there was no plan to destabilise the 
territory. 
  Asked if the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] might take 
over the kwaZulu administration, Mr de Klerk replied: "The TEC 
as such is having trouble administering itself." 
  He added: "The government retains the duty to see that there 
will be good governance throughout the republic."
