FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Boeing income hit by sales drop
Continuing weakness in the world market for new airliners resulted in a 10
per cent fall in net income to Dollars 292m from Dollars 325m for Boeing,
the US aircraft maker, in the first quarter.
Commercial jet deliveries fell to 82 from 93 last time while turnover
dropped to Dollars 6.35bn from Dollars 6.64bn. Earnings per share were down
to 86 cents from 96 cents.
Boeing warned last quarter that overcapacity in the world airline industry
would cause deliveries of its aircraft to fall to between 250 and 260 this
year from 330 last year. It said sales were expected to fall to between
Dollars 20bn and Dollars 21bn from last year's Dollars 25.4bn.
Yesterday, the company appeared to be taking a slightly more optimistic view
of the market, saying that deliveries this year were expected to be 'in the
260 range' and sales were expected to be 'in the Dollars 21bn range'.
On the other hand, Boeing added that it was expecting research and
development costs to rise this year because of systems integration and tests
on the new 777 aircraft and because of commercial development of the
extended range version of the 777, the 737-700, and the freighter version of
the 767.
The company also noted that reduced levels of new investment in facilities
and equipment meant it would be unable to capitalise as much debt interest
this year as it did last year.
Following the contract signing with Southwest Airlines for 63 of the 737-700
aircraft, Boeing said, detailed structural design work on the
next-generation 737 aircraft had begun. Sales discussion were taking place
with several domestic and foreign airlines.
