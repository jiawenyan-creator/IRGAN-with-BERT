FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gleeson withstands recession with Pounds
8.2m
MJ GLEESON yesterday became the second family-run, small, quoted
construction company this week to withstand the worst effects of the
recession, reporting pre-tax profits down from Pounds 9.94m to Pounds 8.2m
in the year to June 30.
Earnings per share fell to 57.54p (67.1p). However, using the strong balance
sheet as justification, the board is proposing a maintained final dividend
of 9.4p giving a same-again total of 12.75p.
'We have never become over exposed in any one area,' said Mr Colin McLellan,
finance director. 'We have tended, in good years, to invest money in land
and commercial property in a small way. We have never got involved in huge
schemes.'
On Monday, Henry Boot, the Sheffield-based construction and property
company, announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 2.35m.
Gleeson said prospects for the UK construction industry were poor, although
the housebuilding division had experienced an improvement in sales during
the past half year.
Turnover fell to Pounds 168m (Pounds 183.1m) as building, contracting and
civil engineering declined. 'There was a lot of competition and not enough
work,' said Mr McLellan.
A decline in gross profit to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 18m) was not offset by
higher rental income of Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 4.6m). The company said it had
let more properties.
Although cash balances rose from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 16.1m over the year,
interest received fell to Pounds 831,000 (Pounds 1.72m) as rates fell.
Interest payments fell to Pounds 58,000 (Pounds 326,000) the company having
redeemed Pounds 2.8m in loan notes issued at the time of the 1991
acquisition of Colroy, the housebuilder. The cash was generated by rental
income and the selling of more land than it bought in its housebuilding
division.
'Work in progress went down by about Pounds 3m. We are keen to buy more land
but land prices seem to us to be rising faster than house prices,' said Mr
McLellan.
The company said planned spending on housing land and investment property
meant that bank balances were unlikely to be sustained at year end levels.
