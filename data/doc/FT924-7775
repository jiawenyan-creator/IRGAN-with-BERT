FT  14 NOV 92 / Industry welcomes Italian rate cut
INDUSTRIAL leaders in Italy yesterday welcomed the move by commercial banks
to cut prime rates by 1 percentage point on Monday following the one-point
cut in the discount rate on Thursday. .
Industry has been pressing the banks to lower the punitively high cost of
borrowing. The new prime rate will be 14.5 per cent with a top rate of
around 21 per cent.
Mr Luigi Abete, head of Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation,
said he wanted banks to lower their rates by a further 3.5 percentage points
to ease the burden on industry. The banks have been criticised for holding
interest rates high with large spreads in order to recoup losses sustained
through the falling value of Italian state paper in their portfolios.
The prospect of falling interest rates also boosted share prices. The Milan
bourse yesterday rose 2.3 per cent, with a heavy volume of trading compared
to recent weeks.
This was the second interest rate adjustment since the turbulence on
currency markets in September which forced the Bank of Italy to raise the
discount rate to 15 per cent, the highest level since 1985. Thursday's move
followed Senate approval of new taxes and spending cuts in the 1993 budget.
The latter included the controversial minimum tax on Italy's 6.1m
self-employed, effectively doubling the base of their taxable income.
Deputies in the four-party ruling coalition backed the minimum tax, which
has provoked countrywide protests, on the understanding it is replaced in
1994.
Parliament has now approved measures to raise L66,000bn (Pounds 32bn) of the
L93,000 projected in new taxes and spending cuts in the 1993 budget. The
Bank of Italy's previous cut in the discount rate on October 26 followed
parliamentary approval for reforms of pensions, health, the civil service
and local government.
