FT  12 JAN 94 / Observer: Loch, stock and barrel
John Major is not alone in having problems with his 'Back to Basics' policy.
Reg Brealey, probably best known for being the first Briton acquitted of
insider dealing, faces a similar problem.
Brealey says that he, not Major, first thought up 'Back to Basics' as a
motto for his latest venture - giving disadvantaged youngsters a fresh start
in life by sending them on a training scheme on west Scotland's Knoydart
peninsula. After being knocked into shape, Brealey's young chaps will enjoy
a spot of Far Eastern travel, plus the chance of a bit of work experience in
one of the Indian jute mills run by Brealey's Titaghur group. Titaghur
bought a big chunk of Knoydart last year.
In his annual report Brealey says he can undercut the official cost of
youngsters in care by 50 per cent. As he still has to win the hearts and
minds of the 53 residents of Knoydart - some seem a mite unwilling to
welcome underprivileged teenagers into their backyard - that is neither here
nor there.
Brealey acknowledges that Titaghur's shareholders, who have been without a
proper share quote for more than three years, may question the wisdom of his
latest diversification, though he solicits their patience.
Meanwhile, he hopes Titaghur's shares will soon be listed on Nasdaq.
Yesterday, no one at Nasdaq's London office had heard of Titaghur.
