SIKHS KILL 36 IN WAKE OF 2 EXECUTIONS 
Sikhs waging a separatist war in Punjab killed 36 people, hanging four in 
revenge for the executions of two Sikhs convicted in the assassination of Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi, police said Thursday. 
The latest deaths bring the number of people killed in Punjab so far this year 
to more than 90. At least 2,400 people were killed in 1988. 
The two Sikhs, Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, were hanged Jan. 6 in New Delhi 
for the murder of Gandhi, who was shot down Oct. 31, 1984, by Sikh members of 
her personal bodyguard. 
Police superintendent Govind Ram said the headman of Bhujiawali village and his 
three brothers, all Hindus, were kidnaped Wednesday night by five Sikhs and 
found hanging from trees the next morning. He said a note claimed 
responsibility for a Sikh militia. 
Others killed Thursday were a Hindu couple and their two daughters and another 
Hindu couple; Sikh farmer Fakir Singh, his son and nephew, and seven others 
killed in separate attacks. 
Police in Chandigarh, the state capital, said 16 more people were reported 
killed Wednesday night.
