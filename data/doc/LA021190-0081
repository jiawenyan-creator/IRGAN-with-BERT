OUTTAKES: BOY MEETS GRAIL 
Robin Williams and director Terry Gilliam are reteaming -- this time, for a 
drama. 
Williams -- who went uncredited for his depiction of the Moon King in Gilliam's 
fantasy, "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" -- will star in "The Fisher 
King." 
He'll play a radio-show personality whose career and life take nose-dives. Down 
and out on the streets of New York, he encounters some street people who lead 
him on a personal quest. The title refers to a character who figures in the 
legend of the Holy Grail. 
Scripted by Richard Lagravanese, "The Fisher King" will be produced by Debra 
Hill and Lynda Obst for Tri-Star. 
Filming's set to begin in May on a $20-25 million budget, according to a 
project insider -- relatively modest, compared to Gilliam's notable 
budget-buster, "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen." Pat H. Broeske
