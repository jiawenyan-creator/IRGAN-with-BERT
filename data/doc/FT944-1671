FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Poll taken at Wellcome AGM
A revolt by small shareholders at Wellcome's annual meeting forced the
company to hold a poll on a special resolution.
The results of the poll showed a big majority in favour of the resolution,
thanks to the weight of institutional shareholdings.
The shareholders rebelled against a plan to renew the company's right to
issue new shares - up to 5 per cent of the issued capital - for cash,
without offering all shareholders the opportunity to avoid dilution by
buying some of the newly issued stock.
Such resolutions are not uncommon. They allow management some flexibility in
corporate deals, for example to offer shares to a prospective business
partner.
Two shareholders spoke against the motion and enough voted against it to
make it unclear whether the required 75 per cent majority had been secured.
A poll resulted in a 99.37 per cent vote in favour.
