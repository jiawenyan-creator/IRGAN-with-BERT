FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Century Inns makes Pounds 4.7m in first
year of trading
Century Inns, the pubs operator, recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m on
turnover of Pounds 19.8m for the 12 months to end-September, its first full
year of trading.
The outcome compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2.1m
before exceptional start-up costs) in the previous 10-month period, on
turnover of Pounds 13.1m.
Operating profit for the period under review was Pounds 8m, compared with
Pounds 4.4m (excluding exceptional items amounting to Pounds 900,000) for
the preceding 10 months.
The company said its performance in its first full year reflected not only
the annualisation effect of purchases during 1992, but also substantial real
growth in earnings.
Mr Alistair Arkley, chief executive, predicted 'reasonable growth' in
pre-tax profits in the current year.
Century, which now has 301 public houses in Yorkshire and north-east
England, was founded in November 1991 by Mr Arkley, former managing director
of Brent Walker Brewing and Trading, and two senior colleagues.
The three, who between them put in about Pounds 250,000, raised more than
Pounds 60m for their management buy-in from Schroder Ventures, Mezzanine
Management and National Westminster Bank.
The business was launched with the purchase of 185 pubs from Bass. Century,
with headquarters in Billingham, Cleveland, now has assets of Pounds 52.6m.
Mr Arkley said he believed the company could grow to 500 pubs within its
existing management structure.
The anticipated sale of Scottish &amp; Newcastle pubs, following its purchase of
GrandMet's Chef &amp; Brewer chain, may give Century a chance to grow, he said.
Century Inns would this year start laying the administrative groundwork for
flotation, he added.
