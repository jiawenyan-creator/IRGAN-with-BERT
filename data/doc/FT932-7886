FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind pressed on Swan Hunter
ALL FIVE Tyne and Wear local authorities yesterday asked Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
the defence secretary, for an assurance that the Swan Hunter shipyard would
be allowed to complete work on three frigates.
The leaders of the councils said they would not enter into talks about the
government's proposed enterprise zone if the shipyard closed with the loss
of 2,200 jobs.
The yard's receivers are to meet union officials today and are expected to
put forward a plan for redundancies.
The councils said Swan Hunter was 'at the heart of the north's economy and
its loss would be simply devastating to the whole of the north-east'.
Completion work on the Type-23 frigates Westminster, Northumberland and
Richmond would keep Swan Hunter going into next year and ensure continuing
employment for a significant part of the workforce. It would also provide
more time to find a new owner for the yard.
The only definite result so far from talks between the receivers and the
Ministry of Defence is that the yard can continue working at least up to the
end of next week.
Unions are poised to take a tough stance if the yard is forced to close
after this and if attempts are made to complete the frigates elsewhere.
Union conveners from shipyards throughout the country are to meet in
Carlisle tomorrow to discuss a call for Swan Hunter workers to resist
efforts to move the frigates and for workers at other yards to refuse to
complete them.
Mr Stephen Byers, the Labour MP whose Wallsend constituency takes in the
shipyard, said he had been told Swan Hunter creditors and local banks had
already lined up receivers to move into companies owed money.
He said the 'fall-out' from the Swan Hunter crisis would be devastating for
the whole north-east England economy.
'Within the next two weeks we shall witness the spectacle of further
companies going under in the wake of the collapse of Swan Hunter.'
