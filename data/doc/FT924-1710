FT  17 DEC 92 / Ireland parties in coalition talks
IRELAND'S Fianna Fail and Labour parties yesterday began exploring the
possibility of forming a coalition government, following parliament's
failure on Monday to elect a new prime minister, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
Leaders of both parties disagree about who should lead such a coalition,
however. Since the general election three weeks ago in which no party
emerged with a clear Dail majority, the three main opposition parties, Fine
Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats, were considered to be the most
likely to form the new government.
Labour's insistence that there should be a centre-left policy programme and
that its leader, Mr Dick Spring, should be prime minister, has been rejected
both by Fianna Fail and by the main opposition Fine Gael party.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the outgoing prime minister, who now heads a caretaker
minority government, held exploratory meetings with Mr Spring earlier this
week and the two parties have exchanged policy documents.
