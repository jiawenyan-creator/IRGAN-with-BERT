FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: FR edges ahead to Pounds 21.4m
FR GROUP, the aerospace and defence contractor, yesterday reported profits
marginally higher despite a tough year in its commercial components
division.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 21.4m on sales down
slightly to Pounds 168.4m.
Earnings per share rose from 20.07p to 20.12p and the final dividend is
raised to 4.35p, giving a total of 6.69p (6.37p).
The group was held back by delayed orders from the UK government but the
military systems division performed reasonably well.
Mr Gordon Page, chief executive, said profits had been maintained as a
result of cost cutting, increased productivity and greater management
efficiency.
'Military spending is not going to be abolished and there is increasing
business to be done in the spheres of surveillance, training and air-to-air
refuelling,' he said.
FR Aviation increased sales and profits, winning contracts with the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries to provide surveillance of UK waters and with
the Ministry of Defence to continue target towing services.
FR's Mk32 air-to-air refuelling pod is now in production for the Royal Air
Force VC10 and the company is negotiating to supply a variant to the US Air
Force.
Flight refuelling, unmanned targets and special flying services now account
for about half of group sales and profits.
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 7.8m, up from Pounds 5.8m
but net interest earned fell Pounds 800,000.
