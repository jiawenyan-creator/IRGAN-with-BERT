FT  12 JAN 93 / Letter: BBC World Service - objective facts and no
sensationalism
Sir, May I endorse P H Ball's sentiments from the Netherlands (Letters,
January 8). By far the best radio programme is the BBC World Service -
listened to and respected by more people in the world than any other on
short wave.
The next best English language programme is surely long-wave Radio 4. It is
heard in many countries, from Norway through much of the EC to Ireland, a
catchment area of up to 300m people. I once heard the budget speech from the
Commons quite audibly at the Algarve, south coast of Portugal, on Radio 4
via a battery portable.
These two programmes must do much to present the UK point of view - a
valuable public service exercise on which to spend part of the licence fee
or household tax. Many of us (insomniacs, workers, drivers) listen to the
World Service through the night - the BBC could save (or spend) money
cost-effectively by broadcasting the World Service by day on an easily
received, all-UK frequency, instead of another news pro-gramme.
Let us have a broadcast source of objective facts, to match the FT in print,
rather than dramatised 'doom and gloom' sensationalism.
