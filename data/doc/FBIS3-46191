  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
National Committee for Young Pioneer Work has launched a 
"Transcentury Fledgling Eagle Movement" across the country, 
aimed at fostering a sense of ambition and development among 
youngsters and training them in skills so as to improve their 
quality as a whole. 
  The programs of the movement include the "Planet Venus 
Scientific and Technological Activities", "Self-Study and 
Practice", "Hand-in- Hand Mutual Help" and "One Hundred Flowers 
Cultural and Arts Activities". 
  Youngsters will be organized to do scientific and 
technological research and make inventions. In the self-study 
activities, they will be taught how to overcome difficulties, 
take care of themselves and make unremitting efforts to improve 
themselves. 
  In the hand-in-hand activities, they will be trained to have 
the sense of co-operating with and helping each other. In the 
"One Hundred Flowers" activities they will be encouraged and 
trained to engage in cultural and arts practices. 
  Through the movement, a committee official said, youngsters, 
who will be the main force of social and economic development in 
the next century, are expected to be prepared to endure 
hardships for the people and delight in serving the people.
