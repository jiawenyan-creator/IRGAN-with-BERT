FT  04 JAN 93 / People: Lex headhunts NEDs
Lex Service, the car-retailing and leasing group, has been taking the
Cadbury recommendations seriously, and for the first time employed a firm of
headhunters in its search for two non-executive directors who, in the words
of Lex chairman and chief executive Sir Trevor Chinn, possessed a 'practical
approach to making change occur in large organisations'.
Eight years after the last non-executive appointment, Lex has picked Bill
Cockburn, the 49-year-old chief executive of the Post Office, and Michael
Ost, 48, who is chief executive of industrial holding company McKechnie.
Neither had met Sir Trevor before the search began, and Ost says he knew
next to nothing about the company either. For both men it is their first
outside directorship of a public company.
'The game is changing,' says Cockburn. 'There used to be this notion that
the chairman would ring up his chums and people would appear like
ornaments.' Not fancying just being an ornament, Cockburn, who stepped into
the top seat at the Post Office two months ago to preside over a 200,000
strong workforce and annual sales in excess of Pounds 5bn, adds: 'Lex may
have fewer noughts on some of its numbers than we do, but in its field it is
one of the biggest, and the management challenge is just as great.'
Working hard to promote a committed service culture at the Post Office, he
explains how interested he is in Sir Trevor's ideas about taking Lex's own
service culture to new levels. 'This quality issue is not just smarm and
schmaltz. There is of course a strong commercial drive.'
He was also impressed with the six-month long search which was 'as thorough
as for a full-time appointment, as far as I could tell. This signalled to me
the company was taking it all seriously.'
Ost, who says his board had agreed it would be of benefit all round if he
took one - and only one - outside directorship in an entirely non-competing
area - has spent 18 years living and working outside the UK, for a variety
of companies including United Technologies Corporation and Singer.
