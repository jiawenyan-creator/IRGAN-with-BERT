COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
AUBURN UPSETS NO. 16 LSU AS OPTIONS RUN OUT, BUT NOT TIME 
By the time the ball got to John Caylor in the right corner, Auburn's options 
had run out. 
But as things turned out, it really didn't matter. 
Caylor made a three-point shot with just under seven seconds remaining to give 
the Tigers their only lead in the game, one that gave them a 78-76 upset 
victory over 16th-ranked Louisiana State in the quarterfinals of the 
Southeastern Conference tournament at Orlando, Fla. 
Caylor was the third option, with Auburn wanting to go first to Ronnie Battle 
or Derrick Dennison outside, then Caylor inside. 
"There was nobody (open) so I just shot it up," Caylor said. 
"It's the one I wanted because it went in," Auburn Coach Tommy Joe Eagles said. 
"I didn't want another." 
LSU, which lost a five-point lead in the final 50 seconds, hustled to get an 
off-balance shot by Chris Jackson at the buzzer that was short. Jackson scored 
28 points. 
Caylor's game-winner capped a comeback from a 15-point first-half deficit for 
the Tigers (13-17). 
Reggie Gallon made two free throws with 41 seconds left and Dennison, who 
finished with 34 points, stole the inbounds pass and made a layup to cut the 
lead to 76-75 with 39 seconds to play. 
LSU (22-8) turned it over again on the inbounds pass and Auburn had possession 
with just under 34 seconds remaining, running the clock down to Caylor's shot. 
Auburn plays Alabama in the semifinals of the SEC tournament today. The Crimson 
Tide beat Mississippi State, 59-44. 
Vanderbilt 78, No. 25 Georgia 74 -- Scott Draud scored four of his 14 points in 
the final 39 seconds of overtime to help the Commodores upset the Bulldogs in 
an SEC quarterfinal game. 
The Commodores (16-13), who made 32 of 39 free throws, will play Mississippi in 
today's semifinals. 
Vanderbilt (16-13) never trailed in the extra period, which was forced by 
Marshall Wilson's short jumper with eight seconds left in regulation to lift 
Georgia (20-8) into a 63-63 tie. 
Mississippi 87, Tennessee 86 -- Joe Harvell made three free throws in the final 
minute to help the Rebels hold off the Volunteers after they nearly squandered 
an 18-point lead in an SEC quarterfinal game. 
Mississippi (12-16), which split two regular-season games with Tennessee 
(15-13), used a 35-14 run to open an 18-point lead late in the first half, then 
spent the next 25 minutes fighting off the Vols.

17th-ranked and top-seeded Clemson.

remaining in regulation when Scott Williams tapped in a miss by King Rice with 
five seconds left. The basket came after Bryant Stith, who led the Cavaliers 
with 32 points and 11 rebounds, was called for charging with 35 seconds left. 
Virginia had a chance to win in regulation, but Williams blocked a 15-foot 
jumper by John Crotty as time ran out. 
No. 17 Clemson 79, Wake Forest 70 -- David Young scored the final six points 
for the Tigers to help them get their first opening-round victory in the ACC 
tournament in a decade. 
Clemson (24-7), which earned the tournament's top seed after winning its first 
regular-season ACC title, had a 26-point lead in the first half and led by 16 
early in the second half. 
But the Demon Deacons (12-16) cut the lead to three points in the last two 
minutes. 
Young made a three-point shot -- his only basket of the game -- with 1:15 left 
to give the Tigers a 74-68 lead. He then made the front end of a one-and-one 
with 55 seconds to play and two foul shots with 15 seconds left. 
No. 12 Duke 104, Maryland 84 -- Phil Henderson scored 24 points and Bobby 
Hurley keyed an early second-half rally as the Blue Devils routed the Terrapins

stayed that way for the duration. The Terrapins (18-13) had just three baskets 
in the first nine minutes of the second half, and Hurley led a run that put 
Duke (24-7) ahead and into today's semifinals against Georgia Tech.
