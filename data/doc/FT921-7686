FT  21 FEB 92 / Terror of taxmen strikes Argentina
THEY are called the 'untouchables'. They attack unpredictably, hunting in
packs. Argentina's tax inspectors are striking terror into the hearts of
businesses great and small.
The 'untouchables' have been busy for over a year, in a tough campaign
against tax evasion. But they only really entered the limelight when
inflation in January lurched out of control, leaping to 3 per cent from 0.6
per cent in December. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, blamed the
retail and service sectors and unleashed the 'untouchables' in the hope of
halting index-linking, which he saw as mortal threat to his anti-inflation
policies.
Since then, there has been no stopping them. In Buenos Aires, they are
closing down over 10 businesses a day, taping bright red seals across the
doors of alleged tax evaders. The increasing risk of detection and the
considerable costs - offenders face one to three days' closure and heavy
fines - has prompted companies to come clean in unprecedented numbers. Above
all, the seals are blatant warning of the costs of raising prices.
The tax department was once a standing joke. Inspectors were notoriously
inept. Tax dodging reached such extraordinary proportions that the World
Bank reported that in 1988 corporate and individual income taxes accounted
for just 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
When Mr Cavallo took office in January 1991, he saw tax evasion as one of
the root causes of Argentina's economic malaise. He claims to have run a
Dollars 200m (Pounds 114.2m) budget surplus in 1991, and plans to raise
current revenues by 20 per cent to a forecast Dollars 35bn in 1992.
