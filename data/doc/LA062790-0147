GRAND JURY HEARS POINDEXTER 
Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter appeared today before a 
federal grand jury that was recently impaneled to continue investigating the 
Iran-Contra scandal. 
Poindexter, who was sentenced June 11 to six months in prison for lying to 
Congress about the Iran-Contra affair and obstructing inquiries of 
congressional committees, testified behind closed doors at the U.S. Courthouse. 
A prosecutor from the office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh 
accompanied Poindexter into the grand jury room. 
The grand jury, which has already heard testimony from former National Security 
Council aide Oliver L. North, is expected to try to perform a final assessment 
of the degree of knowledge that President Ronald Reagan and then-Vice President 
George Bush had of the affair.
