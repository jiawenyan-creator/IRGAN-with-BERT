FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Exploration costs cut Monument Oil
MONUMENT OIL and Gas, the exploration and production company, reported an
after-tax profit of Pounds 4.1m for the 12 months to December 31, down from
Pounds 6.5m in 1991, as it continued to fund high exploration costs and
pre-development work on the Liverpool Bay project.
The company has secured Pounds 10m in debt funding for pre-development work
on the Liverpool Bay oil and gas fields which are estimated to contain
1,000bn cu ft of gas and 200m barrels of oil. The development is dependent
on construction by PowerGen of the Connah's Quay power station in Clwyd
which has been delayed by the government's energy review.
Mr Tony Craven-Walker, chief executive, said that further delays affecting
the project, 'will act as a disincentive for future investment in energy
related projects with accompanying loss of jobs.'
Turnover improved slightly to Pounds 38.8m (Pounds 38.6m). Earnings per
share slipped from 0.99p to 0.62p.
