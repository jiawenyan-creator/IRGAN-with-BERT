-- The 25 members of the Haitian national soccer team who have 
requested political asylum in the United States, which was 
subsequently denied, threatened to carry out a mass suicide 
today. 
  After being eliminated from the Shell Cup taking place in 
this capital city, the Caribbean soccer players decided not to 
return to their country, considering the embattled situation 
there. 
  According to their threat, the mass suicide would take place 
in front of the U.S. Embassy in this city. The embassy decided 
not to grant a visa to any of the athletes who are stranded in 
Trinidad and Tobago. 
  "If we return to our country, we will be risking our lives; 
that is why we would rather immolate ourselves now instead of 
returning. The United States must help us," said Earns 
Jean-Baptiste, spokesman for the soccer group.
