  [Text] The commissioner of police, Shedrach Kiruki, refuted 
reports in yesterday's DAILY NATION, which alleged that the 
general service unit and the regular police fired in the air and 
sealed off the biggest polling station in Lumakanda for 30 
minutes. A statement to Kenya Broadcasting Corporation from 
police headquarters clarified that there was no explosion in the 
township as alleged by some FORD [Forum for the Restoration of 
Democracy]-Kenya officials. Police investigations further 
confirmed to members of the public, FORD-Kenya officials and the 
press that a government vehicle was backfiring and misfiring. 
The commissioner of police described the report as malicious 
and meant to tarnish the good name of the police force.
