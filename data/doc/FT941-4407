FT  11 MAR 94 / People: Promotions at Barings
A younger generation is stepping into power at Barings, parent of London's
oldest merchant bank. Peter Norris, 39, has been made chief executive of the
newly formed investment banking group which has been created by the
combination of Baring Brothers, the traditional merchant bank, with the
group's fast growing broking operation, Baring Securities.
Peter is the younger brother of Andrew Norris, 41, who has recently been
appointed joint head of equity capital markets in New York. He joined
Barings in 1976 and is unusual in that he left the firm in 1984 to spend
three years as a vice president of Goldman Sachs International.
He was rehired by Barings in 1987 and worked in Hong Kong for five years
before being put in charge of Barings Securities in the wake of last year's
problems.
Baring Securities profits have recovered strongly and investment banking
accounted for more than two thirds of Barings' total profits.
Following last year's sudden departure of Baring Securities' chairman
Christopher Heath, who was once Britain's highest paid employee, Barings has
made several management changes and it's clear that Peter Norris, who
recently joined the main board, has been rewarded for turning round the
fortunes of Baring Securities.
Andrew Tuckey, 50, deputy chairman of Barings plc, the group holding
company, has been appointed chairman of the new investment banking group.
Barings has also reorganised the management of Baring Asset Management whose
funds under management rose 42 per cent to Pounds 31.5bn last year.
John Bolsover, 46, remains chief executive, but Martin Shaw, 52, has been
made managing director of the institutional side of the business and Peter
Walsh, 48, has been given charge of the non-institutional sub-group.
Meanwhile, John Ashburton and Nicholas Baring, two former executive
directors, are retiring from the board after the annual general meeting.
