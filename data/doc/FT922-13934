FT  09 APR 92 / Tokyo fall worries fund managers worldwide
THE fall in the Tokyo stock market is worrying fund managers around the
world. The anxiety, they say, goes beyond concern for the value of the
relatively small portion of UK and European portfolios in Japan.
The average UK pension fund manager has about 5 per cent of investments in
Tokyo, while life insurance companies have 3 per cent to 4 per cent there.
Mr Dick Barfield, chief investment officer at Standard Life, one of the UK's
largest insurance companies, said investors were painfully aware of the
extent to which Japanese banks were equity investors.
'The question is whether there is a knock-on effect for the banking system,'
Mr Barfield said. If banks have to liquidate holdings of other assets around
the world, it could send bond, share and property prices plummeting.
For some time now, Japanese banks have been less enthusiastic lenders
abroad, he said, a reflection of their own increasing concern about loan
losses.
Ms Caroline Burton, investment director at GRE Asset Management, said a big
recession in Japan would mean recovery in other countries could be delayed.
Significantly depressed share prices in Tokyo might spur her to shift out of
equities and into bonds.
Other fund managers urge caution about interpreting the sell-offs in Tokyo
in recent days. 'They tend to be clumsy sellers,' said Mr Leslie Robb,
investment chief at Scottish Widows, the UK life insurer. A drop in prices
on the French bourse yesterday is likely to be viewed as a buying
opportunity by continental institutions. Meanwhile, Mr Robb said the biggest
risk posed by Japanese lenders was to the US stock markets.
While the Japanese have invested more in US Treasuries than in equities, any
move away from the US, given the burgeoning budget deficit, could choke off
recovery there.
