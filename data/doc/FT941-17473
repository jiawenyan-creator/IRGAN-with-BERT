FT  04 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Renault - Other companies
On Thursday the French state-owned car group will announce details of its
commercial performance for 1993. This will include the volume of the
company's sales, an analysis of its share of international markets and plans
for the launch of new products.
Like other European car manufacturers, Renault is expected to report a sharp
fall in sales. But the success of new models, such as the Twingo small car,
should see the French car group maintain its share of the European car
market at about 10.5 per cent.
Renault's ability to remain profitable despite the downturn in its markets
will facilitate its privatisation. The sale of the government's controlling
stake is due to take place in the second half of this year despite the
failure of the planned merger with Volvo.
