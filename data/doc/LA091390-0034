"The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No rating. 
 This ghost story will give you sweaty palms, high blood pressure, just about 
everything a scary movie should, without benefit of fake decapitations and 
gallons of fake blood -- just a plot, some chilling sound effects and superb 
black-and-white photography. Not to mention a cast headed by Julie Harris and 
Claire Bloom. ERIK HAMILTON
