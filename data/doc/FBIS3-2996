  [Text] Pyongyang, March 16 (XINHUA) -- No progress was 
made in the seventh contact today on the question of exchange of 
special envoys between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) and South Korea. 
  The two-hour closed-door meeting between representatives of 
the two sides was held north of the demarcation line at the 
Panmunjom truce village. 
  Pak Yong-su, head of the DPRK working delegation, said after 
the contact that the two sides failed to bridge their difference 
on the role of the special envoys. 
  South Korea was opposed to the inclusion in the role 
insistence on national independence, pursuit of national unity 
and identification of ways of national reunification, Pak said. 
  He added that the south side was marking time with a view to 
blocking the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks scheduled for March 
21. 
  Pak said that whatever, special envoys should be exchanged 
at 
an early date and DPRK would continue to work for it. 
  The two sides will conduct their eighth contact south of the 
demarcation line at Panmunjom on March 19.
