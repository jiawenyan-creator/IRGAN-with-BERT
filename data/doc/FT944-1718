FT  19 DEC 94 / Arts (Openings): Berlin
'La traviata' is hardly the kind of Christmas show you would expect from the
Komische Operand not just because of its tragic ending. Verdi has never been
much favoured by a company which places more emphasis on brilliant acting
than beautiful singing. Nevertheless, the production which opens on Thursday
has undeniable potential: Yakov Kreizberg conducts, Harry Kupfer produces
and Violetta is sung by the young Noemi Nadelmann.
