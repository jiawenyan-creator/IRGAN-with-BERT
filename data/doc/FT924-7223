FT  17 NOV 92 / Appeal Court bars water claim
CONSUMERS WHO issued writs against South West Water after about 20 tons of
aluminium sulphate was accidentally introduced into drinking water at the
company's treatment works at Camelford, Cornwall, in 1988 were barred by the
Court of Appeal yesterday from claiming 'exemplary and aggravated' damages
in addition to normal personal-injury compensation.
The court allowed the water company's appeal against a High Court judge's
refusal to strike out the additional claims.
The water company admits breach of its statutory duty to supply wholesome
water and agrees it is liable to pay normal compensation. But the 180
claimants want to sue for exemplary and/or aggravated damages. They are to
seek leave to appeal to the Lords.
