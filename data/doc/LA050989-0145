POP MUSIC REVIEW; 
WILLY DEVILLE SHOWS WHAT A SURVIVOR HE IS 
Having toiled in the rock biz since the heyday of the lower-Manhattan music 
scene 13 years ago, and having weathered a messy divorce, messier managerial 
problems and a long battle with drugs, there's no question that Willy DeVille 
is a soul survivor. 
What hasn't survived is the soul. 
At the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano Sunday night, backed by a new Mink 
DeVille band (with no familiar faces), he was still singing about the aching 
sadness of failed love -- and thanks to his vocal gifts, you could still feel 
the ache. But these days he casts his tales as airy ballads or remarkably 
feisty rock romps. The R&amp;B -- especially the swaggering soul -- around 
which he built his career is pretty much gone. 
This is not bad, nor is it very surprising. Two years ago, when he dissolved 
Mink DeVille and recorded the solo album "Miracle" (produced and featuring 
guitar-playing by Dire Straits maestro Mark Knopfler), his intention was to get 
away from the stylized Mink DeVille sound. He felt that he had painted himself 
into a corner with the R&amp;B and soul orientation, the smoky sax and other 
musical elements. 
With his presentation at the Coach House, he was merely staying true to his new 
musical direction. And it worked enormously well. 
He still managed to hurl a few curve balls, though, both sonic and visual. 
Cruising on stage as the band lit into a fairly hoppin', boppin' take on 
"Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac" -- rail thin, occasionally flashing a gold tooth 
from his reptilian face -- he was decked out in some kind of matador jacket, 
leather pants, boots, hoop earrings and poofy black pompadour. We aren't 
exactly talking GQ material here. But we are talking one of the coolest guys in 
rock, and an eminently engaging performer. DeVille smoking a cigarette is more 
interesting than most rockers going through their on-stage gyrations. 
More importantly, clear-eyed and in fine voice, Willy delivered the goods. 
Whether performing tunes from "Miracle" such as "Heart and Soul" -- an 
atmospheric piece with a Latin lilt, over which he sang a naked pledge of 
undying love and devotion -- or re-arranged versions of early classics, Willy 
was on top of his game, investing every word with seemingly heartfelt emotion. 
He still comes across as a romantic who's not only incurable but absolutely not 
interested in being cured. 
He also injected many of the numbers with some stinging guitar licks. On an 
initially unrecognizable rendition of Moon Martin's "Cadillac Walk" (much 
bigger, denser and more booming than Mink DeVille's recorded version), he cut 
loose with some wailing slide guitar. 
It was that kind of night -- full of surprises, mostly pleasant ones. To those 
who openly pine for the Mink DeVille sound and style of yesteryear, Willy would 
probably lean forward, flash a gold-toothed grin and say, "Tough." We'd have to 
agree.
