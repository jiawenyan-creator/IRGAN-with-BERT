  [Excerpt] Accra, 2 Mar (GNA/PANA) -- [passage omitted on 
rioting] Meanwhile, police said three persons were injured 
Tuesday night when a grenade exploded at the yam market in 
Accra, popularly known as "Kokomba market" because the Kokombas 
who are mainly yam farmers are engaged in the supply and 
distribution of the food stuff to that market. They named the 
three, who were described as traders, as Kwaku Sasu and Eric 
Danso, on admission with serious injuries and Joseph Asare, who 
had been treated and discharged. 
  "No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion and no 
one has been arrested. But we believe the incident is a 
spillover of the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in the northern 
region," they said. 
  They said one unexploded grenade was found at the site of 
the 
incident, and that the injured were asleep when the grenade 
exploded. Police said three men in military uniform were seen 
in the market area about the time of the incident and that 
investigations are going on. 
  The National Electoral Commission (NEC) has postponed 
indefinitely the district election slated for 22 March in the 
entire northern region and parts of the Volta and Brong-Ahafo 
regions which experienced a spillover of the conflict.
