Sara Lee Corp.: The firm posted third-quarter profit of $109 million, up 15% 
from the year-ago period. 
Sales totaled $2.8 billion, down slightly from the 1989 quarter. The Chicago 
firm, which markets a variety of brand name products including Hanes underwear, 
L'eggs hosiery, Hillshire Farm and Jimmy Dean meats in addition to its baked 
goods, attributed the results to weak sales of packaged meats and bakery 
products. However, this was offset by gains from its coffee and grocery 
division and packaged consumer products division.
