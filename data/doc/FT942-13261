FT  26 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Options that can inspire failure
Sir, We would go further than Mr Nigel Dyckhoff (Letters, April 21) in
condemning stock options as passe. It is demonstrable from our surveys that
they have been a far from constructive force. We see a clear tendency for
shareholder value to be enhanced when executives own shares which they have
purchased. Stock options, on the other hand, with their inbuilt 'can't lose'
characteristic, can be argued to have inspired a number of unsuccessful
acquisitions in the 1980s. Options have led to a relatively painless
consequence for executives whose strategic gambles have failed, but a severe
one for shareholders. In fact, to rub salt into shareholders' wounds,
failure has frequently been handsomely rewarded.
Perhaps we need to see a higher number of chief executives with a higher
equity/salary ratio, so that they are gambling to a greater degree with
their own money. It is rare to see a successful private business
diversifying and that is perhaps a pointer for public company directors.
The route ahead is restricted stock, purchased from earned bonuses or
through loans as Mr Dyckhoff suggests. Gifted stock and large cash bonuses
tend to encourage the 'take the money and run' mentality which the public,
press and institutional investors are finding increasingly objectionable.
