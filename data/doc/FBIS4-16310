  [Text] Vitaliy Yefimov, the Russian Federation's minister 
of trancport, has told RIA that the government of the Russian 
Federation has signed a decision on the flotation of the 
Aeroflot Russian International Airlines air company. He said 
that the decision was signed two days ago and noted that, under 
the document, each of Aeroflot's four subsidiary companies can 
now regard itself as independent. However, Vladimir Potapov, 
president of Aeroflot's international division, told RIA that he 
had not seen the document relating to the airline's flotation 
and, therefore, could not comment on it.
