P.M. BRIEFING; 
APPLE TO BUY BACK MORE STOCK 
Apple Computer Inc. said today its board of directors has approved the 
repurchase of up to 2.5 million additional shares of common stock. 
The ongoing open-market purchases are part of a program announced last August 
when Apple's board first authorized the purchase of 2.5 million shares. 
John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said the purchase 
"represents good long-term value to our shareholders." 
Last month, Apple projected a decline in earnings in the first quarter of 
fiscal 1990 and said sales will grow more slowly than previously predicted. 
That announcement surprised industry watchers, coming just two weeks after a 
top executive of the personal computer maker told security analysts in New York 
that it expected worldwide sales growth of more than 20%.
