<RINDOCK>[FAR Case 9171]</RINDOCK>



Federal Acquisition Regulation; Administration of Cost Accounting Standards 



AGENCIES: 

Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA). 




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing an amendment
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to require contractors, who issue subcontracts covered by Cost Accounting
Standards, to send subcontract award information not only to the contractor's contract administration office (CAO)
but also to the CAO cognizant of the subcontractor's facility. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of
Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. 



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS),
18th  F Streets NW., room 4035, Attn: Ms. Beverly Fayson, Washington, DC 20405. 



Please cite FAR case 9171 in all correspondence related to this case.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 

Mr. Jeremy F. Olson at (202) 5013221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR
Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 5014755. Please cite FAR case 9171.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A. Background 



The clause at 52.2305, Administration of Cost Accounting Standards, currently requires contractors to send
information to the prime contractor's CAO, who forwards it on to the CAO cognizant of the subcontractor. Since the
prime contractor's CAO does not change, modify, or add to the information, but just sends it on to the CAO cognizant
of the subcontractor, it is more efficient for contractors to send it direct. The contractor's CAO should also have
the information and, therefore, the requirement to send the information to the contractor's cognizant CAO has not
been deleted. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 because small businesses are exempt from Cost Accounting Standards requirements. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties.
Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section
610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR case 9171), in correspondence. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information
collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of an amended information collection requirement
(90000129) concerning Cost Accounting Standards has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

 Public comments concerning this request are invited through a 

Federal Register

 notice appearing in this issue.
