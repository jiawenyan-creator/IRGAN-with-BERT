FT  16 FEB 93 / Observer: Ageing meteors
The latest clutch of ministerial parliamentary private secretaries, an
essential first step for young parliamentary stars, has thrown up some
interesting combinations. Tim Sainsbury, the rather smooth old Etonian
industry minister, for example, gets the bluff Eric Pickles, (ex-Leeds
Polytechnic and Bradford Council leader).
However, TV broadcaster Gyles Brandreth's appointment as Stephen Dorrell's
bag-carrier is more interesting. Brandreth is a good four years older than
his master but Dorrell is very much a rising star. Brandreth is determined
and hardworking, but may be handicapped by memories of his rather fluffy
TV-am past. Perhaps that's why he isn't defence minister Jonathan Aitken's
pps.
That job is already being done by Stephen Milligan, a contemporary of
Brandreth's at Oxford and another union president. On paper at least, he
would seem to be more in tune with Dorrell. Milligan was the last 'wet'
president of the OU Conservative association before the relentless tide of
right-wingers - which helps explain why it took him so long to find a
parliamentary seat.
