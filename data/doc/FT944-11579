FT  05 NOV 94 / New home starts rise 12.5% in first nine months of 1994
Builders started work on 12.5 per cent more new homes in the first nine
months of this year than in the corresponding period last year, figures
published by the Department of the Environment show.
Figures issued yesterday confirm that new homes have been easier to sell
than existing properties while the general housing market has remained flat
for much of the year.
According to the department builders started work on 123,100 homes in the
first nine months, of which 51,800 were started in the three months to the
end of Sep-tember.
This was 13 per cent more than in the corresponding three months last year
but 8 per cent lower than in the three months to the end of June.
After seasonal adjustment, starts for July, August and September would have
be 1 per cent higher than for the previous three months.
Meanwhile, estate agents reported a further fall in business for the second
month running in October, according to a survey published yesterday by the
National Association of Estate Agents.
Almost 60 per cent of the 200 agents questioned reported a further fall in
inquiries and viewings of houses for sale last month. It was the second
month running that the association reported a fall in activity.
Mr Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, the association's chief executive, blamed the
decline on a half percentage-point rise in interest rates in September. He
said a further increase in interest rates would be disastrous.
'The slowdown experienced after the September rise could be described as a
hiccup compared with to the stranglehold that another increase would put on
the property market,' Mr Dunsmore-Hardy said.
