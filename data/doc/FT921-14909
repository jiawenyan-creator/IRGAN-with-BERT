FT  14 JAN 92 / Five face insider dealing charges
THE BIGGEST insider dealing trial yet launched begins at the Old Bailey
today. Five people face charges under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider
Dealing) Act in connection with alleged offences that took place in 1988.
It will be the first case brought against so many people, and the first
alleged ring charged with conspiring to profit by using unpublished,
price-sensitive information.
The case is brought by the Department of Trade and Industry against Mr Mark
Riding, 27, Mr David Gray, 32, Mrs Catherine Smith (nee Rowlands), 32, Mr
William Liggins, 33, and Mr Keith Tondeur, 43. All worked for financial
institutions.
The five were committed for trial on March 15 last year in relation to
dealings during the period May to August 1988 in the shares of Ranks Hovis
McDougall, the UK foods group then subject to a takeover bid, Pleasurama,
the leisure group taken over by Mecca Leisure, and/or Hawthorn Leslie Group,
the USM-quoted cellular phone company, which acquired ECT Cellular and
London Car Telephones about that time.
Mr Gray was a share salesman with Morgan Grenfell at the time. Mrs Smith
worked in the corporate finance department at Samuel Montagu and Mr Liggins
was a fund manager at Lazards. Mr Tondeur was with Paribas, the French bank,
and Mr Riding worked for the Co-operative Insurance Society in Manchester.
One or two days of legal argument are expected before the charges against
the defendants are read out in court. If they plead not guilty, the case is
likely to last six weeks or more.
In spite of growing concern and new legislation to combat insider trading in
the past decade, the DTI has put only about 36 people on trial, mostly in
ones or twos. A few small cases have been brought by the Crown Prosecution
Service and the Stock Exchange.
About half have of those tried have been acquitted.
