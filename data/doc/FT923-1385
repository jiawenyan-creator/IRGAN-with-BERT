FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reduced exceptionals cut Southern
Newspapers
SOUTHERN Newspapers, the regional newspaper group which faced the threat of
a bid battle between four potential suitors a year ago, reported annual
pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.01m against Pounds 8.61m.
The pre-tax line for the year to June 27 was struck after a Pounds 168,000
(Pounds 5.89m) surplus on disposals of investments.
The sharp reduction was partly offset by lower interest costs of Pounds
580,000 (Pounds 1.77m), reflecting strong cash flow which enabled it to
eliminate all bank debts and end the year with cash reserves of Pounds 5.3m.
A cost reduction programme introduced last year - including a 5.5 per cent
cut in staff numbers to 1,646 - helped operating profits climb to Pounds
7.23m (Pounds 3.9m).
The improved operating figure was struck despite turnover dipping from
Pounds 71.4m to Pounds 69.5m.
The fall mainly reflected a decline in advertising revenues, partly offset
by improvements in circulation, contract printing and other revenues.
Earnings per share fell to 20.10p (26.75p). The final dividend is raised
8.25p, making a total of 11.25p (10.5p).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 549,000 (Pounds 3.53m) was mainly incurred
in preparing a submission to the Monopolies Commission.
This held a three-month investigation into whether a takeover by Trinity
International Holdings, Emap, Pearson (owner of the Financial Times) and
Reed International would be against the public interest.
The four groups were cleared to bid but decided against when the shares rose
to 330p.
Yesterday Mr James Sexton, chief executive, said that since July - when the
four groups were free to look at Southern - there had been no contact.
'We are not in discussions with anyone,' he said. 'It is our intention to
remain independent.'
