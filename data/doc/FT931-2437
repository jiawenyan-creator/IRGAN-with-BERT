FT  19 MAR 93 / Mid-Glamorgan will drop EC cash call
MID-GLAMORGAN county council in south Wales is withdrawing its application
for about Pounds 7m of European aid for 33 projects because it says it
cannot now afford its share of the cost.
The council says that the projects, out of a total of 83 it put forward last
summer for European regional development funding, included a relief road for
Merthyr Tydfil, other improvements for roads and industrial land, and rail
park and ride schemes.
Dr Victoria Winckler, head of Mid-Glamorgan's policy unit, said that the
financial settlement imposed by the government for the coming financial year
meant that the council would not now have the resources for matching finance
for all 83 schemes. About 55 per cent of the cost would have to be met by
the council.
'They were all realistic projects intended to help to regenerate the
economy,' she said.
