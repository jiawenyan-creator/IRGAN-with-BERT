FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P affirms Swiss banks' top
rating
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency yesterday affirmed the top
triple-A credit ratings of the big three Swiss banks, contradicting the
opinion of Moody's Investors Service, its biggest competitor.
S&amp;P said that the top long-term credit ratings of Union Bank of Switzerland,
Credit Suisse and Swiss Banking Corporation would be maintained in spite of
an increase in loan losses and a decline in profitability.
Earlier this year, Moody's downgraded Credit Suisse to Aa1 and has placed
SBC under review for possible downgrade.
Standard &amp; Poor's said that the strong performance of all three banks was
'in marked contrast' to the general deterioration of bank credit quality.
