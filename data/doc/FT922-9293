FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: France will inject FFr2bn into
Bull
THE FRENCH government will go ahead with a FFr2bn (Dollars 350m) injection
of fresh capital for Bull, the loss-making state-owned computer maker,
despite the fact the European Commission has not given its agreement.
Paris announced yesterday that Bull would as expected proceed with its
equity increase, which comes on top of a FFr2bn injection of fresh capital
from the government last year, also being scrutinised by the Commission.
A Bull spokesman said the Commission's inquiry did not legally stop it from
going ahead. The French government has complained of the slowness of the
Commission's inquiry, which opened last July.
Just over three quarters of the money will come directly from the
government, in proportion to its 75.8 per cent ownership of Bull. The new
shares will also be subscribed by France Telecom, owner of 17 per cent, and
NEC, the Japanese electronics company which holds 4.5 per cent.
Last month, Bull announced a FFr3.3bn loss for 1991, following a record
FFr6.8bn deficit in the previous year.
