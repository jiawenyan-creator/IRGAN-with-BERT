FT  25 MAR 93 / Observer: Dust flying
Has dirty work entered the contest between British Gas, the monopoly
household supplier, and ambitious newcomer Alliance Gas? One of the biggest
contenders in the now competitive industrial market, Alliance claims that if
allowed to serve domestic customers, it could cut their bills by Pounds 50
yearly - which the reigning supplier disputes hotly.
Hitherto, the two sides have confined themselves to rival advertising
campaigns. But now British Gas has begun noisily and dustily digging up the
road outside Alliance's headquarters.
Nor were staff there any happier for the news that another of the diggers'
enemies, the Office of Gas Supply, was rocked by a loud gas explosion in its
basement yesterday.
