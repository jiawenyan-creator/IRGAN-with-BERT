FT  09 FEB 93 / Adam Smith Institute says BBC should be floated on Stock
Exchange
THE BBC should be floated on the Stock Exchange as a single company licensed
to broadcast two television channels and five radio stations, the Adam Smith
Institute, the rightwing think tank, says today.
Transfer of ownership 'into the hands of millions of ordinary shareholders'
would not only raise 'huge sums' for the Treasury but would take the BBC out
of the political domain.
The report argues that the BBC should be funded by advertising, but the
transition from licence fee funding could be phased over 10 years. The
licence fee system means the BBC 'is not liable to any penalty for failure
to provide what the general public want to see or for that matter to reap
the rewards'.
The study rejects the idea that there would not be enough advertising to
support the BBC and the existing commercial broadcasters.
As the BBC becomes a privatised corporation, public service broadcasting
should be opened up to competition. An Arts Council of the Air - possibly an
offshoot of the existing Arts Council - which would channel funds for public
service broadcasts. Organisations, including the BBC, would submit bids to
produce such works. Overall the report concludes the proposals would take
broadcasting in Britain a large step towards a free market system.
