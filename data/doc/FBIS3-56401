  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- "The merger of Russian and 
Belarussian monetary systems mainly concerns non-cash turnover," 
Aleksandr Shokhin, vice-premier of the Russian government, said 
in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  "Unlike Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which used old Soviet 
cash 
money and attempted to accelerate the merger of the monetary 
systems, Belarus did nothing of the kind. Now, all mechanisms 
of the merger, including both monetary and economic systems, 
should be worked out. This concerns interbank relations, 
budgets, customs systems, etc.," Shokhin said. 
  He went on to say that Belarus is, perhaps, the only country 
of the former Soviet Union which encourages the development of 
mixed forms of property. This process of encouraging mutual 
interests should be strengthened. Shokhin pointed out that ill- 
considered political statements should not impede real 
possibilities for integration which might be advantageous for 
Russia.
