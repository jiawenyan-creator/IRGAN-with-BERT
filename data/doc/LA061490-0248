11 BRITISH SOCCER FANS ARRESTED FOR VIOLENCE IN ITALY 
Eleven English soccer fans, some hurling tables and bottles, were arrested 
early today after a bar fight and a vandalism spree, the Italian news agency 
ANSA reported. All of the fans are on the island of Sardinia for Saturday's 
game between England and the Netherlands. 
In Milan, a court sentenced eight fans -- six Germans, a Swiss and an Austrian 
-- to eight months in jail for their roles in a violent confrontation with 
police on Sunday. 
Some of the defendants sat down on the bench of their courtroom steel-barred 
holding cells and burst into tears when an interpreter read the verdict 
Wednesday. They are likely to be released from prison and expelled from Italy 
once the World Cup ends. 
At Ajaccio, Corsica, three English soccer fans expelled from Italy for 
trouble-making were injured Wednesday in a brawl with local patrons at a bar. 
One of them needed surgery for a severe arm injury.
