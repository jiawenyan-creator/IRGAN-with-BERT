FT  21 JAN 92 / India delays public sector shut-down
STRONG opposition from labour leaders yesterday forced a delay in the
formulation of a policy to close down public and private sector entities
that are chronically unprofitable and considered by the government to be
beyond redemption.
A meeting of management, labour and government representatives decided that
the policy would be delayed for at least another month while a unit-by-unit
study is made by six tripartite committees.
The government called yesterday's meeting to discuss what is called an
'exit' policy for unprofitable enterprises and to formulate a consensus on
it.
The government has drawn up a list of 58 public sector companies it wants to
close down. Their accumulated losses are estimated at Rs100bn (Pounds
2.2bn). They have a total labour force of 470,000.
The policy is a major part of the government's economic reforms. A 'national
renewal fund' worth Rs2bn is planned to re-train and redeploy workers
declared redundant. The World Bank is contributing towards the fund.
Consultations with the unions concerned began three months ago and at
yesterday's meeting union leaders accused the government of talking only in
terms of retrenchment rather than redeployment.
They urged the establishment of workers' co-operatives to take over the
running of the loss-making companies after writing off all the accumulated
losses. Dr Mahoman Singh, the minister of finance, was reported to be
sympathetic to this demand.
