WASHINGTON, D.C.; 
CHINESE BALLET STAR APPLIES FOR ASYLUM 
A rising Chinese ballet star, who disappeared last month while performing with 
the Houston Ballet Company, said he has asked for asylum in the United States. 
At a press conference in Washington, Lin Zhen said he dropped out of sight 
because his plan had been uncovered and dance officials threatened to return 
him to China. He said that a lack of freedom since Beijing's pro-democracy 
crackdown last year has made it impossible for him to continue his career 
there.
