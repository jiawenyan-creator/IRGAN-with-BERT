has a severe acute episode of a psychiatric disorder which requires medical supervision and treatment on a 24-hour-a-day
basis. The services must include intensive individualized treatment to stabilize the acute condition so that the
individual can be discharged as soon as possible to a less restrictive type of care.

Psychiatric residential treatment facility. 

Inpatient care in a psychiatric residential treatment facility may be provided when an individual does not require
acute care but requires supervision and treatment on a 24- hour-a-day basis to attain a level of functioning that allows
subsequent treatment on an outpatient basis.
