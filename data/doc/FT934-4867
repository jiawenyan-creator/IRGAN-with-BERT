FT  02 DEC 93 / Ivory Coast party split on succession
Ivory Coast's ruling party acted yesterday to cover deep cracks opened by
the contest to succeed President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who is gravely ill,
Reuter reports from Abidjan.
By a show of hands, the Political Bureau of the Democratic party endorsed
the constitutional claim of Mr Henri Konan Bedie, speaker of parliament, to
take over when Africa's longest-serving president dies or stands down.
The decision appeared a setback for supporters of Prime Minister Alassane
Ouattara and opposition parties which are against the constitution's article
11. This states that Mr Bedie, as speaker, takes over until elections in
1995 if the president dies, resigns or is incapacitated.
But it remained to be seen if the unprecedented political tension in the
West African country would abate as a result.
Mr Houphouet-Boigny, 88, has been in power since independence from France in
1960. Western governments led by France and the US are growing nervous about
the future of a country once held up as a model of political stability and
relative prosperity. The economic crisis in the world's number one cocoa
producer is worsening. Civil service salaries are being paid up to three
weeks late.
The main opposition party, the Ivorian Popular Front, is opposed to Mr
Bedie's claim to be interim president and has called for a transitional
government.
