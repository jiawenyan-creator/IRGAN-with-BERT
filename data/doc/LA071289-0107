OLSEN ACCEPTS MOVE TO ANOTHER NBC TEAM 
Although he will be replaced by former San Francisco 49er coach Bill Walsh as 
NBC's No. 1 football analyst next season, Merlin Olsen will remain with the 
network. 
Dick Ebersol, NBC Sports president, said Tuesday that Olsen will work a full 
schedule of games with Charlie Jones. 
Ebersol and Terry O'Neil, NBC Sports executive producer, met with Olsen Monday 
night after it was revealed that Walsh would be Dick Enberg's new partner. 
"Merlin couldn't have been classier," Ebersol said. "Using some baseball 
terminology, he said, 'You don't have to bat cleanup to be a member of a team.'
