FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (7): Financial profligacy
The latest five-star hotel to open in Nairobi has been seized by the Kenya
Central Bank in an attempt to recoup billions of shillings that went astray
in the run-up to the December 1992 elections and their aftermath.
Kenyans are only beginning to count the cost of the financial profligacy
which linked senior Kanu politicians, Asian businessmen, a group of local
banks and the former top management at the central bank.
One confidential report into the complex series of financial transactions
estimates the cost to the public purse was Ks30bn (Dollars 430m), or about
10 per cent of gross domestic product.
The central bank began to lose its grip on monetary policy when banking
licences were liberally awarded in 1992 as a vehicle for financing the
re-election campaigns of ruling politicians. The 'political banks' engaged
in dubious money-spinning ventures, relating to the construction of
glamorous buildings in Nairobi and claiming generous government rebates for
alleged exports of gold and diamonds.
Emboldened by their early success, some of these banks then obtained more
than Ks17bn from the central bank in exchange for a promise to repay the
unsecured loan in dollars at a later date. The loan was never repaid. In
addition, the central bank is investigating the theft of Dollars 117m of
foreign exchange bearer bonds from its vaults and the possible forgery of
other central bank certificates.
Micah Cheserem, appointed central bank governor last July, is trying to
clear up the mess and recover as much public money as possible.
Three commercial banks are under liquidation.
