COLLEGE AND ITS EVICTION OF TENANTS 
We reside in Arbol Verde in one of the houses owned by Claremont McKenna 
College, and we believe that Kaplan's comments in no way describe accurately 
the current situation 
In our view, the houses owned by the college are the best maintained in the 
entire neighborhood. Residents have known about the college's plans for its 
property for at least three years. 
Is this not ample notice for any landlord to give its tenants? 
Of much greater concern to us and to dozens of other Arbol Verde residents is 
the "destabilization" of the neighborhood caused by gang activity centered at 
one of the few houses not owned by Claremont McKenna College. Drive-by 
shootings have now resulted in injuries and a death; thus far the only 
responsible concern that has been shown has been initiated by Claremont McKenna 
College.
