(Draft)"] 
  [Text] The aim of the defense of the Republic of 
Lithuania is to defend the independence of the Republic, its 
inviolability and territorial integrity, as well as to guarantee 
the security of all Lithuanian citizens from external threats. 
The defense concept is the total of political, economic, legal, 
social, military, and other measures that ensure the defense of 
the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and 
sovereignty. 
  This doctrine is based on the Constitution of the 
Republic of Lithuania, universally accepted norms of 
international law, U.N. General Assembly conventions and 
resolutions, and the principles of the national security 
concept. 
  The defense doctrine contains political, military 
political, and military technological parts. 

<H5>    1.1. The Political Basis of the Doctrine </H5>
  The defense doctrine defines potential threats, the removal 
of which involves the Armed Forces. 
  External threats are established considering Lithuania's 
geopolitical situation, the possible aim of foreign states to 
restrict or abolish the independence and territorial integrity 
of the Republic of Lithuania. 
  The external threats are: 
  -- an aggression of another state or military unions of 
other states; 
  -- a civil war in neighboring states or an armed conflict 
between them that could spread to Lithuania; 
  -- an invasion of uncontrolled military units or other 
armed groups; 
  -- a large concentration of military force by other 
countries at Lithuania's borders; 
  -- international terrorism. 
  Aggression is interpreted and assessed in accordance with 
the 
U.N. General Assembly resolution "On the Definition of 
Aggression" adopted in 1974. 
  The nature of threats decides the methods for their removal 
-- political, diplomatic, military, and others. Priority is 
given to political and diplomatic measures. 
  Strengthening its security, Lithuania cooperates with other 
countries and international organizations on the basis of 
accepted principles of international law: 
  -- superiority of the law; 
  -- nonuse of force and intimidation by force in 
international relations; 
  -- peaceful resolution of international disputes; 
  -- noninterference into internal affairs of other states; 
  -- equality of sovereign states; 
  -- honest execution of international commitments; 
  -- inviolability of borders;

and freedoms, and of cooperation among states.

<H5>  2. The Military Policy </H5>

<H5>    2.1. The Goals of the State in the Sphere of Defense </H5>
  The defense of the Republic of Lithuania is the 
constitutional right and commitment of every Lithuanian citizen. 
  The military policy of the Republic of Lithuania, its 
military structures, and the manner of their arming must comply 
with the following key principles: 
  -- to discourage a potential enemy from 
aggressive action; 
  -- in case of aggression, todefend the state 
with minimum losses to society. 
  The Armed Forces must stop the enemy, force him to retreat, 
and restore territorial integrity and public peace. 
  In case of aggression, Lithuania chooses suitable modes and 
measures for defense. 
<H3>  2.2. Armed Forces and Military Measures Guaranteeing the 
Security and Defense of the State </H3>
  The Armed Forces of the Republic of Lithuania is a system of 
state institutions, an armed force defending the independence 
and territorial integrity of the state. 
  In case of military aggression, the Armed Forces and state 
management institutions are reorganized in line with the law of 
the Republic of Lithuania. 
  The Republic of Lithuania conducts the policy of state 
security and defense along two lines: 
  -- preparing state institutions and society for state 
defense; 
  -- participating in international processes strengthening 
security. 
  Preparing its society, Armed Forces, and other state 
institutions for defense, Lithuania adopts the following 
measures: 
  -- upgrades the Army and its management system, and 
ensures control over the border and the air space; 
  -- strengthens the defense of the state borders; 
  -- supports social patriotic organizations seeking the 
formation of a proper state reserve of material resources, 
mobilization, the autonomy of armament in use, and the 
consideration of defense requirements. 
  Defense seeks to win enough time for the organization and 
rallying of international assistance. The state defense force 
is rallied to inflict the largest moral, physical, and political 
damage on the aggressor, and force him to renounce further 
aggression. 
  The basis of the defense system of the Republic of Lithuania 
is the Army. 
  The Army of the Republic of Lithuania is created: 
  -- following the principles of international law and the 
experience of Lithuania and other countries in forming and 
upgrading their military structures; 
  -- applying the principle of mixed recruiting; 
  -- considering the state's possibilities and demands to 
sustain the defense force; 
  -- expanding the system of centralized management; 
  -- upgrading the Army structure, technical and material 
supply, management system, and creating conditions for the 
integration with NATO and the West European Union. 

<H5>    2.3. The Nature of Potential Conflicts and War Action </H5>
  In case of an armed border conflict, the latter is 
localized and suppressed by applying simultaneous political 
measures for its regulation. The localization is conducted by 
the state border defense service. 
  In case of an invasion into the territory of the 
Republic of Lithuania, the penetration of the enemy inside 
the country is halted, territorial integrity and the state 
border are restored, and the situation is normalized through 
political measures. The enemy is halted and the situation is 
stabilized by the Lithuanian Army. 
  In case of open aggression against the Republic of 
Lithuania, the entire state defense potential is 
concentrated to repulse aggression, by mobilizing the community 
and all material resources and adopting political measures for 
the acquisition of international assistance. 
  Weapons of mass destruction can be used against the Republic 
of Lithuania indirectly if: 
  -- Lithuania is in the zone of confronting states or 
their groups; 
  -- accidents and catastrophes at nuclear facilities, 
chemical enterprises, and other entities of increased danger are 
caused artificially. 
  After the use of weapons of mass destruction the key goal of 
the state defense system is to defend society against its 
effects.

  Drafted following the Lithuanian president's decree No. 164 
of 11 May 1993 on the establishment of a working group for the 
preparation of the military doctrine (headed by V. Petkevicius). 
  [Dated] 15 December 1993 
  Today, we are publishing the draft military doctrine of the 
Republic of Lithuania for public consideration. As Vytautas 
Petkevicius, acting chairman of the Seimas National Security 
Committee [recently elected its chairman] (he is also the head 
of a large expert group that worked on this draft) has stated to 
TIESA, the document was drafted with great care for several 
months. The draft defense doctrine denies the propaganda that 
it is the opposition that is responsible for the president's 
decision to apply for NATO membership.
