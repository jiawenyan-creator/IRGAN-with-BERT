  [Text] Security forces and the National Peacekeeping Force 
were involved in a heavy gun battle with unknown gunmen near the 
Angola Hostel in Thokoza on the East Rand. Members of a police 
patrol came under fire when they tried to remove a body lying in 
front of the hostel. Reinforcements in an armored vehicle were 
dispatched and a gun battle ensured on their arrival at the 
hostel. So far four people are reported to have been wounded in 
the shooting. 
  The National Hostel Residents Association says that hundreds 
of West Rand hostel residents will be transported to the East 
Rand to reinforce hostels that it claims are under attack by the 
National Peacekeeping Force. An Association spokesman, Mr. 
Thulani Mlotshwa, said 500 hostel residents from the Rand would 
be moved into East Rand hostels. 
  Referring to yesterday's gun battle between Thokoza hostel 
residents and members of the peacekeeping force in which 
photographer Ken Oosterbroek was killed, he said large numbers 
of township residents accompanied by the peacekeeping force had 
attacked the hostel.
