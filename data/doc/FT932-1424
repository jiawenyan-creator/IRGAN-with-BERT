FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Celsius opens year with profits
advance
CELSIUS Industries, Sweden's newly-privatised defence group, yesterday
unveiled profits after financial items of SKr205m (Dollars 27.13m) for the
first four months, up SKr10m from the same period in 1992.
The company, whose shares will be traded on the Stockholm stock exchange for
the first time today, benefited from cost-cutting and disposal of the
lossmaking piping installation company Calor Vanadis.
It said the figures increased its confidence it would at least equal last
year's profit of SKr545m.
Considerable streamlining before privatisation largely explains a 17 per
cent drop in sales to SKr3.34bn. The group sold Calor Vanadis and Calor VVS
at the end of last year and acquired the defence electronics activities of
Nobel Industries - now known as Celsius Tech - in February.
The most disappointing performance came from arms maker Bofors, where sales
fell to SKr1.12bn from SKr1.48bn and profits dropped to SKr56m from SKr87m.
Celsius said the fall was 'temporary' and partly because series production
of a new combat vehicle, the CV 90, was about to get under way.
The high-technology units FFV Aerotech and Telub produced a combined profit
of SKr89m, up from SKr68m, helping to offset the drop in Bofors profit.
Submarine company Kockums saw profits weaken to SKr80m from SKr88m.
The Celsius share offer, Sweden's biggest privatisation, was heavily
oversubscribed. The group has 56,000 shareholders, but the state remains the
largest with a 25 per cent stake.
