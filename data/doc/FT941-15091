FT  17 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: London
The gilts market will probably concentrate on this week's economic
statistics for evidence about inflation, now expectations of an imminent
base rate cut appear to have receded. Mr Peter Fellner, gilts strategist of
NatWest Markets, said the figures would be looked at for any signs which
might dent 'the consensus expectation of non-inflationary growth'.
The December retail prices index along with retail sales figures are due out
on Wednesday. Traders expect retail sales growth to be strong, in the wake
of recent M0 figures, and the fact that December 1992's poor figure will
drop out of the index.
Analysts say the headline inflation figure will pick up from November's 1.4
per cent, probably to an annual rate of 2 per cent, as mortgage rate cuts in
December 1992 drop out and Budget increases in petrol duties kick in. The
underlying rate, which excludes mortgage payments, may rise to an annual 2.7
per cent.
The Bank will reveal more details on Tuesday of its auction of 2008-12
stock, scheduled for January 26. The market expects the issue to raise
Pounds 3bn, have a maturity of 2010, and yield 6.5 per cent. Traders were
relieved that the auction was not for longer-dated stock, as that would have
suggested the Bank felt long gilt yields had reached bottom.
