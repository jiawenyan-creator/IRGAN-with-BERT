<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3; Exemption</DOCTITLE>


I


The Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR64,
which authorizes operation of the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 (IP3). The license provides, among other
things, that the licensee, is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.
The facility consists of a pressurized water reactor at the licensee's site located in Westchester County, New York.


II


By letter dated September 29, 1994, the licensee requested an amendment to the Technical Specifications (TSs) that
would allow Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation valves AC732, AC741, ACMOV743,
ACMOV744, and ACMOV1870 Type C local leak rate tests (LLRTs) to be performed during refueling
outage (RFO) 9/10, scheduled for spring of 1996. In addition, the licensee's letter requested an exemption from the
requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) since 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, requires
that licensees perform Type C tests during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater
than 2 years. Type C tests are LLRTs of containment isolation valves.
The licensee commenced operating on 24-month fuel cycles in August 1992, instead of the previous 18-month fuel cycles,
starting with fuel cycle 9. The requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, indicate that Type C
LLRTs must be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling at intervals no greater than 2 years (24 months).
On January 12, 1993, the NRC staff issued an exemption that allowed Type C LLRTs to be performed at intervals up to 30
months, thus, permitting operating on a 24-month fuel cycle.
Approximately 6 months after startup from RFO 8/9, IP3 began an extended unplanned nonrefueling outage. In November
and December of 1994, RHR containment isolation valves AC732, AC741, ACMOV743, ACMOV744,
and ACMOV1870 are due for their Type C LLRT. Currently, the interval for Type C testing of these valves
is 30 months. Therefore, the licensee requested a one-time schedular exemption to allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed
valves to be deferred until the 9/10 RFO, which is currently scheduled for the spring of 1996.
By letter dated November 2, 1994, the licensee requested withdrawal of the proposed changes to the TSs and modified
the exemption request. Specifically, the licensee requested that the exemption extend until the return to power
following the current outage, which is defined as prior to T

avg

 exceeding 350
&cir; F. The NRC staff granted the request for withdrawal of the proposed changes to the TSs in a letter dated November
3, 1994.


III


Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security and (2) when special
circumstances are present. According to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present whenever application
of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.
The CFR at 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Paragraphs III.D.3, states: ``Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor
shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years ***.'' The underlying purpose
of the requirement to perform Type C containment leak rate tests at intervals not to exceed 2 years is to ensure that
any potential leakage pathways through the containment boundary are identified within a time span that prevents
significant degradation from continuing or being unknown, and long enough to allow the test to be conducted during
scheduled refueling outages. The requirements to perform Type C LLRTs at intervals no greater than 2 years presumed
the 2-year time interval was adequate to accommodate the 12-month fuel cycles which were common when Appendix J to
10 CFR part 50 was published in 1973. However, IP3, along with several other facilities, are utilizing core designs
which allow operation on a 24-month cycle. In January 12, 1993, the NRC staff issued an exemption that allowed Types
B and C LLRTs to be performed at intervals up to 30 months, thus, permitting operation on a 24-month fuel cycle.
