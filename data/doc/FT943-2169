FT  21 SEP 94 / Slovak poll delays privatisation
The Slovak government yesterday suspended part of its privatisation
programme, postponing decisions on direct sales of state assets until after
next week's general election. The move is designed to remove political
uncertainty from the process ahead of the vote, scheduled for September 30
and October 1, and is in response to a pledge made by Christian Democrat
members of the ruling coalition that no privatisation decisions would be
made during campaigning. The National Property Fund, which administers state
assets, opened on August 1 for bids for stakes in state companies not
included in the voucher privatisation programme, which is not affected by
the suspension. The tender closed on August 30 and the NPF is expected
either to consider the bids after the election or to open another tendering
process. The latter option seems likely if the coalition loses.
