STEREOTYPES AND HEROES 
Regarding Nancy Churnin's article, "Actors Weary of Typecasting, Create 'Latins 
Anonymous,' " Sept. 19, I agree with Luisa Leschin that "Hollywood writers are 
seeing their image of Mexicans as their maids and gardeners." Leschin is one of 
the four members of "Latins Anonymous," a show now being staged in the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. 
I don't know if this typecasting is based on prejudice or ignorance, but I do 
know it has been going on since time immemorial. 
Curiously, every night I watch attractive and well-dressed Hispanic actors and 
actresses playing professional, educated people and living in beautiful homes 
and going to glamorous parties and restaurants. No, not in Hollywood films but 
on the Spanish-language television screens. 
The locales are not Los Angeles nor New York, but Caracas, Buenos Aires and 
Mexico City. These series or films are shown not only in the Western Hemisphere 
but in Spain, Italy, China and even in the Soviet Union. 
But Hollywood writers and producers care little or nothing about all this. It 
is a sad and deplorable situation.
