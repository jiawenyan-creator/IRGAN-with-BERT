Competitive Impact Analysis 



All operational and legal changes considered by the Board that have a substantial effect on payment system participants
are subject to the competitive impact analysis described in the March 1990 policy statement ``The Federal Reserve
in the Payments System.'' In this analysis, the Board assesses whether the proposed change would have a direct and
material adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve
in providing similar service due to differing legal powers or constraints or due to a dominant market position of the
Federal Reserve deriving from such legal differences. 

The Board believes that the recommended price and service level changes would not have a substantial effect on payments
system participants and would not have a direct and material effect on the ability of other service providers to compete
effectively with the Federal Reserve in providing similar services. The 1995 fees approved by the Board result in
a projected return on equity that meets the target return on equity based on the 50 bank holding company model. The Board
believes that the recommended fees for the noncash collection services are consistent with the approach that would
be used by a private-sector firm, which would absorb the results of structural changes through its retained earnings
account. Therefore, the Board does not believe that approval of the proposed fees would have an adverse effect on the
ability of other service providers to compete with the Reserve Banks.
