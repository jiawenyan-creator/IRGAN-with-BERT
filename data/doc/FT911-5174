FT  16 APR 91 / Letter: Bush decision over interference in Iraq courageous
Sir, Of course there is vexation as the world watches the desperate attempts
of the Iraqi rebels to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein ('Anguish of
victory', March 30), but the US refusal to become directly involved should
not be equated with policy confusion.
It is all too easy to accuse the American president of failing to take
advantage of the military success of Desert Storm as the Kurdish and Shia
insurgents are brutally repressed.
George Bush's decision to keep out of the internal politics of Iraq is no
less courageous than his determination to lead the allied coalition to
victory in strict conformity with UN Security Council resolutions.
Could this great achievement in upholding international law really be
well-served by subsequent unauthorised intrusion into the domestic affairs
of even so guilty a leader as the Iraqi dictator?
