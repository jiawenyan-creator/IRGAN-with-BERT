FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Trafficmaster in high street link
Trafficmaster yesterday announced that it had reached an agreement with high
street retailers which would result in its traffic monitoring system being
sold through more than 500 outlets by early next year
When it gained a listing in March, the company had sold about 2,100 units
through direct marketing, but it expects substantial growth through access
to retail networks, mainly electronics and cellular phone stores.
Trafficmaster also reported that interim pre-tax losses had risen from
Pounds 468,000 to Pounds 541,000 on turnover up 61 per cent to Pounds
571,000. This reflected increased investment in infrastructure.
Trafficmaster will have completed coverage of the 912 miles of motorways
detailed in its listing particulars, by December 7, when it will launch its
national network.
It will also have installed sensors covering 406 miles of trunk roads by the
end of the year.
Mr David Martell, chief executive, said the company was focusing on building
up infrastructure, rather than short-term profits.
It had spent Pounds 1.5m on developing its network since the flotation,
which raised Pounds 7.17m, and yesterday it opened its National Traffic Data
Centre.
It is also negotiating with car manufacturers over usage of Trafficmaster in
an on-board system for new cars. Mr Martell reckons that such a system will
be introduced by at least two manufacturers by the end of 1996.
At the end of June, cash and short-term deposits were Pounds 7m, which Mr
Mantell said would be sufficient to fund its investment programme.
The share price closed down 1p at 180p. But it has been one of the best
performing flotations of the year, rising from an issue price of 130p.
The company is not paying a dividend, as flagged at the time of flotation.
Losses per share fell from 3.6p to 2.9p.
