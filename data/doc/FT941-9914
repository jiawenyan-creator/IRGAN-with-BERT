FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades Walt Disney
Problems at the Euro Disney theme park near Paris yesterday cost Walt Disney
its double-A credit rating from Moody's, the US rating agency.
Moody's downgraded the US entertainment group over concerns that the poor
performance at Euro Disney would continue, increasing Walt Disney's
financial risks. The rating agency said it expected the company's debt
restructuring talks to result in Walt Disney and the theme park's bankers
agreeing to share the financial burden.
The loss of a double-A credit rating can lead to higher debt costs, since
many bond investors are prevented by their articles from holding bonds which
do not carry a double- or triple-A rating from one of the leading agencies.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the other leading US rating agency, is also considering
whether to remove Disney's double-A rating.
Moody's said it expected Euro Disney's operating results to remain under
pressure 'in the intermediate term,' even if the restructuring resulted in a
reduction in the theme park's debt servicing costs.
EuroDisneyLand has been forced to cut its prices to attract visitors, and
has postponed a planned expansion.
