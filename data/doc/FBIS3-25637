  [Text] Angolan Head of State Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
arrived in the French capital earlier this evening. With this 
visit, he hopes to intensify bilateral cooperation in various 
areas. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos last visited Paris in 
August 1991 and even then he paid special attention to French 
businessmen. Three years later, judging by his schedule, he is 
likely to pay them the same attention. There is confirmation 
that he will be meeting with the chairmen of Elf Aquitaine and 
Total companies, as well as representatives from other major 
companies. The Angolan president will, therefore, be seeking to 
consolidate French support for this country. 
  In the political sphere, he is scheduled to meet French 
President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
the interior minister, and the cooperation minister. 
  The Angolan head of state's visit to that European country 
is 
scheduled to last three days, during which he will also meet the 
chairman of the French National Assembly, and the leaders of 
France's Socialist and Communist Parties. It should be noted 
that bilateral relations have been reduced somewhat over the 
last three years as a result of Angola's political and military 
crisis. 
  Bilateral cooperation rests mainly on French participation 
in 
oil exploitation -- hence the importance of contacts with Elf 
Aquitaine and Total -- loans, and humanitarian aid.
