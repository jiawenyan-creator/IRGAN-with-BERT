<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene by </F>
correspondent Frederic Francois; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Francois] Was it appropriate for Belgium, as a 
former colonial power, to send UN blue helmets to Rwanda? 
  [Dehaene] We ultimately decided to send troops for several 
reasons: First, because of the UN's insistence; second, because 
of the demand by the parties to the Arusha agreements; and 
third, because we had played an active role in negotiating those 
agreements. I believe that we made the right decision then, but 
now that the Arusha agreements have been followed by a wave of 
violence, we must learn the lessons. Nevertheless, at the time 
of the UN decision [to send troops], I believe that our choice 
was justified. 
  [Francois] Is Belgium contemplating a withdrawal from 
Africa? 
  [Dehaene] No, I do not believe we should make conclusions 
influenced by our emotions. Rather, we must give ourselves some 
time to reflect upon the UN operations and our African policy. 
We nevertheless must define a new African policy, a new 
development policy, and I have promised the members of 
parliament that we would do so in cooperation with them.
