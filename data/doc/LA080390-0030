VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME; 
HOUSE OKS MONEY FOR 2 NAVAL BASES 
Despite cutbacks in the military budget, the House of Representatives has 
included nearly $15 million for construction projects at the two Naval bases in 
Ventura County. 
The House-passed package now will go to the Senate. 
The military construction package approved earlier this week allocated $10.1 
million for construction of a laboratory to integrate weapons at the Naval Ship 
Weapons Systems Engineering Station at Port Hueneme. 
It also included slightly more than $2 million to improve an electrical 
distribution system at the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme 
and another $2 million to beef up security at the Pacific Missile Test Center 
at Point Mugu. 
Bob Hubbert, a spokesman at Point Mugu, said the base plans to build fences and 
upgrade alarms at secret operations at the missile test center. 
In addition, the House included $513,000 to build a new office that doles out 
family housing on base. "Those guys are working in old post-World War II 
buildings. They need better space," Hubbert said. KENNETH R. WEISS
