FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Toyota warns of further sharp
profits decline
TOYOTA Motor, Japan's leading car maker, yesterday warned of another sharp
decline in profits in the year ending June as a result of sluggish sales in
the Japanese market.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president, said Toyota's parent-company pre-tax profits
were expected to slide by about 20 per cent to Y300bn (Dollars 2.4bn) in the
year to the end of June, the third consecutive year of declining profits.
With Toyota, Japan's most efficient and profitable car company, revising
profits projections downward, a shadow has been cast over the rest of
Japan's car makers, who may also be forced to lower their profits forecasts
again.
Already, Nissan is expecting a Y20bn net loss for the year to the end of
March, while Mazda has been struggling to stay in the black.
Mr Toyoda said the decline reflected both weak total sales volumes and poor
sales of more profitable luxury models. Profits since the end of the last
fiscal year have been runnng roughly 30 per cent below a year ago.
In August, Toyota had projected a sales increase of 5 per cent and level
profits. Toyota said yesterday that the value of sales would increase only
marginally to Y9,000bn.
The projected profits will be the lowest since the company merged its
manufacturing and sales operations in 1982, and compare with record pre-tax
profits of Y733.9bn in the year to June 1990.
But Toyota said it anticipated a modest recovery in vehicle sales in the
first half of calendar 1993. Overall, Toyota expects the volume of domestic
sales to decline by 5 per cent this year, and anticipates a 3 per cent
growth in sales next year.
