  [Text] As ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA has already reported, kray 
administration head Nikolay Yegorov's decree "On Emergency 
Measures To Combat Crime," has come into force in the Kuban. In 
accordance with this decree mass surveillance and preventive and 
investigations measures were carried out in the course of four 
days; around 10,000 militia officers took part in these 
measures. The "catch" was fairly considerable and diverse. 
During the operation 344 crimes were detected, including 22 
cases of premeditated murder, 16 cases of deliberate aggravated 
assault, 25 robberies and muggings, 140 cases of embezzlement of 
state and private property, and 12 thefts of firearms and 
munitions. Fifty illegally held weapons were seized and 14 
stolen cars were restored to their lawful owners; money and 
valuables to the tune of 15 million rubles were seized from 
criminals. Eighty five criminals hiding from investigation and 
justice were found. The kray's hotels, stations, and markets 
were checked in a search for "casual workers."
