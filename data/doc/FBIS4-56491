  [Text] Cuba will pay part of its debt to Mexico with 
assets. This is a financial arrangement that combines the 
payment of debts with investments through the direct injection 
of fresh money, better known as the swap [preceding word in 
English] sytem. 
  This system is being applied to three investment projects in 
priority sectors in Cuba: tourism, cement, and petroleum, as 
reported by the Mexican press. 
  Concerning tourism and cement, the contracts have already 
been signed and are already operating. Approximately $50 million 
of the Cuban debt to Mexico was paid through this contract. It 
has to do with the Tuzpan Hotel in Varadero, where 50 percent of 
the shares were purchased through this channel by the DSC group 
from Guadalajara. The other is the Mariel Cement Plant, the 
operator and trader of which is the Mexican cement company, 
Cemex. 
  The Petroleum agreement will be signed in May, and according 
to the magazine PROCESO, a letter of intent was already signed 
between Mexpetrol [Mexican Petroleum Company] -- the principal 
shareholder of which is the parastate company, Mexican Petroleum 
-- and (Cubec), the Cuban distributor of crude oil. 
  This represents a joint investment of $200 million, to 
modernize and expand the refinery in Cienfuegos, the largest in 
our country. Cuba owes $310 million to Mexico. Through this 
procedure, the Cuban Government will pay another $50 million and 
will guarantee investment. 
  Mexico is the first country with which agreements of this 
type have been signed, which, according to local analysts, 
accords Mexico the status of a nation favored by the Cuban 
Government.
