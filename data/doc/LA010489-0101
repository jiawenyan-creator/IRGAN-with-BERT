COUNCIL VOTES TO OPEN TALKS WITH OIL FIRM 
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to open talks with a major oil 
company to decide whether the company should consolidate its oil drilling 
operations at a 2-block site in the city's old downtown area. 
The 6-month negotiation period approved by the council with South Coast Oil 
Corp. will allow the company and the city to determine the impact of 
consolidating the oil drilling facilities in the area bordered by Walnut and 
Orange avenues and Lake and Second streets, according to Deputy City 
Administrator Douglas La Belle. 
"The purpose of the negotiation is to . . . determine economic feasibility and 
compatibility with surrounding land uses," said La Belle, adding that South 
Coast Oil owns 90% of the scattered oil wells in the residential area where the 
consolidated sites would be located. 
Residents in another Huntington Beach community have filed a lawsuit 
challenging a similar plan in their neighborhood. Concerned Citizens of 
Huntington Beach have alleged that the council violated the city's General Plan 
when it approved Angus Petroleum Corp.'s proposal to consolidate several dozen 
scattered wells onto one site near the intersection of Springfield Avenue and 
California Street. 
Councilwoman Grace Winchell said Tuesday that the consolidated drilling sites 
can be beneficial because they use more powerful drilling equipment to get a 
greater oil yield than smaller wells. In addition, she said, the consolidation 
would enhance city redevelopment efforts by increasing available land when 
scattered wells are capped.
