  [Text] Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
challenged his U.S. counterpart by expressing his preference for 
the Dessalinian [from Dessalines, Haitian freedom fighter, 
credited with winning independence for Haiti] methods. In a 
statement last week during his Canadian tour, Aristide, elected 
on 16 December 1990, reiterated what his recommendation of the 
previous month: Apply `Operation Iron Cuts Iron' and opt for 
Dessalinian methods to dislodge the military from command. 
  President Clinton and his colleagues keenly disapproved of 
these statements, believing that the crisis should not be 
resolved through violence. President Aristide responded that so 
far, diplomacy has not yielded the expected results and it is 
now time to forego the Toussaint Louverture [former Haitian 
general known as the father of Haitian independence] methods, 
and adopt those used by Dessalines.
