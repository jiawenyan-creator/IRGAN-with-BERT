FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: German economic recession 'at bottom'
THE GERMAN economy seems to have reached the bottom of its recession, German
ministers said in Tokyo yesterday.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said the economy appeared to be in the
'bottom of the valley', and Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, indicated
it could be at a turning point.
'I do not want to give the impression that recovery is beginning in
Germany,' Mr Rexrodt said. But said recent indicators had been either
'positive or at least not more negative'.
Mr Rexrodt said business expectations in industry had improved, the consumer
climate had not deteriorated for the past two months and the inflow of
foreign orders had improved.
Mr Rexrodt said the G7 finance ministers had expressed satisfaction with
last week's interest rate cuts in Germany and there was no explicit
criticism of the Bundesbank's interest rate policy.
By contrast, there had been heavy pressure on Japan to expand domestic
demand.
