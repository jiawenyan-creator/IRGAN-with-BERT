TO LIVE AND DIE 
Time and money have been concentrated on AIDS education, research and treatment 
at the expense of many other incurable diseases. Bleach, hypodermic needles and 
condoms are free for the asking -- yet the numbers of those with the virus are 
escalating. 
People do have the privilege of choosing the way they want to live -- but if 
they continually put their lives at risk, do they have the right to increase 
their demands on others who choose not to live by those risks? I think not.
