  [Text] Pristina, January 30 (ATA) -- During their stay in 
Kosova, CSCE representatives and heads of embassies in Belgrade, 
Laura Mirakian (Italy), Dr. Geran Jakobson and Torsten Petre 
(Sweden), who have substituted the observers expelled from 
Kosova last summer, visited the Council for the Defence of Human 
Rights in Pristina. During a talk about the situation of human 
rights in Kosova, CSCE representatives showed interest in the 
political legal proceedings after the arrests among Albanians 
last year as well as the position of the Albanians after the 
measures being adopted in the economic and financial field in 
Serbia and Montenegro. 
  The chairman of the Council for the Defence of Human Rights 
in Pristina, Adem Demaci, reported about the escalation of 
Serbian state repression against unprotected Albanians and added 
that unfortunately international community has not properly 
understood the criminal character of the Serbian regime. Mr. 
Demaci said that through its slow reaction towards the rapid 
Serbian actions, international community has objectively 
supported the aggression. 
  "We do not demand from Europe to send her sons to be killed 
for us. The question is of a military character. Serbia will 
generate war in the region as long as its will be militarily 
stronger. In order to avoid its military superiority, it should 
either be disarmed or others must be armed," Mr. Demaci said. 
  CSCE representatives supported the views presented by M. 
Demaci. They took special interest in the alternative which 
would resolve the crisis. In this context, Mr. Demaci said 
that the military presence of America in Macedonia has prevented 
the spillover of the conflict in the south. But if other 
preventive measures are not taken, the conflict may burst out. 
Serbian acts are irrational.
