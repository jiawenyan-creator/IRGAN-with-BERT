Needed for Peace in Angola"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels (TIJD) -- Without the arrival of 10,000 
UN soldiers, there is no chance whatsoever of a durable peace 
agreement between UNITA [National Union for Total Independence 
of Angola] rebels and the Angolan MPLA [Popular Liberation 
Movement of Angola] Government, Wilfried Martens, EPP [European 
People's Party] chairman said. Martens was speaking after a 
visit to Angola, which is torn by a bloody civil war. New peace 
talks start today, but observers are pessimistic about their 
outcome. 
  Martens met various NGO's [nongovernmental organizations] in 
Angola, both in the capital Luanda and elsewhere. He stayed in 
Malenge, a town with 200,000 inhabitants and 120,000 refugees. 
Malenge is in the hands of government troops and surrounded by 
UNITA rebels. The town depends entirely on air links with 
Luanda for its supplies. Every day, eight Hercules aircraft 
bring food and medicine. The EPP chairman said this was not 
sufficient. 
  The women who leave Malenge in search of manioc risk walking 
on one of the many land mines. "I have seen innumerable victims 
walking round on crutches," Martens said. "After Afghanistan, 
Angola is the country with the most mines." 
  "UN officials say the conflict, which has already lasted 14 
months, was the worst one in 1993," Martens said. At least 
100,000 people died last year. The mortality rate in Angola is 
higher than in other armed conflicts in the world. The Angolan 
Government claims that the international community is ignoring 
the war. 
  "Since the civil war flared up again after the Cold War and 
the withdrawal of the Cubans and Soviets, it is a power struggle 
for control of the country," Martens said. Angola's soil is 
rich in diamonds and oil. Seventy percent of the land is 
eminently suitable for agriculture. Fishing is also an 
important source of income.
