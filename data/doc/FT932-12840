FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Kvaerner to build four LNG ships
Norway's Kvaerner group announced yesterday it had won a record NKr6.5bn
(Pounds 690m) contract to build four LNG carriers for the Abu Dhabi National
Oil Company, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. A-shares shot up on the Oslo stock
exchange by NKr3.50 to NKr194 on the news.
The order brings the net backlog to NKr20bn for Kvaerner's shipbuilding
business. Its Finnish Masa-Yards will build the four, 135,000 cubic metre
ships. Delivery is scheduled from January 1996 to June 1997.
The ships will be used to transport liquified natural gas from Abu Dhabi to
Japan, and are intended to replace five vessels built during 1973-77 by
Kvaerner's Stavanger-based Rosenberg yard.
