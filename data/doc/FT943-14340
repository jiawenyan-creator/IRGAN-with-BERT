FT  15 JUL 94 / Breyer set to win Court post
Judge Stephen Breyer looks set to win Senate approval for his nomination to
the US Supreme Court, writes Ken Warn in Washington.
Mr Breyer was questioned behind closed doors yesterday by the Senate
judiciary committee, apparently without any issues that could damage his
nomination being raised.
Mr Breyer was questioned in open session earlier this week, during which he
trod warily on controversial issues such as abortion and the death penalty.
He told the committee that the Supreme Court had already decided abortion
was legal but refused to be drawn about how the law should be applied. The
death penalty was constitutional, he said.
Mr Breyer, a federal appeals court judge, was nominated by President Clinton
to replace Justice Harry Blackmun.
