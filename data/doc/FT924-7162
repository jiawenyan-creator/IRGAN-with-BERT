FT  18 NOV 92 / Dollars 25bn will end crisis over thrifts
MR ALBERT CASEY, chief executive of the Resolution Trust Corporation,
yesterday said he could complete the overhaul of the US savings and loan, or
thrifts, industry with just Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.5bn) in new funding,
Reuter reports from Washington.
This is the lowest estimate to date of the funds needed to complete the
overhaul, on which the RTC has so far spent Dollars 84bn.
The RTC, set up in 1989, was scheduled to close in 1996, but its activities
have recently been slowed by the failure of Congress to provide new funds.
It has been without new funds since April 1, after the last Congress failed
to vote an additional Dollars 43bn.
Mr Casey said that if he received the new funding quickly he could virtually
finish the process of closing down failed institutions and paying off
insured depositors by the end of 1993.
He said that by the end of next year there would only be Dollars
15bn-Dollars 20bn left in hard-to-sell assets, which could be managed by
existing government agencies. 'We could sunset the whole thing three years
ahead of schedule,' he said.
Mr Casey expects his agency will receive another 50 failed thrifts by the
end of next September, the deadline for failed institutions to be handled by
the RTC.
