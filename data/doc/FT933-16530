FT  02 JUL 93 / Manchester picks operator for arena
OGDEN Entertainment Services of New York has signed a 20-year contract to
operate Manchester's new 20,000-seat, Pounds 49m indoor arena. It will
become the company's flagship for European expansion.
Ogden already operates more than 100 venues throughout the US and Canada.
Manchester's arena - which will be the biggest in Europe - is being built as
part of the redevelopment of the city centre's Victoria Station area and
will open in two years. It will be one of the main venues for the Olympic
Games in the year 2000 if the city stages them.
Mr Frank Russo, Ogden's vice-president for international operations, said
yesterday: 'When you look at this from New York, Manchester jumps out at you
as one of the great virgin markets of the world. It has 6.5m people within
one hour's travel. Also, the city really has got its act together.
'This is going to be a 'must play' venue on the world tour.'
The arena will be used for concerts and family shows as well as sporting
events. Mr Russo expects the US National Basketball Association and National
Hockey League to award European franchises, with Manchester an obvious
contender.
The arena will operate with up to 40 full-time staff and 500 part-timers,
some of whom will be required to work up to 60-hour weeks during the
September-April main season. There will also be about 200 contractual
service providers.
Ticket sales in the first year have been budgeted at more than Pounds 15m,
with 1.7m spectators. Ogden's US experience suggests people spend Pounds 10
each on food, souvenirs and other merchandise at each event.
