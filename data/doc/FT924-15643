FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: S Jerome Pounds 1.2m disposal
S JEROME &amp; Sons (Holdings), the West Yorkshire-based textiles and
electronics group, is selling CMR, a designer and installer of security,
closed-circuit television and telecommunication systems, to Westinghouse,
the US electronics group, for Pounds 1.2m cash.
The amount may be adjusted to take account of CMR's agreed net tangible
assets. Westinghouse will assume performance guarantees amounting to Pounds
790,330 and will take on responsibility for CMR's bank overdraft up to a
maximum of Pounds 3.3m.
For the year to December 31 CMR incurred a Pounds 330,000 pre-tax loss on
turnover of Pounds 17.2m. Its net asset value at that date was Pounds
654,000.
Proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce Jerome's bank borrowings.
Gearing will fall from 74 per cent to about 40 per cent.
