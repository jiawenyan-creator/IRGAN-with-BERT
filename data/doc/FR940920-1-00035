 


The MWC operating standards (GCP) contained in today's proposal are the same as those in the February 11, 1991 NSPS.
The training and certification requirements have changed somewhat. The February 11, 1991 standards require only
provisional certification of MWC chief facility operators and shift supervisors, but today's proposed standards
would require both provisional and then full certification. This change is being proposed because the full operator
certification program is now widely available. In 1991, the program was not widely available. 



Today's proposal also adds a provision to allow provisionally certified control room operators to stand in for the
MWC chief facility operators or shift supervisors in their temporary absence from the MWC. Additionally, today's
proposal would require all MWC chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room operators to complete
the EPA or a State MWC training course. This training course requirement was not included in the February 11, 1991 NSPS.





F. Performance Testing and Monitoring Requirements 





Information related to the performance testing and monitoring requirements for MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), MWC organics (dioxin/furan), PM, opacity, MWC operating practices, and NO

X

 has been published in a previous 

Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991). These same requirements would be adopted by today's proposed NSPS and would
be extended to apply to all MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day. Because the proposed NSPS allows
compliance with a dioxin/furan limit either on a TEQ basis or on a total mass basis, procedures are being proposed for
determining dioxin/furan emissions on a TEQ basis. The mass of each tetra- through octa- chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin
and dibenzofuran congener would be measured by EPA Reference Method 23. Each congener mass would then be adjusted
by the corresponding toxic equivalency factor (TEF; the 1989 NATO international TEF's). Finally, the adjusted congener
masses would be added together to determine dioxins/furans in ng/dscm TEQ. Furthermore, today's proposal would
require both large and small MWC facilities to conduct annual opacity tests using EPA Reference Method 9. This testing
would be in addition to the continuous monitoring of opacity levels. Also, today's proposal allows small MWC facilities
to conduct less frequent testing for dioxin/furan, HCl, and PM emissions if the small facility consistently demonstrates
compliance. More specifically, if three consecutive annual compliance tests for an MWC at a small MWC plant indicate
compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (i.e., dioxins/furans, PM, or HCl), the MWC would be allowed to
wait 3 years before retesting for the pollutant. If the next test conducted in the third year shows compliance with
the emission limit for that pollutant, then the facility could again wait 3 years to test for the pollutant. If noncompliance
with the emission limit for the pollutant occurs, corrective actions would be required to be undertaken and annual
testing would be required to be conducted until 3 consecutive years of compliance with the emission limit is established.
At a minimum, performance tests for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl would be required to be performed for each MWC unit
at small MWC plants every 3 years. All large MWC plants would continue to be required to conduct annual compliance tests.




Annual performance tests to determine compliance with the Cd, Pb, and Hg emission limits would be based on EPA Reference
Method 29. The average emission rates of three or more test runs using this methodology would be used to determine compliance.
The EPA considered the use of EPA Reference Method 101A for Hg testing; however, based on available data, the EPA has
concluded that Method 29 is a better measure of Cd, Pb, and Hg emissions than Method 101A and has therefore proposed
Method 29 for testing MWC's. 



Also, as discussed above for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl, if small plants demonstrate compliance with the Cd, Pb,
and Hg emission limits for 3 consecutive years, they would be allowed to begin testing for these three pollutants every
third year. 



The EPA Reference Method 29 is proposed in a separate part of today's 

Federal Register

. Method 29 is very similar to the method that has been used by the EPA's Office of Solid Waste to measure metals emissions
from boilers cofiring hazardous waste, commonly referred to as the EPA multimetals method. The proposed Method 29
is discussed in section IV.H of this preamble. 



Testing and monitoring requirements for NO

X

 at large MWC's are the same as those contained in the February 11, 1991 

Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5488), and are based on use of a CEMS. 



Annual performance tests to determine compliance with the proposed fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions limits
would be based on EPA Reference Method 22 (3-hour continuous visual observation). The limits would apply at all times
and the tests would be conducted during periods of time when fly ash/bottom ash is transferred from the combustor or
from the air pollution control device to the ash loading area, and when ash is loaded for transportation or is being
transported onsite. 



The data availability requirement for CEMS (SO

2

, NO

X

, CO, and O

2

 (or CO

2

)) has been increased from the 1991 NSPS. Today's proposal would require that valid paired CEMS hourly averages (i.e.,
SO

2

 and O

2

 (or CO

2

), NO

X

 and O

2

 (or CO

2

), and CO and O

2

 (or CO

2

)) be obtained for 75 percent of the hours per day for 90 percent of the days per calendar quarter that the affected facility
is operated and combusting MSW. 


G. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 





The MWC NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 established reporting and recordkeeping requirements for MWC organics
(dioxins/furans), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC acid gases (SO

2

 and HCl), operating practices (CO, load, flue gas temperature, and operator training/certification) and No

X

. These reporting and recordkeeping requirements are discussed in the February 11, 1991 

Federal Register

 notice (56 FR 5488). These same reporting and recordkeeping requirements would be adopted under the proposed NSPS,
with two exceptions. First, dioxins/furans would be recorded and reported on either a total mass basis or a TEQ basis.
Second, if small MWC's meet the criteria allowing them to conduct performance tests for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl
every third year, they would submit a simplified annual report for those years in which testing was not conducted.




Today's proposal also would add reporting and recordkeeping requirements for Cd, Pb, and Hg. The proposed standards
would require that initial and annual compliance reports be submitted for Cd, Pb, and Hg for MWC's at plants with aggregate
capacities above 35 Mg/day. If small MWC's meet the criteria allowing them to conduct performance tests for Cd, Pb,
or Hg every third year, they would be allowed to submit a simplified annual report for those years when a full compliance
test was not required. The proposed NSPS would also require that the amount of activated carbon injected for Hg control
at small and large plants be recorded during MWC operation. 



Initial and annual compliance reports for fly ash/bottom ash visible emissions testing would be required under today's
proposal for both small and large plants.
