a final determination that the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, NJ-PA; Buffalo-Niagara
Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal have attained
the ozone air quality standard by the attainment date of November 15, 1993. These actions are based on monitored air
quality readings of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone during the years 19911993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 28, 1994, the EPA published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38410) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) concerning the reclassification of the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment
area from marginal to moderate. The NPR also proposed a determination that the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton,
NJ-PA; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY marginal nonattainment areas attained
the ozone air quality standard by the attainment date of November 15, 1993. The reclassification and determinations
are based solely on ozone air quality data measured during the 19911993 period. 


The rationale for EPA's proposed action was explained in the NPR and will not be restated here since EPA's final action
does not differ from the proposed action in the NPR. EPA received eleven separate letters submitted by the public in
support of the proposed reclassification of the Poughkeepsie area. No adverse comments were received on the NPR.
Therefore, EPA is finalizing the proposed reclassification of the Poughkeepsie nonattainment area. This rule fulfills
EPA's obligations under Section 181(b)(2) to determine whether the Poughkeepsie area attained the ozone national
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) by its attainment date, and to publish its determination in the 

Federal Register

. 
No comments were received on the proposed attainment determinations of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton,
NJ-PA; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY marginal nonattainment areas. Therefore,
this rule also fulfills EPA's obligation under Section 181(b)(2)(A) which requires the Administrator, shortly
after the attainment date, to determine whether ozone nonattainment areas attained the NAAQS.
