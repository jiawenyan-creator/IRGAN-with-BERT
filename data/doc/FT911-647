FT  10 MAY 91 / Aids compensation award
THE HIGH Court yesterday approved payments totalling Pounds 1.5m to children
among the 1,200 haemophiliacs who contracted the Aids virus after receiving
infected blood products during National Health Service treatment.
Mr Justice Ognall approved compensation of Pounds 21,500 each for 34
children who were infected with the virus and 13 children who had an
infected parent or guardian who died will share in payments of Pounds 60,500
to each family.
The hearing followed last week's agreement between the government and the
haemophiliacs and their families on how an additional out-of-court offer of
Pounds 42m should be distributed.
Of the 1,200 haemophiliacs infected with the virus, about 210 have developed
Aids and more than 140 have died.
