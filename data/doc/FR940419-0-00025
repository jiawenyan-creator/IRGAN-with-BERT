Proposal content. 


* * * * *


(n) 

Special procedures for HUD/VA/RTC properties and scattered site projects.

 (1) PHAs may, in lieu of submission of the complete proposal described in this section, submit a limited proposal if:
the proposal is for the acquisition of properties secured by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage, or owned by HUD,
the Veterans Administration (VA), or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); or the proposal is for a project involving
scattered-site acquisition or a scattered-site conventional new construction or rehabilitation development,
and the proposal has been determined to be eligible for front-end funding pursuant to 941.402(c) or 941.403(c),
and the diversity of ownership of the properties is expected to make site control difficult. 



* * * * *



(x) Certification that the PHA will comply with the following HUD requirements: 
(A) Prevailing wages;
(B) Nondiscrimination requirements; 
(C) Site and neighborhood standards; 
(D) Intergovernmental review; 
(E) Accessibility requirements; 
(F) Relocation requirements; 
(G) Minimum Property Standards (MPS) or Housing Quality Standards (HQS); 
(H) If replacement housing under section 18 is involved, that the housing to be acquired is consistent with the Replacement
Housing Plan approved by HUD; 
(I) Generally, properties constructed prior to 1978 should not be considered; however, if a proposed property was
built prior to 1978, that lead-based paint testing and the determination of the cost feasibility of abatement will
be done before the transfer to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void; and 
(J) Any other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209. 
(2) HUD will review the limited proposal, in accordance with 941.405, and upon approval of the proposal, HUD
will execute the ACC and permit advances for the purposes and amounts described in 941.406(b)(3). The PHA will
select individual 
properties in accordance with its approved limited proposal, but will not acquire a property or make a commitment
to acquire without specific HUD site approval, and a determination that the property, including the resulting total
development cost, is consistent with the approved limited proposal.
