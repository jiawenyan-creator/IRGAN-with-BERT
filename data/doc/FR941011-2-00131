I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change involves the primary broker option in DTC's Institutional Delivery (``ID'') system and
will permit DTC's ID system to be used for the confirmation and affirmation of trades which are to be settled by prime
brokers. The proposed rule change also includes a procedure whereby prime brokers can disaffirm trades which they
previously had affirmed.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the place specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of
the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its letter dated January 25, 1994, to the Prime Brokerage Committee of the Securities Industry Association (``Prime
Brokerage Committee''), the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') specified certain conditions for providing
prime brokerage services, including requiring that the parties to a prime broker arrangement utilize the facilities
of a clearing agency registered pursuant Section 17A of the Act
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 to confirm and affirm prime broker transactions.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 DTC is a clearing agency registered pursuant to Section 17A of the Act. The proposed rule change contains procedures
which will permit DTC's ID system to be used to comply with the Division's prime broker letter and to facilitate the
option of settling affirmed prime broker trades through the National Securities Clearing Corporation's (``NSCC'')
continuous net settlement (``CNS'') system.

</FOOTNOTE>


A prime broker is a broker-dealer participating in the ID system that provides a custodial facility for institutional
customers. Under the proposed rule change, broker-dealers that are members of both DTC and the NSCC and that participate
in DTC's ID system and NSCC's CNS system, will have the option to settle affirmed prime broker trades through the ID
system or through NSCC's CNS system. A common member executing trades on behalf of an institutional customer (``executing
broker'') will report trade details to DTC for initial processing through the ID system. At the time of submission,
the executing broker will be required to determine whether a trade will settle on a trade-for-trade basis through
the ID system or through CNS. If the executing brokers choose the former, the trade will settle through DTC's customary
ID procedures. If the executing brokers chooses to settle the trade through CNS, they will submit a prime broker's
CNS agent ID number to DTC when reporting the details of the trade.

Prime brokers are required to maintain two or more agent ID numbers. One of these numbers will be reserved as a special
number to be used only for trades that are directed to settle through NSCC's CNS system.
