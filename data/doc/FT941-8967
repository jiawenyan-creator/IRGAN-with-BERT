FT  17 FEB 94 / Ministers pressed on auditing rule
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants yesterday called on the
government to ensure that small companies exempted from an annual audit
requirement should still be required to appoint an auditor.
It said an auditor would help to ensure that the standard of filed accounts
and financial discipline in companies was maintained.
