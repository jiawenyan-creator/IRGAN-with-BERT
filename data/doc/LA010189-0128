BUS ASSAILANT ATTACKS OFFICER, IS SHOT, KILLED 
An unidentified 53-year-old Los Angeles man was shot and killed by police 
Saturday after he stabbed an officer with a screwdriver after a disturbance on 
an RTD bus, authorities said. 
Two Los Angeles police officers approached the bus at Vermont Avenue and 8th 
Street about 4 p.m. after receiving reports that a screwdriver-wielding man was 
causing problems on the bus, Lt. William Lewis said. When the suspect got off 
the bus and stabbed Officer Michael Grosso, 31, in the shoulder, then tried to 
stab another officer, Grosso shot him in the chest, Lewis said.
