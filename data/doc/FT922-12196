FT  21 APR 92 / Idle capacity in E Midlands
NEARLY 80 per cent of companies in the East Midlands, one of the most
diversified regions of the UK, worked at less than full capacity during the
first quarter of this year, according to the latest business survey of the
region's chambers of commerce.
The results of the survey, carried out in March and covering 336 companies,
provide scant evidence of any recovery from recession. The number of
companies with under-used capacity has remained fairly constant since 1990.
