FT  08 FEB 92 / Halifax begins mortgage rescue
HALIFAX BUILDING Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, yesterday
announced four initiatives to help customers unable to keep up monthly
mortgage payments and to ease the problems of the housing market.
The move follows a meeting between mortgage lenders and the government late
last year at which the lenders pledged more than Pounds 800m for schemes to
save some of the 160,000 borrowers in serious arrears.
But the scale of the schemes announced is small considering that the lenders
have pledged to save 20,000 homes from repossession this year.
Halifax is to supply an initial Pounds 18m to three housing associations
that will then purchase properties which are either under a repossession
order or likely to be subject to one soon. The occupants of the house will
become tenants of the housing association.
The scheme, described by Halifax as a model for others, will save no more
than 350 homeowners.
Halifax is supplying Pounds 8m to Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association;
Pounds 5m to Hyde Housing Association, a national association; and Pounds 5m
to North British Housing Association, based in Preston, Lancashire.
The society yesterday instructed the three housing associations not to
divulge any details of the return on the loans through rents. However, it is
understood to be less than 5 per cent, with Halifax taking part of any
profit when the property is sold.
Two weeks ago, Nationwide Building Society launched an Pounds 8m rescue
scheme with three other housing associations. The return in that case was
believed to be slightly over 3.5 per cent.
Halifax has also arranged for London and Quadrant Housing Trust and Hyde
Housing Association to lease and manage 400 empty homes in and around
London.
Two more lenders, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Leeds Permanent, are expected to
unveil rescue schemes in the first half of next week.
