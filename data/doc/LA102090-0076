FOR BREA, SAVANNA, IT'S A DRAW 
Savanna High School and Brea-Olinda High School each had three prime scoring 
opportunities but were stopped short of the goal line and played to a 7-7 tie 
in front of about 2,000 homecoming fans in Orange League football action Friday 
at Brea-Olinda High School. 
Brea (1-0-1, 4-2-1) fumbled at the Savanna three as the first quarter came to a 
close. 
Near the end of the first half, Brea was on the Savanna nine only to turn the 
ball over again. Hien Nguyen intercepted quarterback Jason Luevanos' pass in 
the end zone. 
Brea's last chance came with five seconds left when Marco Hernandez missed a 
25-yard field goal attempt. 
Savanna had its chances as well. The Rebels (3-2-2, 0-1-1) were stopped on a 
fourth and one at the Brea four early in the third quarter. Savanna then 
fumbled into the Brea end zone, and the Wildcats' Marc Feine fell on the ball 
for a touchback. 
With 2:22 to play, Feine recovered another Savanna fumble at the Brea six-yard 
line. 
Brea took a 7-0 lead early in the first quarter, driving 78 yards in six plays 
after the opening kickoff. The drive was capped by Luevanos' one-yard run. 
Savanna came back to tie it on a five-yard run by Jeff Ragos with 4:09 left in 
the first half. KEN HILL
