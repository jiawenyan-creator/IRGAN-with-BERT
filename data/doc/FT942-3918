FT  13 JUN 94 / Lucas plant to create 650 jobs
Lucas Industries, a leading automotive components manufacturer, is to
announce today that is to build a plant at Houghton-Le-Spring, Tyne and
Wear, where it will create about 650 jobs in the next 18 months, Kevin Done
writes.
The plant will be built by Lucas SEI Wiring Systems, a joint venture formed
in 1990 between the UK group and Sumitomo Electric Industries of Japan.
The plant will make wiring harnesses and will help to meet growing demand
from Lucas' biggest wiring systems customers - Honda, Rover, Toyota and
Jaguar.
Production at the plant is expected to start early next year and investment
in the project is likely to total between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m.
