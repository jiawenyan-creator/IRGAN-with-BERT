BAKER RULES OUT RETURN TO POLITICIZED UNESCO 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III today ruled out the possibility of an 
early U.S. return to UNESCO membership, saying the U.N. body is still 
mismanaged and excessively politicized. 
Baker said in a report to Congress that UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor 
continues to be haunted by his reputation as a "well-intentioned but poor 
administrator." 
Six years ago the Reagan Administration withdrew from UNESCO, known formally as 
the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Britain and 
Singapore quickly followed suit. 
Renewed membership would cost the United States about $50 million annually. 
Baker said UNESCO at this stage "does not possess the characteristics of a 
well-managed and focused organization." 
A principal U.S. complaint over the years has been that UNESCO tries to limit 
press freedom. 
Baker said in his report that Mayor, after some highly encouraging comments on 
that subject, has since equivocated by stating that press freedoms must be 
"balanced" against the desires of governments to control the flow of 
information. 
Baker also said UNESCO resolutions heavily biased against Israel and often 
based on false information continue to be adopted. 
Baker said that instead of imposing personnel cuts, as he had promised, Mayor 
has proposed a restructuring plan that would create 33 new posts at an 
estimated cost of $6 million. The plan has plunged UNESCO into its worst crisis 
in six years, Baker said.
