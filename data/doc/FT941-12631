FT  28 JAN 94 / Provisions at AT&amp;T and MCI lead to earnings fall
AT&amp;T, the US communications and computing group, yesterday reported a slight
dip in fourth quarter net income after special charges, but a 15 per cent
increase in earnings excluding the provisions.
MCI Communications, its smaller rival in the long-distance market, reported
a 33 per cent drop in fourth quarter earnings after special charges, but a
24 per cent increase excluding the provisions.
AT&amp;T made Dollars 982m, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter, after
previously announced restructuring charges at its NCR computer subsidiary
and a non-cash change in accounting methods. This compared with net income
of Dollars 1bn, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues rose
5.5 per cent to Dollars 18.46bn. Excluding the charges, net income was
Dollars 1.15bn, or 85 cents a share.
The company's biggest business, long-distance telecommunications, saw
calling volumes grow more than 6 per cent from the fourth quarter of last
year, helped by the improving US economy. AT&amp;T, which faces fierce
competition in this market from MCI and other rivals, saw long-distance
revenues rise just 2 per cent to Dollars 9.82bn as customers took advantage
of special discount plans. It has been mounting a campaign to boost
international equipment sales.
NCR, which the group is renaming AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, reported
a 20 per cent rise in sales of computer products and equipment, while its
total revenues rose 7 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn. Excluding Dollars 190m of
pre-tax restructuring charges, it had operating income of Dollars 61m.
For the full year, excluding accounting and restructuring charges, the group
reported net income of Dollars 4.26bn, or Dollars 3.15 a share, on revenues
of Dollars 67.16bn, compared with income of Dollars 3.81bn, or Dollars 2.86
a share, on revenues of Dollars 64.9bn in 1992.
MCI reported fourth quarter earnings of Dollars 107m, or 18 cents a share,
down from Dollars 160m, or 30 cents, in the same period of last year, after
taking a Dollars 150m realignment charge. Excluding the provision, earnings
rose to Dollars 199m, or 34 cents a share. Revenues rose more than 13 per
cent to Dollars 3.13bn. For the full year, MCI reported earnings excluding
charges of Dollars 731m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, up from Dollars 1.11 a
share in 1992.
