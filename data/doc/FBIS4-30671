  [Text] Mr. Wichit Suphinit, the governor of the central 
bank, discussed the fact that the president of the English 
International Organization to Monitor and Control Money 
Laundering will visit Thailand in order to talk with officials 
about promulgating a money-laundering law. He said that the 
central bank does not know anything about this. But in 
principle, the central bank supports promulgating such a law. 
The details of this will have to be discussed to determine how 
this law can be promulgated. 
  "I don't think that the Thai government has much experience 
in such matters. We will try to gain experience by attending 
international conferences on money laundering. There is general 
agreement on this," said Mr. Wichit.
