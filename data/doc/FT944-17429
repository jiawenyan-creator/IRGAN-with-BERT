FT  08 OCT 94 / Pension reform levy attacked
The pensions industry said yesterday that government proposals for funding
new pensions regulation would discourage occupational schemes.
The National Association of Pension Funds criticised Department of Social
Security proposals to make employers pay for the setting up and maintenance
of the proposed pensions regulator.
The NAPF is staking its position in advance of legislation due to come
before parliament this autumn.
The government has put forward plans for a levy on the industry to finance
the estimated Pounds 10m cost of the new office and has estimated the total
burden of the reforms will be between Pounds 60m and Pounds 140m. The
pension funds argue the expense could be 10 times that and may inhibit
occupational pensions.
'Our members support the . . . recommendation that the cost of regulation
should fall on the state,' said Mr Ron Amy, the NAPF chairman. 'It should
not be borne by employers who choose to provide pensions for their
employees.'
The NAPF statement backs the position of the Goode committee on pensions law
reform. The committee, set up after Mr Robert Maxwell had raided his
companies' pension funds, called for an independent state-financed regulator
to ensure there was no repetition of the Maxwell affair.
Goode recommended appointment of a new independent pensions regulator with
the power to intervene and impose sanctions - and financed by the
government. The government took many of the ideas on board in its white
paper but watered down the power and independence of the regulator.
