 

The Commission also believes that sufficient safeguards will be in place to ensure the pricing integrity of both the
ELN and the underlying security. First, each of the requirements currently in place for the listing of ELNs (

i.e., 

market capitalization, trading volume, maximum size of issuance, and U.S. last sale reporting), as enhanced herein,
will apply where the linked security is a security that is traded in the U.S. and is issued by a non-U.S. company. In addition,
the only such securities that can be linked to ELNs are those for which either a comprehensive market information sharing
agreement is in place with the primary market for the security underlying the ELN (in the case of an ADR, with the primary
exchange in the country where the security underlying the ADR primarily trades) or where at least 50% of the worldwide
trading volume in the underlying security and other related securities for the six months prior to issuance occurs
in the U.S. market.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 These standards are more stringent than those the Commission recently found to be adequate with respect to the listing
and trading of options on ADRs where no comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement exists between the Exchange
and the primary market in the country where the security underlying the ADR is primarily traded.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 As the Commission stated in the ADR Approval Order, the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement
serves as a deterrent to manipulation and thus protects the integrity of the marketplace.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, the Commission stated that where the U.S. market is the primary market for the trading of an ADR, the
U.S. market is the relevant pricing market for that ADR.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 In those cases, the Commission stated that a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement exists because the self-regulatory
organizations which make up the U.S. market are members of ISG, through which the Exchange can investigate any potential
manipulations.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, by applying these same standards to ELNs linked to securities that are traded in the U.S. market and are
issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements, the Commission believes the Exchange will
be able to detect and deter potential manipulations involving ELNs and the linked securities.

In no event may an ELN be linked to a security issued by a non-U.S. company where less than 30% of the worldwide trading
volume in the security and all related securities occurs in the U.S. market. See Amendment No. 6, 

supra 

note 5.

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The standards being approved here are more stringent in two respects. First, whereas options may be listed on both
sponsored and unsponsored ADRs satisfying the approved requirements, ELNs may only be linked to sponsored ADRs.
Secondly, in determining whether the U.S. market accounts for at least 50% of the market for the linked security and
all related securities the Exchange must use the trading volume for the prior six months with respect to ELNs, but for
only the prior three months for options on ADRs. See ADR Approval Order, 

supra 

note 13.

Moreover, the Commission believes that the proposed method described above for determining whether the six-month
trading volume
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 of the underlying security and all related securities in the U.S. market is at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume
of such securities is adequate to ensure that the U.S. market is and continues to be the price discovery market for the
security underlying an ELN. The Commission notes that these procedures are substantively the same as those the Commission
approved in the ADR Approval Order.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, limiting the term of ELNs linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies to no more than three years
will increase the likelihood that the U.S. market will remain the primary price discovery market for the underlying
linked security during the term of the ELNs.

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
See ADR Approval Order, 

supra 

note 13. The ELN requirements, however, do not have a U.S. volume maintenance standard similar to that required for
options on ADRs. Because a particular series of ELNs is issued at one time for a set term it would be difficult to apply
such a standard. The Commission, however, believes that the other requirements discussed above will help ensure
that the U.S. is the relevant market for the ELNs.
</FOOTNOTE>


Finally, the Exchange will require for ELNs linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies that there be at least
2,000 holders of the underlying security and that the size of such ELN issuances will be limited to (i) 2% of the total
shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least 30% of the worldwide trading volume for the security
for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market, (ii) 3% of the total shares of the underlying security
outstanding provided at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing
occurred in the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total shares of the underlying security outstanding provided at least
70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security for the six-months prior to listing occurred in the U.S. market.
The Commission believes that these restrictions will minimize the possibility that trading in an ELNs issuance will
adversely impact the market for the security to which it is linked.

Additionally, the Exchange has agreed to consult with the Commission prior to issuing an ELN overlying an Amex-traded
security. See Letter from Claire McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex,
to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Office, Division, Commission, dated August 18, 1994.
</FOOTNOTE>


In summary, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act because: (1) There is nothing in the
trading history of ELNs which raises any regulatory concerns with respect to expanding the ELNs listing standards
to include ELNs linked to securities (including sponsored ADRs) that are traded in the U.S. on a national securities
exchange or through NASDAQ and that are issued by non-U.S. companies subject to U.S. reporting requirements; (2)
the proposed rule change adequately safeguards the pricing integrity of both the ELN and the underlying security
and ensures that there is sufficient surveillance to detect as well as deter manipulation; and (3) the existing regulatory
structure and issuer requirements for ELNs, as enhanced herein, will be applied and will ensure that ELNs will continue
to be linked to highly capitalized companies.
