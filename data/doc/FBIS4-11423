<F P=106> [Report by Granma Province correspondent Jorge Luis Batista] </F>
  [Text] A meeting was held yesterday in Bayamo at the 
headquarters of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC] to analyze the progress of the sugar harvest 
during the second 10 days of April. Alfredo Enriquez Pina, the 
PCC's top leader in Granma Province, called for increasing 
efforts during the final phase of the harvest so that the 
province will be able to fulfill its production plan at the end 
of May. 
  Enriquez Pina confirmed that even after grinding is finished 
at a given mill, the forces will be maintained, (?working) in 
cane recovery and supporting the end of the sugar harvest at any 
mills that may require support. Enriquez also stressed the need 
to pay careful attention to self-sufficiency at Basic 
Cooperative Production Units and small farmers cooperatives, and 
he suggested studying the possibility of the mills' generating 
electricity once the grinding is finished. 
  Enriquez, who is PCC first secretary in Granma Province and 
a 
member of the Central Committee, said, moreover, that we must 
increase the use of animal-powered equipment, and he called for 
giving top priority to planting and weeding cane and to 
miscellaneous food crops. 
  During this check on the progress of the harvest, the 
managers of Granma Province agroindustrial complexes explained 
that the power outages and the rains continue to conspire 
against the sugar harvest but that the workers are continuing 
their work at all posts in a dedicated manner with a view to 
enabling the province to fulfill its technical-economic plan. 
  I also report that Granma will be the site of the 
(?national) 
miscellaneous crops management council today and tomorrow [23-24 
April]. The participants in this meeting will tour miscellaneous 
crops areas of Manzanillo and Bayamo Municipalities today. 
Tomorrow, the miscellanous crops management council will meet at 
the headquarters of the PCC Provincial Committee in Bayamo.
