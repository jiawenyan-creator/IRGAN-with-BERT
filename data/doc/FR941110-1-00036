ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 
 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This recommended decision proposes the issuance of a marketing agreement and order for Walla Walla Sweet Onions in
southern Washington and northeast Oregon. For the purposes of this document, the term ``Walla Walla Sweet Onions''
refers to sweet onions grown in the proposed production area, which consists of designated parts of Walla Walla County,
Washington, and designated parts of Umatilla County, Oregon. The proposed order and agreement would authorize production
and marketing research and marketing development and promotion projects, including paid advertising, and would
authorize container markings. The order would be administered by a ten-member committee consisting of six producer
members, three handler members, and a public member. The order would be financed by assessments on handlers of Walla
Walla Sweet Onions grown in the production area. A primary objective of this program would be to improve producer returns
by strengthening consumer demand through various promotional activities and by reducing production and marketing
costs through production and marketing research. Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers would vote in a referendum to
determine if they favor issuance of the proposed marketing order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior documents in this proceeding: Notice of Hearing, issued October 26, 1993, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 29, 1993 [58 FR 58105]. 
 

This administrative action is governed by the provisions of sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code,
and is therefore excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 
 

Preliminary Statement:

 Notice is hereby given of the filing with the Hearing Clerk of this recommended decision with respect to a proposed
marketing agreement and order regulating the handling of sweet onions grown in the Walla Walla Valley of Southeast
Washington and Northeast Oregon. This notice is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601674], hereinafter referred to as the Act, and the applicable
rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders 
[7 CFR Part 900]. 
 The proposed Federal marketing agreement and order (order) were formulated on the record of a public hearing held
at the Education Service District Building in Walla Walla, Washington, on November 15, 1993. The hearing was held
pursuant to the provisions of the Act. Approximately 25 witnesses, including Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers,
handlers, and a Washington State University researcher, testified in support of the order. Proponents emphasized
that Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers need a Federal marketing order to effectively compete with other sweet onion
producing areas. No one present at the hearing testified in opposition to the proposed order. At the close of the hearing,
January 15, 1994, was established as the date by which briefs, statements, and proposed corrections to the transcript
were due. None were filed.
