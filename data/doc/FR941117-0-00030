ACTION: 

Final rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These final rules interpret section 20 of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, as amended by section
303(e) of the Family Support Act of 1988, and section 8003 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. The 1984
law extended Medicaid coverage for a period of four months to certain dependent children and adult relatives who become
ineligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) as a result, wholly or partly, of the collection or increased
collection of child or spousal support under title IVD of the Social Security Act (the Act). The regulations
are applicable to the AFDC and Medicaid programs in all jurisdictions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Statutory Authority


Section 20 of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98378) amended both the AFDC and
Medicaid titles of the Act. Title IVA (AFDC) was amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to section 406 of the Act.
This new paragraph provides that: ``[e]ach dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is living (including
the spouse of such relative as described in subsection (b)), who becomes ineligible for aid to families with dependent
children as a result (wholly or partly) of the collection or increased collection of child or spousal support under
Part D, and who has received such aid in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which such
ineligibility begins, shall be deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children for purposes of
title XIX for an additional four calendar months beginning with the month in which such ineligibility begins.''
Section 20 of Public Law 98378 also amended section 1902(a)(10(A)(i)(I) to require Medicaid coverage of eligible
individuals pursuant to section 406(h) of the Act. Both amendments apply only to those individuals who became ineligible
for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984, the date of enactment of Public Law 98378, and before October 1, 1988, and
who received AFDC in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month of ineligibility.
Section 303(e) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (Public Law 100485) amended section 20 of the Child Support
Enforcement Amendments of 1984 to extend for one year, through September 30, 1989, the authority of this provision.
Section 8003 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law 101239) removed the sunset date for
this section, thus making it a permanent provision of the Act.


Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)


A NPRM was published in the 

Federal Register 

on November 27, 1992 (57 FR 56294), amending 45 CFR Part 233 and 42 CFR Parts 435 and 436 to set forth the circumstances
under which individuals become eligible for the four-month period of extended Medicaid coverage because they have
lost AFDC as a result (wholly or partly) of the collection or increased collection of child or spousal support. The
proposed rules interpreted the statute to require either the new receipt of, or an increase in, the collection of child
or spousal support which renders the family ineligible for AFDC.
As required by statute, the proposed rules provide that individuals must have received AFDC in at least three of the
six months immediately preceding the month in which AFDC ineligibility begins in order to qualify for the extended
Medicaid coverage. As we pointed out in the preamble to the proposed rules, individuals who do not actually receive
an AFDC payment for any month because of the rounding of the payment amount to zero, the recoupment of an overpayment,
or the elimination of payments for those who are eligible for amounts less than $10 are deemed to be AFDC recipients
for that month for purposes of determining eligibility for continued Medicaid coverage under this provision.
Also under the proposed rules, continued Medicaid under this provision ends for any individual family member who
moves to another State. In the preamble to the proposed rules, we stated that Medicaid ends effective with the month
following the month the individual moves to the new State. Although benefits end when an individual moves to another
State, eligibility can be reinstated in the State in which he or she was entitled to the extended coverage if the individual
re-establishes residence there before the end of the four-month period. It was the Department's view that extended
Medicaid benefits are available only in the State in which the family became ineligible for AFDC benefits. For example,
if a family moved to another State in March, the first month of the extended period, and moved back in May, the third month
of the extended period, they would be eligible for extended Medicaid benefits for the months of May and June.
