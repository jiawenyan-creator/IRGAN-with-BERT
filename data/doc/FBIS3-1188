  [Text] The topic under discussion at the peace talks in 
Lusaka, Zambia, is still national reconciliation. The National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] still insists 
on its way. Our correspondent Joao Ligio reports: 
  [Ligio] The discussion of specific principles for national 
reconciliation entered its fifth week today with the same 
routine of exploratory contacts and no fruitful results. This 
morning, the Black Cockerel's men drafted a new text in which 
they accept the government's proposal, with the condition that 
the following is added: Three more provinces, three ministries, 
and three districts, all in the central plateau. This proposal 
was, however, immediately turned down by the mediator without 
the need to consult the government delegation. 
  This afternoon, the mediator handed the parties the final 
version, which includes all principles, even those on which the 
parties disagree. The parties must present their reactions to 
this document by tomorrow, since the mediator is adopting a time 
limit for consideration.
