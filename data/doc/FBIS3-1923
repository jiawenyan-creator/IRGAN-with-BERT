  [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of 
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), today called for 
the CPC to enhance development of theory. 
  At an opening ceremony of a new session of the central party 
school, Hu said that the Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Marxism of 
contemporary China, and it serves as the scientific guide for 
the progress of China. 
  This session of the party school has enlisted more than 
2,600 
officials and army officers, including officials at minister and 
provincial governor level. 
  He noted that there will inevitably be some complicated 
problems and difficulties in the process of socialist 
construction, especially in the process of accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. 
  He said that the real understanding of the theory of 
building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics will help unify the 
thinking of party members, correctly handle the relations 
between the reforms, development and stability, and overcome 
various social contradictions. 
  He also urged the attendants to the party school to study 
the 
theory and basic knowledge of a socialist market economy so as 
to raise their capabilities in work on the socialist market 
economic sector.
