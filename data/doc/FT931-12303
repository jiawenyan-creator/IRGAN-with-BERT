Dollars 370m at year-end
UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, yesterday reported an after-tax
loss of Dollars 223.9m in the fourth quarter of 1992.
This large deficit in the final three months takes UAL's loss for the year
to Dollars 370m, before including charges for accounting-related changes.
The fourth-quarter figure, on operating revenues of Dollars 3.2bn, against
Dollars 2.91bn, comes after pre-tax charges and expenses of Dollars 62m.
Excluding these items, UAL said the loss would have stood at Dollars 184m.
The full-year loss widened to Dollars 956.8m after taking in charges related
to the change in the accounting methods for non-pension retirement benefits.
In 1991, the after-tax deficit was Dollars 331.9m. Full-year revenues stood
at Dollars 12.9bn in 1992, compared with Dollars 11.7bn in the previous 12
months.
In terms of operating results, UAL saw minimal improvement in final-quarter
results - with the operating loss standing at Dollars 326m, compared with
Dollars 347.2m in the same period of 1991.
For the year overall, the operating loss widened from Dollars 494.1m to
Dollars 537.8m.
UAL's poor fourth-quarter figures were echoed at Delta Air Lines.
Delta posted a net loss of Dollars 126.3m in the the second quarter of its
financial year, with a Dollars 187.6m deficit in the same period of 1991.
Revenues were Dollars 2.87bn, compared with Dollars 2.62bn.
The operating loss for the period was Dollars 194.9m, against Dollars 236.8m
in the same period of 1991.
In the first six months of its current financial year, Delta now shows an
after-tax loss of Dollars 233m, compared with a Dollars 174.5m deficit at
the same stage a year ago. Six-month revenues stand at Dollars 5.94bn,
against Dollars 5.2bn.
Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, also reported losses for
1992 overall and for the fourth quarter.
The annual deficit after tax was Dollars 125.3m, compared with a Dollars
305.7m loss in 1991, with the operating loss reduced from Dollars 218.9m to
