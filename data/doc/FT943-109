FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster cleared for Viacom
deal
Shareholders in Blockbuster Entertainment, the US video rental group,
yesterday narrowly voted to merge with Viacom, the entertainment group, a
deal which appeared to be on the rocks only weeks ago.
The deal was approved by holders of 57.7 per cent of Blockbuster's shares.
An agreement, valuing the company at Dollars 7.5bn at yesterday's market
price, was an important element in Viacom's financial strategy after it bid
Dollars 10bn for Paramount. Blockbuster's strong cashflow was to be used by
Viacom to help service the substantial debt taken on with the acquisition.
The deal was thrown into doubt, however, by a steep fall in Viacom's share
price earlier this year. The non-voting B shares tumbled from Dollars 45 at
the start of the year to Dollars 21 3/4 , eroding the value of the all-share
transaction for Blockbuster's shareholders.
