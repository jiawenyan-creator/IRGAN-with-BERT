  [Text] Kampala, 25 Jan (KNA)--Two more Burundi Army 
officers who allegedly led the 21 October 1993 abortive coup 
d'etat, in which President Melchior Ndadaye was killed, have 
fled to Uganda, raising the number to four, according to the 
state-run daily NEW VISION. 
  In its Monday issue, the daily quoted Burundi Embassy 
officials in Kampala as saying that apart from Major Bernard 
Busokoza and Lieutenant Paul Kamana who fled to Uganda in 
November, "We have also learnt about the presence of two others 
in Kampala." He said one was a commando but promised to reveal 
their names later in the week. 
  Bujumbura alleges that Busokoza and Kamana entered Uganda 
through Zaire after the coup, in which President Ndadaye was 
killed on 21 October, had collapsed. 
  The embassy officials further claim that the four wanted 
officers are moving with forged Zairian passports and fake 
names. "At least we have seen them several times at Sheraton and 
Speke hotels in Kampala," they alleged in the interview with the 
NEW VISION. 
  Last Wednesday [19 January], the Burundi ambassador in 
Uganda, Leonidas Havyarimana, called on Uganda's internal 
security organization, ISO, chief Brigadier Jim Muhwezi and 
reportedly raised the same issue. Muhwezi is reported to have 
assured the envoy of Uganda's readiness to track down the wanted 
officers. 
  Uganda and Burundi have no extradition treaty, but on 2 
January, Muhwezi said if the coup plotters are captured here, 
then international law will be applied or other diplomatic 
avenues will be explored. 
  Other sources say President Yoweri Museveni had also assured 
Bujumbura authorities, who visited him on 30 December, that the 
suspects would be apprehended if found in Uganda. 
  Maj. Busokoza, who is said to be in his forties, had until 
the coup been managing director of Burundi Telecommunications. 
Kamana, described as a young officer in his thirties, was a 
paratrooper.
