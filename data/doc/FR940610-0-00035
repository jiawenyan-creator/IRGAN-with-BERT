SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 14, 1993, (58 FR 65309), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland.
The NPR proposed approval of an Oxygenated Gasoline Program in the State of Maryland. A formal SIP revision was submitted
by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992. 





Specific requirements of the Oxygenated Gasoline Program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained
in the NPR and will not be restated here. No comments were received on the NPR.



Final Action


EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992, which implements an Oxygenated
Gasoline Program in the State. The SIP revision consists of revisions to Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 03.03.05,
and COMAR 26.11.13 and new regulations codified at COMAR 03.03.06 and COMAR 26.11.20. Nothing in this action should
be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state
implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately
in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements.

This action was originally classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under
the procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 22142225). However, in an October 4, 1993 memorandum, the Acting Assistant Administrator
for Air and Radiation, Michael H. Shapiro, revised these SIP tables so that Table 2 final actions on which no adverse
comments were received on the proposed rule may be delegated to Table 3 actions. No comments were received concerning
this action; therefore, under the new guidelines, this final action may be classified as a Table 3 action. On January
6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of
section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request.
This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993. 


Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve Maryland's Oxygenated
Gasoline Program must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994.
Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this
rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may
be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in
proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act.)
