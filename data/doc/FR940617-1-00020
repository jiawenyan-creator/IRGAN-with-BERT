1.3 

Address Placement 


Addresses and address labels must be visible. Subject to the general standards in A010, addresses or address labels
may be placed on wrappers (on a flat side, not on the fold); label carriers; subscription order, renewal, gift, or request
forms or receipts; incidental First-Class attachments; or supplements, but only if those items and the host second-class
publication are enclosed within a plastic wrapper (polybag). The delivery address must parallel the length of a letter-size
mailpiece, as defined in C010.

1.0 

Minimum and Maximum Dimensions 



1.1 

Determining Length and Height 



Except as provided by 1.6, mailpiece length and height are determined as follows: 

a. For pieces having three different dimensions, the longest dimension of a mailpiece is its length (horizontal dimension);
the next longest, its height (vertical dimension); the shortest, its thickness. 

b. For pieces having two equal dimensions: 

(1) If the third dimension is longer than the equal dimensions, it is the mailpiece's length (horizontal dimension);
the remaining dimensions are its height and thickness. 

(2) If the third dimension is shorter than the equal dimensions, it is the mailpiece's thickness; of the remaining
dimensions, the length is the dimension parallel to the address as read; the height is the remaining dimension. 

c. For pieces having three equal dimensions, or having an irregular shape, or requiring a specific orientation because
of the contents, the location and orientation of the address on the mailpiece establish which dimensions are its height
and length. The length is the dimension parallel to the address as read; the height is perpendicular to the length on
the address side of the piece.

1.4 

Maximum 



No single addressed mailpiece may exceed 70 pounds or 108 inches in length and girth combined. Girth is the total distance
around the mailpiece, measured at its thickest part, perpendicular to its length. 



1.5 

Nonmailable 



Except for keys and identification devices, all pieces not meeting the minimum size standards above are nonmailable.




1.6 

Other Standards 



Mailpieces to be claimed at the Barcoded rate for flats are subject to the definitions of length and height in C820 (rather
than 1.1). The standards for specific classes or rates may prescribe higher minimum and/or lower maximum size and
weight limits than those stated above.

1.8 

Top and Bottom 



For single-piece rate mail and pieces eligible for and claimed at the Barcoded or third-class carrier route rate for
flats, the top and bottom of a letter- or flat-size mailpiece are its upper and lower edges, respectively, when the
delivery address is oriented to be read. For other mail, the top and bottom of a letter- or flat-size mailpiece are its
upper and lower edges, respectively, when the mailpiece is positioned with the length horizontal.
