Leonid Kravchuk, who arrived in Hungary to attend Prime Minister 
Jozsef Antall's funeral today, held talks with U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore in Budapest. 
  Kravchuk told MTI that the negotiations had focused on 
bilateral ties. The politicians outlined their position on the 
START-1 Treaty and the elimination of nuclear weapons. 
  Kravchuk stressed that they held identical views on the main 
issues. Ukraine confirmed its commitment to become a 
nuclear-free state. This would solve a lot of problems for both 
Ukraine and the whole world, he said. 
  The Ukrainian president stressed the need for a trilateral 
agreement to be concluded between Ukraine, Russia and the United 
States. If this agreement guarantees political, economic, 
scientific and technical cooperation, it will be as important as 
the previous bilateral agreements were, namely it will 
contribute to the destruction of nuclear weapons, the president 
said. 
  Kravchuk and Gore agreed that Ukraine's economic crisis 
could 
be eased through bilateral and multilateral cooperation. 
  In conclusion, the Ukrainian president said he was satisfied 
with the negotiations.
