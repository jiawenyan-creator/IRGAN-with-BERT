FT  28 JUL 94 / Redwood rapped on policy stance
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, was yesterday accused of pursuing his
personal rightwing agenda against the grain of government policy by
announcing that housing associations in Wales would no longer be allowed to
buy private-sector property.
Mr Redwood, who has contradicted government policy in the past, said that
the policy of allowing housing associations to buy property was against the
Tories' 'right-to-buy' principle.
In a statement, he said that Welsh housing associations would be encouraged
to expand their low-cost ownership schemes, saying that they should be
'building new homes not buying existing properties'.
He added: 'The idea that social housing can only be rented was one of the
oddest of British social policy.'
However one government official described Mr Redwood's ideas as
'ideologically-driven drivel'.
Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrats' housing spokesman, said that Mr
Redwood was 'set on undermining government policy with his own rightwing
agenda'.
Mr Redwood's statement contradicted the government's decision nearly two
years ago to allow housing associations to buy private property in order to
stimulate the property market.
Housing for Wales, the agency which funds and supervises housing
associations in the principality, was given a grant of Pounds 35m to buy
unsold private houses.
Under the initiative, 27 housing associations in Wales bought a total of
1,198 homes from the private sector.
However, government officials have said that such purchases in England and
Wales are only a fraction of total housing association expenditure, most of
which is on new building projects.
