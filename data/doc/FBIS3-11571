  [Text] Judge Advocate Lieutenant Lester Gallo has ordered 
that General Humberto Ortega be placed under house arrest after 
Ortega was interrogated as a witness. The warrant states that 
Gen. Ortega cannot leave Managua without prior authorization of 
the judge advocate. 
  Prior to his interrogation, Gen. Ortega had left [deposito] 
his post in order to face the trial at the General Headquarters 
Secretariat of the Sandinist People's Army, which is headed by 
Colonel Alvaro Baltodano Cantarero. 
  Major General Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo has immediately taken 
over as chief of the Army. Cuadra Lacayo is also chief of the 
general staff and second in command of the Army. 
  The military chief said that the charges by the Genie family 
against the Army and his person are following the interests of 
extreme rightist sectors that want to destroy the military 
organization and him personally.
