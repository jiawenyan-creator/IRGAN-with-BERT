FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Ireland
Voting Today. Domestic issues such as unemployment and taxes have tended to
dominate the campaign, but the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition seems unlikely
to suffer from a protest vote.
Apart from Democratic Left, which is the most Euro-sceptic party fighting
the election, the main parties agree on the need for monetary union. Labour
and Fianna Fail, the centre-right party led by Mr Albert Reynolds, prime
minister, also place great emphasis on the need for strong EU social and
employment policies.
The opposition Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats have tried to discredit
the coalition over a controversial passports-for-investments scheme.
LIKELY RESULT: Fianna Fail, topping the polls in all four constituencies, is
set to win seven of the 15 seats, one more than 1989. Fine Gael is
struggling to keep its four and could lose one. Division in the Progressive
Democrats could result in it losing its only seat to an independent.
