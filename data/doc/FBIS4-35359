  [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has again referred to 
his agreement with Israel in the context of Muhammad's with the 
Quraish infidels 1,500 years ago. This time, 'Arafat was 
addressing a meeting of Palestinian contractors in Tunisia. 
  Suggesting that the PLO-Israel agreement was only temporary, 
he said that what had happened was not all they had wanted but 
it was the best they could get at the worst time. 
  'Arafat also told Palestinian businessmen that he wants them 
to become economic tigers. He claimed the average of $440 
million in international aid per year was not enough for the 
Palestinians' urgent needs.
