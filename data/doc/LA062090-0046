SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
A committee of the California Energy Commission will hold a public hearing 
Thursday to allow testimony on SDG&amp;E's proposal to build an additional 
power plant next to its existing plant in Chula Vista. 
SDG&amp;E says the proposed $600-million plant would serve about 331,000 homes. 
The plant site is one of five in Southern California proposed by the utility 
for a combined-cycle project, in which the output of the five plants would be 
combined to distribute power as needed. 
The hearing begins at 10 a.m. at the City Council chambers.
