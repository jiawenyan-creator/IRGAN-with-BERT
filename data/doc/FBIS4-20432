Technology Research and Development Center To Be Built in 
Zhengzhou''] 
  [Summary] Following upon smooth advances in the 
industrialization of the HJD-04 stored-program-controlled (SPC) 
digital telephone switch [technical details of which are given 
in JPRS-CST-92-018, 9 Oct 92 p 28], the State Science and 
Technology Commission (SSTC) recently approved the establishment 
of a Digital Switching Systems State Engineering Technology 
Research and Development Center (SERC) built around the [PLA] 
General Staff's Institute of Information Engineering [in 
Zhengzhou]. Since the HJD-04 was first put into mass production 
(beginning of 1993), over 600,000 lines of this 
60,000-equivalent-line system have been marketed [as of end of 
1993], and over 160 telephone offices have been connected. This 
new SERC will primarily engage in HJD-04 R&amp;D, 
commercialization, 
systems evaluation, and technical training.
