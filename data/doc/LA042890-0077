SENATORS APPROVE ABORTION-RIGHTS BILL 
The state Senate approved a bill guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion and 
repealing Connecticut's unenforced anti-abortion statutes. 
The measure requires counseling for girls 15 and under before getting an 
abortion and encourages them to tell their parents. It now goes to Gov. William 
A. O'Neill, who has said he will sign it. The bill effectively codifies into 
state law much of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision. It 
allows abortions late in pregnancy -- when the fetus is capable of living 
outside the womb -- only when the life or health of the mother is in danger.
