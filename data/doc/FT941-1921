FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bupa advances 13% to Pounds 41.2m
Bupa, Britain's largest private medical insurer, achieved a 13 per cent
improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 41.2m for the year to end-December
1993.
The figure, which compared with Pounds 36.5m for 1992, was struck after
taking account of a Pounds 4.9m rise in exceptional costs to Pounds 18.9m.
The underwriting surplus grew to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 7.6m) before
exceptionals, because of an improvement in the loss ratio, which expresses
benefits paid as a percentage of subscription income. The ratio figure for
1993 was 81.1 per cent compared with 82.2 per cent in 1992.
The results show a continued strengthening from 1990, when the association
incurred a loss of Pounds 38.2m, and 1991 when there was a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 1.3m.
Exceptional costs reflected the restructuring of Sanitas, the group's
Spanish subsidiary, and property write-downs in the UK.
Reserves grew by Pounds 79.9m to Pounds 429m last year and the group's
solvency ratio increased from 43 per cent to 53 per cent.
Operating profits from the health services division, which runs hospitals,
screening centres and nursing homes, improved from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds
25.7m. The advance was attributed mainly to greater efficiency.
Bupa's market share has fallen in recent years as new providers have entered
the market. According to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission its share has
declined from 59 per cent in 1985 to 44 per cent in 1992.
However, the group says its customer base has now stabilised and if, as
appears likely, the market has contracted overall this year, that may mean
its market share has improved slightly.
There was considerable speculation last year that Bupa was planning to swap
its provident association status for a market listing, but the group now
says it has no plans to go public in the near future.
