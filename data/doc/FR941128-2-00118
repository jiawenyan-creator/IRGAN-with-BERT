<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Modification of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed modification to the consent
decree in 

United States 

v. 

Accurate Partitions Corp., et al.,

 Civil Action No. S9100646M, was lodged on October 19, 1994 with the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Indiana. The 

Accurate Partitions

 decree, which was entered by the Court on February 27, 1992, resolves the United States' claims under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (``CERCLA'') against the Settling Defendants and the
Settling 

De Minimis

 Defendants for environmental contamination at the Fisher-Calo Superfund Site in LaPorte County, Indiana (``Fisher-Calo
Site'').

The proposed modification to the 

Accurate Partitions

 decree adds Lincoln Foodservice Products, Inc. (``Lincoln'') and Amphenol Corporation (``Amphenol'') as Settling


De Minimis

 Defendants to the decree. The United States filed its First Amended Complaint in this case on October 19, 1994, adding
Lincoln and Amphenol as defendants in this action. When this action was commenced, Lincoln and Amphenol were not named
as defendants in the United States' complaint, nor were they included as Settling 

De Minimis

 Defendants in Appendix 5 of the consent decree. Nevertheless, these two companies paid their allocable shares of
response costs to the Settling Defendants pursuant to Section XXVII of the consent decree, as if they had signed the
decree. This proposed modification to the decree would add Lincoln and Amphenol to Appendix 5 of the decree as Settling


De Minimis

 Defendants, if the following condition is satisfied: that the Settling Defendants pay to the United States the sum
of $25,000 of the $115,262 total amount that Lincoln and Amphenol previously paid to the Settling Defendants pursuant
to Section XXVII of the consent decree.

The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed modification to the 

Accurate Partitions

 consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural Resources
Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to 

United States

 v. 

Accurate Partitions Corp., et al.,

 (N.D. Ind.) and DOJ Ref. No. 90112549.

The proposed modification to the decree may be examined at the office of the United States Attorney, Northern District
of Indiana, 301 Federal Building, 204 South Main Street, South Bend, Indiana 46601; the Region V office of U.S. EPA,
77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 606043590; and at the Consent Decree Library, 1120 G St., NW., 4th
Floor, Washington, DC 20004, (202) 6240892. Copies of the proposed modification to the 

Accurate Partitions

 consent decree may be obtained in person or by mail from the Consent Decree Library. In requesting a copy please enclose
a check in the amount of $.75 (25 cents per page reproduction costs) payable to ``Consent Decree Library.''
