IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION DECLINES 
Americans will smoke fewer cigarettes this year than in any year since 1942, 
according to a projection by an economist at the Agriculture Department, which 
oversees tobacco growing in the United States. 
Per capita cigarette consumption is expected to fall to 2,936 pieces in 1989 
from 3,096 in 1988, versus 2,585 in 1942, Verner Grise, an economist at the 
department, said at an agricultural outlook conference last week. 
"This would be the lowest since 1942 and 32% below the 1963 peak," he said. 
Grise predicted that cigarette consumption may fall an average 2% to 3% a year 
over the next several years. He said wholesale price increases for cigarettes, 
prospects for higher taxes, increased smoking restrictions and other 
anti-smoking activities could contribute to further drops in the U.S. rate of 
smoking. 
Grise said smokers have been limited sharply recently because 42 states now 
either prohibit smoking in certain places or segregate smokers and nonsmokers. 
Although cigarette use is declining or stagnant in the United States and in 
Western Europe, Canada and Japan, increased consumption in populous China would 
keep world output up, Grise said. Last year China produced 1.53 trillion 
cigarettes.
