WORLD; 
STRIKERS HIT BULGARIAN REGIME 
Tens of thousands of workers walked off their jobs today, responding to an 
appeal by the opposition trade union for a general strike aimed at forcing 
Socialist Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov to resign. 
There were conflicting reports about the extent of the protest. But the walkout 
called by the Podkrepa labor federation was apparently limited to about 10% of 
the nation's work force of 4.5 million. 
"The political tension in this country has reached threatening dimensions, and 
its further escalation is impermissible," Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for 
President Zhelyu Zhelev, said on Bulgarian Radio.
