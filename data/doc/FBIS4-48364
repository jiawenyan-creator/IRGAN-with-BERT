  [Text] Harare May 15 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU 
[Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic Front]) on 
Sunday held a warm-up rally to the 1995 general elections 
campaign and sent out an impassioned plea to the electorate to 
register as voters during the current exercise which ends on 
June 4. 
  The ZIANA news agency reports speakers also unleashed 
vitriolic attacks on minority parties, which in their own 
on-going 1995 election campaigns are lashing out at ZANU(PF) for 
what they call mismanagement of the economy. 
  The rally, which was the first of the meetings to be 
convened 
by the ruling party's Harare Province as a build-up to the 1995 
elections, drew a crowd of more than 5,000 from five Mbare 
Districts. Supporters from nearby Sunningdale also turned up. 
  The only damper to what had promised to be a thrilling 
marathon rally was the absence of the main speaker, the 
flamboyant ZANU(PF) Harare Provincial Chairman Herbert 
Ushewokunze. Party Provincial Secretary Tony Gara said Mr 
Ushewokunze's vehicle had broken down at Shangaani, 100km from 
Bulawayo, on Sunday morning while he was on his way to the rally.
