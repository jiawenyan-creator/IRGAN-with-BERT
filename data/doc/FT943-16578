Karachi, Istanbul and Caracas are the least expensive cities for executives,
according to Business Traveller magazine. Tokyo and Moscow are the most
expensive, while London is 13th on the list of the dearest destinations and

hotel with continental breakfast. It also takes into account soft drinks,
taxis and other incidental costs.
The daily costs in Tokyo are about Pounds 319, in London they are just over
Pounds 200, while the Dublin figure is about Pounds 155.
Those looking for a cheap stay could try Caracas (Pounds 84 a day), Karachi
