FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAA advance

figures for September.

keen following last week's better than expected traffic showing from British
Airways.

moving up 10 to 243p, while SG Warburg jumped 23 to 610p. Buy
recommendations from Smith New Court helped drive Kleinwort Benson 16 better
to 449p and Schroders up 10 to 1323p.
Standard Chartered was the star turn in the banks with the shares
aggressively bought after a profits upgrade by NatWest Securities. The
latter's banks analyst, Mr Mark Eady, lifted his current year profits

big losses in proprietary trading failed to prevent the bank's shares moving
up 11 to 553p. There was also talk that some institutions had been switching
out of Barclays and into NatWest, up 12 at 494p.
The persistent bid rumours circulating in the insurance sector remained
sharply focused on Willis Corroon, the insurance broker whose shares edged
up 3 more to 155p, with a big buyer of Willis shares said to have been
operating in the market. HSBC, the bank, was mentioned as a potential bidder
for Willis. Earlier this year HSBC bought a 6 per cent stake in Hogg Group,
the insurance broker but later sold it on the Inchcape after the latter
launched a bid for Hogg.

17 to 194p and prompting most analysts to upgrade their forecasts for

The company's Pounds 110m of operating provisions were right at the top end
of brokers' estimates but a maintained dividend and confident statement
helped push the shares ahead steadily on turnover of 4.6m.
