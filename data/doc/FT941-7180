FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Nine Network buys films stake
Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network Australia, which has a 14.97 per cent stake
in John Fairfax, is buying a minority interest in Regency Enterprises, the
Hollywood film production and distribution company which produced and
financed films such as JFK and Sommersby and which has ties with Time
Warner.
The Australian TV and radio company is buying out the interests in Regency
which are currently held by an existing minority investor, Dr Bodo Scriba,
but will also subscribe some additional capital to help fund Regency's
expansion plans.
The total cost of Nine's investment is expected to be around ADollars 165m
(USDollars 118.70m), although the money will be committed in two tranches.
The final details of the transaction have yet to be negotiated and the deal
is due to be completed within two months.
Nine Network is likely to end up with around 30 per cent of Regency. The
remainder will be held by Mr Arnon Milchan, who founded Regency in 1991,
when a long-term financing and distribution arrangement with Time Warner,
the entertainment group, was set up.
Yesterday, in Sydney, Mr Bruce Gyngell, Nine Network chairman, said that
there should be 'strategic' benefits' from the investment, and that it would
have 'the added attraction of bringing us even closer to Time Warner'.
Last year, Nine signed a new three-year programming contract with Time
Warner.
