  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Wednesday [16 February] quoted a senior Iranian officials as 
saying that it is contention of the Persian Gulf countries that 
a peace process as distinguished from a process of force, 
intimidation, suppression, submission and surrender has never 
been embarked upon in the region. 
  The English daily TEHRAN TIMES quoted Deputy Foreign 
Minister 
Mohammad Javad Zarif who addressed the United Nations Institute 
for Disarmament Research in Geneva Tuesday. 
  Referring to "a few" countries succumbing to the will of the 
big powers, Zarif said such actions instead of leading to peace 
and stability will only entrench the same threat perceptions 
which will lead to "further insecurity and instability." 
  The "past erroneous approaches and perceptions" deter the 
common attempts "towards a better world order", the daily quoted 
Zarif as saying. 
  He proposed the creation of a forum by Persian Gulf 
countries 
to discuss "security issues, threat perceptions and other 
concerns", ther paper added. 
  Zarif deliberated on the fundamental issues related to 
regional security and to the long-term peace prospects, the 
daily noted. 
  The paper concluded by saying that he mainly discussed the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, specially nuclear, 
and advocated the creation of a zone free of such weapons.
