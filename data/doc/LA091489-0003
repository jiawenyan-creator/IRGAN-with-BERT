RITCHIE VALENS TO GET WALK OF FAME STAR 
Ritchie Valens, the late rock legend, will be honored next May with a star on 
the Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame. 
The Pacoima youth, whose real name was Richard Valenzuela, rose to fame in the 
1950s. Valens, whose story was depicted in the film "La Bamba," died at age 17 
in a 1959 Iowa plane crash.
