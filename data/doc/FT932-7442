FT  24 MAY 93 / Better direction of training urged
MUCH OF the Pounds 20bn which companies spend on training each year is
wasted or misdirected, says a report by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the management
consultants.
The report, by Mrs Sheila Drew - Smith, head of employers' training and
development policy, will be presented today at a training conference
organised by the Confederation of British Industry.
Mrs Drew-Smith said yesterday: 'Employers must recognise that training has
to be related to their business needs.'
She said companies often viewed training as a waste of resources. 'Even some
who learned the lesson of the recession of the early 1980s and continue to
support investment in their employees' training still use a scattergun or
avalanche approach and train for training's sake.
'In these firms management concentrates on inputs, such as training budgets
or the time spent on training, rather than outputs. As a result much of the
training will have been wasted or misdirected. The evidence suggests that
there are still many such firms.'
The report recommends the government - sponsored scheme Investors in People
as a powerful tool for employers seeking to assess themselves against a
standard.
It says the scheme measures the effectiveness of training and helps with
cost - effectiveness because it requires evaluation of the commercial return
from training.
The report gives several examples of companies which have tailored their
training more effectively to their business needs.
Lawson Mardon, the plastics company, concentrated its training on quality
improvement. The result was an 80 per cent decrease in returns from
customers combined with a 10 per cent increase in sales.
