<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board; Relating to Recordkeeping and Record Retention Requirements Concerning Gifts and Gratuities</DOCTITLE>



June 6, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 26, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to require
municipal securities dealers to keep records of gifts and gratuities given to others, including issuer officials
and employees, in relation to municipal securities activities. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Board is filing amendments to rule G8 and G9, on recordkeeping and record retention, that relate
to rule G20, on gifts and gratuities concerning suitability of recommendations. The proposed rule change
requires dealers to keep records of gifts and gratuities given to others, including issuer officials and employees,
in relation to municipal securities activities. The Board is requesting that the rule change become effective 30
days after approval by the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set
forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change



Rule G20 is intended to prevent commercial bribery. The rule has three basic parts. First, rule G20(a)
prohibits dealers from, directly or indirectly, giving or permitting to be given any thing or service of value in excess
of $100 per year to any person, other than to an employee or partner of the dealer, in relation to municipal securities
activities of the person's employer.

 All gifts given by a dealer and its associated persons are used to compute the $100 limitation. The $100 limitation
applies to gifts and gratuities to customers, individuals associated with issuers, and employees of other dealers.
In addition, based on the rule's ``directly or indirectly'' language, if a third party (e.g., a consultant hired by
a dealer) gives a gift to any such person at the request of the dealer, the value of the gift would be included in the $100
limitation.

``Person'' has been interpreted by the Board in the context of rule G20 to apply only to natural persons because
the intent of the rule is to discourage dealers from inducing individual employees to act in a manner inconsistent
with their obligations to, or contrary to the interests of, their employers. MSRB Interpretation of March 19, 1980.

Second, rule G20(b) exempts certain payments from the $100 annual limit set forth in paragraph (a). These payments
are termed ``normal business dealings'' and are defined as occasional gifts of meals or tickets to theatrical, sporting,
and other entertainments, as well as the sponsoring of legitimate business functions that are recognized by the IRS
as deductible business expenses, and gifts or reminder advertising. However, the rule also provides that such gifts
cannot be so frequent or so expensive as to raise a suggestion of unethical conduct.

Finally, rule G20(c) provides that contracts of employment with or compensation for services rendered are
not considered gifts or gratuities subject to the $100 limitation. Such arrangements, however, must be in writing
and must include the nature of the proposed services, the amount of the proposed compensation, and the written consent
of such person's employer.
