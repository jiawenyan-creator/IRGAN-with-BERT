FT  28 APR 92 / Observer: Mercury exit
Is the top management team of Mercury Asset Management, London's biggest and
most successful quoted fund manager, starting to disintegrate as the younger
generation jostle for power?
Generally, there is nothing unusual in the fund management industry about
executives coming and going. Indeed it is a healthy sign. But what is
amazing about Mercury is that it has grown into such a huge organisation -
it has over Pounds 40bn under management and a massive share of the pension
fund business - without any loss of its top personnel. Mercury is well
beyond a size where economies of scale make sense any longer.
However, there are signs of change. Just before Christmas James Dawnay, the
unit trust boss, quit to join Martin Currie, and now Richard Bernays, one of
Mercury's vice chairmen, is off to try to revitalise Hill Samuel's big, but
sleepy, fund management business.
Mercury is maintaining a stiff upper lip. But chairman Peter Stormonth
Darling, who has dominated the group for more than a decade, is getting to
an age when he should be thinking of retirement. With Bernays out of the
way, the two front-runners are David Price, an admin wizard, and Stephen
Zimmerman, the investment guru. David Price would make a natural successor
but insiders say that the choice is too close to call.
