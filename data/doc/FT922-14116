FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: EC proposes quota for banana imports
THE European Commission last night decided to risk a clash with its Gatt
partners and propose an EC-wide quota, rather than a tariff, on banana
imports from central America.
The quota plan will be welcomed by banana growers inside the EC, such as
Madeira, Canaries, Crete, and in the French and former British Carribbean
islands, as a more effective means of maintaining their position in the EC
market than with purely a tariff.
They fear that so-called 'dollar' bananas from central Europe are so much
cheaper to grow than the EC or Caribbean counterpart that the effect of even
a hefty tariff could always be neutralised.
The Commission described last night's proposal, which must now be considered
by EC governments, as the 'least bad' one.
The EC executive had to try to meet conflicting aims of:
Creating a single post-1992 regime for the highly fragmented EC banana
market. Countries such as the UK, France, Spain and Portugal import bananas
duty free under special arrangement from their own producers or former
colonies. Most of the rest of the EC pays a 20 per cent tariff on dollar
bananas, though Germany imports dollar bananas duty free.
Respecting assurances given to Caribbean producers in the Lome Convention
that they would not lose out as the result of any post-1992 system.
Winning acceptance in Gatt, where the EC will have to get a waiver of trade
rules for a new EC-wide quota (of which Brussels has yet to set the level).
Not penalising EC consumers. The Commission is proposing to extend the 20
per cent tariff that exists in much of the EC to Germany, but it argues that
if the quota for dollar bananas is large enough, this will not much raise
the cost of the fruit to Germans.
