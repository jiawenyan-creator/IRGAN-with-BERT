FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: MCC report
A report in yesterday's FT said that Mr Peter Laister, chairman of Maxwell
Communication Corporation, had criticised a Price Waterhouse report to MCC
and its bankers as 'a shoddy piece of work'.
Mr Laister has confirmed that his criticism was not about the PW report but
about the use made of the data when presented in court by counsel for PW.
