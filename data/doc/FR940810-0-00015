Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Lyndonville, VT. This action is a result of a modification of the nondirectional
beacon (NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) for Runway 2 at the Caledonia County Airport which showed
a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations
at the airport. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators who will
be executing the NDB SIAP at Caledonia County Airport.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On March 11, 1994, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Lyndonville, VT (59 FR 11565). The proposal was prompted
by a modification of the nondirectional beacon (NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) for Runway 2
at the Caledonia Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain
instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate
Class E airspace for IFR operators who will be executing the NDB SIAP at Caledonia County Airport. Interested parties
were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal of the FAA.
No comments on the proposal were received.
Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published
in Paragraph 6005 of the FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993).
The Class E airspace establishment listed in this document will be published in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes the Class E Airspace at Claremont, NH. This
action is a result of a modification of the nondirectional beacon (NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP)
for Runway 2 at the Caledonia County Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above
the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this action
is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators who will be executing the NDB SIAP at Caledonia County Airport.
The FAA has determined that this regulation involves only an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep these regulations operationally current. It, therefore_(1)
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory
Evaluation as the anticipated economic cost will be so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
