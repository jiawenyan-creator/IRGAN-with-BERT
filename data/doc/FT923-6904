FT  21 AUG 92 / Patten and Zhou hold Hong Kong discussions
MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday met Zhou Nan, Beijing's
most senior official in Hong Kong, for talks that lasted almost twice as
long as planned.
A brief government statement after the nearly two-hour meeting said the
discussions had been 'very useful' and had touched on many of the main
issues facing Hong Kong. It did not elaborate.
Hong Kong officials said that both men presented their previously stated
positions on the current wrangle over the colony's multi-billion dollar
airport scheme, the pace of decision-making within the Anglo-Chinese Joint
Liaison Committee, and other issues.
Disagreement over the new airport's financing continues to mar Sino-British
ties despite a year-old agreement to clear remaining obstacles to the
airport's construction. China so far has failed to approve the financing
plan, holding up work on the project which is supposed to open by July 1997,
when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule.
Mr Patten is keen to establish a channel of communication with decision
makers in Beijing. The length of this first meeting was taken as an
encouraging sign he might be able to do business with Zhou.
Mr Patten said the meeting had been 'very friendly' and that he looked
forward to regular and productive contacts with Zhou in the future.
The New China News Agency, of which Zhou is director, released a statement
saying that Zhou hoped to build a 'good working relationship' with the
governor.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index yesterday fell 106.47 points, or 1.89 per cent,
to 5,513.97. This was mostly attributed to foreign selling in a very thin
market.
