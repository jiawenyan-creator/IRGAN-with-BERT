BRIEFLY 
Rosewood's Oil, Gas Assets for Sale: Buyers are being sought for the oil and 
gas assets of Rosewood Corp., the holding company owned by the trust estate of 
heiress Caroline Rose Hunt, whose financial unit is fighting for control of the 
financially troubled Los Angeles-based insurer First Executive Corp. The assets 
of Rosewood Resources are being shopped around as part of a divestment strategy 
that saw the sale last year of the Bel-Air Hotel in Bel-Air and the Hana-Maui 
hotel in Hawaii, a Rosewood spokesman said. The assets include oil and gas 
properties in the Midwest, Southwest and Rocky Mountain areas of the U.S.; 
offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the Dutch North Sea, as well as 
onshore fields in France.
