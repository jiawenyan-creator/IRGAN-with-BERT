FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: GE takes full control of
Tungsram
GENERAL Electric of the US has taken full control of the Tungsram lighting
joint venture by buying out Magyar Hitel Bank, the main Hungarian minority
shareholder.
GE has acquired Hitel Bank's 24.4 per cent stake in Tungsram to take its
ownership to 99.6 per cent, but neither party would reveal the terms of the
transaction.
The acquisition clears the way for GE to recapitalise the Tungsram venture
and reduce the interest payments which have added to the Hungarian company's
losses.
GE expects to make the infusion, of about Ft17bn (Dollars 193m), in June and
for the results to show up in the company's earnings relatively quickly.
GE embarked on the recapitalisation after the venture had suffered Ft9bn in
losses in 1992, its third year of losses in a row.
Magyar Hitel Bank, which is in financial difficulties, opposed the
recapitalisation and insisted that GE take over its shareholding.
The infusion will take GE's investment in Hungary to more than Dollars 500m.
