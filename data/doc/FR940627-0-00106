<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Emergency interim rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule at the request 
of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) to prohibit all taking of live rock in the
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the
Dade/Broward County line in Florida; to prohibit the taking of live rock by chipping in the EEZ from the Dade/Broward
County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico boundary; and to limit the harvest of live rock from the EEZ off
the southern Atlantic states in 1994 to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg).

<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 June 27, 1994, through September 26, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Coral and coral reefs in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states and in the Gulf of Mexico are managed under the Fishery
Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by
the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South
Atlantic Council) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and 
Management Act (Magnuson Act). 



Live rock consists of living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate, including
dead coral or rock (excluding mollusk shells), and therefore is a ``fish'' within the meaning of the Magnuson Act.
Live rock is collected by scuba divers and sold to the marine aquarium industry, which markets it as the basis for minireef
aquaria. Live rock is a 
nonrenewable resource providing essential fishery habitat in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. 

On May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25344), NMFS published an emergency interim rule to control the taking of live rock in the Gulf
of Mexico. A description of the fishery and the rationale for that rulemaking are contained in that rule and are not
repeated here. 

In part because of concerns about effort shifting from recently closed areas in the Gulf of Mexico to current or new
harvest areas off the southern Atlantic states, the South Atlantic Council requested an emergency rule to: (1) Prohibit
the taking of live rock in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the
Dade/Broward County line in Florida; (2) prohibit chipping of live rock in the EEZ from the 
Dade/Broward County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico boundary; and (3) limit the harvest of live rock
in 1994 from the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg). 

Reported landings from the Florida portion of the proposed closed area totaled less than 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) in 1993
or about 1 percent of all Florida landings. Florida is the only state in which live rock landings have been recorded.
This emergency closure is designed in part to prevent expansion of harvesting effort into new areas. 

Chipping means breaking up reefs, ledges, or rocks into smaller fragments, usually by means of a chisel and hammer.
Chipping causes serious damage to hard bottom habitats including coral reefs in the Florida Keys. Recent public testimony
to the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils indicated that chipping accounts for about 10 to 20 percent of the live rock
harvest off the southern Atlantic states. In the Gulf of Mexico, chipping of limestone ledges and worm reefs accounts
for about 90 percent of the live rock harvest. 

During a proposed phase out of live rock harvesting under Amendment 2 to the FMP, which is currently under development,
the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils intend to limit harvest to loose rubble rock that is primarily the result of natural
erosion processes. About 485,000 lb (219,992 kg) of rubble live rock were reported landed in Florida in 1992, and this
is the basis for the 1994 quota. Data available to the South Atlantic Council indicate that live rock landings are increasing
and the quota for 1994 is likely to be exceeded prior to implementation of management measures in Amendment 2. 

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) estimates that the quota will probably be met sometime
in October 1994. If a shift of harvesting effort from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic occurs due to the Gulf emergency
rule or other factors, the quota could be reached much earlier. Amendment 2 is not expected to be implemented until
mid November 1994. The South Atlantic Council therefore requested emergency action to implement the 1994 quota and
to prohibit all chipping of live rock to prevent damage to the Florida reef tract and serious loss of fishery habitat
in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, including the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
