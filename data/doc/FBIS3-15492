  [Text] The United Nations, 5 Mar -- The UN Security Council 
at its meeting on Friday [4 March] adopted Resolution 900 on 
normalizing the situation in Sarajevo. The draft of the 
resolution had been submitted by France and been discussed for 
almost two weeks. In this connection, the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent asked Russia's permanent UN representative Yuliy 
Vorontsov to comment on Russia's involvement in the preparation 
of the document. 
  Russia had a number of provisions included that we wanted to 
see in the resolution, and indeed we reached agreement with its 
co-authors that a number of provisions would be removed from it. 
The resolution needed to be, and ended up roughly being a 
resolution on Sarajevo, and not on all the other problems and 
issues arising in Bosnia-Herzegovina, such as how Sarajevo's 
municipal services should be restored. This indeed was the 
purpose of our amendments and unnecessary things concerning 
general issues in Bosnia-Herzegovina were removed by the authors 
of the draft resolution, Vorontsov stated. 
  Asked about Russia's participation in the peacekeeping 
forces 
in Bosnia, Vorontsov noted that the Russian Parliament's 
decision to send 300 Russian servicemen to Bosnia will be 
officially confirmed shortly. I understand that there has been 
a technical hold-up, on account of which Russia has not been 
included in the list of countries providing troops. Of the 300 
Russian servicemen being sent, 100 will be dispatched to 
Sarajevo and the others will go to Croatia to reinforce our 
battalion. Really speaking, the Russian battalion is not 
stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is stationed in Croatia, 
but it does form part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. 
Our battalion is part of UNPROFOR.
