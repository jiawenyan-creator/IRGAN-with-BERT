<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa by </F>
unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Could you comment on the issue of 
the suspected nuclear weapons development program by the DPRK? 
  [Kakizawa] I welcome North Korea's positive stance toward 
accepting full nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). But in the past, the DPRK sometimes took 
half a step backward after taking a step forward. So, we will 
watch the development of this issue while keeping in contact 
with South Korea and the United States. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What should Japan do if the United States 
independently begins sanctions against the North? 
  [Kakizawa] It is too early to discuss what Japan should do 
at a time when the United Nations has not yet decided on its 
policy toward Pyongyang. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] You have repeatedly said that a study should 
be made about enacting legislation to cope with an emergency 
situation. Does this view remain unchanged? 
  [Kakizawa] Since I assumed the foreign ministerial post, I 
have repeatedly expressed the hope that an emergency situation 
will be averted. But when I was asked what Japan should do in 
an emergency, I said Japan had to cooperate with the United 
Nations within the scope of the Constitution. I was also asked 
many times whether it is necessary to enact new legislation. In 
reply, I said should an emergency occur, the government would 
have to consider taking necessary measures. But I added that it 
was not good to discuss, based on supposition, whether new 
legislation is necessary, or whether the government can deal 
with an emergency with administrative measures. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What does "cooperation within the scope of 
the Constitution" mean? 
  [Kakizawa] This is related to the interpretation of Article 
9 of the Constitution. I have proposed that the people and 
political parties should discuss what comes within the scope of 
the Constitution without a preconceived notion on the 
conventional interpretation of the article. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] You have also noted the need to reexamine 
the right to collective defense. 
  [Kakizawa] I merely proposed to have discussions about the 
right. To avoid a hawkish image which could develop depending 
on the developments of the DPRK nuclear issue and due to former 
Justice Minister Nagano's recent remarks on the Pacific war, the 
Hata cabinet decided to unify cabinet ministers' views. As a 
result, it has adopted a unified, conventional position that 
Japan has the right to collective defense as an independent 
country but Article 9 limits the use of this right.
