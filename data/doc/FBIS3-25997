  [Text] Urumqi, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will make greater efforts to 
boost tourism this year. 
  Local officials said that they hoped for a 12 percent growth 
in both the number of tourists and earnings from tourism 
services. 
  To realize this target the autonomous region will launch at 
least three major tourism routes under the national program of 
"1994 Cultural Relics and Historic Sites Tours," and start some 
new tourism programs with special features, such as desert 
expedition and rafting on rivers addition to eight international 
tourism and trade fairs. 
  Statistics show that Xinjiang received about 240,000 
overseas 
tourists and earned 40.02 million U.S. dollars from relevant 
services last year. 
  The famous "Silk Road," which used to serve as a major 
channel for conducting exchanges between China and countries in 
western Asia and Europe, is in the region. 
  The opening of 14 Chinese border cities has presented 
Xinjiang with more opportunities for developing tourism, said 
the officials. 
  Xinjiang's strategy is also to combine tourism with trade. 
From July 1991 to the present, nearly 300,000 people from 
Pakistan, Mongolia and the Commonwealth of Independent States 
came to Xinjiang on shopping tours.
