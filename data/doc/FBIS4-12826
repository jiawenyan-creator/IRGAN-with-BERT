  [Text] The president, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, today 
addressed a group of staff and managers from the Industries 
Ministry and Iran's Standards and Industrial Research Institute 
[SIRI]. In his address, the president considered positive the 
trend of developments in the industrial sector during the era of 
reconstruction. He added that viewing production as a central 
activity constituted a correct and proper program for making 
society's economic foundation stable and solid. The president 
added: At present the country has become self-sufficient in many 
areas. He stressed: With the operation of the petrochemical 
complex at Bandar-e Imam Khomeyni in the near future, the future 
prospects for the country's industrial sector will be even 
brighter than the present. 
  The president, moreover, referred to the important duty of 
the SIRI in controlling the quality of products, and said: 
Alongside the processes of improving production according to 
desired standards and obliterating the undesirable cultural 
trends of the past in connection with consumption of 
foreign-made commodities, one must also endeavor to pay more 
attention to the need to support the country's indigenous 
industrialists.
