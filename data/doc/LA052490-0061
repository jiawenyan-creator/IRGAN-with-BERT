MORNING REPORT: RADIO 
KDAY Aids Homeless: A $50,000 donation from Los Angeles radio station KDAY will 
help homeless activist Ted Hayes get his geodesic dome project to house the 
homeless started. KDAY general manager Ed Kirby said the money was raised 
through the sale of a rap music album. The homeless will be employed to build 
the plastic domes, which will cost about $900 each. GREG BRAXTON
