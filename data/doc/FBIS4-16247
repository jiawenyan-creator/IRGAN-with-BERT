<F P=106> [Video report on meeting of CIS heads of state and </F>
government in Moscow on 15 April, including recorded remarks by 
Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze and Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] A routine meeting of CIS heads of state and 
government is taking place in Moscow today. While a number of 
political leaders are again casting doubts on the effectiveness 
of the CIS, the specific questions of political and economic 
cooperation which have been put on the agenda of this meeting 
give grounds for hope that a new step may be taken today toward 
strengthening the Commonwealth. 
  [Correspondent Vladimir Perfilyev] The session of the 
council 
of Commonwealth heads lasted for two hours today in St. 
Catherine's Hall in the Great Kremlin Palace. The meeting was 
chaired by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Opening the meeting he expressed the hope that this meeting 
would be a new step toward strengthening the Commonwealth. Of 
course, journalists knew the preliminary agenda, but the meeting 
took place behind closed doors and it is better to receive 
information at first hand. The head of the Republic of Georgia 
was laconic. 
  [Shevardnadze] The main thing is that there is good mutual 
understanding on the problems which are being discussed. 
  [Perfilyev] But Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk today 
talked freely with journalists. 
  [Kravchuk] The main issue for us is to resolve the problem 
of 
the Black Sea Fleet. 
  [Perfilyev] In your view is the CIS working or not? 
  [Kravchuk] It is working, but there are difficulties in its 
work. Today Boris Nikolayevich put forward a very good idea 
which was then further developed: to instruct foreign ministers 
and others to draw up a concept for integration within the 
borders, within the framework of the CIS, a concept for further 
integration. You see that voices are being heard calling for a 
Eurasian union, but there are not just voices, they have good 
grounds -- good grounds because the CIS is not yet working well.
