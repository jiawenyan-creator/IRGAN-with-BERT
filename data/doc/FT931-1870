FT  23 MAR 93 / N-sub collision 'did little damage'
Russian and US nuclear submarines collided in Arctic waters this weekend but
the crash, 170 km off Russia's northern coast, caused little damage to
either craft, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Russian naval commanders accused the rival boat of carrying out dangerous
manoeuvres. Defence Department officials in Washington said the US regretted
the incident.
'The high command of the Russian military fleet expresses its extreme
concern over the latest incident of dangerous manoeuvring by foreign
submarines in military training zones,' a Russian navy statement said. A
spokesman said the Russian craft suffered minimal damage and there was no
radiation leak.
