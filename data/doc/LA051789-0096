Soviet Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev denied allegations that he was 
involved in corruption and said his accuser had political motives for making 
the charge, the official Novosti press agency said. Ligachev, a conservative 
who has been considered a rival of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, "resolutely 
denied" the allegations made by a prosecutor, Nikolai Ivanov, who at the time 
was campaigning for a seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies, the news 
agency said.
