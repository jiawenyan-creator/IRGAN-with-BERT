In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


In October 1984, the Exchange filed a proposal to amend Rule 462 to provide for the use of cash, cash equivalents, one
or more qualified securities, or a combination of the foregoing, as collateral for escrow receipts issued to cover
short call positions in broad-based stock index options.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal was approved as a pilot program at each of the options exchanges and was successfully extended over the
years. The Amex now seeks to join the other exchanges and make the pilot program permanent. The Amex also seeks to make
conforming changes to Rule 462, so that the rule will correspond to rule language adopted by OCC
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 and the other options exchanges.

just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating
transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national
market system.
