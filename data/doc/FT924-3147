FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Recovery under way at Atkins
Atkins Group, the Leicestershire-based textile company, returned to the
black in its seasonally unfavourable first half.
Despite 'extremely difficult general economic conditions' turnover for the
six months to September 30 improved slightly to Pounds 7.69m and pre-tax
profits amounted to Pounds 16,000, against losses of Pounds 268,000 last
time, restated to allow for new accounting standards.
Mr David Haggett, the retiring non-executive chairman, said the improved
performance should continue in the second half.
The interim dividend is maintained at 3.6p, again uncovered by earnings of
0.33p (losses of 4.23p) per share.
