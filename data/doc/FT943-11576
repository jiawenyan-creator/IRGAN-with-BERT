FT  29 JUL 94 / Observer: Mirabile dictu
When fund managers Jupiter Tyndall Merlin put former chancellor Norman
Lamont on the board of two of their Far Eastern investment trusts, the spiel
was that he would lend prestige in a part of the world where any old
ex-chancellor prompts much bowing and scraping.
Now Eurosceptic Lamont, he of the ERM crisis, has popped up on the board of
the same outfit's European trust. Fund manager Richard Pease had to admit
the chancellor would not be accompanying him when he goes avisiting his
continental investments.
But his presence will lend a certain symmetry to the board. Of the six
directors, half are now old Rothschild contemporaries.
Not only is John Craig, ex banking head at Rothschild, the trust's chairman.
But James Roe, who worked in investments with Lamont before the latter came
to Westminster, is also a director.
