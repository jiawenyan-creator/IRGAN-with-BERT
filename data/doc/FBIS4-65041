  [Text] Ankara, May 10 (AA) -- Defense Minister Mehmet 
Golhan on Tuesday [9 May] said that Turkey aims at full 
membership to the Western European Union (WEU). 
  Golhan who concluded an official visit to France and who 
attended the Western European Union meetings in Luxembourg, was 
speaking to reporters upon his arrival at Ankara's Esenboga 
Airport. 
  He said during his visit to France bilateral relations were 
discussed as well as regional and international developments 
with emphasis on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Azeri-Armenian conflict, the Cyprus problem, PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan] terrorism and Turkey's status within the WEU. 
  He said he also visited a number of military installations 
in 
France which will hand over to Turkey 20 Puma helicopters as of 
the beginning of 1995. 
  He said that Turkey also needs six mine-sweeping ships, 
adding the new economic measures has slowed down its bidding 
procedure. 
  He said Turkey and France are cooperating in the production 
of radars and these will be delivered in August by France. 
  On the WEU meetings Golhan said its most important factor 
was 
that Turkey's status was ameliorated. 
  A document was signed at the end of the meetings on Monday 
according to which the partnership status of nine Central 
European countries Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Estonia and Lithuania 
[as received] and the extended associate memberships of Turkey, 
Norway and Iceland were published. 
  According to the document, Turkey, Iceland and Norway could 
send military forces to WEU, make use of the WEU's protective 
umbrella and would be included in all communications systems. 
  Golhan said this is not completely satisfactory but 
represents a step towards Turkey's full membership.
