FT  15 APR 93 / Technology: Fax for advertisers
A perennial problem for advertisers is to ensure that readers, listeners or
viewers of their commercials phone up for more information. Freefone
telephone numbers are 'instant', but they are expensive to operate.
LBC, the independent London radio station, is pioneering a service in the UK
which is considerably cheaper to operate than traditional 'phone-in inquiry
services and is available to anyone with a facsimile machine.
Advertisers give a fax number at the end of their commercial and supply LBC
with the documents to send to listeners. When the consumer telephones the
number the document is automatically transmitted.
The cost to the advertiser is Pounds 25 per week for the telephone line plus
15p per minute for the calls. 'The advertisers have control of the costs,'
says Bob Cole, chief sales manager for LBC. 'If they want to send 10 pages
of information it's up to them. If they can squeeze all the information on
to one sheet then it's much cheaper.' The caller pays the cost of an
ordinary telephone call.
The Q-fax service works because almost every fax machine in the country has
a little-used function known as 'polling'. During the transmission of a
normal fax message the transmitting machine first sends out a message giving
its identity. With polling, the other machine recognises this number and
then sends back the required document.
Henry Fletcher, managing director of Eurofax Communications, which offers
the Q-fax service, believes it could be used to support many kinds of
advertising and promotion.
Cole believes the initial interest, however, will be for
business-to-business advertisers. He cites the example of financial advisers
who can use the radio to advertise generic services and then send details,
including all the small print, by fax. 'It makes radio a much more
measurable medium,' he says. 'It's existing technology but with a major
twist.'
