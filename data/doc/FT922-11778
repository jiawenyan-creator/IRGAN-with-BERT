FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Contracting side behind Freeman fall
Results for 1991 from Freeman Group were dominated by the contracting
division, which incurred operating losses of Pounds 1.1m and, when sold in
February, threw up extraordinary charges of Pounds 3m.
That meant distributable reserves were eliminated, so there can be no final
dividend; the total, therefore, is 3p (8.5p) from losses per share of 0.6p
(earnings 21.6p). To overcome the problem directors propose a reduction in
the share premium account, and expect to resume payments in October.
Pre-tax profit of this insulation distribution specialist fell from Pounds
2m to Pounds 342,000.
Continuing activities accounted for Pounds 56m (Pounds 50.3m) of turnover
and Pounds 2.08m (Pounds 2.15m) of operating profit. A fall in the UK to
Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 904,000) was mainly the result of reduced margins and
an increase in bad debts. In France profit rose to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds
1.25m) despite an overall fall in construction activity.
