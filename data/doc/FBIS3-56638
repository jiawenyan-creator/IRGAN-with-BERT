  [Text] A terrible tragedy happened last night near the home 
of Crimean People's Deputy Iskander Mamedov, adviser to the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet chairman. When Mamedov and some 
colleagues were entering his house and being met by members of 
Mamedov's family, the sounds of assault rifles and grenades were 
heard. The firing came from two sides. As a result, 11 people 
-- including Mamedov's son and daughter -- were wounded and two 
people were killed. Iskander Mamedov was brought to the 
hospital in critical condition. In the opinion of Lilya 
Budzhurova, a well-known activist of the Tatar movement in the 
Crimea, whose report on the case was broadcast today on Crimean 
radio, the attempted murder of Mamedov, one of organizers of 
Mykola Bahrov's election campaign, was politically motivated. 
  If anyone has any information on this case, please contact 
the police in Simferopol.
