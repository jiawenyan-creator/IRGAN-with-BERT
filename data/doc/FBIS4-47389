  [Abstract] A new ecological issue is evaluation of the 
pollution caused by the landing of a rocket's first stage. The 
first stage contains fuel residue which contains a highly toxic 
compound, asymmetric dimethylhydrazine. Typically, the fuel 
explodes and burns on impact. In an explosion, the increase in 
temperature makes the substance more volatile; some fuel remains 
in the air, and is spread by the wind and precipitation. If 
there is no explosion, the fuel seeps into the ground. Oxidation 
products are harmful in either case. The physical and chemical 
properties of asymmetric dimethylhydrazine are examined. 
Research began in 1991 in Central Kazakhstan to study 
environmental anomalies caused by rocket fuel. Local 
high-contrast anomalies are due to direct contact, and more 
widespread low-contrast anomalies are associated with 
atmospheric transfer. Only 5% of soil samples revealed 
fuel 
residue concentrations above 0.02 mg/kg. The effects of various 
soil types, oxidation, and migration are examined. 
Concentrations of residue in vegetation were also studied. 
Content varied from 0.05-224.0 mg/kg, with the most common 
concentrations being 0.2-0.3 mg/kg. The maximum concentrations 
and largest percentage of contaminated samples were found at 
fall sites. Greater areas of vegetation than soil were 
contaminated, probably due to the combined effect of soil and 
atmospheric contamination. Root systems were studied to 
determine the method of contamination. It was found that plant 
type was also a factor. Seasonal differences in migration 
patterns, mainly due to temperature and evaporation, are 
explained. Figures 2; tables 2; references 11: 9 Russian, 2
