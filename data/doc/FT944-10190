FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Challenge Bank says it will bid
for rival
Perth-based Challenge Bank, the Australian regional bank, said yesterday
that it intended to make an offer for Bank-West, a significantly larger,
state-owned bank which the Western Australia government plans to privatise
next year.
Challenge said it was confident its bid would be about ADollars 100m
(USDollars 75.56m) more than the state government would receive from a
public float of the company. However, Challenge made no mention of the
specific offer it would make.
Challenge, whose desire to acquire BankWest has been widely known, said the
combined strength of the two organisations in terms of market position,
profitability and funding would maximise the prospect of BankWest remaining
permanently domiciled in Western Australia.
'The merged entity can be funded, at the outset and over time, through a
planned and systematic programme of accessing the domestic and international
debt markets,' it said.
Challenge Bank is estimated to have a 9 per cent share of the WA market,
with a loan book around ADollars 2bn. BankWest is larger, with 27.6 per cent
of the market and a loan book of more than ADollars 6bn. BankWest's gross
assets are around ADollars 12.5bn, while Challenge has ADollars 5bn,
according to its 1993-94 balance sheet.
BankWest said: 'It (Challenge) has failed to spell out how it would
implement a merger. In contrast, a straight float ensures that the full
benefits of privatisation would go to the people of WA.'
Meanwhile, the state government said it would not be pressured on the
privatisation of BankWest.
