FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): City plans campaign to attract
Euro-bank
A CAMPAIGN to attract the proposed European Central Bank to London was
called for yesterday by the Corporation of the City of London and the
Labour-led Association of London Authorities.
The Corporation - the City's local authority  - is preparing to fund and
lead a campaign. Its common council will be asked later this month to make
Pounds 1m available.
The campaign will be looking to draw on the expertise of City institutions.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy resources
committee, said: 'We intend to run a positive campaign stressing the
advantages of London, particularly the ready access to its financial
markets. We are not seeking to run down the likes of Frankfurt.'
He recognised that it would be a 'highly political stance' for the City,
given the government's non-committal attitude to the single currency.
The ALA released a report by the Henley Centre for Forecasting which
suggested that Amsterdam has the edge as most-likely location for the bank
because of internal European Community politics.
The report said: 'London's claim for the European Central Bank is certainly
not helped by the apparent lack of keen support by the UK government for
monetary union.'
It said better marketing of London was needed if it was to succeed. It
added: 'London cannot afford to neglect the broader aspects of its offer,
especially its transport and environmental constituents.'
The City's stance, in particular, will add to pressure on the government to
make an early declaration of its determination not to invoke the British
opt-out clause agreed at the Maastricht summit. Labour is already pledged to
join the currency, provided Britain meets the agreed conditions.
