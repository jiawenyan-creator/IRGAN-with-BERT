FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong arguments for mutual ownership
(2)
Sir, Your article 'Mutual destruction' presented a one-sided analysis of the
disadvantages of the mutual form of corporate organisation and the
advantages of the plc form.
There are three key advantages in retaining mutual building societies:
Building societies offer a better service to their customers than other
organisations. Market research undertaken by BMRB International shows that,
compared with other institutions, building societies are much more likely to
be perceived as dealing with their customers fairly, more likely to be
understanding of their financial problems, more able to communicate with
their customers, taking complaints more seriously, and not pestering their
customers about their service.
Building societies offer lower mortgage rates and higher savings rates than
their competitors. A recent survey by the specialist magazine, What
Mortgage, shows that, of the 20 institutions which have charged least
interest on their mortgages over the previous ten years, 19 were building
societies. In contrast, of the most expensive 20 institutions seven were
banks. Similarly, banks rarely feature in the 'best buys' analyses of
savings products.
Diversity of business organisation. It is unlikely that one particular form
of corporate body embodies within it all the attributes necessary to create
the perfect organisation. Mutuals and plcs each have their own
characteristics, and it is likely that the economy as a whole is stronger if
the two forms of organisation are able to compete with each other.
