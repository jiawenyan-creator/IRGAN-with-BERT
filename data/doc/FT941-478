FT  30 MAR 94 / Faster pension reform demanded
Reforming valuation of lump sums transferred out of occupational pension
schemes and their presentation to potential investors should be carried out
more quickly than City regulators intend, the National Association of
Pension Funds said yesterday.
In advance of today's debate in the Commons on private pensions and
financial regulation, the association urged the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, to move more quickly than it has proposed
in improving this aspect of pension transfers.
The association said the report from SIB on improving standards in this area
of business - which was published last week - was an important step towards
ensuring that people were given proper advice.
But Mr Tom Ross, association vice-chairman, said the system of fixed-rate
projections 'which produce huge estimates that ignore inflation, should be
ditched for transfer value business. This should not be delayed until
September 1995 as SIB proposes'.
He added that it would be vital for the Personal Investment Authority - the
new regulator to protect the private investor - to set and monitor high
standards 'which are externally recognised for the selling of
personal-pension business and which will restore consumer confidence'.
In today's debate, however, some backbench MPs are expected to express
doubts about the PIA's ability to deliver high standards of investor
protection.
The proportion of people expecting to retire at or before the age of 62 has
dropped sharply, a survey by market research group Mintel says. It found
that 54 per cent expected to retire before 62 - in 1990 the figure was about
two-thirds.
