GOLF ROUNDUP; 
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE IT THE HUSTON OPEN 
John Huston gained some breathing room from the brace of double bogeys that 
ambushed Tom Watson and moved into a one-stroke lead Saturday in the third 
round of the Honda Classic at Coral Springs, Fla. 
Huston, a third-year touring pro looking for his first victory, coaxed a 
two-under-par 70 from gusty winds and completed three rounds at 211, five under 
par on the TPC at Eagle Trace. 
Mark Brooks, also with a 70, came on to take second at 212, one stroke back 
with one round to go. 
Watson, still seeking to regain the form that made him golf's dominant figure 
for almost a decade, had to overcome two double bogeys to remain in contention. 
"I still have a chance. I'm still within reach," Watson said after he battled 
back from two shots into the water and scored a 73. 
He was tied for third at 215, one under par and four strokes away from the 
leader, with Mark Calcavecchia, Ray Floyd, Gil Morgan and Bob Estes. 
Calcavecchia, who all but eliminated himself with a 42 on the back nine of the 
second round, came back with a solid 69. Floyd, 47, shot 70. Estes had a 71 and 
the 43-year-old Morgan matched par 72. 
Joel Edwards, the second-round leader, shot a 77 that left him six shots back 
at 217. 
Patti Rizzo mastered the wind with strong woods and long iron play to shoot a 
two-under-par 70 and extend her lead to three strokes after two rounds of the 
LPGA Desert Inn International at Las Vegas. 
Rizzo birdied five holes and is at eight-under 136. Second-year pro Maggie Will 
had Saturday's best round, 66, and is at 139.
