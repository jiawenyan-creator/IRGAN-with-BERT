  [Text] Beijing, June 27 (CNS) -- Company Law, the first of 
its kind in China since 1949, will come into force on July 1. 
It is aimed at governing the running of companies and helping 
the country to set up a modern enterprises system, according to 
a press conference held by the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress (NPC). 
  The Company Law, which was appraised and approved by the 
standing committee late last year, confirmed that companies were 
entitled to an independent legal status and enjoyed legal person 
status. Such regulations lead to the separation of a company 
from subordination to an administrative body, while at the same 
time preventing excessive intervention by an administrative 
organ in a company. They are beneficial to the running of a 
company in accordance with the Law. The Company Law also 
relieves the state of shouldering unlimited liability for 
enterprises, a practice advantageous to increasing the vigour 
shown by enterprises for competition. 
  The Vice Director of the Commission of Legislative Affairs 
of 
NPC, Mr. Bian Yaowu, said that the drafting of the law, which 
was undertaken by the commission, began in September, 1992 and 
underwent discussion on three occasions by the standing 
committee of NPC before the final approval. 
  The Company Law governs registration of companies and other 
corresponding matters. It is very important because it 
indicates that the enterprise reform is now under the legal 
standardization for some 1.2 million companies across the 
country, which increased from 1.03 million by the end of last 
year and from a mere 480,000 in late 1992. 
  Mr. Bian said that, following the implementation of the Law, 
companies running counter to this Law would have to make changes 
to meet the requirements of the Law. Otherwise, they would be 
seriously dealt with according to the Law.
