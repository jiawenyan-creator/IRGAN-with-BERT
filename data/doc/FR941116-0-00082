 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined
that USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply
fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval aircraft
carrier. Additionally, a prior certification of noncompliance for USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71) is amended to
reflect compliance with 72 COLREGS. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS
apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 706. This amendment
provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy,
has certified that USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose,
cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS: Annex I, section 2(g), pertaining to the distance of the sidelights above the
hull; without interfering with its special function as a naval aircraft carrier. The Judge Advocate General of the
Navy has also certified that the aforementioned lights are located in closest possible compliance with the applicable
72 COLREGS requirements. 



Furthermore, this amendment provides notice that certain navigation lights on USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (CVN 71),
previously certified as not in compliance with 72 COLREGS, now comply with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements,
to wit: The ship now has a single forward anchor light, as required by Rule 30(a)(i). 

Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for
public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based
on technical findings that the placement of lights on these vessel in a manner differently from that prescribed herein
will adversely affect each vessel's ability to perform its military functions.
