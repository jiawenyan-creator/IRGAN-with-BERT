FOUNTAIN VALLEY DRIVE-BY SHOOTING LEAVES MAN DEAD 
A 34-year-old Los Angeles man was killed and a 26-year-old Anaheim man was 
wounded in a drive-by shooting Saturday evening at Mile Square Park in Fountain 
Valley. 
The Orange County Sheriff's Department, which would not release the identity of 
either man, is seeking five men in connection with the shooting. 
Lt. William Francis said the victims and suspects are Vietnamese and apparently 
knew each other. 
"We have good eyeball witnesses" to the shooting, Francis said. He said the 
department could not say whether the shooting was gang-related. 
The shooting took place about 6:30 p.m. near Euclid Avenue and Heil Street. The 
Los Angeles man was taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center, where he died. The Anaheim man was flown by helicopter to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where he was reported in stable condition.
