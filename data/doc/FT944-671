FT  24 DEC 94 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Copper's price rally
halted
London's commodities markets broke up for the Christmas holiday at lunchtime
yesterday in a relatively subdued mood. Recently strong markets, like some
of the base metals, generally edged back a little, while recently week ones,
like coffee, clawed back some of their losses.
At the London Metal Exchange copper, which has been setting the trend for
most other base metals, ended at Dollars 2,969.75 a tonne for three months
delivery, down Dollars 11.75 on the day and Dollars 15.75 on the week. But
that was still Dollars 25.25 above Tuesday's low and dealers were not ruling
out a renewed attempt to break decisively above the Dollars 3,000 mark after
the festivities.
Yesterday's reversal was influenced by news of a rise in LME warehouse
stocks, not a big one, but none the less an unwelcome interruption to a long
sequence of falls. The decline on the week could also be seen as modest in
view of the easing in the concern about nearby supply tightness that had
been an important factor in the market's recent strength. That was reflected
in a narrowing in the cash premium over three months metal to Dollars 20 a
tonne from Dollars 70 at the end of last week.
LME markets following copper's retreat yesterday were nickel, zinc and tin,
but aluminium continued to make its own luck. The three months price rose
Dollars 3.25, helped by another big stocks fall, to Dollars 1,943.75 a
tonne, up Dollars 20 on the week and Dollars 78.75 above Monday's low. The
publication of Russian industry data showing lower production and exports in
1994 also aided aluminium.
The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee market sprang to life on
Wednesday after Central American producers unveiled an export retention plan
aimed at reversing the recent price slide - at the end of last week London
futures prices were more than 35 per cent below the highs reached in the
summer.
Although many traders were sceptical about the plan, which would take about
20 per cent of supplies out of the market until more remunerative price
levels were restored, the March position at the LCE leapt Dollars 218 a
tonne on the day. By yesterday's close it was still Dollars 153 up on the
week at Dollars 2,791 a tonne.
The producers were 'strong on words', one trader told the Reuters news
agency on Wednesday, 'but are not likely to be as strong when it comes to
shipments. . . There is little incentive for them to withhold coffee at
current prices'.
The producer move focussed dealers minds on the state of the market,
however, and they seemed to come to the conclusion that the sell-off
following US Department of Agriculture's recent report on the world crop
situation, had been overdone.
Another bearish pronouncement by the USDA - suggesting that world
consumption of coffee in 1994-95 would be 3 to 4 per cent below its June
forecast (before frosts and drought in Brazil drove up prices) - sparked off
a Dollars 75 price retreat on Thursday. But buyers were attracted back
yesterday after Indonesia said it was backing the Central American plan.
Cocoa prices made slow but steady progress meanwhile, until they were
trimmed back marginally yesterday. The March delivery price at the LCE ended
at Pounds 993 a tonne, down Pounds 3 on the day but Pounds 26 up on the
week.
Much of the buying had been encouraged by the tightness of the expiring
December futures position, which widened its premium over the March contract
from Pounds 15 to Pounds 21 over the course of the week.
