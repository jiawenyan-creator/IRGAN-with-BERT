FT  11 DEC 92 / Observer: Blue line
The royal family's sense of public duty is reaching new heights - to the
extent of giving their own blood.
A sample from the Duke of Edinburgh has enabled the Forensic Science Service
to make some progress in identifying nine skeletons unearthed in eastern
Russia last year.
The blood contained DNA which has been matched by home office experts with
minute samples from the remains, which it is thought may include those of
Tsarina Alexandria and three of her children, executed by Bolsheviks in
1918.
Russian scientists asked the FSS for help because of its DNA expertise; the
FSS duly asked Prince Philip for a blood sample. He is directly descended
from the Tsarina through his mother; his grandmother Victoria was the
Tsarina's sister.
The FSS yesterday expressed gratitude for the Duke's interest in its work.
The British royals, in their turn, may find the investigation helpful in
achieving a sense of proportion; whatever their current difficulties,
popular feeling isn't going to run as high in 1992-93 Britain as it did in
1917-18 Russia.
