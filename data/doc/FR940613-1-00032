Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The
requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded
or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other
Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted
by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress
provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed
States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)).
The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity
regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation
and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan
approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and 51.851
of the general conformity rule, the State of West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation
conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly,
West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent
with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not
yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval
of this redesignation request.


2.B.3. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182 Provisions for Ozone Nonattainment Areas


The Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area is classified as moderate and is subject to the requirements of
section 182(b) of the Act. As of November 13, 1992, the date West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request
for the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area, the Charleston, West Virginia area was required to meet the
provisions of section 182(a)(2)(A) to correct its Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements
in effect prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments to the Act. The State of West Virginia submitted those RACT corrections
as SIP revisions to EPA on June 4, 1991. A final rule approving these RACT corrections was published on September 17,
1992 (57 FR 42895).
On January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed
to submit either a full or committal SIP revision for a basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for its ozone
nonattainment areas. On January 18, 1994, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that
West Virginia had failed to submit a 15% rate of progress plan SIP revision for its ozone nonattainment areas. Upon
the effective date of a final approval by EPA of West Virginia's redesignation request, these findings will be automatically
rescinded in the Charleston nonattainment area.


3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act


As stated previously, EPA has approved the RACT corrections noted above. Therefore, the State of West Virginia has
a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as
discussed above. Therefore, the redesignation requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii) has been met.


4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures


Under the 1977 Act, EPA approved the State of West Virginia SIP control strategy for the Charleston, West Virginia
nonattainment 
area. EPA determined that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable.
Since enactment of the 1990 amendments, the State of West Virginia submitted corrections to its RACT regulations
as identified above. EPA finds that these additional measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of
reductions in ambient ozone levels in the Charleston, West Virginia area.
Between 1988 and 1990, because of permanent and enforceable state and federal provisions, emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) were reduced by 8.14 tons/day and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) were reduced by 3.1 tons/day in Charleston. Most of the reductions came from mobile sources and gasoline 
marketing-related activities. The Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), of gasoline marketed for use in the Charleston, West
Virginia area decreased from 10.5 RVP to 9.5 RVP in 1990 and was reduced to 9.0 in 1992. In addition, due to automobile
fleet turnover, there was an increase in the percent of automobiles operated in the Charleston area meeting more stringent
emission standards as required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP). It must be noted here that since
1992 the federal RVP requirement of 9.0 has been the applicable standard in the Charleston, West Virginia area.
