FT  15 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Great expectations for Swedish
giants - Electrolux/Ericsson
Sweden's interim reporting season will get under way this week when two
manufacturing heavyweights, Electrolux and Ericsson, present first-half
figures.
Electrolux, the world's leading manufacturer of household appliances, is
first out of the trap and its results tomorrow are expected to show a
doubling of profits from last year's SKr763m level. The company is
benefiting from a combination of stronger-than-expected recovery in Europe,
healthy sales in the US, and cost-cutting.
The average market forecast is for half-year profits of SKr1.52bn and
full-year profits of SKr2.9bn (Pounds 245m) excluding capital gains.
Ericsson's first-half figures, due on Thursday, are also keenly anticipated,
with analysts looking for profits of between SKr1.8bn and SKr2.6bn compared
with SKr1.28bn a year ago. The performance will be driven by booming sales
of mobile phone systems, where the group has established itself as the clear
world leader.
James Capel in London forecasts an increase in full-year profits to
SKr5.05bn from SKr3.1bn in 1993.
The high expectations for both Electrolux and Ericsson reflect the wider
confidence that Sweden's big multinationals will be presenting exceptionally
strong half-year figures over the next three weeks.
