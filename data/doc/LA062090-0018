MORNING REPORT: OPERA 
Pop Star Pavarotti: Luciano Pavarotti is the new kid on the block of the 
British pop charts. 
His rendition of "Nessun dorma" from Puccini's opera "Turandot" has jumped to 
No. 3 on the singles chart, due in large part to the daily play it receives as 
the theme for the BBC's World Cup soccer coverage. The single's popularity 
propelled Pavarotti's album, "The Essential Pavarotti," to the top of the pop 
album list. Decca Records officials said this is the first time a classical 
album has hit No. 1 on the pop album chart. GREG BRAXTON
