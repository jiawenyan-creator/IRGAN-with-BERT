ON THE SIDELINES; 
MAHORN TRADED TO PHILADELPHIA 
Rick Mahorn, the Minnesota Timberwolves top pick in the NBA expansion draft, 
was traded today to the Philadelphia 76ers for a first-round draft pick in 1990 
and second-round picks the next two years. 
"This is a good deal for both teams," said Timberwolves president Bob Stein. 
"We made the deal because we are willing to make long-term decisions that will 
help our club in the future." 
Mahorn, who played for the NBA champion Detroit Pistons last season, was under 
a two-year contract with the Timberwolves but has refused to report to camp 
until his contract is renegotiated.
