FT  09 FEB 93 / Wages of security guards rise 3.2%
THE AVERAGE hourly wage for security guards has risen by 3.2 per cent to
Pounds 3.50 in the past six months, according to a British Security Industry
Association survey.
Mr David Fletcher, chief executive of the association, said higher wages
were usually paid once customers recognised they were essential for quality
service. Lower wages often lead to higher staff turnover and a consequent
drop in experience and standards, he added.
