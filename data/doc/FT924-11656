FT  24 OCT 92 / Brussels acts to dispel fears over data processing
THE European Commission yesterday acted to dispel fears of draconian EC-wide
restrictions on data processing with the publication of drastically revised
measures to ease the cross-frontier flow of information.
Interest groups had raised vociferous objections to the commission's first
draft directive on data protection, which was published in 1990.
But the commission, which admits the first version was prepared in haste,
has now rewritten the text to meet criticism that it would have hampered the
private sector, while giving the public sector a free rein to process
personal data.
The commission argues that if national data protection laws are not
harmonised, EC countries with high levels of protection - such as Britain
and Germany - will be able to restrict data transmission to their EC
partners.
Among specific changes in the complex text is a decision to apply broadly
the same rules on personal data to public and private sector. Human rights
groups feared that under the earlier text governments would be able to do
what they wanted with personal data.
The commission has also met direct marketers' demands for an 'opt-out'
clause, which will allow them to use personal data - for example, lists of
addresses - unless data subjects have already expressed an objection.
Brussels' controversial proposals to prohibit transfers of data to countries
such as Taiwan which offer little or no protection for personal data have
also been watered down slightly.
The commission hopes the directive will be adopted by member states next
year, and it could come into force from July 1, 1994.
