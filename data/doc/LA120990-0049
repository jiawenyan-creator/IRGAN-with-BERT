NEW COUNCIL MUST HEED VOTER MESSAGE 
As we usher in a new Santa Monica City Council, it is important to recognize 
the messages the voters sent this past election. 
We will no longer tolerate large-scale development that adversely affects our 
residential quality of life. 
The significant support garnered by the independent candidates, coupled with 
the passage of Propositions S and Z, amply attest to that. The council should 
now begin to intelligently manage commercial development to stay within our 
infrastructural capacities and to have it serve our neighborhoods. An essential 
component of such a strategy is immediate downzoning in certain areas and the 
implementation of plans to protect residential neighborhoods from the impacts 
of already-approved development. 
The voters also said that violent behavior by the homeless must stop, and 
solutions need to be developed to help them move back into society. I was 
heartened to see several council candidates adopt the position that, in 
exchange for meals and temporary shelter, able-bodied homeless provide public 
work, such as cleaning up our parks and beaches. 
Finally, the voters said, as did I, that both rent control initiatives were 
unacceptable. The Rent Control Board should now move forward with the Incentive 
Housing Program that would provide landlords substantial rent relief, while at 
the same time assuring preservation of affordable housing through covenants to 
stay in business, enhanced tenant protections and a sensible "inclusionary" 
housing quotient.
