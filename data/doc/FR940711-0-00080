C. Decision 


I conclude that Florida's application for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised, except where otherwise noted. 
Florida now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application, its
previously approved authorities and where otherwise noted in this Notice. Florida also has primary enforcement
responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under Section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement
actions under Sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Florida's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 
This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
