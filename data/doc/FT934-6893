FT  23 NOV 93 / EU to help regions hit by defence rundown
Regions hit by the rundown in defence industries are to receive Pounds 15.5m
in European Union aid, provided the money is committed before the end of the
year, Stewart Dalby writes.
The aid will be matched by Pounds 16m from central local government or
private sector funds.
The aid can be used for such purposes as retraining personnel and
redeveloping redundant defence sites.
The EU money has come from both the European Regional Development Fund and
the European Social Fund, the main structural funds that apply to the UK.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday it had received more
than 250 project applications.
