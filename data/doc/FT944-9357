FT  16 NOV 94 / Porter challenges auditor's figures
The district auditor in the case of alleged vote-rigging by Westminster City
Council was yesterday accused of failing to apply 'fundamental accounting
concepts'.
The accusation was levelled by Mr Michael Wheeler, a senior partner at
Chantrey Vellacott, an accountancy firm, who was called to give evidence to
the public inquiry yesterday by Dame Shirley Porter, former council leader.
He said Mr John Magill, the district auditor and a senior partner at the
accountants Touche Ross, had been inconsistent over certain costs and had
confused capital and revenue expenditure.
Lawyers for Dame Shirley are challenging the district auditor's calculation
that she and nine others should pay a surcharge of Pounds 21.25m to make
good losses through the designated sales scheme.
Mr Wheeler said the scheme had made a profit of Pounds 361,000. Mr Magill
calculated the biggest single item as Pounds 13m - the cost of selling
council properties at a discount instead of their open market prices. Mr
Wheeler said it was 'invalid' to assume they would have been sold at the
higher prices.
The inquiry was adjourned until tomorrow.
