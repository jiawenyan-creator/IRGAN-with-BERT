FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Weaker krona helps lift SSAB
A WEAKER Swedish krona, lower taxes on inputs and cost cutting helped SSAB,
the Swedish steel group, increase pre-tax profits in the first four months
of the year by 42 per cent to SKr124m (Dollars 17.2m), in spite of lower
sales.
SSAB, which was privatised last year, said continued weak demand in western
Europe, including recession-hit Sweden, led to a fall in sales in the period
to SKr4.17bn from SKr4.35bn.
Mr Leif Gustafsson, the chief executive, told shareholders at yesterday's
annual meeting that levels of steel consumption in Sweden were 25 per cent
below those of 1989.
SSAB said its rationalisation programme, combined with lower energy taxes
and a cut in Swedish employers' contributions, had led to savings of
SKr400m.
With an annual net inflow of foreign currency of SKr3bn before last year's
devaluation, the company was also benefiting from the fall in value of the
Swedish currency.
It also anticipated further improvement from a 10 per cent increase in steel
prices since April 1, repeating an earlier forecast that the company would
show a profit over the full year, rebounding from a SKr165m pre-tax loss in
1992.
In the first four months, a SKr34m loss in the steel plate division was
offset by a swing in the products division from a SKr19m loss to a SKr17m
profit, and a sharp reduction in losses in the Tibnor trading unit from a
deficit of SKr53m to a deficit of SKr7m.
