  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The government will press 
ahead with plans for a fresh economic stimulus package while 
trying to revamp the scandal-plagued electoral system, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Monday [24 January]. 
  "I feel responsible for the delay in the announcement (of 
the 
pump-priming measures) from the original schedule of 
mid-January," the government's most senior spokesman told a news 
conference. "Since this is a matter of greatest concern to the 
public we want to work in parallel (with political reform 
deliberations)," he said. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who heads an economic panel 
for the government and ruling coalition parties, plans to resume 
talks with members of his committee early this week, Takemura 
said. But Takemura could not say if the economic stimulus 
package will be put together this month, saying he does not have 
enough information on the timetable. 
  On Monday morning's plunge in Tokyo stock prices, Takemura 
commented, "the government will watch with great interest (the 
stock market movement) as a key index to gauge the state of the 
economy." 
  Share prices went into tailspin on Monday morning as the 
Nikkei stock average of 225 blue chips plunged 836.18 points to 
finish at 18,471.25.
