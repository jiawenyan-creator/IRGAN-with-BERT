SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share 15% $29,846 in non-federal
(cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form
of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations thereof.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. 
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business. 
Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information requirements for this
project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 06400006.
