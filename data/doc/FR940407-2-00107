Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to an Interim Extension of the OTC Bulletin Board

&reg;

 Service Through June 1, 1994</DOCTITLE>


March 31, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 24, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons and is simultaneously approving the proposal.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


On June 1, 1990, the NASD, through a subsidiary corporation, initiated operation of the OTC Bulletin Board Service
(``OTCBB Service'' or ``Service'') in accord with the Commission's approval of File No. SRNASD8819,
as amended.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The OTCBB Service provides a real-time quotation medium that NASD member firms can elect to use to enter, update, and
retrieve quotation information (including unpriced indications of interest) for securities traded over-the-counter
that are neither listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market

SM

 nor on a primary national securities exchange (collectively referred to as ``OTC Equities'').
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Essentially, the Service supports NASD members' market making in OTC Equities through authorized Nasdaq Workstation
units. Real-time access to quotation information captured in the Service is available to subscribers of Level 2/3
Nasdaq service as well as subscribers of vendor-sponsored services that now carry OTCBB Service data. The Service
is currently operating under interim approval that expires on April 1, 1994.

Certain securities listed on a regional exchange may now be eligible for OTCBB quotations. Specifically, on January
24, 1994, the Commission approved an NASD proposal to expand the universe of securities eligible for quotation in
the OTC Bulletin Board to include securities which:
(1) Are listed on one or more regional stock exchanges; and
(2) Do not meet the requirements for dissemination of transaction reports through the facilities of the Consolidated
Tape (``non-Tape B securities''). Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33507 (January 24, 1994) (order approving

</FOOTNOTE>


The NASD hereby files this proposed rule change, pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act and rule 19b4 thereunder,
to obtain authorization for an interim extension of the Service through June 1, 1994. During this interval, there
will be no material change in the OTCBB Service's operational features, absent Commission approval of a corresponding
rule 19b4 filing.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of this filing is to ensure continuity in the operation of the OTCBB Service while the Commission considers
an earlier NASD rule filing (File No. SRNASD927) that requested permanent approval of the Service.
For the month ending February 28, 1993, the Service reflected the market making positions of 384 NASD member firms
displaying quotations/indications of interest in approximately 4,182 OTC Equities.
During the proposed extension, foreign securities and American Depositary Receipts (collectively, ``foreign/ADR
issues'') will remain subject to the twice-daily, update limitation that traces back to the Commission's original
approval of the OTCBB Service's operation. As a result, all priced bids/offers displayed in the Service for foreign/ADR
issues will remain indicative.
In conjunction with the start-up of the Service in 1990, the NASD implemented a filing requirement (under Section
4 of the Schedule H to the NASD By-Laws) and review procedures to verify member firms' compliance with rule 15c211
under the Act. During the proposed extension, this review process will continue to be an important component of the
NASD's oversight of broker-dealers' market making in OTC Equities. The NASD also expects to work closely with the
Commission staff in developing further enhancements to the Service to fulfill the market structure requirements
mandated by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, particularly section 17B of the
Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD notes that implementation of the Reform Act entails Commission rulemaking in several areas, including the
development of mechanisms for gathering and disseminating reliable quotation/transaction information for ``penny
stocks.''


<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
On November 24, 1992, the NASD filed an application with the Commission for interim designation of the Service as an
automated quotation system pursuant to section 17B(b) of the Act. On December 30, 1992, the Commission granted ``Qualifying
Electronic Quotation System'' status for the Service for purposes of certain penny stock rules that became effective
on January 1, 1993. The OTCBB will retain its QEQS status for the term of the proposed extension.
</FOOTNOTE>


2. Statutory Basis


The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b) (6) and (11), and section
17B of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) sets forth the Congressional findings and policy goals respecting operational
enhancements to the securities markets. Basically, the Congress found that new data processing and communications
techniques should be applied to improve the efficiency of market operations, broaden the distribution of market
information, and foster competition among market participants. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, 

inter alia,

 that the NASD's rules promote just and equitable principles of trade, facilitate securities transactions, and protect
public investors. Subsection (11) thereunder authorizes the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of
quotations for securities traded over-the-counter for the purposes of producing fair and informative quotations,
preventing misleading quotations, and promoting orderly procedures for collecting and disseminating quotations.
Finally, section 17B contains Congressional findings and directives respecting the collection and distribution
of quotation information on low-priced equity securities that are neither Nasdaq nor exchange-listed.
