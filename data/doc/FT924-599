FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Kynoch capital reconstruction
Kynoch Group has called an extraordinary meeting for January 14 to consider
proposals for a capital reconstruction to eliminate the deficit on profit
and loss account.
That will involve cancellation of the share premium account and reduction of
the ordinary capital by writing down the nominal value of shares from 25p to
10p.
The group makes and supplies medical equipment, and is involved in Shetland
knitwear. In the 16 months ended December 31 1991 the holding company showed
a deficit on profit and loss account of Pounds 2.08m, and the directors are
forecasting that will increase to no more than Pounds 2.89m for 1992.
It is expected the reduction should be effective in or about February, after
the High Court has given sanction.
