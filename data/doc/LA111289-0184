LOYOLA OPENS YEAR WITH BIG NUMBERS 
On the brink of Loyola Marymount's season opener at Nevada-Las Vegas on 
Wednesday, some trivia about the basketball team: 
* Coach Paul Westhead, entering his fifth season, is fourth in career coaching 
wins at Loyola with 79. He needs five victories to move ahead of Scotty 
McDonald into third and 28 to tie William Donovan for first at 107. John Arndt 
is second at 91. At 79-42, Westhead is head and shoulders above the rest in 
winning percentage at .653. Donovan is next closest at .514. 
* Gersten Pavilion will be the site of the West Coast Conference Tournament, 
March 3-5. The first three tournaments have all been held in the San Francisco 
Bay area, with Loyola winning the last two. Home-court advantage? No home team 
has won the tournament yet. 
* Under Westhead, Loyola's offense has increased 64%, from 68.5 points per game 
the season before Westhead was hired to 112.5 last season, the NCAA record. 
* Barring injury, Loyola's high-scoring triumvirate of seniors, Hank Gathers, 
Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer, should rewrite most of the school record book. 
Gathers, who has scored 1,969 points in his college career (including 233 as a 
freshman at USC), needs 325 points to supplant Forrest McKenzie (2,060 points) 
as the Loyola career scoring leader. Gathers already owns the two best 
single-season totals in school history -- 1,015 last season and 721 the year 
before. With 1,286 career points, Fryer, who has the third-best single season 
of 710, needs 13 to move into the career top 10 and 315 to move into the top 
five. Kimble, with 879 points despite missing 19 games in his Loyola career, 
needs 420 points to move into the top 10. 
* Gathers, who led the nation in scoring and rebounding last season, needs 122 
rebounds to move past Mark Armstrong into second place, and 458 to pass Jim 
Haderlein's career mark of 1,161. Last season he got 426. Gathers needs 31 
points and 296 rebounds to join a select group of collegians to get 2,000 
points and 1,000 rebounds. 
* More Gathers: The WCC's most valuable player as a junior is trying to become 
the 10th player in conference history to repeat. He would join a distinguished 
list: Ken Sears of Santa Clara (1953, '55), Mike Farmer of USF (1957-58), Leroy 
Wright of Pacific (1957, '59) Steve Gray of St. Mary's (1962-63), Ollie Johnson 
of USF (1964-65), Dennis Awtrey of Santa Clara (1969-70), Bill Cartwright of 
USF (1977-78-79), Quintin Dailey of USF (1981-82) and Dwayne Polee of 
Pepperdine (1985-86). (Note: in several years, players have shared the award). 
Notice a missing name? Bill Russell, who led USF to national titles in 1955 and 
'56, was beaten out by Sears for 1955 MVP honors before winning the award in 
1956. 
* Fryer has attempted (632) and made (242) more three-pointers in his career 
than two-pointers (405-179). Last season he led the nation in three-pointers 
made (128) and was third in the country in three-pointers per game (4.1 
average).
