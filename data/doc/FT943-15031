FT  12 JUL 94 / BCCI officer denies responsibility
A former official with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International accused
of helping to fraudulently boost the bank's profits was only following the
instructions of top management whose honesty he never doubted, he told the
Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Imran Imam, a former credit control officer at the bank's London office,
is charged with helping to boost the bank's profits by Dollars 250m by
manipulating loan accounts. He denies charges of conspiring to conceal
documents, furnishing false information and conspiring to falsify records.
Cross-examined by Mr Anthony Evans QC, prosecuting, Mr Iman agreed that as
credit control officer working with Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's former chief
executive, he had been involved in authorising loan guarantees for some of
its biggest customers. The prosecution claims these guarantees were part of
a fraudulent profit-boosting scheme.
Mr Imam agreed that, with hindsight, some of the documents he dealt with had
not been genuine. Yet he insisted he had always been acting on the
instructions of Mr Naqvi, who had usually drafted the documents, or the BCCI
board.
'I had no reason to doubt my superiors,' he said. If Mr Naqvi asked him to
transfer money around the world, he would do so, he said.
Mr Imam said the former chief executive had been in total control of affairs
at BCCI's headquarters.
'Information was given to me by Mr Naqvi on a need to know basis for
whatever work had to be carried out,' he said. He had not had full knowledge
of the transactions.
Mr Evans claimed that Mr Iman was trying to minimise his role in the alleged
fraud by pretending he was only the 'errand-boy'. As an official earning
Pounds 37,000 a year, his job was more than making the tea or making sure Mr
Naqvi's desk had been cleaned, Mr Evans said.
Mr Iman denied this but said that his job could involve running minor
errands at times.
The trial continues.
