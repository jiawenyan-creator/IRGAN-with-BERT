THE WORLD 
Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos remains in critical condition 
after an operation to drain an abscess on his pancreas. But a hospital 
spokesman in Honolulu said he is making normal progress. Marcos, 71, who has 
suffered heart, lung and kidney problems, underwent the three-hour operation 
Tuesday at St. Francis Medical Center to try to reduce a fever. "Although 
Marcos remains in very critical condition, there are no complications from the 
operation," the spokesman said. Marcos, forced out of Manila and into exile by 
a popular uprising in 1986, has been in the hospital for four months. A U.S. 
government prosecutor said Marcos is too ill to stand trial on charges of 
stealing $109 million from the Philippine treasury and fraudulently borrowing 
$165 million from New York banks.
