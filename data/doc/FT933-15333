FT  09 JUL 93 / Polly Peck bankers given apology
THE ADMINISTRATORS to Polly Peck International have apologised to the
Central Bank of the Turkish Republic of northern Cyprus, in a move that may
boost co-operation with the authorities in realising assets in the region.
Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross, one of the administrators, has
withdrawn allegations made during litigation against the bank launched in
October 1991 to recover up to Pounds 45m in Polly Peck funds. He has agreed
to pay legal costs believed to be about Pounds 800,000.
Mr Morris said: 'On the basis of evidence put forward . . . it is now
accepted that there is no foundation for the complaints against the Central
Bank in connection with the disappearance of funds from Polly Peck
International.
'Christopher Morris . . . accordingly apologises to the governor and the
board of the Central Bank for the allegations of fraud and money laundering
which were made in the course of the proceed-ings.'
The apology is likely to ease relations with the authorities of northern
Cyprus, whose co-operation is essential in negotiations over sales of local
PPI subsidiaries.
Mr David Janney, a partner in Theodore Goddard, lawyers for the bank, said
yesterday: 'On behalf of the governor of the Central Bank, I want to say we
are grateful to Mr Morris for making the statement.'
PPI funds passed through the bank's account in London, totalling Pounds 3.6m
in 1988, Pounds 17.6m in 1989 and Pounds 22.5m in 1990. But two of three
Appeal Court judges threw out the administrators' case on the grounds of
insufficient evidence.
