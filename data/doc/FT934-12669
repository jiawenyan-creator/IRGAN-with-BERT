FT  26 OCT 93 / NatWest raises charges for 1m small businesses
NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday announced increases in charges for just
under a million small-business customers.
But the bank said that, to help businesses manage their cashflow, they would
be given a new option of paying charges on a monthly rather than on a
quarterly basis.
The announcement of small rises to the level of charges came just one day
after Lloyds said it would cut its transaction charges to small businesses
by 13 per cent from November 10.
At NatWest, however, from 6 December 6 the account maintenance charge for
the bank's basic tariff will rise from Pounds 7 to Pounds 7.50 a quarter.
Customers will pay 67p for each debit and credit item, compared with the
current charge of 66p.
The Lloyds price cut will see similar charges fall from 75p to 65p per
transaction, while the maintenance charge will remain unchanged at Pounds
2.50 per month.
Ms Jane Bradford, head of NatWest's small-business services, said: 'The
opportunity to settle charges each month, rather than a larger bill every
quarter, will help some small-business customers manage cashflow more
effectively and keep track of the charges they are paying.'
She added that the typical small-business customer, with 30 items passing
through the account each month, would pay only an extra Pounds 6 a year.
The basic tariff is intended for customers with an annual turnover of up to
Pounds 100,000. Larger businesses will still pay on the basis of
individ-ually negotiated charges, normally reviewed with each customer every
year. On average these will increase by about 2.6 per cent, but existing
charges will continue until the next review.
Last month Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, urged
executives of the big four clearing banks to do more to support small
businesses.
Midland is expected to announce its revised small-business charges for next
year later this month.
