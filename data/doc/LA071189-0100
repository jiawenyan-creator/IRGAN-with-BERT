CUOMO TALKS ABOUT 1992 POSSIBILITIES 
New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, reopening a door that he had closed last year, 
said Monday that as a public servant he is "obliged to be open to the 
possibility" of running for President. 
"Of course you have to be open," said Cuomo in an appearance before the New 
York State Broadcasters Assn. 
Nonetheless, Cuomo, a Democrat, said all such talk about his political future 
was speculative. Cuomo was widely expected to run for President in 1988, but he 
decided against it. 
Cuomo has said that he expects to run for reelection as governor next year. In 
his speech Monday he reiterated that he doesn't believe a person can run for 
President while serving as governor. 
Cuomo also said, as he did in 1987, that the Democratic Party would be able to 
find excellent candidates for the presidency in 1992 without turning to him. 
"I'll think about it . . . but I won't think too much," he said jokingly.
