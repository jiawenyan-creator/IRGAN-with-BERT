  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The leader of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) blasted Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Friday for failing to explain his policy 
priorities in an address to the Diet. 
  The premier delievered a major policy speech to the 
legislature "in a very mechanical way," LDP President Yohei Kono 
told reporters. 
  He said he got the impression that the speech was 
"time-consuming but did not reveal what is important to us." 
  Improvement of strained bilateral relations with the United 
States is the issue of most concern now, Kono said, accusing 
Hosokawa of treating it as though it were a trivial matter. 
  The premier should have pointed in his Diet address to 
specific measures to jolt the nation out of the worst economic 
slump since World War II, he said. 
  Kono, the first LDP chief in nearly 40 years to be 
opposition 
leader rather than prime minister, also complained that Hosokawa 
failed to explain the muddle over his abortive plan to reshuffle 
his seven-month-old cabinet. 
  Hosokawa merely read a speech prepared by bureacrats without 
modifications, he added. 
  Asked what he will focus on when he questions the premier in 
the Diet next week, Kono said he will raise the question of what 
achievement the Hosokawa administration has made in the past 
seven months. 
  Hosokawa's coalition government ousted the LDP from power 
last August for the first time in 38 years.
