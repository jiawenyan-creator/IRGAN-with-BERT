FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hopes rise at John D Wood
If interest rates remain low and confidence increases further, John D Wood,
the estate agent, expects to return to profit in the current year.
This follows a significantly better final quarter of the year to April 30,
which enabled the year's loss to be cut from Pounds 497,000 to Pounds
291,000, or from 4.8p to 2.8p per share.
The eight London residential sales offices suffered during last autumn and
winter but the last quarter heralded a recovery in that market as a whole.
The country and agricultural department started well but demand almost
disappeared in the second half of the year.
Turnover at Pounds 4.68m was marginally lower but included a greater number
of sales.
