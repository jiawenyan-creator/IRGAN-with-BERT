SALMAN RUSHDIE CONTROVERSY 
The Salman Rushdie controversy raises interesting questions regarding 
censorship. I'm proud the Western World rushed to his defense; particularly, 
Britain -- he lives there. As for American supporters, count me in, but it's a 
strange side to be on in a country where "The Diary of Anne Frank" is still 
censored in some places; where I was recently requested to remove the word 
"Yid" from an essay by the editor of a New York literary magazine because it 
might cause "a religious war"; where "seven little words" are bleeped from 
movies even on late-night television; where radio stations are still pursued by 
the FCC for obscenities after dark; where racism is so prevalent articles on 
mixed marriages still make newspaper headlines. 
For a hot minute the Rushdie controversy made me think this was the land of the 
free and the home of the brave. Pinch me.
