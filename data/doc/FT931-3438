FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead slips 6% to Pounds 4.7m
ABBOTT MEAD VICKERS, the advertising group, yesterday exceeded analysts'
expectations by turning in pre-tax profits 6 per cent lower at Pounds 4.72m
for the year to December 31, on turnover up 5.6 per cent at Pounds 167.8m.
Operating profits were up by 5 per cent at Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 4.24m), and
a recommended final dividend of 6.3p makes a total of 9.3p (8.4p), payable
from earnings of 18.71p (22.09p) per share.
Operating margins were down slightly at 15.5 per cent (16.6 per cent). The
group ended the year with no debts, and net assets of Pounds 10.1m.
The advertising agencies within the group gained Pounds 50m in new business
through 1992, including significant accounts such as Seat, Adidas, Gillette
and Cellnet.
The group said that three small companies which the group started in 1992,
in sales promotions and investor relations, would be in profit this year,
and that its purchase of some of Clarke Hooper Communications - which went
into receivership in late 1992 - was already showing profits.
Staff levels reached 391 (352) last year, but income per employee levels
were almost stable, at Pounds 73,701 for 1992, against Pounds 74,691 in
1991.
