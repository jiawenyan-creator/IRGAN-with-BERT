 

List of Items Controlled



Equipment for the production of structural composites usable in ``missiles'', as follows:

a. Equipment designed or modified for special fiber surface treatment or for producing prepregs and preforms, not
controlled by 1B01.

b. Filament winding machines, not controlled by 1B01, of which the motions for positioning, wrapping and winding
fibers can be coordinated and programmed in three or more axes, designed for the manufacture of ``composite'' structures
or laminates from ``fibrous or filamentary materials''.

c. Tape-laying machines, not controlled by 1B01, of which the motions for positioning and laying tape or sheets can
be coordinated and programmed in two or more axes, designed for the manufacture of ``composite'' airframe or ``missile''
structures.

d. Equipment designed or modified for the production of ``fibrous or filamentary materials'', not controlled by
1B01, as follows:

d.1. Equipment for converting polymeric fibers (such as polyacrylonitrile, rayon, or polycarbosilane) including
special equipment to strain the fiber during heating;

d.2. Equipment for the chemical vapor deposition of elements or compounds on heated filament substrates; and

d.3. Equipment for the wet-spinning of refractory ceramics (such as aluminum oxide).






Note:

 Equipment covered by 1B21.a includes but is not limited to rollers, tension stretchers, coating equipment, cutting
equipment, and clicker dies.
