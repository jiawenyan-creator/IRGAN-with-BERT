FT  30 NOV 92 / Letter: Penny-pinching leaves passengers suffering
Sir, Your article on passenger reaction to the new Networker trains
('Passengers say new trains create strain', November 25) could be applied to
most of the new trains introduced in recent years. Economic penny-pinching
has won at the expense of passenger comfort.
The class 156 Super Sprinter is seriously deficient in toilet provision. The
ubiquitous class 158 Express Sprinter and the Mark 4 coaches on the East
Coast Main Line are cramped like the Networker. Seats are too narrow and too
close together, particularly where four people are expected to sit with
knees knocking round a table which has insufficient space for their papers.
Larger people and pregnant women are simply not catered for.
The lack of mid-carriage doors and the cramped conditions also extend
unloading times by a significant amount which could be life-threatening in a
major incident. Presumably these designs have passed somebody's safety
audit? A worrying trend for the future is that the 158s are already becoming
rattle-traps with ceiling units and luggage racks banging away throughout
the journey. This same problem was also apparent recently when I sampled the
new stock on the Portsmouth line.
One big advance has been the smoother ride given by the new generation of
bogies and BR should be congratulated on this. However, it would do well to
start again from the body shell and design interiors more suited to
reasonable passenger comfort. The trains are projected to last for 30 years,
but will customers' patience? R J Ardern,
