TRAFFIC IN THE SOUTH 
Jim Newton's article (Oct. 30) on the problems of Mission Viejo caused by the 
development going on around the south Orange County area is a well-expressed 
view of our city's concern about the traffic problem posed by this population 
explosion. 
The puzzling thing about this article, though, is how anyone can do any 
research, whatsoever, on this subject without underlining and repeatedly 
emphasizing the obvious lack of responsibility by Orange County's supervisors 
for permitting this development without first assuring that transportation 
access was adequate to cope with it. 
In this responsibility, our supervisors have been deplorably remiss.
