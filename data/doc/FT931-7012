FT  26 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance
Royal Insurance is obliged to make a virtue out of its capital constraint.
Since growth prospects are limited, it aims to improve profitability by
increased operating efficiency. It is thus less likely than better endowed
competitors to succumb to excess in the upswing. Lloyds has shown that money
can be made by shrinking and cutting costs in banking. But Royal is unlikely
to acquire similar status in insurance. For one thing, its competitors are
also bent on greater efficiency. For another, any battle for market share
can ruin pricing for everybody. In those circumstances, a little spare
capital is always a comfort to management.
Royal could hardly raise fresh equity now. Things might look different next
year, given the improving trend on a range of fronts from reinsurance to
estate agency. Its rebased dividend could then be increased modestly and
still be well covered. The market might even welcome a rights issue next
year on the albeit short-sighted grounds that enhanced growth prospects
would narrow Royal's discount to the rest of the sector.
Those with strong nerves might be tempted to hold on until after Royal has
managed to raise some capital and before the proceeds have been frittered
away. That is a gamble, though, which assumes that mortgage indemnity losses
will continue to fall in 1994. The opposite could happen if building
societies step up repossessions as soon as house prices have risen to the
point where the entire loss is covered by insurance.
