FT  13 OCT 94 / DTI acts to close pyramid groups
The Department of Trade and Industry has moved to close down two more
pyramid selling companies.
It has petitioned the High Court to wind up Powertag Programme and
Headlogic.
The DTI claims that Powertag took over the membership of the Alchemy
Foundation, a pyramid selling company wound up in July this year, with 8,000
members.
Investigators say Powertag continued 'to enlist new members into
money-making schemes which were incapable of making forecast returns to more
than a small fraction of those who participated.'
The DTI also claims Headlogic took over certain assets formerly owned by
Quillpunch, a company linked to Alchemy.
