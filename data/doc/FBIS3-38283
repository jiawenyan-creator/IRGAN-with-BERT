  [Text] Republican Party President Gerard Longuet has given 
his support to the candidacy of Jean-Francois Deniau to lead the 
[majority's] single list for the European elections. He 
affirmed that the Cher region's UDF [Union for French Democracy] 
representative is an "exemplary European" embodying "the passion 
for and reason of Europe." 
  Jean-Francois Deniau is "the candidate of the Republican 
Party," confirmed the industry minister on the France-Inter 
radio station. "He perfectly symbolizes Europe as everybody 
envisages it." 
  Asked whom he sees as leader of a separate RPR [Rally for 
the 
Republic] list, Longuet confirmed that "nothing was in his way," 
but that, to lead an election list, "it would be highly 
preferable" to actually take a seat in Strasbourg [European 
Parliament]. "I hope that the majority's voice is heard as 
strongly as possible, and this only will be possible if it has a 
single list presented by a unified group," Longuet declared, 
noting however that the majority has "always been divided in 
Strasbourg." 
  In Longuet's opinion, "presenting two separate lists during 
the European election campaign would only exaggerate differences 
[within the majority] whereas, over the past 10 months, 
everything has proven that the RPR and UDF are perfectly able to 
build Europe together."
