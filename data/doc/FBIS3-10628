  [Text] The government has authorized the replacement of its 
Hawker Hunter planes by Mirage-5 fighters from the Belgian Air 
Force. This was reported by Chilean Air Force [FACh] Commander 
General Ramon Vega, who said that the FACh had long been 
interested in purchasing the Mirages from Belgium. He said that 
a special delegation will travel to Belgium to analyze the 
operation and the technical characteristics of the airplanes, to 
observe their compatibility with those already owned by the FACh. 
  [Begin Vega recording] This is an old aspiration of the 
FACh. 
We have 45 Hawker Hunter airplanes, which represents a 
considerable figure in our force. Due to their deterioration 
they must be withdrawn from service this year without fail. 
These 20 new airplanes will compensate for the loss of the 
Hawker Hunters. [end recording] 
  Gen. Vega also said that the decision to purchase the 
Mirages 
is the result of many studies carried out over the past few 
years, through which it was determined that the Mirages would 
replace the Hawker Hunters, which have been in operation since 
mid-1968. 
  He added that there are no preestablished terms for delivery 
of the airplanes. Delivery will take as long as is necessary, 
but not longer than a month [as heard], he said. As for the 
cost, Gen. Vega said this was a difficult subject, but it is 
within the ceiling established by law, a little more than $80 
million. He also said that the Belgian Government has granted 
Chile payment terms by which 70 percent of the funds will come 
from a government-to-government credit without charging interest. 
  Gen. Vega said that the FACh wants the contract to be signed 
by the middle of 1994 and the new airplanes to begin operating 
by the end of 1994.
