FT  18 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Investor demand pushes Dow to
record close
Wall Street
THE DOW Jones Industrial Average closed above 3,000 for the first time in
its history yesterday, propelled by demand from investors looking forward to
an economic recovery this summer, and buoyed by some positive corporate
results, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was up 17.58 at 3,004.46. The broader- based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 also rose to a new high, up 2.84 at 390.46. The Nasdaq composite
of over-the- counter stocks climbed 4.56 to 511.31, another record.
Turnover on the New York SE was exceptionally heavy at 248m shares, boosted
by computer program trading and strong institutional demand. Advancing
shares outpaced declining shares by almost two to one.
After opening slightly weaker the Dow spent the day moving back and forth
either side of 3,000 before late afternoon demand helped the index to its
record. Analysts have been expecting the Dow to set a record soon. After the
53-point gain on Tuesday yesterday was seen as the most likely day for a new
closing high for the blue-chip index.
Although the current reporting season has so far been a mixture of good and
bad, the market has risen on the belief that the recession is nearly over.
The fact that the Federal Reserve has not cut interest rates recently, while
initially disappointing, is now being interpreted as a sign that the Fed is
confident the economy can rebound from its trough without the need for lower
interest rates.
Among individual issues AT&amp;T rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 on turnover of
2.4m shares after the telecommunications group unveiled earnings of 65 cents
a share in the first quarter, up from 62 cents a share a year earlier. AT&amp;T
also said it was not ready to raise its bid for NCR, the computer group
which has resisted AT&amp;T's unwanted Dollars 110 a share bid. Yesterday NCR
shares were down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 97 7/8 .
United Technologies slumped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 on turnover of
3m shares after the defence group reported, late on Tuesday, a fall in first
quarter income from Dollars 1.01 a year ago to 25 cents this year.
Philip Morris, one of the market's biggest stocks, eased Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 70 1/4 after the tobacco and foods group met market expectations
with net earnings of Dollars 942m in the first quarter. AMR, the parent
group of American Air lines, rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 63 3/8 in spite
of announcing a loss of Dollars 195.6m for the first three months of this
year.
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the troubled publishing and insurance group, fell
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars  13/16 after General Cinema, the cinema and
retailing company, said talks with Harcourt bondholders had broken down,
threatening the merger agreement between the two companies. General Cinema
shares slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 .

TORONTO prices drifted higher in moderate trading before a late pullback

ahead of losers by 308 to 248.
