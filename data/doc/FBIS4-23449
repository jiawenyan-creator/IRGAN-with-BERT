  [Text] The chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Pierre 
Claver Maganga-Oussavou, gave a news conference this morning in 
which he reiterated his support for judicial and administrative 
recognition of the High Council of the Resistance [HCR]. This 
is in response to a statement by the deputy secretary general of 
the Gabonese Democratic Party in which he says the head of state 
should not recognize the HCR. Here is Mr. Maganga-Oussavou: 
  [Begin Maganga-Oussavou recording] The Gabonese opposition 
assembled within the HCR has never requested a judicial and 
administraive recognition. The right word here is political 
recognition. But what we have been told was that the opposition 
had asked Mr. Bongo for an administrative recognition which, as 
anybody knows, depends on the Interior Ministry. The Gabonese 
opposition is determined to engage in negotiations with the 
president. It wants to be recognized by the executive and the 
one in power now is Mr. Omar Bongo. 
  Otherwise, these negotiations, at least the preparatory 
phase, would have never been started. And this, without doubt, 
means political recognition. [end recording]
