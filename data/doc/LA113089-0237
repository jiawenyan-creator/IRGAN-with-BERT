THE SIDELINES; 
ELWAY AMONG N. ARIZ. APPLICANTS 
Former Stanford and San Jose State Coach Jack Elway is among 77 people who have 
applied for the job as Northern Arizona's football coach, school officials 
said. 
A 12-member search committee started reviewing the applications Monday, and 
officials said Wednesday that a new coach could be named as early as this 
weekend. 
The vacancy occurs because Larry Kentera announced Nov. 7 that he is resigning 
after his fifth season. 
Tom Jurich, Northern Arizona's athletic director, said that among the people 
who have applied besides Elway are USC defensive coordinator Chris Allen; 
Arizona defensive coordinator Larry Mac Duff; former NFL quarterback John 
Hadel, now a receivers coach at Kansas; Arizona State receivers Coach Don 
Bocchi; Western New Mexico Head Coach Bob O'Mera; West Virginia defensive 
coordinator Bob Shaw, and Boise State defensive coordinator John Gough. 
"I think it's a really strong field," Jurich said. "I think it's a credit to 
the university that we can attract those kinds of people."
