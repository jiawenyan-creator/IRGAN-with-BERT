  [Text] Crimea's secession from Ukraine is out of the 
question; [leader of the Republican Party of Crimea] Yuriy 
Meshkov's policy of promising people to take them into Russia's 
arms is a road to nowhere, Mykola Bahrov, chairman of the 
Crimean Supreme Council, told the press. He urged people to 
take a serious view of the situation. 
  He said: The Helsinki Accords established the inviolability 
of borders fixed after World War II. There is an agreement 
between Russia and Ukraine reaffirming the inviolability of the 
two countries' borders. Finally, a trilateral agreement on 
nuclear arms elimination containing the same stipulations was 
signed in Moscow between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. 
Ukraine received guarantees not only from the United States, 
but also from European states, the Crimean parliament speaker 
stressed. Only a naive person can think that Russia will risk 
violating these agreements, Mykola Bahrov said.
