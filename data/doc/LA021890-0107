HE WASN'T A MAN FOR BACKSLAPPING, BUT HE WAS ADMIRABLY DOGGED AND TRUE; 
WASHINGTON: OUR FIRST PRESIDENT HADN'T THE WIT AND FIRE OF JEFFERSON, AND EVEN 
FLUNKED ROMANCE. IT'S HIS PERSEVERANCE AND PROBITY WE LIKE. 
It is difficult to get emotional about George Washington, especially in 
comparison with his 18th-Century contemporaries. Patrick Henry was a fiery 
Revolutionary leader ("Give me liberty or give me death."), John Adams a 
brilliant malcontent famous for his fidgety disposition, and Thomas Jefferson a 
learned patrician who espoused democratic views and was mired in gossipy 
controversies, including an alleged affair with a slave woman. 
Washington had none of these emotive qualities. He wasn't even chummy. There 
was the famous story of his wartime colleagues who, gathering in 1787, marveled 
at Washington's aloofness. One in the group wagered that he could back-slap 
Washington and bring down his icy reserve. But when he put his arm around his 
former leader, Washington removed it, stepped away and returned a cold stare 
that none in the group would ever forget. 
Unlike so many of his colleagues, Washington was not well-educated or even 
bookish. Military analysts -- in his time and now -- have suggested that he 
made mistakes on the battlefield. And he was scarcely noted for his amorous 
success -- his timidity with Sally Fairfax, his first passion, resulted in his 
having to wed a second choice, Martha Dandridge Custis. 
Washington, in contrast to Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, would not find fame 
abroad, for he never traveled to Europe. He ventured only once outside the 
United States, to go to Barbados with his brother Lawrence. 
Finally, Washington had some unattractive physical traits. His feet were 
enormous, and the Marquis de Lafayette, no parochial observer, said 
Washington's hands were "the largest I had ever seen on a human being." Another 
contemporary noted that Washington "is wide-shouldered but has not a deep or 
round chest; is neat-waisted, but is broad across the hips and has rather long 
legs and arms. . . . His mouth is large and generally firmly closed, but which 
from time to time discloses some defective teeth." 
Because Washington had his share of human failings, the historian finds all the 
more reason to honor him on the anniversary of his birth. For Washington also 
exemplified the qualities that have made this nation as great and as 
distinctive as it is. He was the American success story: a man with no 
particular distinction of birth or education who was intent on making it big. 
And make it he did, first as one of the great landowners of his era. He 
persevered in a manner that would upstage abler men and overwhelm his foes. His 
first entrance onto the military stage in the 1750s was unimpressive. No 
matter, he would try again. The British army whipped the dickens out of 
Washington's army time and again, but the general never gave up. 
Washington recognized the division of expertise among men, that some men did 
certain tasks better than others. Although had no great mind, Washington made 
the best of it. He was extraordinary as an administrator, especially as 
President. The matters of state were attended to, capable individuals were 
chosen to carry out policy, and the quest for solving the nation's problems was 
sobered by Washington's perception that ideal solutions might not be possible. 
Most of all, Washington recognized that as the nation's first President, his 
every action served to mold precedent and illuminate posterity. For these 
reasons, his conduct was reserved but unimpeachable. And he made certain that 
the presidency would not become monarchical in tone and that military leaders 
would not prevail over civil authority. 
"His integrity," wrote Jefferson, who often differed with Washington's 
policies, "was most pure, his justice the most inflexible I have ever known; no 
motives of interest or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred, being able to 
bias his decision. He was, indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a good 
and a great man."
