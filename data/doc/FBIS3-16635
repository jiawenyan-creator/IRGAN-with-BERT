  [text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Russia intends, as before, 
to exert vigorous efforts in the framework of the United Nations 
Security Council to promote an early achievement of political 
settlement in Angola, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing on Thursday. 
  "In view of the acuteness and complexity of the situation in 
Angola it would be expedient for the U.N. secretary-general to 
submit to the Security Council a report on the course of the 
negotiations in Lusaka early in April. This would enable the 
Security Council to respond adequately and timely to the 
development of the peacemaking process in Angola," Karasin said. 
  Russian representatives are prepared to continue to meet 
with 
participants in the negotiating process in Luanda, Lusaka and, 
if needed, in Moscow, Karasin said.
