  [Text] [Armenta] The Congressional Permanent Commission 
opened a special meeting at 2330 today. 
  [Announcer] It started late, right? 
  [Armenta] Yes, the meeting started 30 minutes behind 
schedule. The legislators are currently debating whether to give 
Supreme Court Justice Miguel Montes a temporary authority to 
conduct an investigation that will clarify Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's murder. A few minutes ago, PRD [Party of the 
Democratic Revolution] Senator Porfirio Munoz Ledo said his 
party will vote against appointing Miguel Montes as special 
deputy prosecutor in the Colosio murder case, because his 
appointment was made unilaterally and because it does not 
guarantee an impartial investigation. 
  [Begin Munoz recording] We do not believe a decision such as 
the one presented today before the Permanent Commission will 
favor the clarification of this case, and it is even less likely 
to satisfy the desire of Mexican citizens, political forces, and 
the entire country to have clear, honest, and truthful 
proceedings. Therefore, we will openly vote against this 
proposal. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, PAN [National Action Party] and PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] legislators have announced 
that they will vote in favor of Miguel Montes' appointment, 
because the country urgently needs to clarify Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's murder and Justice Montes has shown professional 
proficiency in this area. 
  The Permanent Commission will also discuss and, perhaps 
approve, the appointments of Miguel Mancera Aguayo as governor 
of the Banco de Mexico board and Guillermo Prieto Fortun, Ariel 
Buira Siera, Jesus Marco Jacaman, and Francisco Gil Diaz as 
deputy governors. 
  [Announcer] Jose Luis, it had been constantly rumored that 
this special meeting could also call a special session of 
Congress to modify the Article 72, Paragraph 6 of the 
Constitution. This is the section that includes requirements 
for running for public office. For example, state secretaries 
who want to run for a federal post currently must resign six 
months before Election Day. If this section is reformed, it 
would allow cabinet members to be considered in the selection 
process for a candidate to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
However, this issue will not be discussed, right? 
  [Armenta] No, the issue will not be discussed at this 
meeting. This rumor started yesterday when Maria de los Angeles 
Moreno, the president of the Permanent Commission, called for a 
special meeting but did not specify the meeting's agenda. The 
points to be debated at this special meeting were not revealed 
until today.
