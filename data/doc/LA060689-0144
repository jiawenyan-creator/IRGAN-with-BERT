LOCAL; 
BERGESON TO REVIVE BILL FOR COUNTY VOTE ON TAX HIKE FOR JAIL, COURTS 
After a telephone conference call to patch up differences with Santa Ana city 
officials, State Sen. Marion Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) agreed to revive 
legislation today that would allow Orange County voters to consider a half-cent 
sales tax increase to help finance a new county jail and courts. 
Bergeson, who earlier withdrew her sales tax bill when Santa Ana officials had 
it amended to prevent the new jail from being located in their city, was 
scheduled to ask the Senate Judiciary Committee this afternoon to revive the 
measure and approve it without any reference as to where the new jail would go, 
said Kevin Sloat, Bergeson's administrative assistant. 
The move comes after Bergeson convened the telephone conference call with Santa 
Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, Councilman Miguel A. Pulido and Orange County 
Sheriff Brad Gates on Monday, Sloat said. That led to a fragile agreement that 
called for the officials to stop their open feuding and for Bergeson to send 
the sales tax bill on its way through the Legislature. 
In return, Sloat said, Santa Ana officials agreed to drop their amendment to 
the bill requiring the proposed 6,000-bed jail to be located at least a mile 
from the nearest school -- a condition that would preclude downtown Santa Ana 
as a potential site. It was this amendment that prompted Bergeson to withdraw 
her bill in the first place. 
Santa Ana officials, however, reserved the right to push for the amendment 
again if the Orange County Board of Supervisors doesn't pick another location.
