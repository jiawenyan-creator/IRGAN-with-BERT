FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ lamb sales to UK fall
further
BRITAIN'S traditional role as the dominant buyer of New Zealand lamb was
eroded further last year owing to growing sales to continental Europe, the
Middle East and Asia.
In 1975 Britain took about 90 per cent of New Zealand lamb. But the Meat
Board's annual report, just published, shows this fell below 30 per cent in
the year to September, and that it could fall further as new markets are
developed.
Since 1966 there has been a swing towards added processing in New Zealand.
When the frozen meat trade was developed exclusively with Britain in 1882 UK
butchers preferred whole carcass lamb, and there was no added processing.
By 1980, 72 per cent was whole carcass lamb and 18 per cent was processed. A
decade later 45 per cent was whole carcass and 55 per cent processed. In
1990, 99 per cent of all beef was exported in boneless form.
The report says that while Britain remained the largest market for New
Zealand lamb and offal and a substantial market for mutton, prices declined
during the year, reflecting the UK recession and steep falls in the domestic
prices for mutton, pork, poultry and offal.
The board says the removal of the variable premium on domestic sheepmeat
this year should improve sales and prospects for New Zealand lamb, as would
a changed seasonal pattern of domestic lamb production. But the market will
be influenced by other meats, particularly cheap pork and poultry.
The outlook for New Zealand lamb in most European countries is promising,
with sheepmeat consumption improving, and the board expects price levels and
volumes shipped to rise.
In 1991, frozen lamb sales to France were up 120 per cent at 13,651 tonnes.
Germany took 22 per cent - 14,090 tonnes. East Germany became a new market
following unification.
Sales of frozen lamb to the Middle East rose 62 per cent from 39,396 tonnes
to 63,901 tonnes last year, or 22 per cent of all production. Total exports
to the region, including mutton, beef and veal, increased from 43,680 to
82,757 tonnes. The report says that the population growth in the Gulf, and
its inability to become self sufficient in lamb, continues to underpin this
market.
However 90 per cent of sales were to the catering trade, and the remaining
10 per cent to expatriates. 'The largest untapped market is to encourage
Arabs to buy frozen meat and sheepmeat at retail stores.'
The opening of the Japanese beef market from April 1 last year led to
confusion which will take some two years to settle down, the report says.
It anticipated that Japan would be buying 500,000 tonnes of beef a year by
1995. Korea had also liberalised its trade. Such factors, and high economic
growth rates suggested that Asia would become even more important, although
mutton volumes from New Zealand would fall in the short to medium term.
Japan preserved its position, held since 1984, as the main buyer of New
Zealand sheepmeats, although sales fell from 18,220 to 17,940 tonnes during
the year.
The report says that the North American beef market will remain strong this
year. But there were prospects of restraints under the Meat Import Law
because the trigger level was expected to be lower than in 1991.
Australian production would be the dominant factor. There were indications
that the drought-induced slaughter of 1991 could lead to reduced production
this year.
The report says significant cost savings of about 30 per cent were made
during the year on freight costs to North America.
