  [Text] Cairo, 4 May (MENA)--MENA has learned that 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat refused to sign the maps 
contained in the annexes of the agreement because they did not 
match an agreement reached with the Israeli side in a meeting 
that lasted until 0230 this morning. No new maps were prepared 
because there was no time to prepare prints of the maps agreed 
on. 
  A dispute emerged over the size of Jericho and whether it is 
a city or an area. An agreement was reached that the size of 
Jericho is 61.5 square km and that the 20 additional square km 
can be added to the Jericho area when the matter is discussed 
again in three months. President 'Arafat rejected this idea. 
He wants Jericho's size to be discussed in three months without 
prior specification of the area that can be added. 
  Another dispute emerged concerning a 13-km stretch of land 
on 
Gaza's coast that has an Israeli settlement. An agreement was 
reached that the matter will be discussed again in three months 
and that the Palestinians have the right to engage in any 
activity in that area in the meantime. Responsible Palestinian 
sources say that future talks on this matter may lead to the 
removal of the entire settlement.
