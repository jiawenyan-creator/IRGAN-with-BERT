PETE SCHABARUM ON TERM LIMITS 
I'm feeling inclined to kid you people and say that for once I'm agreeing with 
you. 
That was an insightful section dealing with Prop. 140 (Perspectives on Term 
Limits, Commentary, Nov. 13). Do note that we're Republicans here. 
We voters must have just gotten a taste of how frustrating it is to be a 
legislator, in that the things you vote for have predictably both good and bad 
results. Things just can't be simple, no way.
