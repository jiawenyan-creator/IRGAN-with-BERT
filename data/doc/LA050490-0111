Pitcher Rick Sutcliffe will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder 
Monday, the Chicago Cubs said. 
Bothered again by a sore pitching shoulder that hindered him during the latter 
part of the 1989 season, when he was 16-11, Sutcliffe began the 1990 campaign 
on the 21-day disabled list.
