FT  11 JAN 92 / Sex pests suffer mild sanctions
EMPLOYEES who suffer sexual harassment are more likely to switch jobs than
are their harassers, according to the first survey of British management
attitudes to the issue.
The most common punishment for harassers was found to be an official or
unofficial warning. The next most common outcome was no action.
Researchers from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology found that a majority of 110 personnel directors at leading
companies favoured preventive measures. Just over 30 per cent wanted
stronger laws.
Nearly 90 per cent of employers had not issued a policy statement on sexual
harassment.
The survey's authors said victims were unlikely to report incidents unless
they were sure complaints would be dealt with seriously and sympathetically.
The researchers relate employers' apathy towards the difficulty of defining
sexual harassment. The European Commission is considering a definition, and
the researchers believe this would be helpful.
A recent survey in the US found that more than three-quarters of personnel
managers who responded said they had a formal written sexual harassment
policy.
