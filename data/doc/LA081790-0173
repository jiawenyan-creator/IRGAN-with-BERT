P.M. BRIEFING; 
CELLULAR PHONES IN NEW ZEALAND 
BellSouth Corp. is going ahead with plans to develop an advanced cellular 
telephone network in New Zealand, believed to be the first such system in the 
Southern Hemisphere. 
The Atlanta-based telecommunications company announced today it is proceeding 
with the project following approval from the New Zealand Commerce Commission. 
BellSouth spokeswoman Carlton Hill said the company plans to spend $100 million 
over 10 years to develop the network and will begin offering cellular phone 
service to New Zealanders in 1992.
