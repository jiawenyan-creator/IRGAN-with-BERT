<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to AlliedSignal, Inc.
(formerly Allied-Signal, Inc., Garrett Engine Division, Garrett Turbine Engine Company, and AiResearch Manufacturing
Co. of Arizona) TPE331 series turboprop and TSE331 series turboshaft engines. This proposal would require a record
check of engine records to determine if any repair, assembly, modification, or installation work was performed by
Fliteline Maintenance, or Mr. Eugene E. Shanks, or Mr. Carl Ramirez. In addition, for engines determined to have repair,
assembly, modification, or installation work performed by Fliteline Maintenance, or Mr. Eugene E. Shanks, or Mr.
Carl Ramirez, this action would require verification of all life-limited components, inspection of affected components,
and verification of compliance with all applicable AD's. This proposal is prompted by the results of a Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) investigation involving engines repaired, assembled, modified, or installed by Fliteline
Maintenance. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent uncontained failure of turbine rotors,
fire, or loss of aircraft control.
