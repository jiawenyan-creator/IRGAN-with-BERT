FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Oil boosts Ampolex profits to
ADollars 29.8m
AMPOLEX, the Australian energy group, yesterday announced a 114 per cent
increase in net profit to ADollars 29.8m (USDollars 20m), largely thanks to
revenues from the Kutubu oilfield in Papua New Guinea.
Ampolex said operating profit increased by 207 per cent to ADollars 67.5m in
the six months to the end of December, reflecting a 100 per cent increase in
sales of crude oil to a record 6m barrels.
Net profit was reduced by an increase in tax payments from ADollars 8m to
ADollars 37.6m, mainly as a result of exposure to higher tax rates in PNG,
where the group paid tax of ADollars 28.2m.
Revenue increased from ADollars 89m to ADollars 238.3m, reflecting the
group's 16.46 per cent share of Kutubu output and revenue from the resale of
oil purchased from other Kutubu producers.
Ampolex said Kutubu production is expected to rise to an average of 120,000
barrels a day in the second half, compared with 114,000 barrels in December
and 99,000 barrels over first six months.
The group said gas production for the period rose by 15 per cent to 1bn
cubic feet, due mainly to higher output from its US interests.
