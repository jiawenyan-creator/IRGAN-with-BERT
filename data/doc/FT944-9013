FT  17 NOV 94 / People: Morgan finds his password at Zergo
Peter Morgan, former director general of the Institute of Directors, has
added Zergo, an information security company, to his list of non-executive
directorships.
Morgan, 58, will be able to exploit his computer expertise in his new role:
for 30 years he worked for International Business Machines, the world's
largest computer company, before moving to the IoD in 1989 for a period in
office distinguished by trenchant defence of the free market.
Zergo, with a turnover of about Pounds 7m and funded through venture
capital, looks a different kind of story. It is a comparatively new company,
based in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Its managing director is Professor Henry
Becker, a specialist in passwords and encryption technologies.
Its successes include providing security modules to Visa International and
enhanced security systems for the banks' Clearing House Automated Payment
System.
Morgan's role is expected to include overseeing Zergo's eventual move to the
stock market. Despite some jitters about high technology companies in the
light of recent reverses, Morgan should have little difficulty in persuading
the City of Zergo's potential. Information security is foremost in many
minds at present.
