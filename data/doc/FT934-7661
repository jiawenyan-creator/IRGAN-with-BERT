FT  18 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: Immunity vote goes against Tapie
Businessman and former French urban affairs minister Bernard Tapie (left)
was brought a step nearer investigation for alleged fraud after a National
Assembly committee recommended the lifting of his parliamentary immunity.
The vote follows a request by a state prosecutor investigating alleged
embezzlement at Testut, a maker of scales and part of the holding company
Bernard Tapie Finance. The full assembly will decide on the recommendation.
