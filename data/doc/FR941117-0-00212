 

In addition to enhanced confirmation disclosure, the Staff Report discussed the overall benefits of price transparency
and the need for greater transparency in the municipal securities market.

7

 Notably, price transparency enhances market liquidity and depth, and fosters investor confidence,

8

 while a lack of price information impairs market pricing mechanisms, weakens competition, and prevents investors
from monitoring the quality of their executions.

Commissions Annual Conference (1994).

To address some of the recommendations contained in the Staff Report, on March 9, 1994, the Commission issued for comment
proposed Rule 15c213 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'')

10

 to require disclosure of mark-ups in riskless principal transactions in municipal securities. Because the same
benefits of mark-up disclosure apply to other debt transactions, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 10b10
(``Rule'') under the Exchange Act that would require riskless principal mark-up disclosure for debt securities
other than municipal securities.

The Commission previously proposed disclosure requirements of mark-ups in riskless principal transactions on
three other occasions. 

See

 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15220 (Oct. 6, 1978), 43 FR 47538 (proposing mark-up disclosure for riskless
principal transactions in municipal securities); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13661 (June 23, 1977), 42
FR 33348 (proposing mark-up disclosure by non-market makers in riskless principal equity and debt securities, but
not municipal securities); and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12806 (Sept. 16, 1976), 41 FR 41432 (proposing
mark-up disclosure by non-market makers in riskless principal transactions involving equity and debt securities).

</FOOTNOTE>


Since the Proposing Release was issued for comment on March 9, 1994, municipal market participants have proposed
significant new ways of making pricing information more widely available to investors. The Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') has taken the first step toward a system that will make publicly available price information
for municipal securities transactions on a next day basis. Recently, the MSRB stated that its ``ultimate goal for
the [transparency] program is to collect and make available transaction information in a comprehensive and contemporaneous
manner (footnote omitted) *** [and] wishe[d] to reiterate to the Commission its commitment to these
goals.''

12

 The Public Securities Association (``PSA'') also has proposed a system to publicize municipal securities price
information. These proposals will create the infrastructure necessary to enhance transparency in the market, and
when fully implemented, will provide last sale reporting for virtually all municipal securities transactions.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission is encouraged by these developments, and after careful consideration, has determined to defer the
riskless principal mark-up proposal for six months

13

 in anticipation of meaningful progress by the industry toward enhanced price transparency in the municipal securities
market. The riskless principal mark-up proposals would provide better information only to a certain segment of transactions
in the debt markets. The industry's efforts to improve transparency, on the other hand, ultimately will result in
enhanced price disclosure for 

all

 transactions. Moreover, better dissemination of price information will benefit investors by providing them with
useful information at the time they are making their investment decision, rather than after-the-fact when the confirmation
is received. If, at the end of the six-month period, industry initiatives to improve price transparency have not progressed
to the Commission's satisfaction, however, the Commission may reconsider the riskless principal mark-up proposal
in light of existing alternatives.

Recently, the MSRB set forth a tentative schedule for the completion of each of the four phases of its proposal: phase
one (inter-dealer transactions, January 1, 1995); phase two (addition of time of trade and institutional customer
transactions, December 1995); phase three (addition of retail customer transactions, November 1996); and phase
four (more contemporaneous trade reporting, April 1997).

B. Other Disclosures


In addition to the riskless principal mark-up proposals, the Commission proposed several other amendments designed
to improve confirmation disclosure so that customers can better evaluate their securities transactions. Specifically,
the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 10b10 that would require broker-dealers to disclose (1) mark-ups
in connection with transactions in certain NASDAQ and regional exchange-listed securities; (2) if they are not members
of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC''); (3) information relevant to certain types of collateralized
debt instruments; and (4) if a debt security has not been rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization
(``NRSRO''). Proposed Rule 15c213 contained a similar provision requiring broker-dealers to disclose the
unrated status of a municipal security.
