  [Text] At 1030 on 2 April, the high-ranking delegation of 
the Kingdom of Cambodia led by Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, first prime minister; and Samdech Hun Sen, second 
prime minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia, held talks 
with the high-ranking SRV delegation led by His Excellency Vo 
Van Kiet, Vietnamese prime minister, who is on a visit to 
Cambodia. 
  The talks went on for over two hours and focussed on two 
issues, namely the border issue and that of Vietnamese residents 
in Cambodia. The two sides agreed to set up a joint technical 
committee to check and mark the border between the two countries 
and to set up appropriate technical groups concerning Vietnamese 
residents in Cambodia. 
  The two sides informed one another of the economic and 
political situation and other areas and also pointed out the 
concrete points in relations between Cambodia and Vietnam. The 
two sides also discussed the issue of goods circulation, 
particularly the transport of goods through Vietnam.
