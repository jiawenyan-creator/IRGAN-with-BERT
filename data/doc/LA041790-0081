WORLD IN BRIEF; 
EAST GERMANY; 
2,000 DEMONSTRATE AT SOVIET AIR BASE 
About 2,000 people marched to a Soviet air force base to protest the accidental 
explosion of two missiles, the East German news service ADN reported. 
Demonstrators gathered at the Tutow base near Neubrandenburg to demand a halt 
to the use of live ammunition by planes on training flights and to call for the 
closing of the base, ADN said. It said the demonstration was prompted by an 
accident last week in which two missiles from a Soviet fighter plane exploded, 
damaging five farm silos.
