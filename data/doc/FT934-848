FT  22 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Betting shops sell-off
planned
The Victorian government hopes to attract more than 150,000 shareholders and
raise around ADollars 750m by floating a 75 per cent interest in the state's
Totalizator Agency Board (TAB), the government-run network of betting shops,
on the stockmarket. The remaining 25 per cent will be allocated to the
racing industry.
Money from the sale - expected to be Victoria's largest public flotation -
will help pay off some of the state's hefty debts.
It is hoped to list the shares on the Australian Stock Exchange in time for
next year's Melbourne Cup horse race, listed for November 1.
