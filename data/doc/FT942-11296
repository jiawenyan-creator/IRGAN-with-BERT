FT  06 MAY 94 / Students spurn jobs in accounting
The number of students entering chartered accountancy has slumped to the
lowest level in 20 years, a report on education within the profession says,
Andrew Jack writes.
There were only 4,074 trainees with the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales joining firms in 1992-93, reducing steadily from a peak
of 7,063 in 1988-89. The figure was last this low in 1974.
Mr Phil Armitage, director of education and training for the institute, said
the decline reflected a reduction in demand for new entrants by the UK's
accountancy firms, which have been cutting numbers since the start of the
recession.
The decline poses a considerable threat to the finances of the institute
which relies on new recruits for a substantial proportion of its income.
More than 90 per cent of entrants were graduates, and 61.5 per cent joined
firms with more than 100 partners. Women comprised 37 per cent of the
intake.
