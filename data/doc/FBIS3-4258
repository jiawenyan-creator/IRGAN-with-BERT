  [Text] Beijing, March 27 (XINHUA) -- Approved by State 
Council departments, a state-level industrial demonstration zone 
will be set up in the new port city of Fangchenggang in 
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  The zone is aimed to help the region eliminate abject 
poverty 
by improving laborers' general qualities and increasing their 
income. 
  China has set a target of wiping out abject poverty among 
its 
80 million poverty-stricken people by the year of 2000. 
  The Fengchenggang Zone is the first of the kind set up by 
the 
state, according to today's "PEOPLE'S DAILY". 
  Officials from the State Council office in charge of aid-the 
poor projects and the World Bank have arrived in the city on a 
study tour. 
  A special loan will be granted by the World Bank for the 
construction of the zone which is designated to cover four 
square kilometers. 
  Preferential policies will be given to the zone to attract 
both domestic and overseas investors. 
  Workers employed on the zone's projects must come from the 
region's poor areas. They will start work after training in the 
job center in the zone.
