FT  08 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Caught in a trap
Extending a product line, rather than launching a new brand, has the
attraction of offering quick rewards while minimising risk. The cost of
successfully launching a brand in the US, for example, is typically Dollars
30m (Pounds 19.3m) compared with Dollars 5m for a line extension.
But being swept along in 'line extension mania' can be dangerous.
In the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review* John Quelch, a Harvard
professor, and David Kenny, of consultancy Bain &amp; Co, identify pitfalls
which include:
Excessive segmentation and consumer confusion. If product lines are extended
without removing any existing items, the resulting clutter may drive
consumers to seek simple, all-purpose products.
Weakening brand loyalty. When a company extends its line, argue the authors,
'it risks disrupting the patterns and habits that underlie brand loyality
and reopening the entire purchase decision'. Customers may be encouraged to
switch brands.
Missing out on new brands. Some products currently marketed as extensions
could well have been launched as discrete brands. Long-term profits are
often sacrificed in favour of short-term risk management, say the authors.
No extension of demand. 'People do not eat or drink more, wash their hair
more, or brush their teeth more frequently simply because they have more
products from which to choose,' the authors say.
Other traps include damaging relations with retailers - the number of
packaged goods in the US grew 16 per cent each year from 1985 to 1992, while
retail shelf space expanded by only 1.5 per cent each year. Market share
gains from line extensions are also short-lived, as they can be copied
quickly by the competition.
