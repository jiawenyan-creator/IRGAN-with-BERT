FT  19 MAY 93 / Prison officers raise threat of industrial action
PRISON OFFICERS yesterday raised the threat of industrial action over the
introduction of private management to the state prison service.
Mr John Bartell, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said there
was a 'distinct possibility' that the union's annual conference next week
could call for a national ballot on industrial action over privatisation.
Mr Bartell said staffing cuts and market testing were forcing down service
quality and exposing prison officers to danger. Officers were being made to
cut corners to save money and basic security procedures were not being
applied. There had been a 60 per cent increase in assaults on prison
officers in the past two years. Private management had produced farcical
results, said Mr Bartell, with a series of escapes after Group 4 took over
Britain's first privately managed prisoner escort service last month.
