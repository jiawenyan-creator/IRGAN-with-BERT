  [Text] Hohhot, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Nine cities along the 
border areas in Hulun Buir League, north China's Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region, have emerged as world trading centers. 
  Bordering on Russia and Mongolia, the league was approved in 
1988 to be built into an experimental zone for China's economic 
structural reform. 
  It has since then built nine port cities with modern 
railway, 
highway and airport connections and opened more than 10 tourist 
routes leading to Russia and Mongolia. 
  In 1993, the trade volume handled by the nine cities added 
up 
to 804 million Swiss francs, a hefty 120 percent rise from 1992. 
  Overseas economic and technological cooperations in the 
region have also expanded to involve Japan, the Republic of 
Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, the United States, 
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. 
  Last year, the region implemented 151 such cooperation 
contracts, totalling 60.21 million Swiss francs. It also used 
72 million yuan in foreign funds to build 44 joint ventures. 
  In addition, the number of foreign tourists in the league 
topped 100,000 people, with a total turnover of 65 million yuan, 
including 400,000 U.S. dollars.
