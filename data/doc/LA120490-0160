CANOGA PARK MAN KILLS 1 OF 3 ASSAILANTS IN ROBBERY ATTEMPT 
A Canoga Park man shot and killed one of three assailants armed with shotguns 
when they forced their way into his house Monday night, causing the two other 
gunmen to flee and foiling what police described as an attempted robbery. 
Police today were hunting for the two suspects and investigating the death of 
Minnooie Pat Farjad, 19, who was found dead next to a 12-gauge shotgun in the 
house in the 8500 block of Fullbright Avenue. 
Police did not release the name of the 30-year-old man who allegedly shot 
Farjad or the names of two other men who were in the house at the time. Police 
said they were investigating the shooting, but said it appeared to be 
justified. 
According to LAPD Lt. Harvie Eubank, the incident began about 10:30 p.m. when 
the gunmen confronted a friend of the two men who lived in the house, described 
as construction workers who also worked on race cars at the residence. 
The friend, who was approaching a mobile home parked in the front yard to 
retrieve some clothes he had left there, was first ordered to lie on the 
ground, Eubank said. Then he was told he would be killed if he did not open the 
front door of the house, Eubank said. 
"He made enough noise that he tipped off his friends inside to what was going 
on," Eubank said. "One of them armed himself with a .38-caliber weapon." 
When the friend led the gunmen into the house, he saw one of the residents 
standing in the hallway with the gun and dropped to the floor, police said. The 
resident fired six shots, killing Farjad. The other gunmen, described as a 
black and a Latino, ran without firing a shot and drove away in a black 
Mustang, Eubank said.
