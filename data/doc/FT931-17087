FT  02 JAN 93 / International Company News: Court ruling clears way for
Arnotts takeover bid
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit maker fighting a hostile takeover bid from
Campbell Soup, the US food group, said it would appeal against a court
ruling invalidating a 1985 shareholding agreement.
The judgment, delivered by the New South Wales supreme court on Thursday,
clears the way for Campbell to pursue its ADollars 8.80 a share offer, which
values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn (Dollars 827m).
Campbell, which already owns 32.9 per cent of Arnotts, is seeking a further
17.2 per cent for majority control, but has offered to buy all the 67.1 per
cent of the shares it does not own.
Arnotts argued that the agreement between the companies prevented Campbell
from voting more than 14.5 per cent of the stock or appointing a majority of
directors unless it acquired more than 85 per cent of the shares.
However, Justice Windeyer ruled that the agreement was valid only while
Campbell's shareholding remained below 40 per cent, freeing Campbell to seek
control of Arnotts.
The agreement was drawn up in 1985 when Campbell took a friendly
shareholding in Arnotts as part of its defence against an unwelcome takeover
bid by Mr Alan Bond.
The judge said the agreement was intended to prevent Campbell from seizing
control of Arnotts without paying for it. He said the agreement had no
bearing on a full takeover offer.
Campbell delayed the closing date for its offer by two weeks in response to
the ruling. The offer, which is with shareholders, will now expire on
January 28.
Analysts say Campbell may have to raise its bid, following suggestions by
the two largest institutional shareholders that the offer price was too low.
An independent report commissioned by Arnotts valued the group at a minimum
of ADollars 10.78 a share. The shares closed at ADollars 9.20 on the
Australian Stock Exchange on Thursday.
