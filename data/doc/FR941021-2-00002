ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose
the environmental impacts of authorizing helicopter landing tours on icefields adjacent to the city of Juneau, Alaska.
The proposed action is to issue five year special use permits (19951999) authorizing Coastal Helicopter,
Inc., ERA Helicopters, Inc. and Temsco Helicopter, Inc. to land on the Juneau icefields at specified locations and
conduct tours. The majority of use would occur between May and September of each year. Tours would originate at private
heliports and helicopter flightpaths would transit a variety of private and municipal lands prior to entering the
National Forest. The proposed action would increase authorized helicopter landings tours on the Juneau icefields
from 11,000 in 1994 to a maximum of 22,000 in 1999.



The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State and local agencies as well as individuals
and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by, the proposed action.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments concerning the scope of the analysis should be received in writing by October 21, 1994.

<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Send written comments or requests for additional information to John Favro, Recreation Staff Officer, Juneau Ranger
District, 8465 Old Dairy Road, Juneau, Alaska 99801, (907) 5868800.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose and need for the proposed action is to meet public demand for quality guided services which provide safe
access to remote locations on the Juneau Icefield. Meeting this demand includes providing for visitor safety and
an appropriate balance between commercial guided recreation opportunities and non-commercial, non-guided recreation
opportunities without unacceptable impacts to other forest users and resources.




Kenneth E. Mitchell, Juneau District Ranger, Tongass National Forest, Chatham Area, is the deciding official. The
decision to be made is whether or not to issue special use permits for helicopter landing tours as requested, and if
permits are issued, decide the levels to be authorized and the mitigation measures that will be required.

The no action and proposed action alternatives will be considered in the EIS as well as other alternatives which address
significant issues and satisfy the purpose and need for the action. Alternatives may consider limiting the number
of landings, moving heliports, or defining flight paths.
