  [Text] Russia believes that North Korea should honor all 
its commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, said 
the Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and 
information department, Grigoriy Karasin, at Tuesday's briefing 
in Moscow. 
  According to him, Moscow welcomes the statement by the 
chairman of the U.N. Security Council, which urges Pyongyang to 
allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to conclude its 
inspections in North Korea in accordance with the agreement 
reached between them on February 15th. 
  "Russia views the statement, which was adopted by consensus, 
as a timely action reflecting the world community's concern 
about the situation connected with the North Korean nuclear 
problem. We hope that Pyongyang will pay due attention to the 
recommendations given in the statement," he said.

RUSSIAN TANKS WAS DELIVERED TO CHINA 
  As Karasin said, "the allegations that a large consignment 
of 
T-80 tanks was delivered to China from Russia are absolutely 
groundless." 
  According to the diplomat, "the development of military- 
technical ties between Russia and China is a normal component of 
their relationship." Such ties "are effectuated through state 
structures and under appropriate control." 
  "In the area of military equipment deliveries to China, 
Russia observes the generally-accepted principles of 
transparence, including the despatch of the necessary data to 
the U.N. Conventional Weapons Register," said the spokesman for 
Russia's Foreign Ministry.
