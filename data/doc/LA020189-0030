DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
2 YOUTHS ARRESTED IN DRUG-RELATED SLAYING 
Two teen-age gang members were arrested Tuesday in the drug-related slaying of 
a Studio City man three months ago in a Pacoima alley, Los Angeles police said. 
Police arrested a 16-year-old from Sepulveda and a 17-year-old from Pacoima on 
suspicion of murder in the shooting death of Gary Bolden, Detective Al Ferrand 
said. Bolden, 44, died Oct. 27 in an alley in the 12900 block of Foothill 
Boulevard. 
The arrests were made after police served search warrants at 7 a.m. Tuesday at 
nine locations in the Pacoima and Sepulveda areas, Ferrand said. Investigators 
believe the locations were used by members of a drug-selling organization 
involved in the slaying, he said. 
The suspects are being held without bail at Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, police 
said. 
Investigators believe Bolden was trying to enter the drug business in the area 
when he was killed and robbed by the two suspects, Ferrand said. The suspects 
are members of a gang competing for drug business in the same area, he said. 
Also arrested was Sam Ferrell, 19, of Pacoima, on suspicion of possession of 
cocaine for sale. He was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail at the Van Nuys 
jail. Police found several weapons, drug paraphernalia and a small amount of 
cocaine in the searches, Ferrand said.
