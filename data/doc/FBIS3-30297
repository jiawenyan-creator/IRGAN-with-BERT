  [Text] Sofia, January 31 (BTA) -- At a regular meeting 
today the Council of Ministers decided to export Bulgarian 
uranium concentrate abroad. The decision concerned 500 tonnes 
of concentrate stocked before the entry into force of the decree 
closing down uranium mines. According to the commission set up 
by the government last December to explore prospects for using 
the uranium concentrate, it will be inefficient to resume 
uranium mining in Bulgaria. The commission came to this 
conclusion considering the high prime cost of the local product, 
which exceeds the average international price about 4.5-fold, 
says a commission report heard by the cabinet today. According 
to the commission, Bulgaria would lose about 10 billion leva by 
the year 2005 by using the more expensive local product. 
  The commission suggested three schemes for utilizing the 
uranium concentrate. The first one envisages that it be sold at 
international market prices, the second that it be stored in 
special depots and the third that it be processed to use in 
Bulgarian nuclear reactors. 
  Yet taking into account Bulgaria has no technology to 
process 
the concentrate into fuel and that current storage methods turn 
the ore into a potential environmental threat, the commission 
recommends to sell abroad. The Council of Ministers would 
further on select the export agents.
