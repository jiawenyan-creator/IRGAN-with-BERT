ALLA BREVE 
BRUCKNER: Symphony No. 5. NDR Orchestra, conducted by Gunter Wand. RCA Victor 
60361-2-RC (compact disc). 
A skeptical consumer might wonder why RCA Victor is remaking its Wand-Bruckner 
cycle when Wand's perfectly good earlier one, vintage 1974-1981, is still in 
its catalogue. There certainly are some differences in this new Fifth -- more 
expressive, flexible phrasing from the wise old veteran conductor, a better 
orchestra with less raucous brass, slightly superior live digital sound. Yet 
Wand's basic overview remains the same, an invigorating, straight-ahead 
approach that only taps moderately into Bruckner's spiritual depths. RICHARD S.
