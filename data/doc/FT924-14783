FT  08 OCT 92 / Engineers' salaries outstrip inflation
INCREASES in engineers' pay have outpaced inflation in the past three years,
a survey published yesterday shows.
The survey compiled for the Engineering Council said that incorporated
engineers and engineering technicians, mainly support staff, had won
increases 10.3 percentage points above the rise in the retail prices index
in the three years to April 5 1992, pushing their average annual earnings up
by 31.7 per cent to Pounds 23,483.
It also said that chartered engineers, mainly project leaders, had won rises
7.2 percentage points above inflation over the period, pushing their average
annual earnings to Pounds 31,768.
Mr Denis Filer, Engineering Council director, said: 'The industry is now
paying salaries which recognise the value and output of engineers.'
Engineers' pay had fallen behind other professions, but rises have been 1
point higher than other professional groups every year since 1988, he said.
The gap between engineers who would recommend the profession to young men
and those who would recommend it to young women is far narrower than it was
in 1989.
More than 75 per cent of engineers would now recommend the profession to
young women. More than 80 per cent of chartered engineers and 77 per cent of
incorporated engineers would recommend the profession to young men.
The survey of 8,000 workers also showed that about 75 per cent of all
engineers and technicians had undertaken further training.
The council said that 11,000 of the 18,000 engineers who had qualified for
the European Community's professional engineering qualification, the Eur
Ing, were British.
The proportion of incorporated engineers contracted to work 37.5 hours or
more a week has fallen to 49.5 per cent, the lowest level since the surveys
began in 1979.
