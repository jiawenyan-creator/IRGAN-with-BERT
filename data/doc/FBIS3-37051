<F P=106> [Unattributed report on presidential aide Georgiy Satarov's </F>
statement under the "Politics" rubric: "Boris Yeltsin Realizes 
That It Is Better To Rely on Those Who Put Up Resistance, Says 
Georgiy Satarov, Aide to the Russian Federation President"] 
  [Text] The president has a range of political problems 
concerning relations with the Federal Assembly, parties, and 
public organizations. I have been called upon to help him in 
this work. My current role, that of presidential adviser, as I 
see it is basically a continuation of what I have done as a 
member of the Presidential Council, that is, to help the 
president collaborate with other bodies of power. 
  As for my specific steps, in the near future I plan to 
present to the president my program, my vision of the problems, 
but so far I would not like to talk about that. As I have said, 
I see my new role as creating a requisite political atmosphere 
where relations between the president and the Federal Assembly 
would be based on information flows coming from both sides. 
  As I mull over why Boris Yeltsin chose me as an aide, 
although I have far from always "expressed my full approval," I 
come to the conclusion that the president realizes that he needs 
to rely on those who put up resistance, who are not afraid to 
speak up and to defend their views.
