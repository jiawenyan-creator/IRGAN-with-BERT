FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Brittan says EMU project
still alive
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's Trade Commissioner, yesterday warned the
Conservative party against thinking that the recent crisis in the European
exchange rate mechanism had signalled an end of the European Monetary Union
project, James Blitz writes.
Addressing a fringe meeting to rally support for next year's European
elections, Sir Leon said that, far from abandoning the Emu project ,
Britain's European partners were preparing themselves to re-think the
project against a different time-scale.
'It is not realistic to think that the concept of Emu will go away or be
destroyed,' said Sir Leon. 'The lesson our European partners have learned is
that the concept of Emu will have to be achieved in a different way.'
