FT  29 JUL 92 / Union hits at BMW plans for US plant
GERMANY'S IG Metall metalworkers' union said yesterday it would fight BMW's
plan to build a factory in South Carolina without union representation for
workers, AP reports from Berlin.
IG Metall, which claims with 3.6m members to be the biggest union in the
west, accused BMW of deciding to build in the US on political rather than
economic grounds, to the detriment of Germany's industrial base. It said it
would co-operate with the US autoworkers' union to see that the plant was
unionised.
Munich-based BMW announced last month it had chosen to build its first US
plant in South Carolina with an investment of Dollars 250m.
Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, BMW chairman, said in a meeting last week with
reporters from South Carolina that the company would fight attempts to
unionise the plant, and that a second plant would be built in the state.
'We don't need an outside, third party between management and our
employees,' he said.
IG Metall yesterday released a letter sent to Mr von Kuenheim from Mr Klaus
Zwickel, a deputy president of the union, vowing that BMW will be 'no
exception' to the union's policy of seeing that workers are represented in
German-owned plants abroad.
The union would work closely with the United Automobile Workers in the US
during the construction phase of the South Carolina plant to secure union
representation, Mr Zwickel's letter said.
In Germany it would be unthinkable for BMW to open a new factory without
union representation, and German law requires that employees be represented
on an oversight council with power to influence company policy. Mr Zwickel
is a member of the oversight council at BMW.
The doctrine is considered a cornerstone of social peace, democracy and good
labor relations in Germany.
However, in recent years the high pay and benefits enjoyed by German workers
have come under increasing fire from employers who say Germany is losing its
industrial competitiveness.
