  [Text] As of yesterday, the Cyprus Police have increased 
security measures at Jordanian interests in Cyprus following 
information that terrorist attacks might be launched against 
them. 
  The information was conveyed to the security authorities 
after the recent assassination of the Jordanian Embassy first 
secretary in Beirut by the Palestinian organization, Hamas 
[Islamic Movement]. The Hamas organization proceeded with this 
action after Jordan deported 24 Iranians. However, because of 
Jordan's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian talks on the Middle 
East issue, fears are expressed that the incident will not end 
there. 
  This is why the Cyprus authorities have increased security 
measures at the Royal Jordanian Airlines offices in Nicosia 
while police patrols in the surrounding area have also been 
increased and the police guards have strict orders to keep their 
eyes open. Measures have also been adopted at other "targets." 
  As is known, Jordan does not have an embassy or any other 
diplomatic mission in Cyprus but it has a person who functions 
as a representative. 
  The police have heightened vigilance to avert any possible 
criminal acts.
