FT  08 JUL 92 / NatWest sheds 180 London jobs
NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday made redundant about 180 staff from West
End branches in London. They were called to two mass meetings, told they
were redundant and sent home.
The action was condemned by Bifu, the banking union, which accused NatWest
Bank of selecting staff who were the cheapest to sack.
