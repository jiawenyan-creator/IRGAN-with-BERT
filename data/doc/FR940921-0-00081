86.09424 


Test vehicles and engines. 


(a) ***
(5) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks covered by an application for certification will be divided into groupings
(e.g., by fuel type) which are expected to have similar evaporative emission characteristics throughout their useful
life. Each group of vehicles with similar evaporative emission characteristics shall be defined as a separate evaporative
emission family. 
(6) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks to be classed in the same evaporative emission family, vehicles
must be similar with respect to: 


* * * * * 


(iv) Fuel type. 


* * * * * 


(12) Vehicles powered by heavy-duty engines covered by an application for certification and using fuels for which
there is an applicable evaporative emission standard will be divided into groupings of vehicles on the basis of physical
features, including fuel type, which are expected to affect evaporative emissions. Each group of vehicles with similar
features shall be defined as a separate evaporative emission family. 
(13) For vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for which there are applicable evaporative emission
standards to be classed in the same evaporative emission family, vehicles must be identical with respect to: 


* * * * * 


(iii) Fuel type. 
(14) For vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for which there are applicable evaporative emission
standards to be classed in the same evaporative emission control system family, vehicles must be identical with respect
to: 


* * * * * 


(15) Where vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines using fuels for which there are applicable evaporative emission
standards and which cannot be divided into evaporative emission family-control system combinations based on the
criteria listed above, the Administrator will establish evaporative emission family-control system combinations
for those vehicles based on features most related to their evaporative emission characteristics.
