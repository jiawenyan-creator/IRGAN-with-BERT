  [Excerpts] Moscow, 23 Mar -- Rescue teams are carrying out 
an on-the-spot investigation of the burnt-out debris of the 
Aerflot Airbus A-310-300 which crashed last night near 
Mezhdurechensk in Kuzbass and measures are being taken to find 
out what caused the airliner, regarded as one of the world's 
safest planes, to crash. [passage omitted] 
  Representatives of the Russian airlines' ground services 
state that no technical malfunction was registered on board the 
airliner prior to its flight. This is the reason why foreign 
news agencies speak of an act of subversion on board the plane. 
Some local residents, who saw and heard a mid-air explosion, 
are also of the same view. [passage omitted]
