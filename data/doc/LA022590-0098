VISALIA; 
TODDLER SAVED FROM FIRE; 2 PEOPLE DIE 
Two people were killed when fire destroyed a one-story home in Visalia, but a 
3-year-old girl was saved when a family friend broke a bedroom window and 
snatched her from the smoke-filled room, firefighters said. "When I heard the 
children were in there, I wasn't afraid," said Troy Green Jr., 25, of Visalia.
