  [Text] Nairobi, May 10 (AFP) -- A Ghanaian UN soldier was 
killed in Kigali when he was hit by shrapnel from mortar fire 
near a stadium in the capital, a UN statement said. Ghanaian UN 
troops and more than 3,000 refugees were using Amahoro stadium 
as a shelter, a UN statement said. 
  The stadium has been turned into a temporary shelter for 
people who have tried to escape the brutal ethnic massacres 
hitting the tiny east African country, according to the UN 
statement obtained here Monday. It said he was the 11th soldier 
in the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda killed in Rwanda since 
the country slid back into civil war last month after President 
Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspicious airplane crash.
