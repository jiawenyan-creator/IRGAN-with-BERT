FT  25 OCT 93 / Lloyds cuts small business charges
LLOYDS BANK yesterday announced it was cutting charges for small businesses.
About 350,000 such customers will see transaction charges cut by 13 per cent
from November 10.
Customers on the bank's standard business tariff will pay 65p for each debit
and credit item compared with the present charge of 75p.
Mr Mike Shaw, head of business banking, said: 'This is good news for most of
our small business customers. The changes are possible because of cost
reductions and other improvements in our internal efficiency.
'We have decided to share the benefits with our small business customers,
many of whom have been going through difficult times, but who have a vital
role to play in the economic recovery.'
Lloyds has also decided to introduce pre-notification of charges for small
businesses from January. Small businesses, defined by Lloyds as those with
annual turnover of up to Pounds 1m, will get a breakdown of transaction
charges and debit interest before they are debited to accounts.
At the same time Lloyds will drop the Pounds 4 charge on cheques returned
because of lack of funds. Charges for unauthorised overdrafts will be cut
and simplified and bankers' draft and electronic funds transfer payments
will also be made cheaper to small businesses.
The bank said: 'We have come under criticism. Niggling charges are being
streamlined or got rid of.'
Charges for larger businesses are not being altered.
Lloyds' move comes a month after Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, called in executives of the big four clearing banks and urged them
to do more to support small businesses.
