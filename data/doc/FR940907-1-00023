SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background


The Department of the Navy has adopted procurement policies and procedures that implement and supplement the Federal
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) [48 CFR] and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). The
policies and procedures are known collectively as the Navy Acquisition Procedures Supplement (NAPS). Pursuant
to FAR 32.500(b), the Navy developed a shipbuilding progress payments clause for use in fixed price (FP) and fixed
price incentive (FI) contracts for construction or for shipbuilding or ship conversion, alteration, or repair,
when the contracts provide for progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion. The shipbuilding progress
payments clauses are being revised primarily with the intent of incorporating controls, terms and provisions consistent
with those found in the clause at FAR 52.23216, Progress Payments. 


B. Summary of Major Revisions 


(1) Definitions. Consolidates the FI clause definitions. 
(2) Computation of Payments. The proposed rule modifies the payment limitation of 100% of allowable costs to include
unliquidated progress payments made to subcontractors. 
(3) Invoices. The proposed rule modifies the invoicing provision by requiring contractor certification of the amount
of unliquidated progress payments made to subcontractors. 
(4) Physical Progress and Weighting Factors. The proposed rule modifies the physical progress and weighting factors
provision to give the Contracting Officer the unilateral right to establish the weighting factors if the contractor
and the Contracting Officer cannot reach agreement. 
(5) Incurred Costs. The proposed rule adds to the list of incurred costs exclusions, costs incurred by subcontractors
and suppliers; and capitalized costs and interim payments to subcontractors and suppliers. This provides consistency
with the FAR progress payments clause. The proposed rule also removes the small business provision that allows for
billing of material costs not paid for by the contractor. 
(6) Progress Payments to Subcontractors. The proposed rule adds a new section containing provisions from the FAR
progress payments clause that govern payments to subcontractors. 
(7) Liens and Title. A proposed provision is added which references Liens and Title provisions found elsewhere in
the contract. 
(8) Reduction and Suspension. The proposed rule adds a new section incorporating provisions from the FAR progress
payments clause that govern reductions and suspension of progress payments. 
(9) Limitations on Undefinitized Contract Actions. A proposed new section is added incorporating provisions from
the FAR progress payments clause that govern limitations on Undefinitized Contract Actions. 
(10) Special Terms Regarding Default. A proposed new section is added incorporating provisions from the FAR progress
payments clause that govern treatment of progress payments in a contract default. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The proposed rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirement under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Supporting data requirements identified in the proposed rule include only data
already required to be maintained by shipbuilding contractors. 


D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Information 


The proposed rule will have no economic impact upon small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

. The shipbuilding progress payment clauses have been incorporated into applicable contracts since the early 1980's,
affecting all shipbuilders, large and small. The proposed NAPS rule will benefit the Navy and its shipbuilding contractors
by insuring uniform application and administration of progress payments. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility
analysis has been performed.
