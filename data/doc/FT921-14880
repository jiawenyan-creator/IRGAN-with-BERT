FT  14 JAN 92 / Letter: No politics in union backing
Sir, In your report on the conclusion of the industrial tribunal hearing of
the case of shop stewards unfairly dismissed by the Port of London Authority
in 1989 ('TGWU Pounds 1.5m to fight dockers' case', December 24) you
accurately draw attention to the support given by the TGWU to its members in
this case, regardless of the great financial costs incurred. In giving this
support the union was clearly discharging its obligations to its members. We
do not put a price on securing justice.
I must, however, take serious exception to your concluding paragraph, which
asserts that such support 'has a political dimension' and implies that I
gave it, as general secretary of the TGWU, because I was in turn supported
by 'mainly left-wing dockers'.
This is a slur on myself and the union. All members, irrespective of their
political views (or any other opinions), have exactly the same right to
support from their union when it is needed. Any shop steward or other
members victimised by their employer in this outrageous way will receive the
unqualified backing of the TGWU in whatever way is necessary to secure
justice. Politics does not enter into it, and the implication that I am more
supportive of those who allegedly support me than those who do not is
grossly inaccurate and unworthy of the Financial Times.
