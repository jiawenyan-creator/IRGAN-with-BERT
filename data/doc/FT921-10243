FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Courage to distribute beer for Japanese
brewer
COURAGE will begin distributing beer in the UK for Asahi, the Japanese
brewer, in April.
Asahi has a 20 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing of Australia, Courage's
parent company.
The Japanese brewer at present exports only a few thousand bottles of beer a
year to the UK, mainly to Japanese restaurants in the London area.
Asahi will ship its Super Dry brand and expects to sell some 3m bottles
during the next 12 months through Courage's national distribution net-work.
If it achieves its sales targets, Asahi said it hoped to switch to local
production under licence by Courage.
Courage already distributes Molson Dry for the Canadian brewer, part-owned
by Foster's. Its lager portfolio also includes Budweiser, Miller,
Kronenbourg, Holsten, and Carlsberg in some trade sectors.
