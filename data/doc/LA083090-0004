DEBATE OVER BUSH'S ACTIONS IN PERSIAN GULF 
It is remarkable that the reasonable Casey Kasem and many in the Arab community 
accuse the United States of a double standard when we sent troops to Saudi 
Arabia and instituted an economic blockade against Iraq but did nothing when 
"Israel invaded Lebanon." Did Kuwait attack Iraq or even threaten Iraq? Israel 
tolerated being harassed and shot at with missiles from PLO bases in Lebanon 
for a long time before it went into Lebanon. 
He also said the United States practices a double standard since we do not 
force Israel out of the West Bank and Gaza. How can he disregard the fact that 
the Arab nations had all those territories until they staged their invasions 
and were defeated? Except for Egypt, they refuse to negotiate and are still in 
a state of war against Israel. What kind of a logical equation is this?
