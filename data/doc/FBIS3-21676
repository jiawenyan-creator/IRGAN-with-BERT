  [Text] An antinarcotics bureau squad was carrying out a 
raid in the Burj al-Barajinah area when it suddenly came under 
fire. The squad returned fire and reportedly wounded some of 
the attackers. A B'abda police force led by Commander Colonel 
Naji al-Hadi subsequently intervened, pursued the gunmen, and 
seized a large quantity of narcotics in the area.
