FT  23 AUG 94 / Archer's broker 'happy' about Anglia share role
Mr Broosk Saib (above), for whom Lord Archer placed orders to buy and sell
Anglia Television shares, last night said he was 'very happy' about his role
in the transaction, which has been the focus of a Department of Trade and
Industry investigation into alleged insider trading, William Lewis writes.
'I am happy, I am very happy, I am comfortable and I am very calm about the
whole thing as I know there are no problems,' he said. Lord Archer placed an
order for Mr Saib to buy 50,000 Anglia shares a few days before a Pounds
292m takeover offer by MAI for the television company. The DTI said last
month it would be taking no further action against Lord Archer after a
five-month inquiry. Lady Archer sits on the Anglia board.
When asked how he felt about making an Pounds 80,000 profit from the share
transaction, Mr Saib said: 'Anyone could buy shares, and I have bought a lot
of shares in my lifetime, and I continue to do so.' He added: 'I have no
problem and I hope neither has Lord Archer. I feel there is nothing in the
case.'
