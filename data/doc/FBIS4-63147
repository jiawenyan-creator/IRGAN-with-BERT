  [Text] Stepanakert, 19 May (SNARK)--"I am sure that the 
final document on realization of Moscow protocol dated 18 
February 1994 -- which was signed last Tuesday by the heads of 
defense departments of Russia, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh -- 
is capable to end bloodshed and open way to a long-term peace in 
Karabakh region," told in his interview to SNARK today the head 
of International Organizations Department in Karabakh Foreign 
Office, Massis Mailyan. 
  "Regretfully, he observed, Azerbaijan has not yet joined 
this 
agreement. However we hope that the official Baku will finally 
accept the realities and sign the Moscow document, which 
provides a mechanism of cease-fire control."
