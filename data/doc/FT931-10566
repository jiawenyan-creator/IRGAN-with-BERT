FT  08 FEB 93 / Malaysia broadens markets
MALAYSIAN investment in China totalled about MDollars 2bn (Pounds 526m) last
year as industry sought to broaden its markets and reduce dependence on the
US, Europe and Japan, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, said at
the weekend.
He said in London he was not concerned that a substantial flow of investment
into China might undermine investment in Malaysia's development. Falling
domestic investment was the result of a strategy to expand into new markets,
including China, Vietnam and Africa.
Mr Anwar said: 'I don't think this a source of concern or major worry. Is it
being done at the expense of investment domestically? The answer is no. Does
it actually affect in a small way investments locally? Yes. But we have not
taken any measures to curb or discourage investments overseas.'
In common with Chinese communities in other Asian countries, ethnic Chinese
companies and businessmen are looking to participate in the rapid growth of
China's economy.
'We encourage this trend. We want penetration into new markets. We want to
continue to have effective trading arrangements with China,' Mr Anwar said.
China was not competing for the type of investment which Malaysia was now
seeking, Mr Anwar said.
Mr Anwar said that he hoped to bring down inflation this year to 4 per cent
from 4.7 per cent last year, and that he would be comfortable with 7 per
cent economic growth as this would help to contain inflation. But spending
on infastructure could push growth nearer to recent levels of 8 to 9 per
cent.
