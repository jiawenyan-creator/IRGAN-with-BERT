Airbus Industrie Order: Trans European Airways signed a contract with Airbus 
Industrie for eight new aircraft and options for four more jetliners in the 
largest order the European aircraft maker has ever received from a charter 
airline. TEA, of Belgium, will take delivery on the eight A310-300, wide-bodied 
planes beginning in late 1990, an Airbus statement said. The planes will seat 
275 passengers in an all-economy layout. The total price of the deal was not 
disclosed, but Airbus said each of the jetliners costs about $62 million.
