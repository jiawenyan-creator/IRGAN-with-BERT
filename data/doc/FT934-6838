FT  23 NOV 93 / Observer: What's your poison?
Here's a problem Agatha Christie never considered: how to get rid of a jar
of strychnine - legally. It may not be an everyday problem, but the
experience of a north London colleague who found such a jar in his fuse
cupboard suggests there may be a need for a poisoner's charter.
The label gave instructions on poisoning moles written in 1964 by a former
resident: mix with earthworms and use as bait. But on balance we'd rather
have live children than dead moles.
However, the local chemist didn't want to touch it, and nor did the police,
who weren't even concerned as to its whereabouts. The pharmacy at the Royal
Free Hospital tried to find out who could handle it and rang back after an
hour suggesting the Ministry of Agriculture. The man from the ministry
wasn't interested and thought it was a job for Camden council's
environmental health department. No luck there either. But how about the
hazardous waste department of the London Waste Regulation Authority?
Preliminary investigations were not encouraging. An answerphone handled the
inquiry. But when one of the staff of the few remnants of Ken Livingstone's
GLC rang back service couldn't have been better. What's your poison, and how
soon can we collect it?
Is Citizen Ken's Charter working better than William Waldegrave's?
