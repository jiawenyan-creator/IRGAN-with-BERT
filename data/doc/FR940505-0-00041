Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model ATP Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Jetstream Model ATP airplanes, that requires
a one-time inspection and appropriate torque loading check of certain wing top surface stringer joint fasteners,
and correction of discrepancies. This amendment is prompted by a report of loose fasteners on the wing top surface
stringer joint bolts at Rib 0. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity
of the wing top surface stringer joints at Rib 0, which subsequently could lead to reduced structural integrity of
the wing.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective June 6, 1994.


The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of June 6, 1994.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Jetstream Model ATP airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 65569). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection and appropriate torque loading
check of certain wing top surface stringer joint fasteners, and correction of discrepancies.


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received.
The commenter supports the proposal.
Since issuance of the notice, Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Revision 3 of BAe ATP Service Bulletin ATP5714,
dated December 15, 1993. This revision of the service bulletin is essentially identical to Revision 1, which was referenced
in the notice, but contains certain editorial changes. The FAA has revised the final rule to include a reference to
Revision 3 of the service bulletin as an additional source of appropriate service information.
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 50
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $27,500, or $2,750 per airplane.
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption
