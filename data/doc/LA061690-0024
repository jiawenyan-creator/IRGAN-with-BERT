DODGERS SHOULD CENTER ATTENTION ON BULLPEN 
It has come to my attention that the Dodgers have four center fielders (Gibson, 
Gonzalez, Javier and Gwynn). Since Fred Claire doesn't believe in buying or 
trading for quality relief pitchers, maybe some of the center fielders should 
be given a chance in the bullpen.
