FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on Finance Bill debate time
LABOUR has warned the government not to use the move to a unified Budget
next year as an excuse for curtailing the Commons' ability to discuss the
Finance Bill.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, is to announce within the next
week the government's plans for the December Budget in a year's time.
The announcement will come in a letter to Mr Nick Brown, an opposition
Treasury spokesman, who last week raised with Mr Dorrell Labour's concerns
that the government would seek to cut the period in which the Finance Bill
was before parliament, and would deal with technical matters in secondary
legislation rather than in the bill itself.
That warning has been underlined by opposition MPs organising extended
debate on a number of technical financial measures - which would normally
get little or no discussion - as a sign of what might happen if ministers
ignored their concerns.
The opposition argued that if the gaps between the different stages of
parliamentary debate on the Finance Bill were shortened, then other
organisations would be less able to offer advice on whether the drafting
accurately reflected government intentions.
At present, the Treasury publishes economic forecasts both at the time of
the Budget in spring and in the Autumn Statement.
Once the two events are combined in a unified Budget, Labour will seek a
set-piece economic debate at Westminster in July to provide a second
forecasting occasion.
The government intends the second Budget next year to take place some three
months earlier than the traditional March Budget arrangements, with the
Finance Bill completing its passage through parliament perhaps by late May.
