RETHINKING DEFENSE; 
ARMING FOR THE '90S; 
BRACING FOR THE 'BUILD-DOWN'; 
AEROSPACE: DEFENSE CUTBACKS WILL HIT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ECONOMY HARD. BUT 
THE SUFFERING ISN'T LIKELY TO BE AS GREAT AS IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO. 
In the 1977 film "Fun With Dick and Jane," George Segal and Jane Fonda played a 
husband and wife who turn to armed robbery to support their comfortable 
Southern California suburban life style after he is laid off as an aerospace 
engineer and cannot find work. 
It was an exaggeration, of course, but the black comedy did reflect the pain 
and dislocation then occurring in the Southland's aerospace industry. 
The impending end of the Vietnam War, coupled with completion of the Apollo 
moon-landing program, wiped out more than 100,000 Southern California jobs 
between 1970 and 1973, and many workers had trouble finding comparable 
employment outside the defense or space areas. Some engineers became janitors, 
surplus defense plants became ghostly federal warehouses and the regional 
economy went into a bad recession. 
Now, as the Cold War seems to be ending and the Reagan-era defense buildup is 
fading, some worry that another economic tailspin may be lurking -- perhaps 
even worse than that of nearly 20 years ago. There is strong evidence that a 
slump has already begun: An estimated 5,000 aerospace jobs in Southern 
California were eliminated last year, and 9,000 more have been lopped off this 
year. All forecasts are for job losses of that magnitude or greater to continue 
well into the 1990s. 
What is clear is that the local economy will take a wallop over the next five 
years as defense budgets shrink, major weapons projects end and thousands of 
aerospace workers lose their jobs. That will have spillover effects on 
everything from charitable contributions to municipal tax revenues. 
So far, however, many experts are crossing their fingers, arguing that the 
Southland economy is vastly larger and more diversified than it was and 
therefore should weather the difficult times faced by its huge defense segment 
with little lasting damage. 
Given the region's strong job market and expanding economy in most other 
sectors, the dislocation coming in defense may be minimized, most experts 
believe, and most workers will be able to find new jobs. 
They are especially hopeful that the booming market for commercial jets -- 
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have huge order backlogs from the airlines that 
will last at least a decade -- will soften the blow of defense cuts. Although 
Boeing is based in Seattle, much of the subcontracting for its jetliners is 
done in Southern California, and McDonnell Douglas builds its commercial 
aircraft in Long Beach. 
"I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that (laid-off defense workers) are all 
going to be working as clerks at Sears," said John Oliver Wilson, chief 
economist at Bank of America. "Unlike the 1960s, we've got demand for engineers 
and the defense companies are rushing to diversify." 
Since World War II, Southern California has had the nation's largest 
concentration of defense contractors. Its pioneering flight industry was 
quickly converted to wartime production in the early 1940s, and, in essence, it 
has never really switched back. From the region's factories and hangars have 
poured fighter planes, missiles and other armaments to fight three wars and to 
maintain the Cold War arsenal. 
According to figures compiled by the Commission on State Finance, federal 
defense spending in California hit a relative peak in 1968, representing a 
whopping 14.6% of that year's gross state product (the value of all goods and 
services produced in California). That dropped off rapidly with the end of the 
Vietnam War, hitting a low of 6.6% in 1979 before the Reagan buildup began. 
"Aerospace went into a free fall after 1968," said David Hensley, director of 
California forecasting at the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. "But it's not 
in a free fall now, and it probably won't go into one." 
Even at the peak of the 1980s defense buildup in 1986, federal defense spending 
in California amounted to just 9.6% of the gross state product -- well below 
the 1968 record. It is estimated at 8.1% for 1989, heading to 6% or less by the 
mid-1990s. 
"Everybody seems to be expecting us to take a kick in the pants (if defense 
spending drops sharply)," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles 
Area Chamber of Commerce. "But we may already have had it since 1986, and we've 
hardly noticed." 
Of course, it is easy to talk of the ability of the Southland economy to 
swallow the big defense cutbacks in the "macro" terms favored by economists. In 
that world, the regional economy is simply one big job factory and everybody 
who is let go by a defense contractor will simply find work elsewhere because 
the job market is so strong. 
The truth is, however, that the defense "build-down" will hit many people and 
economic segments very hard, and it is likely that the local economy will take 
years to recover. The most likely effects: 
Many highly skilled engineers and technical workers will have a very hard time 
finding comparable work in commercial or civilian fields in Southern 
California. The Reagan-era buildup lasted almost a decade, and many of those 
who will lose their jobs have been working in highly specialized fields for 
relatively high pay. Although the Southland job market is considered robust, 
its ability to absorb thousands of skilled technical workers with considerable 
experience and hefty salary needs is highly doubtful. 
In addition, employment in the commercial aircraft programs that many are 
counting on to take up the slack of defense cuts is not likely to be expanded 
dramatically in the next few years. The commercial jet companies seem content 
at this point to increase productivity through overtime and to stretch out 
delivery schedules instead of adding new production facilities in expensive 
Southern California. 
Although most experts predict a fairly gradual, managed decline in defense 
expenditures, it is possible that at least one or two major projects being 
built in the Southland could be wiped out soon. Among the threatened programs 
seem to be McDonnell Douglas' C-17 transport, Northrop and Lockheed's Advanced 
Tactical Fighter and Northrop's Stealth bomber. Together these programs employ 
more than 20,000 workers in Southern California. To lose one or more of them in 
the early 1990s, as seems probable, would be a devastating blow to industry 
hopes for only a gradual loss of jobs, mostly through retirements and normal 
attrition. (Last week, in fact, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was reported to 
have proposed cutting production of the C-17 from 10 planes to six next year.) 
The region's huge network of defense subcontractors, who make everything from 
electronics to fasteners, plastic devices and fabricated metal parts, is 
already hurting from the end of some projects, notably Rockwell's B-1 bomber. 
Many subcontractors are expected to have a difficult time switching to 
commercial work after years of lucrative defense contracts. Although some are 
finding success as subcontractors for the region's burgeoning high-tech and 
biotech industries, others have noticeably scaled back operations and laid off 
workers. 
The shrinkage of the defense industry here could be a body blow for the 
region's commercial and residential real estate industries. The area's 
astronomical home prices have already softened, some say in part because of the 
loss of so many high-paying aerospace jobs. And large vacancies have already 
occurred in the Los Angeles International Airport, El Segundo and South Bay 
regions, where the defense industry is concentrated. By one account, 25% of the 
office space near the airport is now vacant. 
How severe the effects of the defense downturn will be depends largely on how 
the Bush Administration decides to make the cuts and how strongly Congress 
fights reductions that will hurt local employers. The early signals from the 
White House and Defense Secretary Cheney are that a fairly rapid reduction in 
the size of the Army may occur but that the elimination of big procurement 
programs will be gradual. 
"I don't think (the federal government) will make the same mistake again and 
cut defense spending sharply all at once, as they did in the early 1970s," said 
Roy Anderson, retired chairman of Lockheed, who lived through the difficult 
aerospace slump of 1968-76. "There seems to be a good understanding in 
Washington of the impact of precipitous cuts, which just launch us on a cycle 
of slump and boom." 
Southern California is less vulnerable to reductions in the size of the armed 
forces than it is to cuts in defense procurement of weapons and armaments. To 
be sure, the region has several major military installations. Largest among 
them are the San Diego and Long Beach naval facilities, the Marine base at Camp 
Pendleton and several Air Force bases. Overall, California has an estimated 
250,000 active-duty military personnel within its borders. 
But the Southland has no major Army bases, and therefore it should not suffer 
greatly as the Administration shrinks the Army. In fact, the diversity of the 
state's defense spending should provide a buffer against cutbacks in any one 
area. 
According to 1989 figures from the Commission on State Finance, federal defense 
spending in California divides up as 23% for research and development, 33% for 
procurement of weapons and armaments, 27% for civilian operations and 
maintenance of military installations, and 17% for military salaries and 
pensions. 
The severity of the downturn in Pentagon purchases of weapons and armaments 
will depend to some degree on what the government does with the money it will 
no longer spend on defense. 
"The money won't disappear into thin air," said Stephen Levy, economist and 
director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. "It 
will be redirected, through tax cuts, deficit reduction or new government 
spending programs." 
Two years ago, the center and the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
conducted a study to determine how the region would be affected by defense 
cutbacks. Levy said the report assumed a one-third reduction in the "real," or 
inflation-adjusted, defense budget from the 1986 level -- a much larger cut 
than most now expect in the early 1990s. 
"The scenario that would keep the most (defense workers) in their jobs in 
Southern California would be if the federal government decides to go hellbent 
for space or technology programs," Levy said. "The switch would be relatively 
painless; the employers would probably be the same." 
Any other scenario would involve a painful transition in which many workers 
might require retraining or might be forced to leave the area, he said. 
If the government decides to cut taxes or reduce the deficit instead of 
investing in new programs, he said, California's economy would also benefit in 
the broad sense from lower interest rates or increased personal income. 
But, he added, the tax-cut scenario would have the least benefit and could 
produce a modest decline in the region's manufacturing job base. Even that, 
however, would not be comparable to what happened in the early 1970s. 
"The big difference is that we have a healthy economy now, unlike 1971-73. The 
Los Angeles region is running below the national unemployment rate," Levy said. 
"We ended the huge B-1 program in the last few years, but I can't even read 
that in the regional economic numbers." 
Adds B of A's Wilson: "If the defense cutbacks are spread over five or six 
years, the cuts by themselves are not sufficient to plunge the California 
economy into a recession. It would take other things to do that, such as an 
overvalued dollar hurting California exports, the closure of some Asian markets 
to our products due to political change or a policy mistake by the Federal 
Reserve to tighten monetary policy (which would hurt California's 
interest-rate-sensitive economy)." 
Wilson acknowledges, however, that "the $64 question" is how difficult the 
dislocation of former defense workers will be on Southern California, and there 
are ominous signs that it will not be easy. 
"The market for out-of-work engineers and technical people is already dismal 
and has been since the slump began two years ago," an executive recruiter in 
Los Angeles said. "This could get very bad." 
The region's manufacturing industries that have expanded greatly since the 
great aerospace slump of the early 1970s -- apparel, furniture, chemicals, 
printing and high tech, among others -- are not a good match for defense 
employees looking for work, he said. In addition, most of those industries do 
not offer nearly the salary or benefits of defense work, and that may make it 
tough for laid-off workers to maintain their current standards of living. 
Otis Booth III, executive director of the Russell Reynolds Associates executive 
recruiting firm's Los Angeles office, said he has noticed that most of the 
defense workers who have been laid off since 1986 are finding work at smaller 
"niche" companies -- often defense subcontractors that have grown larger during 
the buildup in the 1980s and now need experienced managers and technicians. 
Many of these firms still have a substantial defense backlog that will run into 
the 1990s, so these people should be secure for at least several years, Booth 
said. 
"The trend seems to be that as big projects end, people leave the large prime 
contractors and go to the smaller firms that still have lots of work," he said. 
He predicted that even as defense budgets shrink, the Pentagon will seek 
funding to upgrade existing weapons systems with new electronics and other 
capabilities. And that should help the smaller Southern California defense 
firms that make such devices. 
In the end, perhaps the most wrenching transition for the region will be to 
accept the realization that the defense business will no longer be the economic 
linchpin it has been since World War II. 
"Frankly, even without this cutback, I would not have expected much expansion 
by the defense industry in Southern California," said John Cushman, president 
of Cushman Realty Corp. of Los Angeles and an expert in regional real estate 
trends. "The industry is eyeing Texas, Nevada and Arizona for new plants, 
places where the cost of doing business is less, the tax structure is more to 
their liking and the cost of housing and utilities is cheaper." 
In fact, some observers believe that the so-called negative quality-of-life 
issues swirling around Southern California -- pollution, traffic, 
overdevelopment and high housing costs -- may ironically act to cushion the 
personal blow of defense cutbacks. 
Said UCLA's Hensley: "You hear these complaints all the time. I suspect that 
what is keeping a lot of people here who can't afford to buy a house and who 
don't like the smog is the strong job market. They can make a good salary. Take 
that away, and why stay here?" 
So, unlike the situation in the early 1970s, when laid-off aerospace workers 
such as those in "Fun With Dick and Jane" fought to maintain their life styles 
in what seemed a much more desirable Southern California, some may now view the 
loss of a defense job as the excuse to leave. 
"I'm hearing a lot of people talking about Phoenix, Albuquerque, Portland and 
Tucson," Booth said. "The fact is that salary levels in Southern California 
manufacturing don't seem high enough any more to maintain that nice life style 
everybody talked about."
