<F P=106> [Report by Shihab Ahmad Mahmud titled: "Why Do Some Military </F>
Policemen Refuse To Recognize End of Service Document?"] 
  [Excerpt] Military policemen's known duty is to punish 
wrongdoers, apprehend deserters from military service and so 
forth. Nobody differs on that. But there have been complaints 
against these policemen which must be mentioned. We have 
received many complaints about their behavior and maltreatment 
of certain innocent individuals. Despite the fact these 
individuals carried documents proving their correct status, the 
military policemen treated them as wrongdoers or deserters. The 
complaints include one sent by citizen (J-'A), from Madinat 
al-Hurriyah who was apprehended by a military police detachment 
and remanded for five days despite the fact that he carried an 
end of service document which was issued by the Ministry of 
Defense. Still, they did not recognize it! [passage omitted]
