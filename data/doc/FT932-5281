FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Invesco MIM
The scale of non-compliance uncovered at Invesco MIM is staggering. While
those responsible deserve opprobrium, the more serious question is how one
of the UK's largest investment managers was allowed to get into such a
state. Since some of the 55 charges go back to 1988, the regulators and the
company's auditor had time to spot trouble before Mr Maxwell's raid on the
Mirror Group pension fund brought matters to a head. Having fined Invesco
for mismanaging personal equity plans in 1989, Imro should have clamped down
on lax standards elsewhere in the group.
The improvements to Imro's procedures recommended by the Securities and
Investments Board - and the tough new style for SIB advocated by Mr Andrew
Large, its chairman - might close the more gaping holes in the regulatory
net. But it is hard to imagine that the fine imposed on Invesco will act as
much of a deterrent. While there is little sense in heaping fines on a
company now diligently putting its house in order, SIB should consider
wheeling out its as-yet-unused powers against individuals in such cases.
That might help generate the commitment to compliance that has evidently
been lacking.
After almost three years living hand in glove with the regulator, Invesco at
least should demonstrate an exemplary record from here on. It is hard to
argue that the regulatory system has come through in good shape.
