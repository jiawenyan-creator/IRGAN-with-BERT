BIG NUMBERS PAY OFF FOR PRINGLE, CS FULLERTON 
Mike Pringle had the winning numbers Saturday, including the one on the back of 
his jersey. 
Pringle's 213 all-purpose yards in Cal State Fullerton's 34-20 victory over 
Nevada Las Vegas moved him back to first in the nation in that category, 
although his per-game average dropped five yards to 234.8. 
But his numbers really came up later -- in the California Lottery. 
Pringle said that he bought two Lotto 6/49 tickets after the game and picked 
his two regular sets of numbers, just as he does every Wednesday and Saturday. 
Five of six came up on one ticket and Pringle won $3,616. Three came up on the 
other ticket and he won five more dollars. 
Pringle's numbers: 
2 -- The jersey number of Washington State receiver Tim Stallworth, a friend of 
Pringle's. 
15 -- Chosen in memory of his best friend's brother, Tracy Anderson, who died 
last year. Anderson wore number 51 as a Cal State Northridge football player. 
27 -- This one is simple. "Me," Pringle said. 
28 -- The number worn by Chris Richards, a friend of Pringle's who played at 
Cal from 1986-88. 31 -- The number of Washington State running back Steve 
Broussard, another friend. 
34 -- Pringle's number at Kennedy High in Granada Hills and for two seasons at 
Washington State before he transferred. This was the only number, excluding the 
bonus, that did not come up. The number that did was 35. 
One of Pringle's other good numbers: 118. That is his rushing average, the best 
in the Big West Conference and 10th best in the nation among Division I 
players.
