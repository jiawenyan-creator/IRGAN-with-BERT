FT  14 MAY 92 / US backing for rights of Palestinians angers Israel
ISRAEL yesterday reacted sharply to a statement by the US that Washington
supported a 1948 UN resolution recognising the right of Palestinian refugees
to return to their original homes, a proposition that all mainstream Israeli
parties reject as a threat to the existence of the Jewish state.
stressed at a news briefing:
Ms Margaret Tutwiler, state department spokeswoman, following a call by
Jerusalem to clarify her statement, said yesterday that the issues raised in
the resolution 'can only be resolved through a process of direct
negotiations among the parties themselves.'
The exchange came as talks were due to get under way in Ottawa yesterday on
the plight of Palestinian refugees convened as part of the multilateral
phase of the Middle East peace process.
Israel refused to attend the talks because representatives of the
Palestinian exiles were invited as well as residents of the occupied
territories. They declared their intention of having the issue of their
right to return put on the agenda.
Washington advised the Palestinians not to raise the issue but was clearly
irritated by the Israeli stance. Ms Tutwiler said late on Tuesday that the
US continued to support Resolution 194, which recognises the right to return
home, or to compensation for losses, for Palestinians who fled or were
forced from their homes in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed
establishment of the state of Israel.
Ms Tutwiler said Washington did not want to 'interpret' the resolution -
apparently signalling that the US did not envisage in practice a flow of
refugees back to parts of what is now Israel. Refugees from the 1948 and
subsequent wars number about 2.5m. But her statement deepened a rift between
the Bush administration and the Israeli government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir.
