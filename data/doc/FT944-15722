FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: DTI will ignore RJB chief's 'bonus'
The Department of Trade and Industry is not expected to pursue reports of
controversial payments made to Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB
Mining, which last week became the government's preferred bidder for British
Coal's English mining assets.
Mr Budge was cited in a report by receivers to AF Budge, the family business
which collapsed in 1992, for receiving payments without evidence of proper
boardroom approval.
Mr Budge, who says the payments were a performance bonus, has since repaid
Pounds 325,000 to the receiver without admitting liability.
Meanwhile, it emerged that one of the bids for British Coal's assets
included a clause to give members of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers up
to 20 per cent of the company.
A consortium of the UDM and Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the
former British Coal commercial director, is believed to have offered Pounds
510m for two of the central England regions.
This figure included a Pounds 35m payment to the government for the issue of
a 15 per cent stake to the mineworkers. A further 5 per cent would be set
aside for mineworkers to buy through an employee share ownership plan.
The consortium is believed to have provided a further substantial amount to
extend indefinitely the generous redundancy terms which the government has
said must be provided until March 1998.
