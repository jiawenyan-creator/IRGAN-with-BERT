FT  29 JUL 94 / Judge attacks arms trial 'abuse'
Customs and Excise and the Foreign Office 'interfered with the course of
justice' by stopping potential defence witnesses giving evidence in an
arms-for-Iraq case, the Court of Appeal said yesterday.
Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, said: 'The machinations in this case to
prevent witnesses for the defence being available, coupled with the
non-disclosure of what had been done, constituted such an interference with
the justice process as to amount to an abuse of it.'
He was giving the court's reasons for its decision earlier this month to
clear Atlantic Commercial, a defence consultancy, of being concerned in
exporting, and attempting to export, arms with intent to evade export
prohibitions.
Atlantic Commercial, based in Cuckney, Mansfield, Notts, was fined Pounds
7,500 at the Old Bailey in November 1985. Mr Alexander Schlesinger, a
director, and Mr Reginald Dunk, a consultant were fined Pounds 3,000 and
Pounds 12,500 respectively.
The appeal court ordered Customs to pay their costs.
The case concerned consignments of Sterling Mark 5 sub-machine guns
intercepted by Customs and Excise. The defendants had planned to contest the
case and call witnesses from the Iraqi and Jordanian embassies in London to
confirm the legality of the contracts. But they opted to plead guilty when
the witnesses failed to attend court.
