  [Excerpts] For the first time since the Israel-PLO 
agreements were signed, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
yesterday began to reduce the number of troops stationed in the 
Gaza Strip. 
  An IDF post overlooking the Jabalyah refugee camp was closed 
yesterday and was replaced with a small lookout. 
  Military sources said the outpost, called "Outpost Oranim," 
was evacuated in the wake of the IDF's change in deployment in 
the Gaza Strip, but they did not rule out the possibility that 
the reduction in forces came in the wake of the agreements with 
the Palestinians. [passage omitted] 
  The bullet-ridden body of 'Ata Abu-Ahmad, 30, who worked in 
Gaza's local hospital, was found. 'Ata was abducted four days 
ago from his place of work on suspicion of aiding Israel. He 
was murdered and following the murder the hospital workers went 
on strike.
