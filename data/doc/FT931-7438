FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Further sharp fall at Mannesmann
MANNESMANN, the German engineering conglomerate, suffered a further sharp
fall in profits last year, in spite of a 15 per cent increase in sales to
DM28bn (Dollars 17bn).
The company, which is expected to produce full figures in May, yesterday
blamed the decline on recession, launch costs for its mobile telephone
network, and heavy extraordinary costs for restructuring.
Net profits in 1991 were DM625m, down from DM1bn a year earlier.
The steel tubes, trading and vehicle components divisions all incurred
losses, while the engineering and plant businesses produced 'clearly
positive returns'. The Brazilian subsidiary returned to profit after two
years of deficit, and earnings from electrical and electronic engineering
were unchanged.
Overall order intake rose 9 per cent to DM27.7bn thanks to the consolidation
of newly-acquired businesses. On a like-for-like basis, new contracts fell 7
per cent.
Half of the DM6.4bn in new orders won by the vehicle components business
stemmed from the new VDO and Boge subsidiaries. While business was
relatively brisk in the first half of the year, these businesses were hit in
the second half by the sharp downturn in the German automobile industry.
Tubes, in which Mannesmann has recently announced a series of international
co-operation agreements, saw new business slump by 21 per cent to DM4bn.
The group's new D2 mobile telephone business has already signed up 100,000
subscribers and made sales of DM121m.
