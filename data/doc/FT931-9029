FT  16 FEB 93 / Moscow warning on debt talks
RUSSIA'S deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, warned last night that
there was 'a real threat' of debt negotiations with foreign creditors being
broken off. He was speaking after Russia and Ukraine failed again to agree
how to divide the debt between them.
The former Soviet debt over which the two are haggling is around Dollars
80bn (Pounds 56.3m).
The two republics appeared close to an accord only last month, when Ukraine
said it had secured a deal under which it would pay independently for a
share of the debt in exchange for a share of former Soviet assets.
However, western creditors strongly oppose such a solution because of
concern that Ukraine might be unable to meet its obligations.
Mr Shokhin said at the time that any agreement would have to be acceptable
to the ex-Soviet Union's creditors.
Russia's biggest savings bank, Sberbank, said yesterday it was astonished by
a central bank attempt to take it over, and that such a move, if approved by
parliament, would provoke a return to a centralised Communist-era banking
system, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Mr Pavel Zhikharev, Sberbank's chairman, speaking in Izvestia newspaper,
rejected the central bank's accusations that it had used its independence to
seek 'super-profits' and take excessive risks.
