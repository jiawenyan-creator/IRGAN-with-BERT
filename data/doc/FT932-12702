FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: 78% drop reduces Lyles to Pounds 102,000
DIFFICULT trading conditions continued throughout the first half at S Lyles;
turnover fell 19 per cent and pre-tax profit slumped 78 per cent.
However, the interim dividend for the six months to December 31 1992 is held
at 1.55p, payable from earnings per share of 1.02p (4.47p).
Home sales of this yarn spinner and dyer dropped to Pounds 3.97m (Pounds
4.51m) while exports were Pounds 1m off at Pounds 2.74m. The profit was
Pounds 102,000 (Pounds 486,000).
Mr John Lyles, chairman, said the significant fall in demand necessitated
the workforce being reduced by a further 10 per cent.
'However, if present indications of emerging confidence in the UK and US
economies are sustained, I would expect some improvement in demand later
this calendar year, although the economies of some of our European trading
partners remain a matter of concern', he said.
The decision on the final dividend would depend on the outturn for 1992-93
and prospects for the following year.
