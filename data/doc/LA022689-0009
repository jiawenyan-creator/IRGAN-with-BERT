August Sarnitz's "R. M. Schindler" (Rizzoli: $35; 224 pp.; 0-8478-0921-8) 
documents the career of one of the most influential and innovative architects 
who ever practiced in Los Angeles. Born in Austria in 1887, schooled at the 
legendary Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, and apprenticed under Frank Lloyd 
Wright, Rudolf Michael Schindler opened an office in Los Angeles in 1921 to 
champion the simple, functional and well-detailed designs of the so-called 
International Style. While dutifully tracing Schindler's work and philosophy, 
Sarnitz, in this dry, awkwardly designed, academic monograph, unfortunately 
fails to convey the pioneering spirit of the architect and how he adapted his 
rationally conceived designs to the varied landscape and life styles of 
Southern California. Nevertheless, the book is valuable, if only for the 
cataloging of Schindler's wealth of projects here with plans, drawings and 
photographs (many -- like the one above, of the Falk apartments -- by Julius 
Shulman) and extracts from Schindler's extensive correspondence. Sam Hall
