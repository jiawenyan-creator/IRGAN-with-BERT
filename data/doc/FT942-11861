FT  04 MAY 94 / Anger at fee for Woolmark
The International Wool Secretariat, which licenses the world's most
recognised textile trademark, the Woolmark, is about to reap the rewards of
30 years of promotional work through the introduction of a Pounds 7,000
annual fee for the symbol's use.
The IWS has announced that from May 1 next year it will charge spinners,
weavers and manufacturers for the use of the Woolmark and Woolblendmark and
which assure the presence of a minimum of 60 per cent of new wool.
Britain's wool industry has reacted angrily. The Confederation of British
Wool Textiles has been particularly critical of the flat rate fee, which it
believes will penalise small producers. But the IWS argues that a sliding
scale of charges would incur excessive administrative costs.
The confederation and the IWS do agree, however, on the logic of
commercialising the symbol to raise funds to promote the use of wool.
A recent Harris poll found that 40 per cent of consumers in the UK, US,
Japan, Germany and France would pay more for a pure new wool garment
carrying the woolmark than for one without it.
Textile labelling looks set to become a lucrative business. The British
Textile Technology Group recently announced it would offer a label
certifying that textile products were free of harmful substances.
