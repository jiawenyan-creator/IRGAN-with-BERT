FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Matra in part-sale of US space
subsidiary
Matra, the military arm of France's Lagardere group, has agreed the partial
sale of its US subsidiary, Fairchild Space and Defense Corporation, to
Orbital Sciences Corp of the US in a Dollars 105m deal.
Matra is to be paid in cash and shares, giving it a stake of more than 15
per cent in Orbital. The French company will still own Fairchild's
buildings, worth Dollars 39m, which it will lease to Orbital.
Matra bought Fairchild in 1989. It said yesterday the deal was prompted by
the 'almost unavoidable necessity' of mergers because of the cuts in US
military and space spending.
Orbital is a fast-growing space company, with turnover of Dollars 190m last
year. Its technology includes Orbcomm mini-telecom satellites, the Pegasus
system of launching the mini-satellites from aircraft, and techniques in
map-making from pictures taken from space.
Fairchild has a large amount of government business, including work on the
US Air Force's F-22 advanced tactical fighter.
Matra said its interest in the deal was primarily product-related. It wanted
to associate its own French-based space business and that of Fairchild with
Orbital.
Orbital Sciences, based in Fairfax, Virginia, earned Dollars 4.6m last year,
up from earnings of Dollars 3.8m on revenues of Dollars 174.6m in 1993.
The company has successfully launched 16 space missions, including the
Pegasus rocket and suborbital launch vehicles.
Mr David Thompson, chief executive of Orbital, said earlier this year the
company had been exploring ways to apply its space launch and satellite
systems technologies to higher-growth commercial markets.
