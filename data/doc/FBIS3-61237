<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  Prices for consumer goods and services rose by 2.5 percent 
from 14 through 21 December of this year, including those for 
foodstuffs, by 2.3 percent; nonfood items, by 2.4 percent; and 
paid services for the population, by 3.8 percent. 
  The dynamics of weekly price increases over the past four 
weeks were as follows: 


                    11/30          12/07          12/14          12/21

  Over the elapsed week, there have been no significant 
differences in the rate of price increase by individual economic 
regions, with the exception of Kaliningrad Oblast, where prices 
rose by 5.4 percent. 
  Since the beginning of December, prices for consumer goods 
and services increased overall by 7.9 percent, including those 
for foodstuffs and nonfood items--by 7.6 percent and for paid 
services for the population--by 12.2 percent.

  The greatest rise in foodstuffs prices (by 8.1 percent) was 
registered in Kaliningrad Oblast, and the lowest (1.5 
percent)--in the Northwestern economic region. 
  Overall in organized trade in the Russian Federation, the 
most perceptible rise in prices was registered with respect to 
frozen fish, sour cream, some varieties of cereals, and eggs (by 
5 to 7.5 percent). The trend of negligible increases (by 1-2 
percent a week) in prices for meat products and vodka continued. 
  The cost of a consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs as of 
21 
December amounted to 29,900 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly 
basis. As compared with the preceding week it rose by 2 percent, 
and compared with the end of last year--sevenfold. The cost of 
the selection differed by individual regions by a factor of 
five: the highest cost of the consumer basket was registered in 
Magadan (R78,100), and the lowest in Ulyanovsk (R15,400). In 
Moscow and St. Petersburg it amounted to R34,300 and R29,000, 
respectively. 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  Prices for these items rose over the week by 2.4 percent. 
Prices for sewn items and knitwear increased at a somewhat 
greater rate--by 3.5 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. 
Prices for footwear, cultural, personal, and household items, as 
well as fuel sold to the population, have been rising by 1.1-2.0 
percent weekly. 
<H5>  Services </H5>
  Fees for paid services to the population rose by 3.8 percent 
over the third week of December. The cost of attending child 
care preschool facilities increased over the week by 10.5 
percent, including 1.6-1.9-fold in Moscow, Makhachkala, Izhevsk, 
Novokuznetsk, and Kaliningrad. Fees for health care and notary 
public services increased over the week by 6-11 percent. 
<H5>  Inventories of Goods at Trade Enterprises </H5>
  Changes in the inventories of basic consumer goods at 
officially registered enterprises in trade and industry are 
characterized by the following data: 


                         1 December 1993 as % of 1 December 1992

  Inventory turnover at registered retail trade enterprises 
measured in June-November of this year at a 5.1 turnover value; 
at state-owned enterprises this value measured 4.7; in consumer 
cooperatives, 3.2; and at privately owned enterprises, 6.7. 
<H3>  Production of Most Important Categories of Industrial 
Products </H3>
  Over the elapsed period of December 1993 (19 days) 
production 
of most varieties of products counted in the periodic reports 
has declined, which may be seen from the following table:

  In the fuels and power generation sectors, over 19 
days of December of this year production and extraction of main 
varieties of energy resources is characterized by the following 
data:

coking 


  Half of the 32 associations of the Rosneft state enterprise 
have cut back on oil production as compared to the corresponding 
period of November of this year, including significant cutbacks 
at the Tatneft (by 8 percent), Komineft (by 5 percent), and 
Nizhnevartovskneftegaz (by 3 percent) associations. Oil 
production increased at the Yuganskneftegaz and Megionneftegaz 
associations. 
  Over the two ten-day periods in December, production of 
automotive gasoline increased by 5 percent as compared to the 
same period of the preceding month, and of boiler oil--by 7 
percent. The level of diesel fuel production remained 
practically unchanged. Because of arrears in payments, there has 
been a cutback in oil deliveries to the Ryazan refinery plant; 
as a result, at this oil-refining enterprise that used to 
operate in a stable mode, the volume of primary oil refining 
dropped off by 17 percent, production of boiler oil decreased by 
22 percent, and that of diesel fuel, by 14 percent. 
  Nine out of the 12 associations in the RAO [all-Russia 
joint-stock society] Gazprom have increased their production of 
gas; nevertheless, it is still 8 percent below last year's 
level, including in Urengoygazprom--by 7 percent, 
Orenburggazprom--by 3 percent, and Nadymgazprom--by 2 percent. 
  Over the elapsed period of December of this year, 
practically 
all enterprises in the coal industry have increased production, 
with the exception of the associations Yakutugol (where 
production fell off by 14 percent), and Vorkutaugol (where it 
fell by 11 percent), and the Severokuzbassugol concern--by 13 
percent. 
  In ferrous metallurgy, the output of pig iron, steel, and 
rolled metal over 19 days of December declined by 2-4 percent as 
compared to the corresponding period of this year's November and 
by one-quarter as compared with last year. 
  Production in the metallurgical process is seriously 
affected 
by the shortage of scrap metal, the deliveries of which to the 
sector's enterprises amounted to only one-half of normal 
requirements. The situation with respect to the supply of coking 
coal has improved somewhat. In December their reserves at 
metallurgical enterprises amounted to 67 percent of the norm, 
while in November the figure was only 56 percent. As a result, 
the burning out of coke over the elapsed period of December 
increased as compared to the corresponding period of November by 
3 percent. 
  The output of steel pipe has declined as compared to the 
corresponding period of November by 9 percent, and that of last 
year--by 54 percent. 
  Over the elapsed days of December of this year, the average 
daily production of the corresponding period of last year has 
been exceeded with respect to one out of three monitored 
machine-building products. The greatest increase 
occurred in the output of large electric machinery (1.3-fold), 
pneumatic-chassis cranes and self-propelled graders (by a factor 
of 2-2.3). With respect to these products, however, there 
remains a considerable lag as compared to the level of the 
corresponding period of last year. 
  Production of special, specialized, and modular 
metal-cutting 
machine tools remains at last year's level. 
  The output of large electric machinery, low-capacity 
electric 
motors, and trucks amounted to almost one-half of that for the 
same period of last year; of traveling cranes, bulldozers, and 
main line freight cars--one-third; and of drop forges, 
automotive trailers and semitrailers, and tractors--less than 
10-25 percent. 
  Over three weeks of December, the output of all varieties of 
chemical and petrochemical industry products counted 
in weekly reports lagged behind the level of the corresponding 
period of December of last year; with respect to some of them, 
the rate of production decline increased in the third week of 
the month: 


                             In real volume   Average daily production as % 
                             since the        of the corresponding period

  There has been a 40-65-percent decline as compared to the 
December level of last year in the average daily output of 
polyvynilchloride resins, pipe and pipeline components made of 
thermoplastics, polyvynilchloride-based plastics, chemical 
filament and fiber, microbiological fodder protein, and 
automotive tires for agricultural vehicles. 
  At the same time, the average daily output of certain 
varieties of products has increased as compared to the 
corresponding period of November of this year, including 
phosphate fertilizer--by 18 percent, and polyvynilchloride resin 
and polypropylene--by 2 percent. 
  In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industry, the daily production of most varieties of timber 
products over the elapsed 19 days of December exceeded the 
volume of the corresponding period of this year's November, with 
the exception of wood-chip board, paper, and cardboard. At the 
same time, as compared to the corresponding period of December 
1992, the output of all categories of the industry's products 
has declined: 


                             In real volume    Average daily production as % 
                             since the         of the corresponding period of

Paper--thousands of tonnes   134               79              96 



  The daily production of commercial timber fell off by more 
than one-third as compared to the December level of last year, 
which has led to a reduction in the output of sawn lumber--by 37 
percent, matches and mine props--by half, and cardboard--by 
one-quarter. 
  The situation in the construction materials 
industry was as follows: 


                             In real volume    Average daily production as % 
                             since the         of the corresponding period of

  As a result of a 19-percent decline in the daily production 
of pliable roofing materials over the period from 13 through 19 
December as compared to the first 12 days, their output over the 
entire elapsed period of the month amounted to only 75 percent 
of the December level of last year (79 percent over 12 days of 
December). 
  The output of cement dropped down to 105,000 tonnes a day as 
compared to 111,000 over the first two weeks of the month and 
was the lowest since the beginning of the year. 
  In light industry over the elapsed period of 
December as compared with the analogous period of the preceding 
month, there has been an increase in the average daily 
production of cotton and linen fabrics and sackcloth. At the 
same time, production of woolen and silk fabrics, hosiery, and 
footwear declined by 13-18 percent, and of knitwear--by 5 
percent. The December 1992 level has been exceeded only in 
production of cotton fabrics, while the output of woolen fabrics 
and footwear fell off by half; silk fabrics decreased by 42 
percent; linen fabrics, sack cloth, and knitwear, by almost 
one-third; and hosiery, by 24 percent. There has been a 
considerable decline in the output of footwear for children--by 
58 percent. 
  In the production of radio electronics and complex home 
appliances, as compared with the corresponding period of 
November, there was an increase in the production of electric 
vacuum cleaners, tape recorders, sewing machines, bicycles, and 
other varieties of goods. At the same time, there was a decline 
in the average daily production of refrigerators and freezers, 
television sets, and washing machines (by 2-12 percent), 
knitting machines, radio receivers, and photo cameras (by 11-25 
percent), electric irons (by one-third), and motorcycles (by 
almost one-half). As compared with the analogous period of last 
year, production declined with respect to all categories of 
goods (with the exception of galvanic cells and batteries and 
regular light bulbs): the output of photo cameras and electric 
irons fell off by two-thirds; electric vacuum cleaners, washing 
machines, radio receivers, and video tape recorders, by half; 
and tape recorders and knitting machines, by 40 percent. 
  Due to material and financial difficulties, since the 
beginning of the year there has been no production of washing 
machines at the Nizhniy Novgorod automotive plant, PO 
[industrial association] GPZ-4 (Samara); of radio receivers--at 
PO Radiopribor in Velikiye Luki (Pskov Oblast), radio electronic 
plant Sokol (Moscow), and the Kamensk-Uralsk radio electronics 
plant (Sverdlovsk Oblast). 
  Over 19 days of this December, production of a majority of 
21 
varieties of foodstuffs counted in weekly reports 
(with the exception vegetable oil and canned milk products) has 
declined as compared to both the corresponding period of last 
year and that of the preceding month. Among them are meat, 
butter, cheeses, whole milk products, macaroni items, and others. 
  There has been a considerable decline as compared with the 
corresponding period of last year in the production of canned 
fruit and vegetables, macaroni items, tea, and mineral water (by 
33-41 percent), as well as whole-milk products, margarine, meat, 
butter, and canned meat (by 13-28 percent). Production of food 
concentrates fell off by more than half. 
  Among the daily necessities, over the elapsed days of this 
December as compared to the analogous period of last year the 
output of household soap and creams declined by half; of facial 
soap and creams [as published]--by 42 percent; and synthetic 
detergents--by one-third.
