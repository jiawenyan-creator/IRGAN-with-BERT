LOCAL; 
SUICIDE RULED IN GUN INCIDENT 
Los Angeles police officers who stormed into a Granada Hills apartment where a 
man was believed to be firing a weapon found the 61-year-old resident dead of 
an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said today. 
A special weapons and tactics team entered the apartment in the 16800 block of 
Chatsworth Street about 11:15 p.m. Thursday, about three hours after neighbors 
reported hearing up to six shots from the unit, Detective Michael Brandt said. 
Brandt said the officers found Jerry Jordan, who lived in the apartment alone, 
dead of a gunshot wound. The death has been ruled a suicide but investigators 
have not determined why Jordan killed himself, Brandt said. 
During the incident, the neighborhood was cordoned off and apartments near 
Jordan's were evacuated, police said.
