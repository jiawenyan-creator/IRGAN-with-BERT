  [Excerpts] The UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva has 
condenmed UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola]. A resolution was approved which blames UNITA totally 
for the situation in Angola. [passage omitted] The Angolan 
Government has welcomed this resolution. The Angolan 
representative, Ambassador Eduardo Parreira, has expressed his 
satisfaction and said that perhaps it is time to stir the 
conscience of the less aware. 
  [Begin Parreira recording] I believe that this resolution 
will be like a reference point which, like a beacon, illuminates 
the spirit of those who still have not understood that the war 
is indeed a tradegy, one of the...[pauses] The worst of human 
rights violations and that it is taking us nowhere. The doors 
are open for dialogue -- they have always been -- and in the 
Bicesse accords and in subsequent meetings we have always had 
and have fought for a spirit of concord and dialogue. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]
