FT  22 AUG 92 / Japan money supply growth at record low
JAPAN'S broad money supply (M2 plus certificates of deposit) grew at a
record low pace of 0.2 per cent in July compared with 0.9 per cent in June.
A Bank of Japan official attributed part of the slowdown to slower
commercial bank lending.
The central bank has until recently promoted broad money supply as the most
important indicator to follow when setting monetary policy. But it is
joining a growing list of central banks around the world that have been
flustered at the behaviour of monetary aggregates, and the Bank of Japan
says the measure is becoming less useful as a measure of economic activity.
The central bank said the fluctuations in broad money were not easily
explained by economic activity or changes in interest rates, also reflecting
fluctuations in asset prices, changing bank behaviour under interest rate
liberalisation, and the shift of funds between bank deposits and other
savings instruments.
Another indicator, broad liquidity - which includes deposits in the postal
savings system - grew by 3.5 per cent, also a record low compared with 3.9
per cent in June. The officials said broad liquidity has maintained a high
degree of credibility, but it was difficult to explain why. It said the
shift of funds out of the banking system did not indicate any credit crunch,
and that corporate activities have not generally been restricted by lack of
access to funding.
The bank nonetheless said it would pay close attention to the lending
attitudes of banks as well as to monetary aggregates because banks were
adopting a more prudent lending stance in the wake of rising non-performing
assets, the share price fall, and the pressure of meeting Bank of
International Settlement capital adequacy ratios.
The bank said for the time being it would follow a number of monetary
indicators and try to repond quickly to changes in the economic environment.
