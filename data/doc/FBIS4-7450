    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 31 March carries more 
reports about the combat situation: 
  "The situation around Gorazde is getting worse," 
correspondent from Gorazde Enes Musovic reports "as the chetniks 
are intensifying their attacks by the hour. One grenade lands 
here every second." Musovic then goes on to say that "last night 
a group of 1,000 soldiers of the regular Yugoslav Army, armed to 
the teeth and escorted by armored personnel carriers, crossed 
the Bosnia- Herzegovina border and arrived in Visegrad. In this 
way the self-styled Yugoslavia is making its full contribution 
to the aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  The 3d Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports that 
"the 
3d Corps units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army yesterday 
conquered several important elevations and settlements on the 
Teslic-Seher battlefield, starting from Veliki Kraguljac and 
Mali Kraguljac, and the village of Karanovica." The Corps also 
reports that "the chetnik artillery from (?Srpske Stijene) 
sporadically shelled Secevo, Djaki, and Turbe, while the town of 
Bugojno was attacked from the direction of Kupres." 
  "The defense lines have moved to the advantage of the free 
Bosnia-Herzegovina territory on the Brcko battlefield," Hamiz 
Deronjic reports from Brcko. As he says "yesterday afternoon, 
the chetniks launched a fierce tank-infantry attack that was 
supported by self-propelled antiaircraft artillery [PRAGA] and 
Bofors guns. The soldiers of the Legendary 108th Brigade halted 
the enemy and, after the accurate hits of our artillery 
destroyed a chetnik PRAGA with its entire crew, they moved into 
a decisive counterattack. They killed some 10 chetniks and 
injured many more. In a powerful counterattack, the soldiers of 
the 108th Motorized Brigade moved the line of defense by half a 
kilometer in the direction of the aggressor's strongholds of 
Pekici and Sekulici."
