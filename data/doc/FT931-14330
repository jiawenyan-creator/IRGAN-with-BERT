FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Inchcape lifts stake in Revasa
INCHCAPE, the motor and businesses services group, has increased its stake
in Revasa, the Italian insurance broker, through Bain Clarkson, its wholly
owned insurance broking subsidiary.
Bain Clarkson will pay a maximum of Pounds 1.7m, subject to performance, to
lift its stake in Revasa from 10 per cent to 49 per cent.
Bain Clarkson bought its initial 10 per cent shareholding in January last
year.
The Milan-based broker, currently ranked 10th in Italy in revenue terms, is
involved mainly in the property, casualty and construction sectors.
Mr Simon Arnold, chairman of Bain Clarkson, said: 'Italy is an important
market for us. This increased shareholding in Revasa will give us a stronger
position in the country, moving us forward in our strategy to gain
prominence in the major European markets through shareholding arrangements
such as this.'
Bain Clarkson also has operations in Greece, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland
and France, where it recently acquired a 25 per cent stake in CECAR, the
country's third largest broker.
Contrary to a weekend press report, Bain Clarkson's results are understood
to be holding up well, in spite of difficulties in the reinsurance market.
