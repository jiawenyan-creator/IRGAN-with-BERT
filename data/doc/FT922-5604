FT  29 MAY 92 / Civil servants may strike on tendering
CIVIL SERVANTS may go on strike over plans to extend competitive tendering
arrangements under which private-sector companies bid for work previously
carried out by civil servants.
The CPSA and NUCPS, the largest Civil Service unions, are planning a ballot
on a one-day strike by members at the Scottish Office after the leaking of a
management consultants' report on the potential for tendering.
The report followed a white paper last November which called on departments
to publish annual targets for areas of activity, including professional and
specialist services and executive and clerical operations, to be
market-tested.
Unions fear competitions will be biased against internal tenders and will
lead to job losses and pay cuts similar to those suffered by blue-collar
workers in local government.
The ballots will provide the first test of the strength of Civil Service
opposition to the tendering proposals.
Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, said yesterday he expected
support for a strike to be solid. 'The initial call came from grass-root
members. It is an honest reaction to a serious fear for their jobs. They do
not believe there is going to be a fair assessment - dogma will decide who
wins tenders rather than consideration of who can provide the better
services.'
The Scottish Office report, compiled by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte,
identified work done by 3,000 staff that could be put to tender in the next
two years. Although experience showed that most tenders would be won
internally, cost savings would result.
Jobs that could be contracted out included those in administering student
grants, the roads network and project management.
Mr Malcolm Lauder, CPSA branch secretary, said management had refused to
discuss the report or give the unions copies of it.
The Scottish Office said no decisions had been made by ministers. There was
nothing to consult the unions about.
