FT  14 JAN 92 / Hungary intensifies privatisation efforts
HUNGARY'S privatisation authorities have launched a battery of initiatives
in an effort to build on last year's record level of sell-offs.
The drive is given urgency by Hungary's recession, which continues despite
the highest level of foreign investment in eastern Europe.
The State Property Agency (SPA), the privatisation authority, yesterday
announced proposals for improved conditions for investors. It plans to
plough back privatisation proceeds into three funds designed to remove much
of the political and business risk involved in takeovers.
The funds would allow 'quicker and safer investments,' said Mr Lajos Csepi,
managing director of the SPA. One would help restructure state enterprises;
another would temper the unemployment resulting from privatisation; and the
third would provide guarantees against hidden liabilities such as
environmental damage.
The SPA also signalled further efforts to remove the bureaucratic red tape
which often entangles sales of state companies.
Half of state enterprises, including all those valued at under Ft1bn (Pounds
7m), are to be freed from the agency's direct supervision.
In addition, the SPA appears unlikely to impede plans by some consultants to
deal directly with creditors of bankrupt public sector companies.
Completed privatisations attracted Dollars 770m (Pounds 429m) in foreign
investment last year, roughly equal to that put into 'green field' ventures.
