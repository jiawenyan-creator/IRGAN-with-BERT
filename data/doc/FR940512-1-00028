et seq.

analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.
