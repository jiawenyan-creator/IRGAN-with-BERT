FT  01 SEP 93 / HSBC doubles to Pounds 1.2bn: Changes fuelled by the Midland
buy
STRONG trading income in Europe and banking growth in the Asia Pacific
region helped HSBC Holdings, the international banking group, to disclose a
126 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 521m to Pounds 1.17bn
in the first half of the year.
HSBC also provided pro forma figures including its UK subsidiary Midland for
the comparative period, which showed a 116 per cent rise in pre-tax profits.
Midland was consolidated into HSBC's results in the second half of last year
after a merger agreed a year ago.
Since December, HSBC increased assets by Pounds 13bn to Pounds 183bn. The
strongest asset growth came in mortgage lending in the UK and Hong Kong, and
in treasury dealing assets such as gilts and other government bonds held by
Midland.
The group achieved a return on shareholders' funds of 19.8 per cent and a 58
per cent rise in earnings per share to 33.12p, against 20.97p or a pro forma
13.24p. It increased its interim dividend to 7p from 4.8p.
Sir William Purves, chairman, said the merger with Midland was proceeding
'satisfactorily'. The outlook for Hong Kong remained good.
The most serious slip in the group's worldwide operations occurred in its
Marine Midland US retail bank, which wrote down its mortgage servicing
rights by Dollars 182m (Pounds 123m) as fixed-rate mortgages were repaid
amid falling interest rates.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 19 per cent on a pro forma
basis to Pounds 447m. Asia Pacific provisions fell to Pounds 50m, against
Pounds 173m, while US provisions were neglible as a result of a provisions
release at Marine Midland.
The group's pro forma non-interest income rose by 29 per cent to Pounds
1.64bn. This included dealing profits of Pounds 522m, against Pounds 204m,
as securities and foreign exchange dealing were helped by exceptional
trading.
Operating expenses grew by 18 per cent pro forma to Pounds 2.2bn, half of
the rise was accounted for by exchange-rate movements and half by costs at
Midland and Hongkong Bank.
But the cost-to-income ratio fell to 59 per cent from 64.2 per cent pro
forma.
The group's total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio strengthened to 12.9
per cent against 12.6 per cent pro forma.
But its tier 1 ratio of core capital to assets fell to 7.5 per cent from 9.4
per cent pro forma after re-classification.
