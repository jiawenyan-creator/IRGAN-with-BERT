A LATE TEE TIME 
When I moved to Yorba Linda, way back in 1965, no woman sat on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. No woman had ever been nominated for the vice presidency on a major 
party ticket. There were no women astronauts. And women journalists were not 
admitted to the National Press Club in Washington. 
Today, all that, and much more, has changed -- except, it seems, in Yorba Linda 
("Woman Golfer Tees Off at Club's Policies," Orange County section, Feb. 17). 
There, women apparently do not merit equal treatment with their male 
counterparts at the golf course, whether they go there to network with business 
associates, enjoy the great outdoors or just pursue a little white ball across 
the fairways. 
Come on, fellows! We are only about 11 years away from the 21st Century!
