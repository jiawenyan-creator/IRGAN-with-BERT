FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Contract for electricity supply
Sir, Prof Newbery is correct to call for increased competition in
electricity generation (Personal View, January 10) but the analysis of the
industry presented is incorrect in one important respect. It is argued that
'future contract prices are likely to approximate the expected pool price'.
This may be the case in competitive markets or where arbitrage is a
possibility but not in the electricity industry where two generators have
significant market power and where contracts tend to be specific and not
widely traded. The generators may wish to limit the supply of such contracts
(or make them expensive) and attempt to restrict the liquidity of the
contract market. Indeed, it could be argued that the premium of the contract
price over the spot (pool) price is precisely a measure of the lack of
competition.
At present this is bad news to many electricity consumers and in particular
to the regional electricity companies which buy large amounts of electricity
at the volatile pool price and sell at a price fixed by regulation. However,
the contract market may also hold the key to increasing the competitiveness
of the industry. What is required is a standardised, transparent contract
market which can be regulated attentively. If generators truly competed in a
liquid contract market pool problems would be reduced significantly. It is a
high contract price, representing the long-term price of electricity, which
would attract entrants to the industry.
