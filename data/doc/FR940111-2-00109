<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waivers of Compliance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received from the Kentucky Railway Museum, Incorporated a request for waiver of compliance with certain requirements
of Federal regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature

Kentucky Railway Museum, Incorporated (KRM) Waiver Petition, Docket Number SA937 



The KRM seeks a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part 231, Railroad Safety Appliance Standards.
The KRM is requesting that it be permitted to operate diesel locomotive number 32 which does not comply with 49 CFR 231.29
``road locomotives with corner stairways'' in that the uncoupling mechanism cannot be operated from the bottom stairway
opening and Section 231.30 ``locomotives used in switching service'' which requires switching steps and the removal
of end foot boards. 

Locomotive number 32 is an EMD, Model BL2 locomotive built in 1948. The locomotive is equipped with end footboards
and arranged with a step and handhold located on the side at each corner, front and rear, for access to the walkway and
cab structure. The uncoupling mechanism is operated from ground level. 

The KRM is a railroad museum which operates historical equipment for the education and enjoyment of the visiting public.
The train is operated between New Haven and Boston, Kentucky, a distance of 25 miles round trip at a maximum speed of
25 mph. 

Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
