  [Text] Brasilia, 2 May (EFE) -- Brazilian presidential 
candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva today urged U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to invite his Cuban counterpart, Fidel Castro, to 
attend the "summit" of the Americas to be held in Miami on 9-10 
December. 
  Lula is the leading presidential candidate for the 3 October 
elections. He said Latin American governments should not 
consider Cuba's exclusion from the meeting "as a fait accompli." 
  Lula said the Brazilian Government should recommend that 
Clinton pick a city other than Miami to hold the "summit" and 
that Castro be invited to attend. 
  In remarks to EFE, the 48-year-old leader of the Workers 
Party (PT, socialist) charged that choosing Miami to host the 
meeting is "an act of provocation for Cubans." 
  Brazilian President Itamar Franco has announced that he 
would 
invite the winner of the 3 October presidential election to join 
his entourage to the "summit" of the Americas. 
  Lula said that, even though he has received no invitation, 
he 
would not attend the summit because one Latin American country, 
Cuba, will not be represented there. 
  Lula has voiced his opposition to the trade embargo that for 
three decades has been imposed by the United States on Cuba. 
  On previous occasions, Lula said that he is in favor of 
Castro's calling democratic elections in Cuba.
