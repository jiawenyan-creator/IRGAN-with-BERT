U.S. RELATIONS WITH CHINA 
The Times reports that the Bush Administration is easing its curbs on China 
(Part I, Sept. 4). Why? Not because the Chinese government has eased its curbs 
on the people of China. On the contrary, the arrests, prosecutions and death 
sentences have escalated since the massacre. Amnesty International has 
confirmed this. Yet we had been told that if stiffer sanctions were deemed 
necessary they would be imposed, depending on the actions of the Chinese 
government. 
How can our government hypocritically demand free democratic elections in 
Nicaragua and Cuba? How can we support so-called "freedom fighters" in Central 
America, yet look the other way and carry on business as usual in China? Why? I 
suspect that it is because business interests are involved in the China 
decision. It seems that economic freedom is more important than political 
freedom, not only in China but in the United States as well. 
We, who have a heritage and an obligation to defend democratic ideals and 
peaceful reform, seem to have caved in completely when forced to make a choice 
between our principles and our pocketbooks.
