FT  13 JAN 92 / Security forces find arms caches in Ulster
Four people were arrested after guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition
were found in houses in Ballymoney, County Antrim. Three men and a woman
were being questioned about what is thought to have been a Loyalist arms
cache.
Earlier, security forces arrested three men after unearthing a large store
of homemade explosives in a house near the Falls Road in west Belfast.
Police and military also found several bags of fertiliser - a key component
of homemade explosives - when they searched a hall attached to Clonard
Monastery in the Falls Road area.
