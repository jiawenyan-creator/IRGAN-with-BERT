<H8>  State Privatization Program for the Year 1994 </H8>
  The State Privatization Program for the Year 1994 
(hereinafter, the Program) has been developed in accordance with 
the Law of Ukraine "The Privatization of the Property of State 
Enterprises," and is directed toward the widespread development 
of the privatization of the property of state enterprises. 
<H5>  Part 1. Conditions for the Conduct of Privatization </H5>
<H5>  Section 1. Priorities of Privatization </H5>
  Based on the results of the privatization process in 
1992-93, 
the following priorities have been defined for the realization 
of state policy in the sphere of privatization: 
  --the widespread pursuit of privatization of subjects in 
groups A and E; 
  --the launch of privatization for subjects in groups B, C 
and 
D; 
  --the assurance of the participation of citizens of Ukraine 
in privatization through their use of privatization deposit 
accounts; 
  --the development of the market infrastructure; 
  --the creation of conditions for making the privatization 
process and the post-privatization functioning of the 
enterprises more energetic; 
  --the creation of conditions for the participation of 
foreign 
investors in privatization; 
  --the coordination of the processes of privatization of 
property that is under nationwide, republic (Republic of Crimea) 
and municipal ownership, and the conduct of organizational and 
financial measures with that aim. 
  The tasks of the Program are mandatory for fulfillment by 
central and local bodies of state executive authority and bodies 
of regional and local self-government. 
<H5>  Section 2. The Subjects of Privatization </H5>
  2.1. The subjects of privatization are categorized by groups 
based on the initial (balance-sheet) value of the fixed capital 
as indicated in the balance-sheet account for the quarter that 
preceded the date of the decision by the privatization body on 
the privatization of that subject (hereinafter, the value) and 
qualitative features. The subjects are categorized as follows: 
  Group A--subjects whose value does not exceed 700 million 
karbovantsi in prices for 1 August 1993 (aside from the 
enterprises of group D); 
  Group B--subjects whose value was from 700 million to 45 
billion karbovantsi in prices for 1 August 1993, and the portion 
of the value of the capital per worker does not exceed the 
nominal value of a privatization property certificate by more 
than 1.5 times (aside from the enterprises of group D); 
  Group C--subjects whose value was from 700 million to 45 
billion karbovantsi in prices for 1 August 1993, and the portion 
of value of the capital per worker exceeds the nominal value of 
a privatization property certificate by more than 1.5 times 
(aside from the enterprises of group D); 
  Group D--monopoly enterprises that are designated as such 
under established procedure regardless of their value; 
enterprises in the military-industrial complex that are subject 
to conversion in accordance with the corresponding program 
regardless of their value; enterprises whose privatization is 
being carried out with the enlistment of foreign investments 
under international treaties of Ukraine, regardless of their 
value; enterprises whose value exceeds 45 billion karbovantsi; 
  Group E--mothballed subjects and subjects of incomplete 
construction; the property of liquidated enterprises; 
  Group F--portions (shares, shares of stock) that belong to 
the state of the property of enterprises that are under mixed 
forms of ownership. 
  In case of the indexing of the balance-sheet value of the 
fixed capital, the amount of the value by which the 
categorization of the subjects of privatization is accomplished 
is increased by the indexing factor of the privatization 
property certificates. 
  2.2. Subjects that have the greatest impact on the 
development of the consumer market, as well as those whose 
presence under state ownership is restraining the process of 
financial stabilization and slowing economic development and the 
formation of a market economy, are subject to priority 
privatization. These subjects include: 
  --enterprises in retail trade, public catering and domestic 
services; 
  --operations enterprises in housing and municipal services, 
including enterprises of the housing and hotel industries, and

  --mothballed subjects; 
  --subjects of incomplete construction that were financed out 
of state capital investments and subsidies from state or local

already expired. 
  The decision to privatize those subjects is made by the 
privatization bodies at their own initiative.

structural subdivisions from their composition is not permitted 
if that could lead to the disruption of production and 
technological processes.

privatization property certificate, to the employees of the 
enterprises whose property is being privatized; 
  --in accordance with Decree No. 51-93 of the Cabinet of 
Ministers of Ukraine of 17 May 1993, "Specific Features of

the heads of structural subdivisions; 
  --by means of the open sale of shares of stock for 
privatization vouchers, to the citizens of Ukraine, societies of 
buyers, investment funds, proxy societies and other financial 
intermediaries. 
  The subsequent sale of portions (shares, shares of stock) 
for 
privatization vouchers is accomplished through the funds of the 
buyers.

privatization vouchers for policies of insurance companies that 
have a license of the State Property Fund of Ukraine in order to 
carry out intermediary operations with privatization vouchers 
and to provide for the exchange of privatization vouchers for 
shares of stock in medical subjects that are being privatized. 
  6.5. In case of a change in the general procedure for the 
computation of the appropriate value of subjects being 
privatized, the nominal value of the privatization property 
certificates and the amount of their overall issue are subject 
to mandatory indexing. The indexing factor is determined by the

Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, the Ministry of 
Statistics of Ukraine and the National Bank of Ukraine, and is 
approved by decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 
  6.6. Citizens of Ukraine are granted an opportunity for the 
unrestricted selection of the spheres of privatization, and the

  The convertibility of privatization vouchers during the 
period of privatization is provided for through the stipulation 
of factors for the recomputation of the nominal value of 
vouchers of one type when they are being converted into vouchers 
of another. 
  The State Property Fund, National Bank, Ministry of Finance 
of Ukraine, Ministry of Economics of Ukraine and Ministry of 
Statistics of Ukraine will establish by 1 March 1994 the 
procedure and the factors for the conversion of various types of 
privatization vouchers, which are reviewed during the indexing 
of the values of property being privatized. 
  6.7. The issue of privatization vouchers in 1994 is 
accomplished in the form of non-cash deposits.

are 
opened in accordance with the Statute on the Procedure for the 
Opening of Privatization Deposit Accounts and the Making of 
Payments From Them approved by the National Bank of Ukraine and 
the State Specialized Commercial Savings Bank of Ukraine, as 
well as the Statute on the Procedure for Transactions for 
Acquired Facilities of Privatization approved by the National 
Bank and the State Property Fund of Ukraine.

Ukraine, in conjunction with the State Specialized Commercial 
Savings Bank of Ukraine, the Ministry of Communications of
