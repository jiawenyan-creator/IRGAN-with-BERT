MISSION VIEJO'S GRAFFITI 
Regarding the unwelcome appearance on Irvine walls of the ugliest of all of 
man's graphic efforts, the ubiquitous graffiti; may I offer to the good 
citizens of that community an Italian phrase that just might offer them solace: 
"Muraglia bianca, carta di matto." That translates as: "The white wall is the 
fool's paper." 
Cold comfort, I admit, but better than nothing.
