FT  04 MAY 94 / IBM to set up data 'highway' linking 500 Chinese cities
International Business Machines has been chosen by China's Ministry of
Electronics Industry to lead a vast project to link about 500 cities to a
national 'information highway' data network.
Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed by Mr Lou Gerstner,
IBM chairman and chief executive, and Mr Zou Jiahua, one of China's vice
premiers, IBM will lead the 'Golden Bridge' project, one of three
initiatives designed to modernise China's data communications and computing
infrastructure.
The project will involve designing and building regional networks in
selected cities across China, along with a 'backbone' network linking the
regional systems. The effort will be led by a newly established joint
venture, based in Beijing, between IBM China and Ji Tong Communications, a
company affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Electronics Industry.
'This is China's version of the information highway. The Chinese government
has set very ambitious goals and we are thrilled to have been selected to
work with them,' said Mr Ned Lautenbach, head of IBM's international
operations.
IBM has also been chosen as the primary consultant on two other 'Golden
Projects': Golden Card will establish facilities for credit and debit cards
throughout China, and Golden Customs will create computerised record-keeping
and tracking systems for China's exports and imports.
IBM's presence in China dates back to 1935. The company left China when the
communist regime took over and came back in 1982 as an offshore business. In
September 1992 IBM China became a wholly owned foreign enterprise,
authorised to trade in local currency and to hire Chinese employees.
'In the last 18 months or so we have been growing our resources, our
commitment and our business in China,' said Mr Lautenbach. These moves
reflect the Clinton administration's liberalisation of export controls on
high technology goods sold to China.
