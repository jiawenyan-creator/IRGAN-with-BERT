FT  24 DEC 92 / Letter: Support for BR projects essential
Sir, The King's Cross and Thameslink projects are at an advanced state of
planning and almost ready for work to start - enabling target completion by
1999. They address acknowledged inadequacies and will do much to lead
Britain's rail network into the next century. Faster progress could be made
given increased borrowing powers (not grants) and there is evidence of
considerable positiveness from British Rail and - in spirit at least - from
the government.
The Channel tunnel itself will very soon be at the stage where it waits for
commissioning planning to commence and has been a remarkable physical
achievement for all concerned - demonstrating renewed faith and confidence
in those who strove for it for the last 200 years. We know that UK links
will not be in place when it opens but we do have every support for Sir Bob
Reid, the chairman (who has not always been allowed to do what he and his
board feel is right), and British Rail.
British Rail should be given both the necessary enablement and the moral,
financial and physical support to its projects. Britain led the world in
transport in the last two centuries - it can still do the same for the next
two.
