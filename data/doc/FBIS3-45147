  [Text] Taiyuan, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The development of 
rural industrial towns in north China's Shanxi Province is 
growing in momentum. 
  At present, there are 150 towns in the coal-rich province 
whose annual output value has exceeded 100 million yuan each. 
  The rural industry in the province constitutes six pillar 
trades: coal processing, metallurgy, machinery, light textiles, 
chemicals and processing of agricultural side-line products. 
  Rural industries have also set up a few major production 
bases including a heating radiator base in Qingxu County, an 
active carbon base in Datong city and a forgeable iron base in 
Taigu County. 
  The rural towns with 100-million-yuan output value boosted 
the development of rural industry in the province. Last year, 
the total output value and pre-tax profits of the rural 
enterprises reached 68.6 billion yuan and 7.5 billion yuan, 
respectively increasing by 70 and 52.9 percent over the previous 
year.
