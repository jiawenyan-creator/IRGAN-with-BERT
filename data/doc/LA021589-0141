The 10 anchors for the new "Sports Kids" TV program for children have been 
announced by Irvine-based American Kids Sports Assn., organizers of the planned 
weekly show. 
Selected from among more than 1,000 children, ages 9 to 12, who auditioned for 
the program were: Laurel Hafer, 9, Newport Beach; Amy Katcherian, 9, Irvine; 
David Reznik, 10, Newport Beach; Lee Gayle, 10, West Covina, and Sarah

T.J. Ballard, 9, of Costa Mesa was also selected to work behind the scenes on 
technical aspects. 
The 11 were chosen from among 31 finalists who took part in a 3-week 
"broadcaster school." They will begin training in broadcast journalism in 
preparation for their first assignments, planned for June. 
"Sports Kids" will use a format styled after "Wide World of Sports" to showcase 
youth sports events around the world. Details about the program, planned for 
national broadcast, are to be announced April 16 at a black-tie reception that 
will include a performance by the Beach Boys. RICK VANDERKNYFF
