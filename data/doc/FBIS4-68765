Useful for Finland as Well"] 
  [Text] The training of Estonian policemen in Finland has 
gotten under way. In early spring the Police Institute in Espoo 
already had a few Estonian policemen for a brief course. At the 
Police School in Tampere a crime investigation course, in which 
Estonian investigators participate for the first time, is under 
way right now. 
  The police department of Finland's Ministry of the Interior 
and the head of Estonia's police have agreed on intensified 
cooperation in training. This year about 30 Estonian policemen 
will take courses in Finland. 
  Chief Inspector Matti Launiainen of the Interior Ministry's 
police department says that the training of Estonian policemen 
also gets the Finnish policemen used to international relations. 
Finland also benefits from the Estonian policemen by acquiring 
current information about crime in the east. 
  The first experience from the training cooperation is good. 
The language represents the biggest problem, but it is not 
insurmountable. The training language is Finnish. 
  Criminal investigator Ain Balder from Tartu says that 
economic criminals in Estonia have a five-year lead over the 
police. This lead is what one is now trying to shorten with the 
training in Finland. 
  The strong moral self-esteem of the Finnish police appeals 
to 
the Estonian policemen, says Balder. In Estonia there are 
problems of suspicion about receiving bribes. This is ballast 
from the Soviet era that one should get rid of, he says. 
  Balder believes that personal contacts across the Bay of 
Finland will make criminal investigation in both countries more 
efficient. It is surely better to get help through direct 
contacts than via Interpol or other official international 
channels, he says.
