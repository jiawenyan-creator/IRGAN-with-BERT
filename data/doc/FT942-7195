FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Celsius opens with advance of
20%
Celsius, the Swedish defence group privatised last year, yesterday announced
a 20 per cent increase in first - quarter profits to SKr186m (Dollars
24.07m).
The group said rationalisation had driven the results from SKr155m a year
ago, allowing it to compensate for reduced financial income.
An improved business climate and the group's emphasis on high technology
niches enabled sales to reach SKr3.1bn, up SKr200m. The order intake rose to
SKr2.5bn from SKr1.8bn partly due to the recent acquisition of Enator, a
data technology group.
Operating profit more than doubled to SKr146m from SKr58m, even though the
contribution from associate companies fell to SKr10m from SKr26m. Lower
interest rates meant financial income was SKr57m lower at SKr40m.
The group predicted that its full-year result would exceed last year's
SKr721m. It expects higher sales and increased efficiency to compensate for
reduced financial income and a lower contribution from associate companies.
