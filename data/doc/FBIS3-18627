  [Text] Paris does not envisage sending any extra troops to 
Bosnia, as called for yesterday [3 March] by General Jean Cot, 
head of the UN peacekeepers, but Paris could examine a 
redeployment of its soldiers stationed in former Yugoslavia. 
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman recalled that France has 
already made the largest contribution, with more than 6,000 men 
deployed there, including nearly 3,000 in Sarajevo alone.
