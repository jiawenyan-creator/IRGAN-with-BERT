  [Text] Bratislava--Barring any unforeseen circumstances, 
the small hydro-electric plant on the Moson branch of the Danube 
will be completed in the first half of May. The Vodohospodarska 
vystavba Bratislava state enterprise will, as of 15 May, double 
the volume of water discharged from 20 cubic meters per second 
to 40 cubic meters per second and will contribute significantly 
to supplying the Danube branches and the Danube wetlands in 
Hungary, said Environment Minister J. Hrasko. Environment 
Ministers J. Gyurko and J. Hrasko last week recommended that 
their governments adopt a political decision that would bring 
them closer together.
