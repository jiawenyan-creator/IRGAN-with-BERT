BREEDING BIRDS: BURROWING OWL; 
BURROWING OWL: (ATHENE CUNICULARIA) 
Description: The adult burrowing owl is boldly spotted and barred. Long legs 
distinguish this ground dweller from all other small owls. Its round head and 
tuftless ears also aid in identification. 
Habitat: Prefers flat, open land. 
Diet: Large insects, rodents and lizards. Primarily a nocturnal hunter. 
Display: Often seen in daylight outside burrow or on fence post, where it 
bounces and bobs. 
Nest: This owl adopts abandoned burrows of ground squirrels and other 
small mammals, occasionally enlarging them by kicking dirt backwards. The nest 
chamber is usually lined with cow chips, horse dung, food debris, dry grass, 
weeds, pellets or feathers. 
Eggs: White and nest-stained, about 1.2 inches long. 
Natural history notes: In competition with developers for flat, open land, the 
burrowing owl has lost much of its Orange County habitat and is greatly reduced 
in numbers. 
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 
962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160. 
Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society 
volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.
