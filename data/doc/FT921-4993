FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Woolwich plans 40 T&amp;C closures
FORTY OF the 78 branches of Town &amp; Country, the building society which was
taken over by Woolwich Building Society last October, are to be shut down
when the merger of the two societies is completed early in May.
News of the closures, which are likely to make a substantial number of T&amp;C's
800 staff redundant, were announced along with news of a sharp fall in
Woolwich's profits during 1991 because of sharply increased provisions
against bad debts.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy chief executive, said it was impossible to say at
this stage how many T&amp;C staff would lose their jobs.
Woolwich's pre-tax profits fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 136.4m (Pounds
173m). Bad debt provisions were Pounds 72.4m, up from Pounds 32m in 1990. In
addition the society wrote off loan losses of Pounds 23m during the year.
Its assets grew from Pounds 18.2bn to Pounds 20.2bn during the year, but its
two main businesses, savings and mortgage lending, both contracted.
Lending was down to Pounds 3.1bn (Pounds 3.6bn), while net receipts of
savings in 1991 were Pounds 1.12bn (Pounds 1.45bn).
'We decided not to push the boat out in a thin market,' said Mr Donald
Kirkham, chief executive. He said that the Woolwich had held its own in
market share terms.
During the year, Woolwich enlarged its network of estate agencies and took
over T&amp;C. It also developed its European mortgage operations in France and
Italy. Mr Kirkham said these investments were the main reason why the
society's cost-income ratio rose from 53.7 to 59.9 per cent, about 10
percentage points higher than the industry average.
Woolwich's results contrasted with a sparkling 1991 performance announced
yesterday by Yorkshire, the 12th largest society.
Its pre-tax profits rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 52.6m. Total mortgage
lending was up by 15 per cent to Pounds 979m, while the society's assets
grew by 17 per cent to Pounds 4.18bn.
Yorkshire's cost-income ratio dropped to 42 per cent, its lowest ever level.
Loan loss provisions were Pounds 15.3m, up from Pounds 9m in 1990.
The society's strong showing partly reflected the fact that much of its
customer base is in the north of England which has been less affected by the
recession than the south-east.
Mr Derek Roberts, chief executive, said that his society's strong all-round
performance demonstrated that it was well equipped to deal with tough market
conditions. 'Although bad debt provisions are high, the society has been
protected by its prudent levels of growth during the boom years in the
housing market,' he said.
