"Common Language is One of Ecology"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- A meeting took place in the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry between Major General Sergey 
Grigorov, chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry, 
ecology and special protection funds directorate, and European 
Parliament deputies Christian Rousing and Freddy Blak. The 
visitors from Denmark saw for themselves how the storing and 
utilization of nuclear weapons and propulsion plants in the Army 
and the Navy is done by experienced specialists with the aid of 
the most up-to-date technical monitoring equipment. However, due 
to considerable cuts in nuclear arms and redeployment of missile 
units there is a lack of ecology specialists. The 
Europarliament deputies voiced readiness for cooperation in 
jointly training them.
