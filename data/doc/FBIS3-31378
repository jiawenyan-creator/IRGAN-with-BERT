  [Text] Sofia, February 15 (BTA) -- "In my opinion any 
statements that possible airstrikes against Bosnia pose no 
threat to stability and security in this region are unacceptable 
and naive," Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General 
Staff of the Bulgarian Army, told the press today. He described 
as correct, clear and consistent Bulgaria's policy as stated by 
President Zhelyu Zhelev, for noninvolvement in military measures 
and no form of support for other countries' intervention and no 
air corridors to be used by countries that choose to get 
involved in the conflict.
