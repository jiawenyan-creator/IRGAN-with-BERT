SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This regulatory action is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. The
Administrator of REA has determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) does not apply to this rule. The Administrator of REA has determined that this rule will not significantly affect
the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. Section 1710.117 requires
borrowers to comply with applicable environmental regulations and will cover the activities for which assistance
is sought under this subpart. This rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation,
which may require consultation with State and local officials. A Notice of Final Rule titled Department Programs
and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA electric loans and loan guarantees from
coverage under this Order. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule:
(1) Will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict
with this rule; (2) will not have any retroactive effect; (3) will not require administrative proceedings before
any parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. The program described by this rule is listed in the
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under number 10.850 Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees.
This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government
Printing Office, Washington, DC 204029325. The existing recordkeeping and reporting burdens contained
in this rule were approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
(44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), under control numbers 05720017, 05720032 and 05720103. Because of the deadline imposed by
the law, the additional recordkeeping and reporting burdens have been submitted to OMB for approval on an emergency
basis. Send questions or comments regarding these burdens or any other aspect of these collections of information,
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget, room 3201, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. Attention: Desk Officer for USDA.


Background


The Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993, Public Law 103129, 107 Stat. 1356, (RELRA), signed
into law by President Clinton on November 1, 1993, amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, 7 U.S.C. 901 

et seq. 

(RE Act). The amendments mandate a restructuring of the electric loan programs of REA. Loan purposes, the definition
of ``rural area'', applicable interest rates and loan terms and conditions were among the areas affected by RELRA.
An interim rule implementing these provisions of RELRA were published on December 20, 1993 at 58 FR 66260.
The amendments to 7 CFR part 1710, published today implement the provision for making loans for demand side management,
energy conservation programs, on- and off-grid renewable energy systems. This provision has a statutory deadline
of January 1, 1994.
