FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc oversubscribed
The privatisation issue of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and
pharmaceuticals group, attracted almost 3m individual investors and was
about three times oversubscribed, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, announced yesterday.
Mr Alphandery said orders for the issue, the second in the government's
privatisation campaign, demonstrated support for its plans to sell public
sector companies and expand popular shareholding.
The strong demand from individual investors means that the French government
will exercise a clawback option to reduce the tranche allocated to
institutional investors. As a result, the number of shares for individuals
will be raised to 52.3m from 47.5m.
Individual investors will see their allocations reduced below the 60 shares
which was set as the maximum subscription. The government will announce
today how many shares will be granted to individuals.
The price for individual investors was set at FFr146 per share, compared
with the public offer price of FFr135. Yesterday, Rhone-Poulenc shares
closed at FFr153.9.
Mr Alphandery said the sale of the government's 43 per cent stake had seen
strong demand from French and international institutional investors. Of the
26.9m shares to go to institutional investors, 36.25 per cent are for French
companies, 19 per cent to US companies, and 8.5 per cent to Japan.
