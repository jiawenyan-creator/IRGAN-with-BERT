CANADA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
Your editorial on cooling the medical cost epidemic (Editorials, March 27) 
informs us that the "Clinical Appropriateness Initiative" being developed by 
the RAND Corp. will attempt to define standards for what is or is not an 
appropriate surgery, a long overdue effort to eliminate the many unnecessary 
procedures now being performed. 
It is obvious that the medical care crisis is a serious, complex problem 
requiring thoughtful, workable solutions, such as the fixed fee, universal 
coverage approach in Canada, combined with reforms. 
Our politicians, however, have a much simpler solution. No problem, don't 
address the structural flaws in our system, just let the employer pay for 
universal coverage. 
What the politicians don't understand is that most businesses that don't offer 
employer-paid health insurance can't afford to. Many businesses are like mine, 
heavy on labor, with less than $150 per month per employee in net profit. 
Forcing the employer to pay insurance under these circumstances becomes a 
monetary impossibility.
