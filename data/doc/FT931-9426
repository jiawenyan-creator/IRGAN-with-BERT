FT  13 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Tunnel vision
LIKE MANY other people, I was an original subscriber for Eurotunnel units
and warrants in December 1987. In return for the lump sum which I then
subscribed, I was allotted a holding of units and a holding of warrants. The
warrants lapsed in November 1992, of course, but I continue to hold the
units.
I know I can set the cost of the warrants against other investment gains for
the purposes of capital gains tax, but I have no idea how much of the
original lump sum was attributable to the units and how much to the
warrants. How can I work this out?
Of the Pounds 3.50 which you paid for each unit with warrant attached,
Pounds 3.3555992 is attributable to the unit (comprising a Eurotunnel plc
share and a Eurotunnel SA share) and the other 14.44008p is attributable to
the warrant.
This allowable loss on each warrant is accordingly 14.44008p x 139.7 / 103.3
= 19.52836p. This apportionment is based upon the quarter-up prices on
December 10 1987, viz Pounds 2.44 for a unit and 10.5p for a warrant.
