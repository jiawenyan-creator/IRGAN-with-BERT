  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis said this evening that 
with its joining Greece's defense space, Cyprus will be stronger 
than it is now as far as the negotiations go, and much stronger 
in regard to any Turkish expansionist designs. Speaking upon 
his return from Thessaloniki this evening, President Kliridhis 
noted that Turkey knows what has been said by Greek Governments, 
that any possible attempt at expansion into the free part of 
Cyprus is a reason for war, but he added that if it does not 
know that there are plans for implementation of this decision, 
it will not take us seriously. 
  President Kliridhis said that the practical steps for the 
unified defense space between Greece and Cyprus will be 
completed by the end of February and will be put before the two 
governments. He also said that a delegation from the Greek 
National Defense General Staff in Athens will come to Cyprus at 
the beginning of February for cooperation with the National 
Guard General Staff. Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos 
Arsenis will come to Cyprus around the middle of February for a 
further exchange of views. 
  Referring to an appraisal that the moment of truth for the 
Cyprus issue has arrived, President Kliridhis said that the 
moment of truth for the Cyprus issue has been close for a long 
time now, and that the truth is that [Turkish Cypriot Leader 
Rauf] Denktas has never responded positively to any proposal for 
a solution of the Cyprus issue. The president also said that 
the Greek Cypriot side agreed to discuss the UN secretary 
general's proposals in order to find ways to implement them. 
However, Kliridhis added, we do not accept Denktas' altering 
the proposals and will not discuss the Turkish Cypriot leader's 
altered proposals. Finally, the president noted that the 
National Council will be convened on 27 January.
