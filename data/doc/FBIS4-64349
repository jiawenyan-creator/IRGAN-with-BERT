<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Karlsruhe: Hashish Consumption </F>
Publishable"] 
  [Text] The Constitutional Court has issued a kind of 
commentary about its own ruling on hashish. It described as 
"groundless" reports that it had approved the consumption of 
hashish. The Court explained that it had declared the ban on 
drugs and all drug-related offenses to be in keeping with the 
constitution. However, lenient sentences may be applied to 
minor offenses. The Court further explained: "Law-enforcement 
bodies must in principle discontinue with prosecution if hashish 
is only consumed in small quantities for private consumption, 
and without danger to third parties." The Court considers terms 
such as "free of punishment" or "approval" to be wrong, because 
in a legal sense, the consumption of hashish and marijuana 
remains punishable. The Court has merely forbidden the 
prosecution of petty consumers of hashish in certain 
circumstances; therefore, in ordinary language, such persons 
remain free of punishment.
