FT  17 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures break through
Dollars 2,000 barrier
Coffee futures prices in London and New York continued their exponential
rise yesterday, helped by signs there might be fresh interest from
investment funds and speculative buyers.
The July robusta futures contract surged through Dollars 2,000 a tonne to a
new five-year high. It closed at Dollars 2,052, up Dollars 95 on the day,
although profit-taking had trimmed it back from the peak of Dollars 2,065
reached after a strong opening in New York.
The second position arabica contract in New York was up 11.1 cents at 126.8
cents a pound in afternoon trading.
Bullish sentiment was fuelled by the fortnightly US report on traders'
commitments, published on Friday, which showed speculators and funds had
bought less in the last two weeks than believed. 'It indicated there was
more potential for the funds and specs to come in,' said one trader.
'We're looking at an old-fashioned physical squeeze,' said Mr Lawrence
Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London broker. 'Roasters and traders haven't
needed to hold security stocks until now and suddenly they've found there
isn't enough coffee around.'
He said some 3m bags of coffee were available in New York warehouses but
those holding on to the stocks were waiting for prices to go further. But he
warned that the market had reached 'ridiculous' levels, 'considering that
the outcome of the 1994-95 season is still uncertain'.
