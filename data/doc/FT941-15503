FT  14 JAN 94 / TSB pre-tax profits surge to Pounds 301m
TSB Group yesterday exhibited a solid recovery from poor lending in the late
1980s by announcing full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 301m, against Pounds
5m, helped by a large fall in provisions for bad debts.
The dividend for the year was increased by 20 per cent to 7.68p, against
6.4p. Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, said this restored the payout to
the level it would have reached if the bank had not frozen it in 1991 and
1992.
TSB stressed it intended to keep Hill Samuel, the merchant banking and fund
management arm which last year it indicated it might sell. Mr Peter Ellwood,
group chief executive, said TSB was investing in Hill Samuel.
Bad debt provisions in the year to October 31 fell from Pounds 597m to
Pounds 343m. The largest fall - from Pounds 334m to Pounds 112m - came in
the loan administration unit established in 1992 to run down a poor
corporate loan portfolio.
Mr Ellwood said TSB had replaced about Pounds 800m of poor assets in the
loan unit and Mortgage Express, a centralised mortgage lender, with Pounds
1bn of high quality assets, mostly by increasing mortgage lending through
branches by 25 per cent.
The bank reduced banking income to build its customer base by moving
deposits to higher interest accounts. Retail banking profits fell by 11 per
cent to Pounds 260m, although retail insurance profits rose 50 per cent to
Pounds 194m.
Strongest growth was in unit trusts, with sales of Pounds 457m, against
Pounds 109m. Mr Ellwood said this showed that although TSB's short-term
profits had been reduced by its policy on deposits it would create long-term
gains.
However, he said that the bank would have to increase the volume of business
in 1994 to sustain income growth. As competition intensified, margins were
likely to fall for both banking and life insurance products.
The bank's strong capital ratios were bolstered by retentions and a fall in
risk-weighted assets to Pounds 15.6bn from Pounds 16.9bn. The tier one ratio
of core capital to risk-weighted assets rose from 7.2 to 8.7 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 12.7p, against a 1.7p loss. Shares closed 15p up
at 267p.
