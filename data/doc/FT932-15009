FT  15 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
Three-month COPPER prices fell sharply in late LME trading, closing weak and
just above Dollars 2,000 a tonne, with the decline pulling other metals
lower. New York's Comex copper futures were more than 2 cents a lb down by
midday. London dealers said late selling pressure and liquidation appeared
to be a fresh attempt to push the market below Dollars 2,000 and trigger
lurking sell stops. Although the market held above this level in initial
after-hours trading, traders were wary of a downward break, as all the signs
suggested that the Dollars 2,000-Dollars 2,050 range was unlikely to hold.
LME ZINC also fell away during late afternoon trading. Overhead resistance
above Dollars 1,050 a tonne for three-month metal eventually proved too
strong, dealers said. The market was also correcting downwards after rising
some Dollars 50 in a straight line on Tuesday, while the Chinese production
cuts which emerged overnight were not as large as many traders had expected.
Production at two Chinese zinc-lead smelters is to be cut by 10,000 tonnes
of zinc and 20,000 tonnes of lead per year. New York COTTON prices were
sharply ahead by midday on fund buying.
