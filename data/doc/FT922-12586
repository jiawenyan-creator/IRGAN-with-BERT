FT  16 APR 92 / Sweden cuts tax to help industry
Sweden announced yesterday it plans to scrap the general energy tax on
industry and lower its value added tax by 3 percentage points from 25 per
cent to 22 per cent, AP-DJ reports from Stockholm. The centre-right
coalition government will also abolish a tax on commercial property,
starting next year, as a way of stabilising market prices. The proposals are
part of a plan to reduce taxes by a net SKr2bn (Pounds 190m). The government
said the lower energy tax would give companies an added SKr3bn.
