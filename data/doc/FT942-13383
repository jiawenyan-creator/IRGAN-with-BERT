FT  25 APR 94 / Taiwan to send arson delegation
Taiwan will send a delegation to China to gather details on the deaths of 24
Taiwanese tourists in an arson case that has set back detente between the
two sides, AP reports from Taipei.
Mr Huang Kun-huei, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, told reporters
that the delegation would leave for China in a week. The 24 were found dead
on March 31 in a burned-out boat on a lake in China's Zhejiang province.
Earlier, Taiwan had demanded an open trial for three suspects arrested by
Chinese authorities last week and more details on the investigation before
it would accept China's suggestion to send a delegation.
Beijing's semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
sent a letter to its Taiwanese counterpart over the weekend promising that
China would answer questions about the case, Mr Huang said.
'The most important thing now is to find the truth and hammer out
compensation for families of the victims . . . so it is still imperative to
hold talks on the incident,' Mr Huang added.
The case has prompted Taiwanese groups to call for a boycott on tourism to
the mainland and for a suspension of new investment projects. It has also
heightened the impression in Taiwan that Beijing remains an unreliable
partner.
