FT  05 JAN 94 / Labour costs 'cheapest in UK'
Labour costs in the UK are lower than in any other leading industrial
country, a book published today says.
International and Comparative Industrial Relations, by Professor Greg Bamber
and Mr Russell Lansbury, ranks hourly labour costs for production workers in
the UK below Germany, Sweden, Canada, Italy, the US, France and Japan. The
figures are based on 1991 local currencies converted into US dollars.
