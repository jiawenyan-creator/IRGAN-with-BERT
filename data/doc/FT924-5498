FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Rothmans Intl flat at Pounds 266m
ROTHMANS International, the cigarette and luxury goods group which is
controlled by Richemont, the Swiss holding company, yesterday reported flat
pre-tax profits, held back by lower interest rates on its investments.
Interim pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds
266m to Pounds 266.5m on sales 2 per cent up at Pounds 1.2bn. Net investment
income fell 35 per cent to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 33.1m).
Earnings per share rose to 20.9p (20p) and the interim dividend is increased
by 7 per cent to 4p (3.75p).
Lord Swaythling, chairman, said that because so much of the group's profits
were made abroad, it was almost paying out as much as it could in dividends
without running into an ACT problem.
At the operating level, Rothmans increased tobacco profits, from Pounds 180m
to Pounds 192m, despite a lower volume of cigarette sales. Sales increased
in eastern Europe, particularly to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
In the UK sales of Royals King Size 25's were strong.
These increases were offset by lower sales in Australia, because of what
Lord Swaythling called swingeing tax increases and a price war. Sales also
fell in Germany, because there were too many manufacturers, and in Indonesia
and the Philippines, where Lord Swaythling said it was tough to achieve
meaningful market share.
The operating profit was after a Pounds 9.2m exceptional charge covering
rationalisation of the Australian and Philippine operations and stock
write-downs of Pounds 3.9m in the Philippines and Indonesia.
Luxury products lifted their contribution at the operating level to Pounds
21.8m (Pounds 20.5m).
Translation of overseas company profits hit the pre-tax result to the tune
of Pounds 5m.
