VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY; 
WIDENING OF ROAD NEARS COMPLETION 
The expansion of Olsen Road to four lanes at the Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley 
city limits is expected to be finished by the end of April, the Simi Valley 
director of public works said Wednesday. 
The director, Ron Coons, said the Wood Ranch developer who is widening the road 
in both cities expects it to be finished this month. 
The Thousand Oaks City Council agreed Tuesday to pay the $30,000 needed for the 
grading, paving, striping and landscaping costs of the expansion on its portion 
of the road. 
In 1987 Simi Valley had rejected a Thousand Oaks proposal to widen Olsen Road 
because it was concerned about traffic diversions from the Ventura 
Freeway-widening project, according to a report from John Clement, Thousand 
Oaks director of public works. 
In late 1989 Simi Valley approved a development permit for a day-care center on 
Olsen Road, on condition that the developer make road improvements on the Simi 
Valley side. Simi Valley agreed to have the developer improve the Thousand Oaks 
portion of Olsen Road only if Thousand Oaks funded the improvement, Clement 
said. 
"It worked out to be a very good arrangement," Coons said. "The cities are 
working well together." DAWN PURCELL
