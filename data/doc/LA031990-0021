TENNIS ROUNDUP; 
CAPRIATI WINS WHEN INJURY STOPS FENDICK 
Jennifer Capriati won easily Sunday, and so did Andre Agassi. 
Capriati, tennis' 13-year-old sensation, advanced to the fourth round when 
Patty Fendick sustained a knee injury while leading, 4-2, in the first set. 
"I never want to win like that," Capriati said. "I feel sorry for her. She was 
playing great, too." 
The fifth-seeded Agassi, 19, who had a first-round bye, needed just 54 minutes 
to eliminate Kelly Jones in a second-round match, 6-1, 6-2. 
In another men's match, qualifier Mark Kratzmann upset ninth-seeded Yannick 
Noah, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (8-6). 
In women's matches, No. 3 Monica Seles routed Laura Lapi, 6-1, 6-1, in 42 
minutes, and No. 4 Manuela Maleeva trounced Camille Benjamin, 6-1, 6-2. 
Capriati, 8-1 since turning pro earlier this month, lost her serve at love in 
the second game and fell behind, 3-0. She was ahead, 30-0, in the seventh game 
with Fendick serving when the match ended. 
Fendick said her right knee locked as she hit a backhand approach shot. She 
stumbled while retreating for a Capriati lob and then collapsed along the 
baseline. 
After a trainer examined the injury, Fendick decided she couldn't continue and 
left the court with a bandage wrapped around her knee.
