FT  29 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poll is not a blow to Labour
Sir, The recent Newsnight/NOP poll was reported by you with the headline
'Blow for Labour in economy poll' (September 27).
Polling is not a precise science. Like gazing at tea leaves, much is left to
interpretation. The NOP poll reveals, for example, that 57 per cent of the
sample believe that personal taxes would either stay the same or go down
under a Labour government.
The poll shows that 63 per cent believe that the economy will be either
stronger, or about the same.
There is no room for complacency in the Labour camp, of course, but this
evidence was collated after the long summer parliamentary recess, before
Labour's conference, and only a few weeks after Tony Blair's election as
leader.
It is slightly unfair to report 'a blow' to Labour's economic credibility
when there has been no public platform as yet for Mr Blair's new approach.
As Labour's team begins to tackle the key issues of taxes and spending, the
NOP poll shows that Labour is starting from a credible base.
After all, even in 1992 Labour gained support from some unlikely quarters.
