FT  19 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee still on roller-coaster -
Market Report
Coffee futures trading continued its roller-coaster course in London and New
York yesterday as nervous traders betrayed their uncertainty about which way
the market is heading.
Robusta futures in London surged by Dollars 272 to a day's peak of Dollars
3,760 following strong gains in late trading in New York on Monday. But New
York lost its nerve yesterday, leaving the January contract in London still
up Dollars 177 on the day at Dollars 3,665 a tonne, but close to the day's
low of Dollars 3,660.
'It was purely speculative buying,' said one trader. 'The funds had gone
short and they were forced to cover on the back of the potential problems
caused by the drought in Brazil.'
The London market initially fell sharply on Monday following reports of
light rainfall in coffee-growing regions of Brazil. This was seen as
relieving the drought, which is expected to exacerbate next year's coffee
shortfall caused by two severe frosts in June and July. However, a report
from an independent US weather forecaster saying the drought was worse than
the last serious one in 1985 helped to fuel the rebound in New York and
London.
'It's a very, very nervous market,' said the trader. 'Nobody can put a firm
figure on what the crop will be.'
In afternoon trading in New York, second position arabica futures were down
5.05 cents yesterday at 203 cents a pound.
On the London Metal Exchange copper prices recovered from Monday's fall and
traders said there was still good support at Dollars 2,480 a tonne, Reuter
reports.
Three-month copper went to Dollars 2,490 before easing back to close up
Dollars 12 at Dollars 2,488.50.
A further 23,000 tonnes fall in aluminium stocks helped lift the price but
resistance held at Dollars 1,740 a tonne. Aluminium closed up Dollars 16.75
at Dollars 1,732.25.
