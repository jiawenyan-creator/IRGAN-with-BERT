  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Feb 22 (AFP) -- The UN came "very, 
very close" to ordering air power against warring parties in 
Bosnia Tuesday [22 February] after five UN soldiers were wounded 
when a mortar shell struck their tank, a senior UNPROFOR 
official said here. 
  General Jean Cot, commander of the United Nations Protection 
Force in ex-Yugoslavia, told journalists that "it is only 
because there was no absolute means of determining the origin of 
the shell that it was not possible to use the (North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation) air force." 
  An official at UNPROFOR headquarters here told AFP that "we 
came very, very close to using air power." [passage omitted]
