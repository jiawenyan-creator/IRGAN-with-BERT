  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Home Affairs Minister 
Choe Hyong-u volunteered Saturday to clarify the background on 
the appointment of Pak Chung-pae, director-general of the 
Ministry's local administration bureau, as governor of South 
Chungchong Province. 
  Choe told a press conference that Pak was appointed after 
three opinion polls were conducted of provincial government 
officials and "young people," most of whom supported Pak. 
  "Pak, who is only a second grade government official, was 
selected as we believe that it is only right to appoint the 
governor the local people want," Choe said. 
  Some eyebrows were raised over Pak's appointment because of 
his rank. He replaces Pak Tae-kwon, one of President Kim 
Yong-sam's close associates, who resigned amid charges of 
illegal electioneering before the legal campaign period started. 
  "The new governor is a South Chungchong man who was born 
there and worked as a local government official for more than 20 
years," Choe said. "He is second to none in his qualifications 
and ability." 
  Pak lagged behind in receiving a promotion because he had 
"no 
background (supporters)," Choe said, praising President Kim for 
selecting an able man for the post. 
  The government will continue to appoint low-ranking 
officials 
to high positions if they have the ability, Choe said. 
  Meanwhile, for the first time in administrative history, the 
government has named a woman mayor and chief of a city ward (ku). 
  Mrs. Chon Chae-hui, director-general of the Labor Ministry's 
vocational training bureau was appointed mayor of Kwanmyong 
city, Kyonggi Province. Mrs. Yi Hyon-hui, director-general of 
the Taegu city government's welfare bureau, was named chief of 
Taegu's South ward.
