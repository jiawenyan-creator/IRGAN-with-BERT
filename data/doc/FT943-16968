FT  01 JUL 94 / Observer: There's the rub
Guess where the National Union of Mineworkers is holding its annual
conference this weekend? No, not Scarborough, Eastbourne or even Jersey.
Arthur Scargill will rally what's left of his union in Blackpool's Miners'
Convalescence Home. But the agenda's familiar enough, including a motion for
a Pounds 90 a week across-the-board pay rise and the threat of strike action
if they don't get it. They will also be discussing Angola etc. No wonder the
NUM has shrunk from nearly 200,000 members in 1985 to fewer than 10,000. The
physiotherapists' union has more members.
