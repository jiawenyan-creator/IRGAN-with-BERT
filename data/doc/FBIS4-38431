  [Text] Head of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee 
Sergey Glazyev has accused the Russian government of losing 
control and of inefficiency. 
  At a news conference in Moscow on Monday, he said the 
economic situation was worse than predicted by the president's 
market research and forecast center earlier this year. Glazyev 
described as catastrophic the situation in research-intensive 
sectors and in the chemical, light and farm equipment 
manufacturing industries where the fall in production, he said, 
would run at 70-90 percent by the end of this year. 
  Although he described Yeltsin's package of economic decrees 
as "a rather serious step" to try to implement the president's 
own policy outlined in a message to the Federal Assembly, 
Glazyev said the reforms could not be shoved on by decrees alone 
amid government passivity and inaction. In his view, some of 
the decrees are not thought-out well enough, not to mention the 
lack of a mechanism for implementing them. 
  Glazyev accused the government of procrastination in 
drafting 
a Yeltsin-promised package of 50 economic bills. 
  The parliamentary official unveiled his own program of 
economic policy guidelines. Among other things, these provide 
for a 10-12 percent value added tax, 20 percent tax on the 
export of capital, 3 percent tax on securities and property 
deals, increasing the range of products falling under excise 
duties, phasing out export tariffs and introduction of an 
environmental tax. 
  On foreign trade, the program envisages improved export and 
currency regulations by the registration of exports of strategic 
commodities and commercial bank representatives as well as the 
return to a state monopoly on oil and gas exports, precious 
metals and stones. 
  It also proposes to kick-start the mechanism of tenders for 
foreign credits as a way of creating an effective economic 
security system.
