 

As a general matter, the Commission believes that the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively
permits the sharing of information between an exchange proposing to list an equity option and the exchange trading
the stock underlying the equity option is necessary to detect and deter market manipulation and other trading abuses.
In particular, the Commission notes that surveillance sharing agreements provide an important deterrent to manipulation
because they facilitate the availability of information needed to fully investigate a potential manipulation if
it were to occur. These agreements are especially important in the context of derivative products based on foreign
securities because they facilitate the collection of necessary regulatory, surveillance and other information
from foreign jurisdictions.
In the context of ADRs, the Commission believes that, in most cases, the relevant underlying equity market is the primary
market on which the security underlying the ADR trades. This is because, in most cases, the market for the security
underlying the ADR generally is larger in comparison to the ADR market, both in terms of share volume and the value of
trading. Because of the additional leverage provided by an option on an ADR, the Commission generally believes that
having a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement in place, between the exchange where the ADR option trades
and the exchange where the foreign security underlying the ADR primarily trades, will ensure the integrity of the
marketplace.

 The Commission further believes that the ability to obtain relevant surveillance information, including, among
other things, the identity of the ultimate purchasers and sellers of securities, is an essential and necessary component
of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement.

See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26653 (March 21, 1989), 54 FR 12705 (order approving the trading of options
on the International Market Index (``IMI''), an index comprised of ADRs traded in the United States based on foreign
securities). In this approval order, the Commission specifically required that there be comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreements in place between the Amex and the foreign exchanges on which the securities underlying the ADRs
trade so that a substantial percentage of the Index was covered by comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements.

Under the current proposal, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit the listing of options on an ADR
without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the foreign market where the underlying
security traded, as long as the U.S. market for the underlying ADRs is at least as large as the market for the underlying
foreign security. Specifically, the proposed listing standards require that 50% or more of the world-wide trading
volume in the underlying foreign security occur in the U.S. ADR market, which consists of the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE,
the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx. The proposal further requires that for the continued trading
of the ADR options the percentage of the world-wide trading volume occurring in the U.S. ADR market must not fall below
30%. The Commission believes these standards will ensure that the relevant pricing market for the options on ADRs
is the U.S. ADR market rather than the foreign market where the security underlying the ADR trades.
Moreoever, the Commission believes that the proposed method for determining whether the trading volume in the U.S.
ADR market meets the required percentages is adequate to ensure that the U.S. ADR market is and continues to be the price
discovery market for the foreign security underlying the ADR option. Specifically, the Amex has represented that
it will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security,
and other related securities which can affect the pricing of the underlying foreign security.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 To list an ADR option without the existence of a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement, the proposal requires
the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market,
to be not less than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for all classes of the issuer's stock and all ADRs that
overlie any of these classes.

In summary, the Commission believes that in cases where a substantial percentage of the world-wide trading volume
for the underlying ADR, the underlying foreign security, and other securities relevant to the pricing of these securities
occurs in the U.S. ADR market,
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 the U.S. ADR market operates as the price discovery market for the foreign securities (i.e.

, stocks and ADRs) underlying the ADR options. In these cases, the Commission believes that the U.S. ADR market is the
instrumental market for purposes of deterring and detecting potential manipulation or other abusive trading strategies
in conjunction with transactions in the overlying ADR options market. Therefore, because the Amex, and all the other
U.S. self-regulatory agencies which make up the U.S. ADR market are members of the ISG, the Commission believes that
there is an effective surveillance sharing arrangement to permit the exchanges and the NASD to adequately investigate
any potential manipulations of the ADR options or their underlying securities.

We note that it is appropriate to view the U.S. ADR market as a single market even though it is made up of several national
securities exchanges and the NASD. The Commission notes that all of the markets on which or through which these ADRs
could trade are linked together by ITS. The Commission further notes that one market, the NYSE, typically operates
as the primary exchange on which trades in U.S. ADRs are executed.
