FT  24 SEP 93 / Ports 'boosted' by policy on labour
BRITAIN'S ports have grown more productive and competitive since the
government's abolition of the registered dock labour scheme four years ago,
says a report published yesterday by the Department of Employment.
But it adds that the adverse economic climate since 1989 had 'prevented
former scheme ports from realising all the benefits of abolition'.
It argues: 'Many predicted wider benefits of abolition have yet to be
fulfilled.
'But abolition has created the conditions for viable port-related
investment, and will enable other developments to take place as the economic
recovery continues'.
However, an increase in the number of reported accidents per employee is
reported in the ex-scheme ports, along with a decline in training.
Improved productivity has not led to a reduction in the prices to port users
but has increased the profit margins of port employers. While there has been
some port-related investment since abolition of the registered ports, this
has 'been limited by over-capacity in the industry' as well as the
recession.
The report adds that abolition has 'not yet had a significant impact upon
the level of non-port-related investment activity within the estates of the
ex-scheme ports'.
Lord Caithness, shipping minister, welcomed the study. 'Abolition has
brought the substantially improved productivity and quality of service we
predicted,' he said. The study was carried out by two independent
consultancies - Peida and MDS Transmodel.
