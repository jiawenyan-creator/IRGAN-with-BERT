FT  24 MAR 94 / Cradock attacks policies of Hong Kong Governor Patten
In London Sir Percy Cradock, Britain's former chief negotiator on Hong Kong,
yesterday attacked the policies of the present governor, Mr Chris Patten, in
even more personal terms than those he used to the House of Commons foreign
affairs committee last December, Edward Mortimer reports.
In a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs Sir Percy
recalled the phrase 'double whammy', used of Labour's tax policies by Mr
Patten when he was chairman of the Conservative party, and said that what
Britain had achieved in Hong Kong was 'quite a notable example'. Official
policy, he said, had an 'Alice in Wonderland' quality: 'All those who speak
up for democracy will have ended up by damaging it, and in the process will
have antagonised a rising superpower'.
Sir Percy also accused Mr Patten of putting undue pressure on LegCo, the
colony's legislative council, to adopt his proposals for the 1995 elections.
The people of Hong Kong, he claimed, were being 'pushed forward into a kind
of confrontation which I don't think they want'. He urged that LegCo be
allowed 'a whip-free vote', but alleged that 'in fact what has happened has
not been that. All the resources of Government House are being used to push
it through, including the placemen, the appointed members. They are being
asked to move forward like the troops of the Light Brigade.' In any case,
Sir Percy added, LegCo should not be the final arbiter. 'We remain
responsible until 1997. It does not lie in our ability to say 'it's very
unfortunate but this is what LegCo wanted'. That won't do.'
