FT  08 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Concerned over AVCs
COULD YOU tell me the relevant income figure to be taken into account when
calculating the maximum pension contribution? I am particularly concerned
about whether to make additional voluntary contributions. I had understood
that the relevant figure was the taxable salary in the final year of
employment. I now hear that it is the gross figure comprising the salary
plus the value of additional benefits such as a company car, health
insurance, and any other allowances paid by the employer.
The taxable value of your benefits in kind, such as company car and Bupa
premiums paid by your employer, can be added to your salary for the purposes
of calculating your pensionable remuneration. You mention the final year of
employment. There are many situations where fluctuating earnings, or the
level of salary, require pensionable remuneration to be based on the average
of the best three consecutive years in the last 13, but with the allowance
for each year's remuneration to be uplifted between the year it was received
and the date of retirement in line with increases in the retail price index
during the same period.
