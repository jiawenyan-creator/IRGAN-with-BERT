FT  07 SEP 94 / Scargill urges move back to the 1970s
The TUC congress came alive for a few minutes yesterday when Mr Arthur
Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, mounted the
rostrum and called for the trade union movement to go 'back to the 1970s'.
During an impassioned speech supporting an NUM motion urging the repeal of
all Conservative trade union legislation since 1979, Mr Scargill called on
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, to 'stop waffling' and to give his
'unequivocal support' to the striking signal workers.
Last night the Labour leader - in Blackpool dining with the TUC general
council - said he would make it clear to union leaders that while they could
not expect any special access to a future Labour government, they would get
'fairness'. He added that the unions themselves were asking only for
fairness.
Mr Scargill used the debate on union legislation to attack his colleagues on
the general council for failing to call for action to stop mine closures.
He argued that industrial action against the law was an effective trade
union movement policy.
'We didn't get rid of the Industrial Relations Act by simply passing
resolutions that have a degree of anonymity,' he said.
He reminded the conference that the movement had been prepared to strike
against the law when it took action in 1972 to free a group of imprisoned
dockworkers who became known as the Pentonville Five.
With some nostalgia he recalled the days when TUC delegates could not move
for photographers and international media. Today, he said, 'we have been
marginalised, not by the Tories, but by our own unwillingness and inability
to fight back'.
He added: 'I'd love to go back to the 1970s.'
However, the general council election results showed a short while later
that, in spite of attracting warm applause, Mr Scargill was eighth in the
poll - the first seven were elected.
