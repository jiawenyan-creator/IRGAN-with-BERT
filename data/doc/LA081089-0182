BRIEFLY 
Bumper Crops Expected: The first reliable estimate of the size of this year's 
harvest, to be released today by the Agriculture Department, is expected to 
project a bumper corn, soybean and wheat crop. Officials expect a big jump in 
output from last year's drought-hit levels because of better weather in key 
Midwestern states. The report is expected to project soybean production at 1.90 
billion to 2.01 billion bushels, corn at 7.29 billion to 7.76 billion bushels 
and wheat no lower than 1.95 billion bushels.
