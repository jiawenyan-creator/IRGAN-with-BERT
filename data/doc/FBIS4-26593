"Deng Xiaoping Recently Visited Qingdao, Mentioned Three Major 
Problems in China's Development"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Jun (WEN WEI PO) -- Authoritative 
persons here disclosed that not long ago, accompanied by Central 
Military Commission Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing, former CPC leader 
Deng Xiaoping toured Qingdao, Shandong. 
  Mentioning fundamental problems regarding the country's 
development, Deng Xiaoping said that it is necessary to pay 
attention to and stick to three points: First, except when an 
inevitable large-scale war breaks out, the principle of taking 
economic development as the center must absolutely never be 
changed, the policy of reform and opening up must absolutely 
never be changed, and the party's basic line must not be shaken 
for one hundred years to come. Second, it is necessary to sum 
up the lesson of the former Soviet Union, and it is necessary to 
properly handle the relationship between the center and 
localities. Third, it is necessary to stick to the CPC's 
leadership and the CPC's ruling status must never be shaken. 
China must not pursue a multiparty system. 
  It is learned that Deng Xiaoping's above views have already 
been relayed to central high-ranking personalities.
