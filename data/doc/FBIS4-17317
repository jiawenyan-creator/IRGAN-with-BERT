of Illness and Suffering"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- An international congress on "the World 
After Chernobyl" has opened in Minsk; it will sum up the latest 
scientific data from the countries afflicted by the catastrophe 
and will discuss tactics for overcoming its consequences. 
  The congress, which has attracted representatives from more 
than 20 countries of the CIS and beyond, will give priority 
attention to the situation in Belorussia [Belarus], which 
suffered most as a result of the explosion at the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Electric Power Station. Almost 1.9 million people live 
in the contaminated regions today -- virtually one in five of 
the Republic's inhabitants; the incidence of dangerous illnesses 
is constantly increasing.
