  [Text] Based on the micro-structural feature of 
single-crystal Ni-base superalloy, two micro-models have been 
proposed to calculate and analyze its thermal misfit, especially 
the critical resolved shear stress of the two-phase superalloys. 
The results show that the macro-critical resolved shear stress 
can be obtained by the finite-element method which takes thermal 
misfit into consideration, and the method can be used to analyze 
further the superalloys with high _g_' volume. The effect of 
thermal misfit on change of _g_' on tempering condition, and 
the 
primary quantitative result shows that the thermal misfit stress 
is one of the main driving forces on _g_' coarsening.
