FT  18 SEP 93 / Major discusses Paisley plan
A DELEGATION of the Democratic Unionist party from Northern Ireland, led by
the Rev Ian Paisley MP, met Mr John Major, the prime minister, at Downing
Street yesterday to discuss the DUP's latest proposals on the future
administration of the province.
These are contained in a DUP document - Breaking the Logjam - which was
announced earlier this week, although no details have been made public.
There have been stirrings of hope that the proposals might open the way for
renewed round-table talks in Northern Ireland between the main
constitutional parties, after the collapse of talks last November without
any agreement on new constitutional arrangements. Mr Major told Mr Paisley
that he and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, would study the
document.
Both the British and Irish governments last week re-affirmed their
commitment to restart the talks process if they could persuade the
participants to meet again.
It is thought unlikely that the DUP will retreat from its position that it
will not return to the negotiating table unless the Irish Republic drops its
claim to Northern Ireland.
Mr William McCrea, DUP MP for Mid-Ulster, said there could be no dialogue
with Dublin as long as Articles Two and Three - on territorial claims -
remained in place.
The party has since added a further pre-condition that Mr John Hume, the
SDLP leader, must first terminate his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader
of Sinn Fein.
Mr Hume met Mr Major on Thursday. He told the prime minister that the SDLP
was prepared to return to the negotiating table provided there were no
pre-conditions.
