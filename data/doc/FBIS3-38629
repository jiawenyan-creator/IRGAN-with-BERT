  [Excerpt] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special 
coordinator on Cyprus, had a new meeting with President Glavkos 
Kliridhis this afternoon. The meeting was attended by Finance 
Minister Faidhros Oikonomidhis, who was acting foreign minister, 
and U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher. Speaking afterward, 
Oikonomidhis said that Lamb briefed the president on his 
meetings in the occupied areas with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas. Lamb described his meeting with President Kliridhis as 
constructive but refrained from responding to correspondents' 
questions. Lamb will have another meeting with Denktas.
