EARNINGS 
20th Century Industries: The Woodland Hills-based auto and home insurer said 
its second-quarter profit fell 11% from a year earlier to $14.4 million. 20th 
Century said the drop reflected its estimate of the impact of Proposition 103 
on its results since state Insurance Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie has 
called for the firm to roll back its premiums by $14 million. 20th Century 
plans to contest the proposal.
