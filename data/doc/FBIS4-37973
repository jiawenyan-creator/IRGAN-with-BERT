<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemeni </F>
minister of planning and development, by Shakir al-Jawhari, in 
Sanaa; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Jawhari] You set a 
condition according to which you rejected 'Ali Salim al-Bid's 
participation in dialogue. You also announced a list of 16 
names with whom dialogue is banned. 
  [Al-Iryani] I am sure that if the other party accepted to 
hold a dialogue as part of the Security Council 
resolution--which stresses Yemen's unity, sovereignty, and 
independence--and also if we faced only the obstacle of banning 
such a dialogue with al-Bid and his group, it would have been 
possible to discuss--and I am not saying to surmount--this 
obstacle. However, this obstacle was preceded by a yet more 
serious obstacle; namely, the other party is not concerned about 
the 16-man list or other lists; it wants to hold a dialogue with 
us in the name of the imaginary Democratic Republic of Yemen. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you mean that you are ready to retreat from 
the decision banning dialogue with al-Bid and the 16 people on 
the list? 
  [Al-Iryani] Only after we remove the insurmountable 
obstacle, represented by the other party's rejection of the one 
state and one people. 
  [Al-Jawhari] You thus link your retreat from the decision 
banning dealings with al-Bid and his group to their retreat from 
the secession decision. 
  [Al-Iryani] Exactly. However, I do not have the right to 
determine this matter because it has a legal aspect. But I 
believe that if they retreat from the secession decision this 
issue can be debated. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] In light of the outcome of Presidential Council 
member 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani's visit to Beijing, do you 
expect China to veto a new UN Security Council resolution 
against Yemen? 
  [Al-Iryani] The visit showed China's response to, sympathy 
with, and support for Yemeni unity. There is no state which 
says it will use the veto. The decision to use the veto does 
not only depend on the relationship between two states. Such a 
decision is made as part of the rules and principles on which 
the UN Charter is based. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Are you saying that you are ready to hold a 
dialogue with al-Bid again if he retreats from the secession 
decision? 
  [Al-Iryani] Not exactly. I am saying that the condemned 16 
persons are not the obstacle, and that a dialogue with them will 
not be the main problem. The main problem is represented by the 
fact that the secessionists, whether condemned or not, insist on 
holding a dialogue between two states. 
  [Al-Jawhari] In any case, do you not believe that your 
"veto" against a-Bid and the 16-man list ... 
  [Al-Iryani, interrupting] Naturally, as part of the Yemeni 
laws and Constitution, our decision was a "veto" against them. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you not believe that this "veto" was hasty 
and that it contributed to creating an atmosphere in favor of 
declaring the secession? 
  [Al-Iryani] Brother, they have been considering secession 
since 1992. 
  [Al-Jawhari] But your positions helped materialize this idea 
into a decision. 
  [Al-Iryani] I swear by God that we helped or appeased them 
for the homeland's sake. The homeland, however, means nothing 
to them. 
  [Al-Jawhari] You now agree to expand the military committee 
and reject their demand to bring in international observers. 
What is the difference between the two? 
  [Al-Iryani] The military committee, which we proposed to 
expand, is the result of a sovereign Yemeni decision. The 
international observers will come by a UN Security Council 
decision that is outside the Yemeni legitimacy and we reject 
this. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you fear the results? Do you doubt the 
intentions of the Security Council or the parties that stand 
behind its resolutions? 
  [Al-Iryani] We doubt the intentions of these parties and not 
the Security Council. The parties that seek to have a fresh 
resolution at the Security Council, especially concerning 
international observers, have an illegitimate aim which they are 
trying to realize through legitimate resolutions. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do the Americans or the Europeans support the 
idea of international observers? 
  [Al-Iryani] No. If you read Pelletreau's remarks several 
days 
ago, you will notice that he said: "I do not think that the 
United Nations is the suitable place for adopting a decision on 
sending observers, we hope that this will be done within an Arab 
or Islamic framework." If this is a firm U.S. attitude, this 
means that there is no justification for the United Nations to 
be a party to this issue. 
  [Al-Jawhari] By the way, to what extent do you trust the 
firmness of the U.S. stand? 
  [Al-Iryani] We deal with things as they appear to us because 
only God knows what is inside the minds. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Have you noticed that the U.S. stand has 
undergone some change in recent weeks? 
  [Al-Iryani] No. The U.S. attitude has been firm from the 
first day of the struggle. It has not changed. 
  [Al-Jawhari] While Sanaa radio says that the United States 
supports unity, Aden radio says that the United States supports 
their demand to stop the fighting and provide protection for 
them. What do you say to that? 
  [Al-Iryani] The U.S. attitude clearly demanded an end to the 
war from the first day. Pelletreau was in Sanaa the day the war 
began, the day the secessionists began the war. He made a 
statement at Sanaa airport and has not changed it so far. 
Americans and non- Americans alike are demanding an end to the 
fighting to protect civilians and not to protect the 
secessionists. This is well known and there is nothing new in 
this regard. 
  [Al-Jawhari] What made you promise the United States not to 
enter Aden? Why did not you promise that you will not enter 
al-Mukalla, for insistence? 
  [Al-Iryani] No, no. Aden is currently taking the limelight 
and everyone talks to us about Aden and not al-Mukalla despite 
the fact that we regard the people of Aden and al-Mukalla to be 
our people. In any case, this does not mean that Aden is 
protected and al-Mukalla is open to attack. For us, the stand 
on the two cities is the same but we do not know why the 
international community's interest is concentrated on Aden. For 
us, Aden and al-Mukalla are the same and we hope that we will 
enter them without fighting. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Don't you believe that the interest in Aden is 
the result of intentions to recognize it as the capital of the 
state that has been announced in the south? 
  [Al-Iryani] I do not rule this out in regard to those who 
support secession. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you rule it out in regard to the Americans? 
  [Al-Iryani] So far I have no indications that the Americans 
have such intentions and therefore, I would tend to consider 
this to be a remote possibility rather than a probability. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] Before the establishment of unity, you 
received a green light from Washington during the president's 
January 1990 visit to the United States. The U.S. support for 
unity at that time was due to the U.S. conviction that Yemeni 
unity would contribute to realizing stability in the region. Do 
you think that the unity no longer realizes the required 
stability necessary for U.S. interests? 
  [Al-Iryani] I do not think that any right-thinking person 
would venture to say that unity would not lead to stability. 
Any right-thinking man will definitely reject the notion that 
partition would lead to stability. 
  [Al-Jawhari] The question is not exactly like this. Within 
the unity framework, especially after the parliamentary 
election, It was hoped that Yemeni democracy would contribute 
toward containing the Islamists, as happened in Jordan. But 
what happened was that the Islamists' entry into the government 
was represented by the most extremist side; namely, Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, as member of the Presidential Council. 
This man is accused worldwide of being behind terrorist 
operations, whether in Jordan or in Egypt. A Jordanian paper 
said that some of the elements that carried out bombings earlier 
this year received training in a Yemeni camp belonging to 
al-Zindani, who met with the terrorists personally and sent them 
to the training camp? 
  [Al-Iryani] First, I believe that there is no definite proof 
that the reports you cite about al-Zindani are true. 
  In any case, this is your side of the story. I do not 
approve of what you say about Shaykh al-Zindani. Anyway, unity 
safeguards Yemen against any extremism, whether it comes from 
the right or the left. Unity is the safety valve against 
extremism. Those who seek to partition Yemen will not succeed 
in preventing the emergence of extremist movements under the 
canopy of partitioning. But, under unity and democracy, 
extremists will become moderates. I am sure of this. 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you not believe that the post-war era will 
compel you to realign your local, regional, and international 
alliances and to reassure the countries concerned that Yemen 
will not become another Iran or Sudan in the region? 
  [Al-Iryani] I do not want to go into details I do not know. 
I only want to tell you that Yemen offered endless reassurances 
to its first neighbor. However, these reassurances, 
unfortunately, did not stop the wheel that was already spinning. 
  Yemen does not need to reassure others because it has never 
been a source of danger to anyone. This is in the past and the 
present. As for reassurances for the future, these can be 
guaranteed only under the canopy of unity and democracy. Also, 
we do not need to reassure people because we never scared them. 
You expect reassurances from those who scared you in the past. 
We did not scare anybody. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Jawhari] Do you not believe that if you prosecute Tariq 
al- Fadli now, this could be the best reassurance to neighbor 
countries that you will not encourage fundamentalism? 
  [Al-Iryani] If I were a judge, I would set al-Fadli free 
because the crimes the secessionists have committed are much 
more serious. 
  [Al-Jawhari] This is not a legal precept but a political 
one. 
Under the law, no criminal can be excused because another 
defendant must be put to trial. 
  [Al-Iryani] Al-Fadli was not arrested red-handed. He is only 
accused of instigation, and this too has not been corroborated. 
  [Al-Jawhari] This is because he has not been tried. The 
courts only sentence or acquit people. 
  [Al-Iryani] But what if the authorities themselves resort to 
terrorism as one of their duties, then they deserve to be 
trampled by 20 elephants.
