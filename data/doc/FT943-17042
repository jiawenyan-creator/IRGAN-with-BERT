FT  01 JUL 94 / Mayhew assurance on north-south body
Any joint administrative body proposed by the British and Irish governments
would be accountable to democratic institutions in Belfast and Dublin, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons yesterday.
He insisted that there was no truth in suggestions that the British and
Irish governments aimed to run the affairs of Northern Ireland jointly 'over
the heads of the people'.
Sir Patrick's assurances were challenged by Mr David Trimble of the Ulster
Unionists and brushed aside by the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic
Ulster Unionists.
Mr Paisley also rejected a fresh appeal that he should join with leaders of
the other constitutional parties in the talks aimed at achieving a political
settlement involving the Dublin government.
Sir Patrick said that the role of the north-south body which had been
discussed would enable common cause to be made in areas of common interest.
