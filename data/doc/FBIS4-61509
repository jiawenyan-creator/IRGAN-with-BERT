  [Test] Moscow, 5 May -- The Russian side again urgently 
appeals for the provisional government in Rwanda, the army 
command, and the Rwandan Patriotic Front to display 
responsibility for the fate of their country and security in the 
region, and to cease firing immediately and return to the 
negotiating table to begin implementing the Arusha agreements. 
This appeal was made today at a briefing by Director of the 
Press and Information Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry 
Grigoriy Karasin. 
  At the current time, he said, Russia is looking at the 
possibility of assisting with humanitarian aid to the suffering 
inhabitants of Rwanda.
