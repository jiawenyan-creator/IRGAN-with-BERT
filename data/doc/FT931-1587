FT  24 MAR 93 / Councils bank on Tour de France
TWO STAGES of the Tour de France, the world's greatest cycle race, will be
held in Britain in July next year.
Le Tour en Angleterre, as it is being called, will start from Dover on July
6 for a 201km (125-mile) run through Kent and East Sussex to Brighton. The
next day the cyclists will race for 193km through Hampshire, starting and
ending in Portsmouth.
The three county councils and various district and city councils on the
route are paying at least Pounds 500,000 between them to stage the event.
Mr Alan Rushton, the managing director of Sport for Television, which
conducted negotiations on behalf of the event, said Berlin paid Pounds 1.2m
for a visit in 1987, Luxembourg paid Pounds 1m last year, while the average
fee for a start or finish in a French city is Pounds 600,000.
Mr David Knight, head of leisure at Portsmouth City Council, said yesterday
the event 'has all the ingredients to be the largest tourist attraction of
1994 in the UK. It attracts 960m television viewers in 120 countries.'
Mr Brian Daley, leisure officer at Havant, near Portsmouth, said: 'Hotels
within 50 miles of the route are usually booked up. The event will be
outside the main tourist season and we anticipate that the average spend of
visitors will be higher.'
