U.S. soldiers detained 29 Panamanians who entered a restricted military area 
and released them after confiscating their weapons, a spokeswoman for the U.S. 
Southern Command in Panama reported. She said that among those briefly detained 
were 10 officers and soldiers of the Panamanian Defense Forces, including Maj. 
Manuel Sieiro, brother-in-law of Panama strongman Manuel A. Noriega. Five 
Panamanian journalists were among the civilians in the group, the spokeswoman 
added. About 40 U.S. Marines were conducting "a reconnaissance exercise on 
roads" leading to the Panama Canal when the Panamanians entered the area in 15 
vehicles. A number of submachine guns, rifles and pistols were confiscated, the 
spokeswoman said.
