  [Text] Al-SHA'B has learned that the U.S. Administration 
has conveyed a memorandum to some regional Arab countries 
containing the details of a U.S. plan that aims to exterminate 
Islamic fundamentalists this year. According to the memorandum, 
the step will be coordinated between the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency (C.I.A) [abbreviation in English] and the 
security services in these Arab countries. 
  The memorandum stressed that the cycle of fundamentalist 
terrorism has started to threaten particular regimes. It called 
for increasing financial aid by 30 percent to confront terrorism 
in the region. The U.S. plan calls for the following: 
  1. Signing a security agreement between the Arab countries 
and the United States on confronting religious terrorism; 
  2. Letting U.S. intelligence teams stay in the Arab 
countries permanently to survey the activities of the terrorist 
fundamentalists; 
  3. Intensifying punishment of detained terrorists; 
  4. Cornering [muhasarat] those states that support and 
harbor terrorist fundamentalists politically and economically. 
This is a reference to Sudan and Iran; 
  5. Expressing U.S. readiness to earmark part of its economic 
and military aid, granted to particular countries in the region, 
for confronting fundamentalist terrorism; and 
  6. Taking joint Arab-U.S. steps to establish a joint 
security committee that will cooperate with the U.S. 
intelligence service to curb and wipe out terrorism.
