IBM, DIEBOLD TO MERGE SERVICES 
IBM and Diebold Inc. said today they will combine their automated teller 
machine operations and market the products worldwide under a joint venture. 
Under the agreement, the joint venture company and Diebold will market the 
combined ATM product lines of the two companies in the United States, with 
assistance from IBM. 
IBM will market the lines abroad. 
No dollar value was placed on the deal. 
The joint-venture company will develop new automated teller machines and other 
self-service banking equipment, the companies said in a joint statement. 
Diebold, based in Canton, Ohio, shipped about 12% of ATMs sold last year 
worldwide, said spokeswoman Mary Ann Jackson. The company also is a major maker 
of corporate security systems. 
International Business Machines Corp., based in Armonk, N.Y., is a significant 
player in the ATM market as well as the world's largest computer company.
