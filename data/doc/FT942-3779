FT  13 JUN 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news
Monday: A busy week for UK economic statistics kicks off with May producer
prices. Annual rates of growth have been subdued but there were signs in
April that the surge in world commodity prices was showing up in
manufacturers' costs.
Tuesday: The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey
will give the week's first clue to the strength of the retail sector in May.
Analysts will be looking to see if April's tax rises have affected consumer
behaviour.
Wednesday: A cornucopia of economic information. Inflation in May is
expected to be subdued, with the underlying annual rate stuck at 2.3 per
cent and the headline rate set to fall slighly to 2.5 per cent. Analysts
think unemployment will fall by a further 25,000 in May. But a key focus for
the markets will be average earnings, the annual growth rate of which has
recently accelerated from 3 to 4 per cent.
Thursday: Official retail sales figures for May are expected to show a small
increase in the annual rate of growth, from 4.4 to 4.5 per cent. May's
public sector borrowing requirement is forecast to have been Pounds 4.1bn.
