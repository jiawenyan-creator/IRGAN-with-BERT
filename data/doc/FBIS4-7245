  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- North Korean letters 
addressed to the South Korean Government and parliamentary 
leaders urging a grand national rally have arrived in Seoul via 
a third country, the National Unification Board said Wednesday. 
  A set of 38 letters, forwarded to high-profile figures like 
House Speaker Yi Man-sop, opposition leader Yi Ki-taek and 
outgoing Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, insisted that the two 
sides hold a unified rally on Aug. 15 in Seoul or in Pyongyang. 
  The rally should discuss "great leader" Kim Il-song's 
10-point declaration for national reunification and unity 
proposed a year ago, the letters said. 
  North Korea had tried to deliver the letters directly to the 
South on April 11, but the Seoul government refused to accept 
them. 
  The board said it will not send the letters to each 
addressee 
and instead put them on public view.
