ORANGE COUNTY 1991 RESOLUTIONS; 
MSGR. JAIME SOTO 
I resolve to celebrate Mass and hear confessions at the central jail once a 
month during 1991. 
I resolve to make a difference in the effort against gangs and drugs in the 
county. I resolve to help Hispanic families meet the challenges of sharing 
their faith and culture with their children. I resolve to continue working with 
voluntary and public leadership to build an Orange County that cares for the 
least among us.
