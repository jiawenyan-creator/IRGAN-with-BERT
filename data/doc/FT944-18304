FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Baxter sells diagnostics side
Baxter International, the Illinois-based hospital supplies group which
plunged into losses last year after a Dollars 925m restructuring, has agreed
to the sale of its diagnostics business for Dollars 448m.
The business had been put up for sale last November as part of a move by
Baxter to reduce borrowings and concentrate its investment in biotechnology
and renal therapy, and to develop its non-US operations.
The company said it had reached agreement to sell the business to Bain
Capital, a Boston-based buy-out firm. Some Dollars 40m of the consideration
will be in the form of preferred stock, with the remainder in cash and
accounts receivable retained by Baxter.
Baxter said that the sale would further reduce its debt levels, and that its
ratio of debt to total capital would be 'in the low 40 per cent range' by
the end of this year, compared with 50 per cent at the end of 1993.
The company's shares closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 28 in New York.
They have recovered almost Dollars 8 from the trough they hit a year ago,
when Baxter was rocked by a temporary US government ban on accepting bids
from the company, as well as an admission by Baxter that it had broken US
law by co-operating with an Arab boycott of Israel.
