Baylor quarterback J.J. Joe will be sidelined for at least the next six weeks 
with a broken thumb, school officials said. 
Joe, who took over as Baylor's starter in the team's game against Texas Tech 
last month, broke the thumb during routine passing drills Wednesday when he hit 
another player's helmet. 
Sophomore Steve Needham will start Saturday against Arkansas.
