<F P=106> [New Year's address by President Islam Karimov; place and </F>
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] All the people seeing out the old year and seeing in 
the New Year have their own problems, worries and experiences 
which are different from others. But I am convinced of one 
thing: All of them are united by the feeling that they wish 
peace and well-being, they wish well to, first, their families, 
children, close friends and relatives, the kray and the land 
they live on, the land which unites us all. 
  We should realize this can be achieved only if we are 
together. Only cooperation and mutual understanding can make 
this possible. We are practically destined for integration. 
  This New Year's Eve night I would like to address all the 
people. I wish to say the following: 
  People: Be vigilant! 
  People: Be happy!
