  [Text] Brazzaville, Jan 20 (AFP) -- A rocket attack damaged 
a police station Thursday [20 January] in the northern Ouenze 
area of Brazzaville, which has been rocked by fighting among 
government supporters, troops and opposition militias. 
  A second rocket attack blew out the windows of a bank in the 
same district, witnesses said. No casualties were reported from 
the attacks and it was unclear who was responsible. 
  In December, a policeman was killed when unidentified gunmen 
opened fire on another police station in the Ouenze district, 
which had hitherto been spared the violence raging largely in 
the south of the Congolese capital. 
  In another incident, a group of opposition militiamen on 
Thursday attacked a street market in the southwestern M'filou 
area, but nobody was hurt, witnesses said. 
  The militia was protesting against the sealing off by 
government troops and presidential guards of Makele-kele and the 
Bacongo district, an opposition stronghold in the south, 
following the disappearance at the weekend of presidential guard 
lieutenant, Jonathan Mabiala. 
  Small arms fire overnight in both these districts was due to 
clashes between militiamen backing President Pascal Lissouba and 
armed opposition forces, a military source said. 
  The guard has accused the private militia of opposition 
leader Bernard Kolelas of seizing Mabiala, but the opposition 
has denied any part in the affair. 
  Since mid-December, clashes in Brazzaville following 
contested elections have left some 115 people dead in the south 
of the city.
