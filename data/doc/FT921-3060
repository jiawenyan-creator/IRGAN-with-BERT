FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Fugro-McClelland in partial
flotation
FUGRO-MCCLELLAND, the Dutch-based group of consultancy engineers, is to
float roughly one-third of its shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange next
month. It wants to raise up to Fl 128m (Dollars 68m) to finance a recent
acquisition in the US and to fuel growth.
The company will offer 3.2m shares to the public, at between Fl 37 and Fl 40
each, with the final price to be announced on March 30.
Trading in the shares will begin on April 7, marking the first company
flotation in Amsterdam so far this year. Of the shares on offer, 1.66m are
existing shares held by several Dutch institutional investors and venture
capital firms. The rest will be newly issued.
Fugro-McClelland, the product of a 1987 merger between Fugro of the
Netherlands and McClelland Engineers of the US, will use part of the
proceeds to repay a Fl 59m loan it took out in 1991 to finance half of its
acquisition of John E. Chance, a US surveying company.
The consultancy group, with annual turnover of Fl 310m and a workforce of
2,200, is active in geo-technical and offshore services, surveying and
environmental consulting. It has more than 100 offices in 30 countries.
