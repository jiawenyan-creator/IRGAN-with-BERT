FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Heineken in Indian venture
ITC, India's biggest manu-facturer of cigarettes, plans to set up an
export-oriented brewery in collaboration with Heineken, the Dutch brewer,
Reuter reports from Calcutta.
Company officials said a team from Heineken would visit Calcutta this month
or early in March to finalise collaboration details. 'We hope to begin work
by the middle of 1994,' one said.
ITC plans to invest Rs1bn (Dollars 39m) in a brewery with annual capacity of
200,000 litres and canning facilities. More than 60 per cent of the
investment will be for the canning plant.
ITC's foray into the beer business has been prompted by a recent
collaboration between Heineken and BAT Industries of the UK, the largest
shareholder in ITC.
ITC is understood to have short-listed locations in the south Indian state
of Andhra Pradesh and the western states of Maharashtra and Goa.
India, with a population of 890m, consumes 40m litres of beer a year.
Spirits are traditionally more popular, but demand for beer is growing by 14
per cent a year as bars modelled on the British 'pub' sprout up across the
industrialised states of Maharashtra and Karnataka.
