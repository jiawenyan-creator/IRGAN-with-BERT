FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Rate cut beyond expectations needed to jump start
economy
Sir, The British Treasury seems to be repeating the errors of the US Federal
Reserve which cost George Bush the US election. Gradual interest rate cuts
based on lagged ex-post indicators of continuing economic sluggishness will
not jump start the economy as they will be perceived as doing too little too
late. For the debt deflation common to both the US and UK requires a
Wicksellian response - with the market rate being pushed well below the
'natural' rate of interest - resulting in an immediate boost to
interest-sensitive spending as the public expects future interest rates to
rise rather than fall.
As no one knows the current natural rate of interest - though a figure of a
2 to 3 per cent real rate would not be historically implausible - the only
sensible short run course is to cut the market rate below the level anyone
expects it to fall (say 3 to 4 per cent). This would leave little doubt that
future interest rates are likely to rise rather than fall - boosting current
spending. As soon as signs of overheating appeared, interest rates would
obviously have to be raised. However, because of 'White September' the
exchange rate need no longer enter into the calculations]
