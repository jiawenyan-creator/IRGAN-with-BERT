  [Text] This is Andjelko Perincic reporting from Zagreb 
airport for Croatian radio. Mate Granic, the deputy prime 
minister and minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of 
Croatia, returned to Zagreb at about 1000 this morning following 
his working visit to Russia. As reported yesterday, he had 
talks in Moscow with Andrey Kozyrev, the Russian minister of 
foreign affairs, and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin, who is also 
President Yeltsin's special envoy for former Yugoslavia. The 
main topic of the talks was the efforts to find solutions to the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia. 
  Speaking about the state of overall Croatian-Russian 
relations following the talks yesterday, Minister Granic said: 
  [Begin recording] As for our bilateral relations, these are 
developing well and it is likely that later this year my 
official visit to the Russian Federation will take place, and 
that the prime ministers will also exchange visits. There is 
also the possibility of a top-level visit by the end of the year. 
  Our talks in Moscow were dominated by two important issues: 
on the one hand Bosnia-Herzegovina and the efforts to involve 
the third side, i.e. the Bosnian Serbs in the negotiations; on 
the other, the completion of the current and the possibility of 
a new, more active mandate for UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
and the normalization of overall Croat-Serb relations. In our 
view the talks were useful, substantive, and open. The talks 
will continue. [end recording]
