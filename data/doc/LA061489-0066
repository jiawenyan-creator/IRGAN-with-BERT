CHILDREN'S INSURANCE PLAN CLEARS PANEL 
Ground-breaking legislation that would give a new tax credit of up to $500 a 
year to low-income working Americans to help them buy health insurance for 
their children was approved by the Senate Finance Committee. Debate on the 
measure may produce sparks -- not only because of the innovative new health tax 
credit, but also because it takes a more modest approach to child care benefits 
than another major Democratic initiative. "I know there is going to be a big 
battle with the ABC bill on the floor," said Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), a 
committee member and the Senate GOP leader. "Maybe we'll end up without any 
child care bill at all." The ABC bill is a measure by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd 
(D-Conn.) that envisions a much more expensive child care program.
