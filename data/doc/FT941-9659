FT  14 FEB 94 / US to renew threat of Indonesia sanctions
The US will this week tell Indonesia it will carry out a threat to impose
sanctions, AP reports from Jakarta.
Washington warned last year that trade privileges might stop unless the
rights of Indonesia's 76m workers were recognised. President Suharto's
government told Washington of its progress last month, but the US Treasury
secretary, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, said during a recent visit to Jakarta that more
must be done.
