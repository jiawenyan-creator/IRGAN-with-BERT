CURRENT PAPERBACKS: POP. 1280 BY JIM THOMPSON (VINTAGE: $8.95) 
Jim Thompson's dark, chilling portrait of a two-bit sheriff in a jerkwater 
Southern town is best known as the source of Bernard Tavernier's film, "Coup de 
Torchon." Beneath his simple, good ol' boy exterior, Nick Corey conceals a 
vicious, calculating mind that enables him to pit his enemies against each 
other and continue eating, drinking, whoring and murdering. 
Thompson is a master of plot construction, and Corey's numerous intrigues 
dovetail as neatly as the sliding panels of a Chinese puzzle box. 
"Pop. 1280" inaugurates the Vintage reissues of the "Black Lizard" pulp crime 
novels published in the mid-'80s by the Creative Arts Book Co. in Berkeley. 
Included in the initial release are "The Grifters," "The Getaway" and "A Hell 
of a Woman" by Thompson; "The Burnt Orange Heresy" and "Pick-Up" by Charles 
Willeford; "Shoot the Piano Player" and "Black Friday" by David Goodis, and 
"The Hot Spot" by Charles Williams. Vintage has announced plans to publish 
three additional titles every two months during 1991.
