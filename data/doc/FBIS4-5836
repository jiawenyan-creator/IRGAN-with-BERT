  [Text] Talking to NAEO NA about the disappearance of 
Russian Embassy Third Secretary Igor Makeyev, Pradap 
Phibunsongkhram, director general of the Foreign Ministry's 
European Affairs Department, said that press reports on the 
issue had both positive and negative effects. Some reports had 
caused confusion. He believed however, that Mr. Igor is still 
alive. The police would have the news report if he had died. 
  Pradap said the report that Mr. Igor took with him a 
computer 
containing secret information was untrue. The diplomat's 
position is not important. He has the duty of issuing visas. 
His work has nothing to do with computers. Pradap also said 
that it was also impossible that Mr. Igor might have returned to 
Russia. As Russia is still a communist country, he can live 
comfortably here rather than in Russia. 
  "If the diplomat wants to seek a new life in a third 
country, 
the Russian Embassy would have already informed the Foreign 
Ministry. As a result, I still believe that Mr. Igor is still in 
Thailand. He may go somewhere to escape the heat. The police, 
however, have to investigate the reasons for his disappearance," 
Pradap said.
