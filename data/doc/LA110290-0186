THATCHER FOES GLOATING AFTER HOWE PULLS OUT 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's opponents had a field day today after her 
deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, quit in protest of her resistance to Britain's 
integration into the European Community. 
"Instead of having a leader who holds the party together . . . we have one who 
unfortunately allows the party to break up," said ex-Prime Minister Edward 
Heath, who was himself ousted by Thatcher as party leader in 1975. 
Publicly, key aides in Thatcher's 22-member Cabinet rallied round, although 
they take a more conciliatory policy than the prime minister in the drive 
toward European union. 
Education Secretary John MacGregor was chosen today to replace Howe as leader 
of the House of Commons. It was not known whether anyone will assume Howe's 
additional title of deputy prime minister. 
Thatcher, her government in disarray and looking increasingly embattled, was 
closeted at her 10 Downing Street office "working on a couple of speeches for 
next week," a spokeswoman said. 
Howe stormed out of Thatcher's Cabinet late Thursday, vexed by Thatcher's 
implacable refusal to cede British sovereignty to the European Community, the 
12-nation trading bloc. 
He could no longer serve honorably in her government, he said, because of the 
strident tone in which she rejected an accord in Rome last weekend by the other 
EC leaders to work for a single European currency in the late 1990s. 
Foes gloated that the "Iron Lady" might soon be on the way out. An election 
must be held by mid-1992 while some of her own Conservative legislators floated 
the idea of a party leadership poll this December.
