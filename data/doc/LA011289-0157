WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD; 
FORUM ON HOMELESS CENTER 
The West Hollywood Small Business Council will sponsor a community forum from 7 
to 9 p.m. Jan. 24 at Plummer Park's Long Hall to discuss a proposed 
$1.2-million comprehensive center for the homeless on the city's east side. 
A panel of speakers will discuss "Sheltering the Homeless." Many of the 
council's more than 80 members own small businesses on the east side and have 
expressed concern about the shelter. 
The 70-bed permanent facility is to occupy the second floor of a furniture 
company warehouse, 1033 La Brea Ave. Despite objections from some merchants and 
residents, the City Council last September ratified a lease for the property. 
Officials have said they hope to be able to open the facility by next summer.
