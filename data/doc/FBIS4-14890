  [Text] The Estonian Government categorically opposes the 
granting of a peacekeeping mandate to Russia, Estonian Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik told Interfax. 
  He said that only the UN and the CSCE had such a mandate. 
The granting of this mandate to any individual country is a 
gross violation of international norms and peacekeeping 
principles, said Luik. 
  "Russia has the right to participate in peacekeeping 
operations within the framework of the UN and does not need any 
additional mandate," he stated. 
  He also pointed out that Estonia was against giving 
individual countries a "carte blanche" and would insist on the 
observance of this principle.
