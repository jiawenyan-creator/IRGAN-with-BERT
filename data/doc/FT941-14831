FT  18 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Provision worries hit BAe
Fears that British Aerospace may include provisions of around Pounds 200m in
its next set of results saw the shares decline by 2.6 per cent, one of the
worst performers in the FT-SE 100 Index. Talk in the market suggested that
BAe would be making the provisions because of continuing problems at its
troubled regional jets division, following the failure of talks last year
with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation for a proposed joint venture.
Sentiment was further damaged by suggestions that Saudi Arabia may
renegotiate the lucrative contract for Hawk aircraft; and weekend press
reports that the UK government may replace its transport fleet with US
Lockheed aircraft instead of a European rival.
BAe is part of a consortium developing the European alternative. The shares
gave up 10 to 414p in trade of 2.5m.
