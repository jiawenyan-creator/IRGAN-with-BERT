CHINA TACKLES TOILETS 
China has launched a three-year campaign to stop the nation's toilets from 
leaking, confident that it has overcome the defects of socialist plumbing. 
Dripping toilet systems in countless Chinese homes are wasting 200 million tons 
of water a year, the official Economic Information newspaper said Friday. A 
unified toilet system, central planning and cooperation between departments 
could plug all leaks in three years, the newspaper said.
