FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: ASG forms alliance with Danzas
for SKr50bn unit
ASG, Sweden's second largest transport company, is forming an alliance with
Danzas, the Swiss conglomerate, to create a European transport group with a
SKr50bn (Dollars 8.9bn) annual turnover and 20,000-strong workforce.
ASG will concentrate its activities in the Nordic region and take over
Danzas's business in the area while turning over its own affairs elsewhere
in the world to the Basle-based company.
The alliance, which will come into being next year, will co-ordinate the
marketing, product development and electronic data processing operations of
the companies. They will be able to utilise each other's existing warehouse
facilities. Until now ASG worked with about 15 partners in different
countries involving a variety of regulations.
Mr Bengt Jonsson, ASG's chief executive, said: 'Our own capital base is too
small to carry out large acquisitions in the European market. At the same
time the profit levels in most companies are too low and purchase prices too
high.'
