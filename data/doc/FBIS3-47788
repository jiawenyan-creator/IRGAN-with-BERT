  [Text] Osaka, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The Export-Import Bank of 
Japan will make no change in its financial support to Russia 
despite the resignation of the nation's economic reform leader, 
the bank's governor said Monday [17 January]. 
  Mitsuhide Yamaguchi said at a press conference in Osaka that 
the Ex-Im Bank will basically maintain its stance on financial 
aid to Russia despite the resignation of First Deputy Prime 
Minister Yegor Gaydar on Sunday from President Boris Yeltsin's 
government. 
  Yamaguchi made the comment after growing speculation that 
Russian economic reforms may be delayed because of Gaydar's 
resignation. He said, however, that the bank needs to take a 
careful look at the development of Russia's economic policy. 
  Some analysts said Gaydar's resignation may have an adverse 
effect on relations between Russia and international financial 
bodies like the International Monetary Fund.
