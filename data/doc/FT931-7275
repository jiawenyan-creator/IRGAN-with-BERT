FT  25 FEB 93 / Letter: Late payment - new businesses being fatally
undermined
Sir, Michael Cassell's article on the appalling economic implications of the
now universal practice of late payment of bills ('The dangers that lurk in
delay', February 23) concentrates on large 'small' businesses and lacks
constructive suggestions for reform.
The full dimensions and tragedy of the crisis are even greater than he
suggests. The Financial Times should be directing its spotlight towards the
many thousands of individuals who have lost their jobs in the current
recession and who are valiantly trying to set up new businesses, often on
their own or with just a few others.
Their efforts are being fatally undermined by the fact that they are not
being paid for their products or services. It is now impossible for these
new entrepreneurs to construct realistic or dependable cash flow
projections. They are forced to devote a ridiculous and disproportionate
amount of time chasing long overdue money. This is not a creative way of
spending time and energy. Many trickles of economic regeneration are thus
being stopped before they can even reach the main flow of business activity.
As for reforms, I suggest that we need: a national monitoring system
(statistics are urgently required); a nationally accepted payment schedule,
with penalties clearly set out; quicker and more flexible court procedures;
and an immediate full-scale government campaign against delayed payments.
