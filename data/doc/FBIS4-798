  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is trying to negotiate a 
cease-fire in Rwanda. Meanwhile, after the departure of the 
Belgian and French paras, the fighting and the massacres have 
resumed. Francois Cornet reports: 
  [Cornet] Kigali airport, a strategic point in the Rwandan 
war, fell this morning after the last Belgian and French paras 
left yesterday. Since dawn, the Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels 
have pounded the airport runways and installations, where 450 
Blue Berets have taken refuge. [passage omitted] 
  In the chaos, the Belgian paras last night managed at the 
last moment to save some 50 Tutsi children hiding in an 
orphanage surrounded by the mainly Hutu soldiers of the 
Presidential Guard. [passage omitted]
