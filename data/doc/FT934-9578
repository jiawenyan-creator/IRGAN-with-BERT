FT  10 NOV 93 / People: Rowland changes his power base
Chris Rowland, former electricity analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has
returned to the City after failing to persuade electricity generators
National Power and PowerGen to sell him plants they no longer wanted.
He has been recruited by Merrill Lynch to cover European electric utilities
including the two UK generators. It is just eight months since he quit his
BZW job to set up Cabah Energy with the aim of operating the generators'
discarded units. But Rowland refuses to blame the generators for his lack of
success. 'I failed to make offers which were attractive enough to the
generators,' he says.
However, his return to the City will reinforce the view that the generators
will fight hard against calls that they sell off plant. National Power has
publicly expressed strong reservations about selling off plant it wants to
close, although it has indicated it is willing to talk about less marginal
stations providing the price is right.
Rowland, 38, one of BZW's longest serving analysts before he quit, said
yesterday that even if National Power's and PowerGen's plant became
available he would no longer be interested. 'The competition would be too
great.'
