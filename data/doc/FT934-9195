FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Carter Holt boosts interim net
profit
FORESTRY group Carter Holt Harvey yesterday announced a 'significant
improvement' of 47.1 per cent in net profit to NZDollars 165.3m (USDollars
90m) in the six months to September 30.
The company is controlled by a joint venture between International Paper of
New York and Brierley Investments, with 65 per cent of its shares held
publicly.
Directors said that the forestry and wood products sector achieved earnings
before interest and tax of NZDollars 145.6m, a rise of 146 per cent over the
same period of last year.
Sales grew 36.9 per cent to NZDollars 536.5m.
Record high prices for export logs to Asia led to substantially higher
profits in forestry. The group also benefited from increased construction
which meant adjusting local prices for panels and building supplies to
reflect export values.
