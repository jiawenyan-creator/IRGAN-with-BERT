Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would 
require inspections to detect cracking in the upper row of fasteners in the lower lobe of 
the fuselage skin lap joints, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports 
of incidents involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that 
are approaching or have exceeded their design life goal. The actions specified by the 
proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the fuselage skin and rapid loss of 
pressure in the airplane. This proposal also relates to the recommendations of the 
Airworthiness Assurance Task Force assigned to review Model 747 series airplanes, which 
indicate that, to assure long term continued operational safety, various structural 
inspections should be accomplished.

Discussion 




In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after cracks in rivet 
holes in the upper fuselage linked together, causing structural failure and uncontrolled 
decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage. This accident focused 
greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft. 

In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was 
attended by representatives of the aviation industry from around the world. It became 
obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of 
new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older 
technology airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on 
this aging fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety. 

The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace Industries 
Association (AIA) of America committed to identifying and implementing procedures to 
ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging transport category airplanes. An 
Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, with representatives from the aircraft operators, 
manufacturers, regulatory authorities, and other aviation representatives, was established 
in August 1988. The objective of the Task Force was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to: 


1. Select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in the transport fleet, 
to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes, 

2. Develop corrosion directed inspections and prevention programs, 

3. Review the adequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program,
