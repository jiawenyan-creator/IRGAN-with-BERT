 

D. The Impact of Updating the Wage Data (Column 3) 


Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that, beginning October 1, 1993, we annually update the wage data used to
calculate the wage index. In accordance with this requirement, the wage index for FY 1995 is based on data submitted
for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1990 and before October 1, 1991. 
As with the previous two columns, the impact of the new data on hospital payments is isolated by holding the other payment
parameters constant in the two simulations. That is, the table shows the percentage changes in payments when going
from our FY 1995 baseline_using the FY 1994 wage index before geographic reclassifications based on 1990 wage survey
data, eliminating the separate rural rate and incorporating the FY 1995 GROUPER_to a model substituting the FY 1995
pre-reclassification wage index based on 1991 data as described above. 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act also requires that any updates or adjustments to the wage index be made in a manner
that ensures that aggregate payments to hospitals are not affected by the change in the wage index. To comply with the
requirements that the DRG and wage index changes must be implemented in a budget neutral manner, we compute a budget
neutrality adjustment factor to apply to the standardized amounts. For the FY 1995 proposed amounts, this adjustment
factor is 0.997647. This factor is applied to the standardized amounts in this column to ensure that the overall effect
of the wage index changes are budget neutral. 
The results indicate that the new wage data do not have a significant overall impact on urban and rural hospitals. As
discussed in section III of the preamble to this proposed rule, 86.4 percent of all prospective payment system hospitals
would experience a change in their wage index of less than 5 percent. This column demonstrates that hospitals with
significant changes in their wage indexes are not concentrated within any particular hospital group. In contrast,
the impact analysis of the final FY 1994 operating prospective payment system changes displayed numerous hospital
groups with payment changes in excess of 2.0 percent due to the new wage survey data (58 FR 46459). For FY 1995, some of
the largest changes are evident among urban hospitals grouped by census division. New England urban hospitals' payments
rise 1.0 percent, while payments per case for urban hospitals in the West North Central and Mountain census divisions
fall by 1.1 percent. The most dramatic shifts occur in Puerto Rico, where payments decline by 10.7 percent in rural
hospitals and 7.7 percent in urban hospitals. These effects are attributable to data corrections. We note that the
FY 1994 payment effect of the new wage data was an 11.6 percent increase for rural Puerto Rico hospitals. 
This decline in the wage index values for Puerto Rico hospitals also appears to be the main cause for the 0.6 percent
drop in payments among proprietary hospitals. The 20 hospitals with the greatest drop in their wage index within this
category are all located in Puerto Rico. Also experiencing a 0.6 percent decline in payments per case are hospitals
in rural counties deemed to be urban under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act. This impact appears to be primarily related
to 2 hospitals experiencing nearly 20 percent declines in their wage index values.
