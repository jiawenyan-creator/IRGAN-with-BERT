FIRST IMPRESSIONS: MOONRAKER FINDS PLACE IN THE SUN 
The cliche: Hotel food is boring food. But in the past few years, as 
experimentation has gradually replaced the old Continental glop, this has 
become less true. 
This new-style food isn't always good, but it's hardly dull. 
Recently, the new Sheraton hotel in San Pedro opened Moonraker, a restaurant 
with a menu that is anything but safe. The chef, Larry Canas, comes with an 
impressive resume: He's cooked at Chez Melange in the South Bay, Le Bel Age and 
385 North. And he calls his food Asian nouvelle cuisine. That means there are 
things like duck livers served on soba noodles, Thai shrimp salad, and onion 
soup made with a reduction of sake -- Canas' pan-Asian 385 North training 
shows. He's fond of gimmicks like caper-shiso butter, and tropical fruit on 
just about anything, but it all beats staring down at another plate of trout 
amandine. 
At this point, Moonraker is more ambitious than polished, but its weekend 
brunches have already become popular. Dinner entrees might run from $10.95 
specials to $22.50 for a veal chop grilled with foie gras and a Creole 
bordelaise sauce. 
 Moonraker, at the Sheraton San Pedro, 601 S. Palos Verdes St., San Pedro.
