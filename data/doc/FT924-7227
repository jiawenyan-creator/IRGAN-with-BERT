FT  17 NOV 92 / Mercury extends business service
MERCURY Communications will today launch a new service offering business
customers the benefits of a private telecommunications network without
having to lease and maintain their own infrastructure.
Mercury said its 'virtual private network' service would be up to 30 per
cent cheaper than conventional private networks. Call charges would also be
cheaper than using the public network.
