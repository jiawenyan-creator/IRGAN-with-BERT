FT  13 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Customers of no concern?
Sir, In 'Yorkshire Water accepts price set by Ofwat' (August 3), you quote
the company chairman as saying: 'If she (Mrs Diana Scott, a former regulator
seeking a seat on the board) wants to look after the interests of the
customers the board of the plc is not the place to do it.'
As a captive customer of Yorkshire Water, am I to infer that consideration
of customers' interests is not a matter for board concern? Has the company
learnt nothing, one wonders?
