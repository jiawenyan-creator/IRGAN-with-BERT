FT  27 MAR 92 / Letter: Land values and clean-up costs
Sir, John Hunt's article, 'Erasing the black marks' (March 25), referred to
the minister for the environment's recent announcement to defer compilation
of the public register of potentially contaminated land. He dwelt upon the
concern, expressed widely by land-owners and their professional advisers, of
planning blight.
In an active land-dealing market an owner of industrial land featuring in
the prospective register might have to offer a discount to a potential
purchaser, if, in the absence of any detailed site investigation, his
consultants are unable to assess the risk that the site may attract and
estimate the costs of clean up.
I would argue that these discounts apply to all industrial land today, in
advance of the opening of any register. The problem of discounting will
become more apparent when the land market is restored: contaminated sites
for which there are no survey data will be further devalued, and sites which
have either been treated (even though they may remain on a future register)
or simply surveyed allowing quantification of the problems and costs a
developer may face, are likely to attract a premium.
These issues need to be addressed urgently, regardless of the administrative
details of implementation of Section 143 of the Environmental Protection Act
of 1990.
