    [Editorial Report] Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish of 18 
March 1994 on page 7B reports that over the next few weeks the 
National Enterprise for Staple Foods (Enabas) will export 60,000 
quintals of black beans to Venezuela, the United States, Costa 
Rica, and the Dominican Republic. According to Enabas Executive 
Director Alfredo Guzman, Enabas will buy 25 percent of the total 
production from growers for 105 to 110 cordobas per quintal. 
Enabas exports will generate $1.4 million. Guzman predicts that 
the country will export 240,000 quintals, totalling $5 million. 
The article explains that the cultivation of black beans, a 
nontraditional product grown for export, is sponsored by the 
Nicaraguan Investors Financial Institute, the Social Action 
Ministry, and nongovernmental organizations. Growers include 
6,000 peasants from Chontales, Nueva Segovia, and Matagalpa. 
According to Guzman, yields average 20 quintals per manzana with 
production costs of 78 cordobas per quintal. Enabas is offering 
incentives to producers to increase the area under cultivation, 
the article reports.
