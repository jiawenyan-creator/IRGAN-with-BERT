FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrief enters saga of Aberdeen
Petroleum via 17% stake purchase
THE COMPLICATED saga of Aberdeen Petroleum took another twist yesterday when
Pittencrief, the acquisitive communications and natural resources company,
announced a deal to acquire a 16.6 per cent stake in the Scotland-based
group.
Pittencrief said it had agreed to acquire 8.6m Aberdeen shares at 12.5p each
from a private investor, Mr DJ Hughes.
The Pounds 1.1m consideration would be satisfied by the issue of 335,000 new
Pittencrief shares. Aberdeen closed last night 1p up at 12p, while
Pittencrief fell 5p to 314p.
Mr David Hooker, managing director of Aberdeen, said that Pittencrief's
purchase had come as a surprise. He gave a cautious welcome to the new
investor and said he expected to discuss the 'investment in more detail
shortly' with Pittencrief.
Mr Douglas Sinclair, finance director, refused to comment on whether
Pittencrief intended to launch a bid or play the white knight in Aberdeen's
attempt to fend off hostile proposals from US-based Bellwether. The stake
was seen as an attractive investment.
Analysts speculated that Pittencrief, which has been reportedly seeking oil
and gas assets, had one of two intentions: to bid for Aberdeen or profit
from Bellwether's approach.
