FT  15 AUG 94 / Cracks found in Concorde wings
Hairline cracks have been found in the wings of British Airway's seven
Concorde aircraft, the company has confirmed. 'We have repaired two of them
and are working to repair the others one by one,' BA said.
The Civil Aviation Authority said it had allowed the Concordes yet to be
repaired to remain in service if they were checked after every 10 flights.
The longest crack found was four inches and the others were about one inch.
It said the cracks did not affect airworthiness. They were not in a
high-tension area or one that had any bearing on safety. The cracks were
found during a routine inspection in May.
Last week the Department of Transport's Air Accident Investigation Branch
reported that two outer window panels had shattered during a flight causing
a Concorde to lose speed.
