BOXED-IN 
Re: Claire Simpson's letter in Calendar (June 3) regarding the automatic 
renewal of Hollywood Bowl boxes in which she argued that this practice should 
be abandoned and boxes assigned by lottery: 
This is no different from season tickets at any theater. 
(I'd like to sit in the first five rows of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
Ahmanson, Pantages, etc., too.) 
For 10 years we enjoyed the Playboy Jazz Festival and looked forward each year 
to our box for this concert. Then someone got the brainy idea to offer the 
boxes in a lottery. Since then, we have not attended a Playboy concert.
