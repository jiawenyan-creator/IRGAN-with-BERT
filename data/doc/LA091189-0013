BUCCANEERS FINISH PACKERS WITH INTERCEPTION, 23-21 
Vinny Testaverde's passing put Tampa Bay in front, and Mark Robinson's late 
interception made sure the Buccaneers stayed there in Sunday's 23-21 victory 
over the Green Bay Packers. 
Testaverde led Tampa Bay to three second-quarter touchdowns and a 20-7 halftime 
lead. Then it was Robinson's turn. 
Robinson had two of Tampa Bay's three interceptions off Don Majkowski, 
including one on the eight-yard line with five minutes left that stopped the 
Packers' final drive. 
"That was the real big play, the key play of the game," Tampa Bay Coach Ray 
Perkins said. 
"We were just in a zone coverage and he (Majkowski) overthrew it just a 
little," said Robinson, whose first interception led to the Buccaneers' 
go-ahead touchdown. 
Testaverde completed 22 of 27 passes for 205 yards and a touchdown. Majkowski 
completed 17 of 27 passes for 220 yards, but his overthrow on the potential 
go-ahead scoring drive was critical. 
"I didn't make a very intelligent decision at the end and it probably cost us 
the game," Majkowski said. "I don't expect myself to do that. I'm very upset at 
the way it turned out." 
The Packers drove from their 30 to the Tampa Bay 16 before Robinson's 
interception. A personal foul penalty against Green Bay on the return gave the 
Buccaneers the ball on the 30, and they ran out the remaining 5:32. 
The Packers had scored on their first possession of the game, when Brent 
Fullwood ran it in from the three. But then the Buccaneers took control with 
three touchdowns, two coming after interceptions. The three drives consumed 
nearly 20 minutes in the first half. 
Tampa Bay led, 20-7, at halftime before the Packers pulled within 23-21 with 
14:05 left as Carl Bland recovered teammate Perry Kemp's fumble in the end 
zone. Kemp fumbled after catching a 12-yard pass. Rookie Jeff Query's 45-yard 
reception set up the touchdown.
