SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Department may revoke an antidumping finding if the Secretary concludes that the finding is no longer of any interest
to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping finding when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
On August 1, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38956) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping finding on cadmium from Japan (August 4, 1972). 
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
this antidumping finding on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who
might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of
the anniversary month. 
In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under 353.2 (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping finding on cadmium from Japan
is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping finding in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii). 


Scope of the Order 


Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of cadmium from Japan. This merchandise is currently classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 8107.10.00. The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs
purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 

This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of cadmium from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after August 1, 1994. Entries made during the period August 1, 1993, through July 30, 1994, will
be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs
Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after August 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping
duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d).
