  [Text] Taipei, May 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Thursday [12 May] 
took a major step in opening its insurance market by revising 
the insurance law to put foreign insurers on an equal footing 
with their local counterparts. 
  The Ministry of Finance said Article 22 of the insurance law 
had been eliminated in order to meet requirements set by the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which Taiwan expects to 
join before the year's end. 
  The article stipulated that total stakes of an individual 
insurance firm held by foreigners must not exceed 30 percent of 
the firm's paid-in capital. 
  It is generally believed that this further opening of the 
insurance market will make the already severe competition 
stiffer. 
  At present, 14 American life insurance companies are doing 
business in Taiwan, struggling to take only 4.5 percent of the 
local market share. Only Aetna Life Insurance Co., a division 
of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. of Hartford, Conn., is believed 
to 
be making profits. 
  It has been reported that Continental Insurance Co. of New 
York is pulling out of Taiwan, five years after it became one of 
the first US insurance firms to set up business here.
