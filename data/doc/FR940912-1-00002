SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed rule was published in the July 12, 1994 issue of the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 35487). The proposed rule would amend the definition of fresh fruit and vegetables set forth in 7 CFR 46.2(u)
of the Regulations issued pursuant to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (7 U.S.C. 499o). This document
extends PACA coverage to include frozen fruits and vegetables that are oil-blanched, especially frozen french fried
potato products. Under previous regulations, suppliers of these commodities suffered considerable financial
losses because oil-blanched products were excluded from the PACA. Reopening the comment period grants dealers in
frozen oil-blanched products the same rights afforded dealers whose frozen product is water blanched. 



On August 10, 1994, the Agency received a request from the Food Marketing Institute, International Foodservice Distributors
Association, National-American Wholesale Grocers Association, National Council of Chain Restaurants, National
Grocers Association, and the National Restaurant Association requesting a 90-day extension of the comment period.
The request stated they needed additional time to develop their comments. 

The Department has determined that a 30-day extension of the comment period will provide adequate time for interested
persons to respond to this proposed rule. Accordingly, the comment period is reopened to October 12, 1994.
