FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Voters set for council verdict
VOTERS IN England and Wales went to the polls yesterday to elect a total of
3,501 councillors to 47 county councils.
In Newbury voters turned out in their thousands to deliver their verdict on
the government's record. Dry, sunny weather led to brisk early polling in
the parliamentary by-election and a high turn-out was expected.
Yesterday marked the broadest test of political support since the general
election in April last year, but preliminary indications were that turn-out
was low for the council elections in spite of the fine weather.
Politicians believed that the council tax failed to stimulate many voters
into turning out, even though it was the successor to the controversial
community charge, or poll tax.
There were no elections in Scotland, Greater London, or the metropolitan
districts, which elect their councillors in May next year.
For several councils they were also the last elections before abolition. The
eight counties in Wales will be converted into 21 all-purpose authorities.
