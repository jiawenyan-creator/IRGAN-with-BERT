FT  19 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: IRS to ease tax rules on
hedging transactions
THE Internal Revenue Service has issued regulations that will allow hundreds
of US businesses to count gains and losses from hedging transactions as
ordinary income for tax purposes, rather than capital gains, which are taxed
at a higher rate.
The decision represents a defeat for the agency, which since 1988 has
attempted to collect taxes on hedge transactions, which are used for risk
management purposes by industries as diverse as farming, banking, and
energy, at the higher rate. Its actions were based on a 1988 supreme court
ruling in a case called Arkansas Best, which reversed 40 years of tax
practice in the treatment of contracts used to protect business risks.
The IRS also issued a temporary regulation which will give immediate relief
to companies embroiled in disputes with the agency over its method of hedge
taxation. They include giants like General Motors, which uses hedging to
protect itself from foreign currency and interest rate risk, and Ralston
Purina, which produces cereal products and animal feeds, and hedges its raw
materials costs with forward contracts and futures transactions.
The regulations are also a relief to the nation's futures exchanges, where
many hedge transactions are executed. 'It looks as if Treasury has
recognised hedging is a legitimate business expense,' said Mr Jerrold
Salzman, outside counsel to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The IRS turnround follows a June 17 tax court ruling involving the Federal
National Mortgage Association. That ruling gave tax relief in limited cases,
but could not be broadly interpreted. The new IRS regulations are much
broader, and are an important step toward rationalising the tax treatment of
hedging transactions, said Mr Patrick Arbor, Chicago Board of Trade
chairman.
