FT  02 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK takeovers
Contested bids such as Redland/Steetley and TI/Dowty mostly squeaked through
in the first half of 1992. But with yesterday's victory by Henlys in the
battle of the motor traders - following hot on the heels of Manders'
successful defence against fellow paint maker Kalon - the predators' lot is
not proving an easy one. Obviously it is rash to make judgements on the
basis of just two tiddlers, and there are particular difficulties in making
unwanted bids for smaller companies. The explanation, though, may go beyond
relative management merits or even the lack in both recent cases of a full
cash alternative.
The way in which the falling stock market has tended to erode bid premiums
has certainly been one factor in the failures. Another may be the
increasingly uncertain outlook for earnings, and therefore the difficulties
for institutions of assessing the fairness of offers.
