FT  11 MAY 91 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and NCR in pre-merger link
AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph is to consolidate its computer operations
into the business of NCR, the Ohio-based computer company, ahead of the
formal merger of the two companies.
After a five-month bid battle, NCR finally agreed to be acquired by AT&amp;T

said they expected the legal formalities, before the merger can be
completed, to take four or five months.
