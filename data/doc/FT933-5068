FT  06 SEP 93 / Call on frozen beef rejected
THE government yesterday rejected calls from the Labour party to withdraw on
health grounds surplus European Community meat which has been released on to
the market after being held for long periods in cold storage.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, said on BBC Radio
that the government had 'behaved shamefully' by withholding from the public
the origin of the EC beef and the date on which it had first been put into
storage. Without it, he argued, the consumer could not know for certain
whether the meat was safe.
He was responding to a report in yesterday's Sunday Times newspaper that the
release of deep-frozen surplus beef up to six years old was prompting
concern about the quality of meat used primarily in pies and sausages.
Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the Consumers' Association, said
last night: 'It is outrageous that EC beef is just being dumped on the
market and consumers are not told anything about it.'
The UK's beef 'mountain' reached a record 164,389 tonnes last year partly
because of the recession and partly because other EC countries refused to
buy UK beef after an out-break of BSE, or 'mad cow' disease.
