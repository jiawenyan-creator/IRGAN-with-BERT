FT  29 APR 93 / Bangladesh to get Dollars 2.15bn
Western aid donors yesterday pledged Dollars 2.15bn (Pounds 1.57bn) aid to
Bangladesh, urging it to liberalise its economy further and do more to help
the poor, Reuter reports from Paris.
In a statement issued after a two-day meeting in Paris, donors praised
Bangladesh's economic management but some had reservations about its human
rights record, criticised in an Amnesty International report released
yesterday.
Mr Saifur Rahman, finance minister, told a news conference the aid - about
Dollars 100m more than he requested - showed the donors' confidence in
Bangladesh and said only one or two of the 14 countries at the meeting
raised the human rights issue.
A statement released by the World Bank, which chairs the aid meetings, said:
'Donors emphasised the crucial importance of reducing Bangladesh's
widespread and acute poverty through programmes to generate productive
employment for the poor.'
The report by Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group,
accused Bangladesh security forces of torture, rape and unlawful executions.
