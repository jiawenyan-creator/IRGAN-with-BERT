FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Lewinsohn stands back from Card Clear
THE FORMER chairman of Dominion International, the collapsed finance house,
has been forced to distance himself from a small credit card security
company, following revelations that the Department of Trade and Industry is
trying to disqualify him from holding company directorships.
Mr Max Lewinsohn, who was chairman of Dominion for 12 years before its
collapse in 1990, last week resigned as non-executive chairman of Card
Clear, which is seeking to raise between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 250,000
through the Business Expansion Scheme.
Card Clear has written to all the scheme's applicants offering them the
chance to withdraw before the closing date on Friday. The company's advisers
said it was too early to tell if any applications had been withdrawn.
In January the DTI initiated proceedings against Mr Lewinsohn relating to
his involvement with Dominion under section 6 of the Company Directors
Disqualification Act 1986. The next hearing is set for October.
Mr Lewinsohn retains a small stake in Card Clear after he and other
investors raised Pounds 150,000 for the company last September.
The BES scheme is underwritten by Ellis &amp; Partners, stockbrokers for Card
Clear, and another company in which Mr Lewinsohn holds a minority stake.
Mr Clive Mattock, a director of Ellis, is a long-term friend of Mr Lewinsohn
and was managing director of Oaklands Stockbrokers, which was closed in
1990.
