FT  15 SEP 92 / Scots judge cases to be reviewed
FIVE cases featured in a confidential police report alleging that
high-ranking homosexuals in Scottish legal circles may have interfered with
the course of justice and are to be reviewed, the Crown Office in Edinburgh
announced yesterday.
The move follows publication of a leaked version of the report in the
Edinburgh Evening News.
The newspaper said the confidential police document concluded a
well-established circle of homosexuals in Edinburgh with influence in the
justiciary may have formed associations that laid them open to blackmail,
and homosexuality 'may well have been used as a means to seriously interfere
with the administration of justice'.
