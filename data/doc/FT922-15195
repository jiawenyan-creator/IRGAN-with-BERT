FT  02 APR 92 / Greens attack Rio summit
ACTIVIST environmental groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, with the
Brazilian Forum of Non-
Governmental Organisations, yesterday launched a blistering attack on the
stalled negotiations for the UN environment summit, to be held in Rio de
Janeiro in June.
They warned yesterday that the meeting might do more harm than good,
exacerbating north-south differences.
'Unless there is a dramatic change of course, the Rio conference is heading
towards failure of historic proportions,' the organisations stated in Rio.
Their document sets out ten points seen as essential 'to give the planet the
minimum changes of survival.' Chief of these is a commitment by President
George Bush of the US to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions that contribute to
global warming. 'Without this, the conference will be a disaster,' it
warned.
The attack heightens fears over the content of the conference and comes amid
renewed worries over the Brazilian organisation of it, particularly
following the resignation of President Fernando Collor's entire
administration on Monday.
