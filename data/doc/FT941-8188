FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Bridgestone - Other companies
The Japanese tyre company which owns Firestone, will announce
non-consolidated and consolidated earnings results for the year to December
1993 on Friday. Profits are expected to reflect an 8 cent fall in production
and a 10 per cent fall in sales in the overall domestic tyre market last
year. The company also faces lower profit margins as consumers are buying
tyres at discounts, and choosing lower grade tyres in the economic downturn.
