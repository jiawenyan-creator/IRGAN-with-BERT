SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: THREE AZTECS ARE NAMED TO ALL-REGION FIRST TEAM 
San Diego State was the only school to have three players named to the American 
Baseball Coaches Assn. Region 7 first team released Tuesday. 
But SDSU catcher Eric Christopherson, expected to be a first-round draft choice 
in June, was not named to the first team. 
SDSU's Jeff Barry was one of only three repeat choices. Barry, a junior 
outfielder from Medford, Ore., batted .320. He was joined by shortstop Brian 
Grebeck (.332) and pitcher Kurt Archer (9-2, 2.13). 
Christopherson and infielder Scott Dennison and outfielder Anthony Johnson were 
named to the second team. 
Also, the Aztec baseball team finished 17th in the national top 25 selected by 
Baseball America. SDSU (49-22) moved up from 22nd the previous week. Stanford, 
which defeated SDSU for the championship of the NCAA West I Regional, remained 
in the No. 1 spot.
