FT  05 APR 94 / Exports to 'fuel German growth'
Industrial production in west Germany will rise by 2 per cent this year
thanks to rising foreign demand, according to the latest economic report
from the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute.
The report, which supports an increasingly widespread view that the economy
has seen the worst of the recession, points to a revival in the motor
vehicle, electronics, engineering and chemical sectors, all of which are
heavily dependent on the export market.
Economists suggest that a year of cost-cutting measures and wage restraint
have helped make west German industrial products more competitive on the
world market.
Ifo said new orders were up 2 per cent from November 1993 to January this
year, compared with the first quarter of 1993. Foreign orders rose 7.5 per
cent over the same period.
The institute expects the growth in foreign demand to prompt a 5 per cent
increase in car production this year, following a 20 per cent fall in 1993.
It also forecasts growth in the electronics sector of 2-3 per cent, compared
with a fall of 6.5 per cent last year; and 3 per cent growth in the chemical
sector, after a 2 per cent decline last year.
However, recovery in the engineering sector will remain sluggish, with 1 per
cent growth in production forecast from a low base. Engineering output fell
by 12 per cent in 1993.
Economists emphasise, however, that the rate of recovery will depend on the
speed in which other European Union countries emerge from the recession, as
well as continuing efforts by industry to reduce labour unit costs.
DIW, the Berlin-based Institute for Economic Research, has even forecast a
0.5 per cent contraction this year, contrary to the government's
expectations of growth of 1-1.5 per cent.
