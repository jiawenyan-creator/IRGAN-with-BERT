FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Mansfield advances to Pounds 11m
MANSFIELD Brewery lifted pre-tax profits by almost 37 per cent, from Pounds
8.04m to Pounds 11m, over the 12 months to March 28.
Property disposals contributed Pounds 407,000, against just Pounds 25,000,
but interest charges jumped to Pounds 6.12m (Pounds 4.48m) reflecting the
group's capital expenditure programme.
Profits at the operating level, after charging Pounds 1.2m against free
trade debts and loans, advanced some 34 per cent to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds
12.5m). The trading margin improved from 7.4 per cent to 9.3 per cent.
Mr Geoffrey Kent, chairman, said total draught beer sales rose 2.8 per cent,
while the group improved its share of the regional market, estimated to have
fallen by 4.6 per cent.
He attributed the volume increase to the purchase of new pubs - Mansfield's
estate expanded by 22 per cent to 453 houses by the year-end and another 6
have been acquired since then - and improved sales to the wholesale trade.
In contrast, free trade sales volumes were marginally lower while tied trade
showed an underlying decline of 4.4 per cent on a like-for-like basis.
The expansion of the pub estate led to borrowings rising Pounds 16.5m to
Pounds 59.8m - equal to gearing of almost 44 per cent at the year-end.
Turnover totalled Pounds 114m (Pounds 108m). A proposed final dividend of
9.6p brings the total for the year to 13.6p (12.1p), covered 3.6 times by
earnings of 48.6p (38.6p) per share.
