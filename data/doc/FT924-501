FT  24 DEC 92 / UK Company News: ITN contract still waiting to be finalised
Negotiations on the Pounds 53.6m a year Independent Television News contract
with the ITV companies look like continuing to the last minute.
A number of substantial ITV companies were holding out yesterday, and a
number suggested it may be December 31 before the five-year deal is signed.
The new franchises start from the beginning of next year.
The row is over the proposals for a two year review. Companies such as
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, HTV, Meridian and Grampian which will no longer be
shareholders in ITN, want a wide-ranging review.
If substantial savings flow from the new ownership structure the ITV
companies want to benefit.
Carlton Television, it is believed, wants to set firm limits on the
conditions that would trigger a review.
Once the news supply agreement is signed the restructuring of ITN will go
unconditional.
