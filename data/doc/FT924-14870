FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Gemina rises to L157bn
GEMINA, the Italian investment and financial services group controlled by
Fiat, raised group net profits marginally to L157bn (Dollars 119.4m) for the
year to June 30 from L152.5bn in 1990-91.
Net earnings at parent company level fell heavily to L42.7bn from L101.5bn,
largely on account of a L112.2bn write-down in the value of Gemina's stakes
in quoted companies.
The company is paying an unchanged dividend of L60 for ordinary shares and
L70 for savings stock. The payment, which exceeds the parent company's
profits, will be made using funds from a special reserve. The group
confirmed its intention to sell its stake of over 13 per cent in Banco
Ambrosiano Veneto, Italy's biggest private sector financial institution.
However, the group made no mention of the widely-expected sale of its equity
and bond trading subsidiary to Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the large
treasury-owned bank.
