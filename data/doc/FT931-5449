FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japan to ease curbs on bank
borrowing for casualty insurers
JAPAN'S finance ministry plans to ease bank borrowing restrictions for the
country's non-life, or casualty insurers, in a move to support the insurers
which face redemptions on equity-linked bonds.
The decision is intended to help some of the smaller casualty insurers,
which are facing a squeeze in cash flow due to low profit growth, and have a
high exposure to bad loans.
Some Y18bn (Dollars 154m) worth of warrant bonds issued by the non-life
insurers are expected to expire this year. Most of Japan's leading 15
casualty insurers are backed by strong corporate groupings. However, the
weaker companies without group support are expected to face severe cash flow
problems.
The companies' underwriting margin - premium income minus claims and
operating expenses - are under increasing pressure as the premiums have not
kept up with a rise in claims expenses.
An increasing reliance on savings type policies, which are a combination of
insurance and savings deposits, is also squeezing the insurers' profits, as
a fall in interest rates is depressing the return on the insurers'
investments.
A surge in bad loans is also hurting the non-life companies' profitability.
The casualty companies have Y7,100bn, or more than 32.5 per cent of their
investment assets, in loans, of which over 51 per cent are uncollateralised.
Mr David Snoddy, financial analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo,
reckons almost 5 per cent of the insurers' loans are non-performing or at
risk of becoming so.
By allowing the insurance companies to borrow from banks, pressure to
realise profits on stock holdings will diminish, easing selling pressure on
the stock market before the March year-end book closing.
The finance ministry recently said it would allow life and non-life
insurance companies to book unrealised profits on stock holdings to prop up
earnings.
