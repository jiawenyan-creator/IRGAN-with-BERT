  [Text] During the civil war in Tajikistan, Russian troops 
prevented an explosion at the Nurek Hydroelectric Power Station 
in the mountains which could have led to catastrophic flooding 
of many Central Asian areas. The investigation into last year's 
events is still going on, since some saboteurs among the armed 
Tajik opposition gunmen have managed to take refuge on Afghan 
territory. 
  It has been learned from informed sources in Dushanbe that 
the extremists planned to drive three "Zil" trucks loaded with 
explosives into the hydroelectric facility's operational tunnels 
and detonate them. In the opinion of military experts, a 
serious danger of flooding was averted: The unique mountain 
station's dam is 350 meters high. The reservoir's total 
capacity is 10.4 billion cubic meters. The wave after the 
explosion could have been 86 meters high. The initial width and 
length of flooding could have been 53 km and 1,385 km 
respectively. Over 2,000 villages and seven cities in 
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenia could have been flooded. 
  The blowing up of the dam was prevented by soldiers of the 
201st Russian Motorized Rifle Division's Kulyab Regiment, two of 
whom died in a shootout with Tajik opposition gunmen. 
  Colonel General Eduard Vorobyev, who headed the 
antiterrorist 
operation and is now first deputy commander in chief of Russian 
Ground Forces, informed an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the 
extremists had also planned a sabotage operation to destroy the 
nitrogen mineral fertilizer plant in the city of Yavan. Its 
consequences could have led to the mass poisoning and death of 
people.
