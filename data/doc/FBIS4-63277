<F P=106> ["Judging by All, Azerbaijan Is To Sign Truce Agreement With </F>
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh" -- TURAN headline] 
  [Text] Baku, 19 May (TURAN) -- Today early in the morning 
Azerbaijan's Defense Minister, Mamed-Rafi Mamedov, left for 
Moscow, the source from Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry told TURAN. 
  As was reported, earlier Baku refused to sign the document 
concerning truce due to the fact that Armenia insisted on the 
settlement of two questions at a time: the introduction of 
Russian troops into the conflict zone and discussion of the 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Defense Minister Mamedov said that this proposal contradicts 
preliminary agreements and then left the talks. 
  Yesterday special envoy of Russian president, Vladimir 
Kazimirov, arrived in Baku to incline Azerbaijan to sign the 
truce agreement. 
  On the same day President Aliyev conducted phone talks with 
Pavel Grachev. During the phone talks, President Aliyev said 
that Baku considers the terms of the truce as "humiliating ones" 
and asked to take this point into account. However, Grachev 
mentioned that "he cannot interfere into internal affairs of 
Azerbaijan and he is waiting for an answer to Russia's 
proposals." 
  All these facts prove unofficial data that Moscow 
intensified 
its pressure on Baku after it refused to sign the document. 
Every time Moscow puts forward more and more difficult 
conditions.
