FT  10 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling seeks Budget boost
FOREIGN exchange rates moved in tight bands yesterday, with investors
unwilling to commit themselves to either sterling or the dollar before
today's UK Budget, and US economic data later in the week, writes Neil
Buckley.
Weekend opinion polls in the UK continued to suggest that a hung parliament
is a strong possibility after the general election expected on April 9,
bringing a long period of political uncertainty. This has caused widespread
hesitancy to move into sterling.
Yesterday it touched its floor against the top-placed peseta within the
Exchange Rate Mechanism, but rumours of Bank of England intervention seemed
to be unfounded. Against the D-Mark, it dropped as low as DM2.8640 at one
point, from a start of DM2.8655/90, and closed at DM2.8671/76.
Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank, said: 'The market itself
is not looking for anything specific from the Budget. But it will be
watching closely for the reaction of two sets of individuals - the business
community, to determine whether this Budget could spur economic recovery,
and the voters, to see if it can improve the Conservatives' electoral
prospects.'
Dealers have warned that a negative reaction to the Budget from these groups
could place sterling under increasing pressure on the foreign exchanges.
Against the dollar, however, the pound had a better day, closing at Dollars
1.7230, after Friday's Dollars 1.7185. It ended mildly higher in New York at
Dollars 1.7255.
The dollar generally took a rest from last week's exertions, and traded in a
narrow range to close down at DM1.6630, against DM1.6695 previously, but up
at Y131.95 from Y131.75. Later in New York it finished at DM1.6607 and
Y131.92.
Most dealers feel the dollar will become more bullish again after Thursday's
US retail sales figures and Friday's producer prices index. The belief that
the Bank of Japan will soon cut its discount rate of 4.5 per cent is also
weighing heavily against the yen, although the news that a candidate from
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had been defeated in a Japanese
by-election on Sunday had little effect.
In Tokyo, the dollar had finished at Y131.73 and DM1.6633, against
Y131.80/90 and DM1.6670/80 at the New York close on Friday.
Within the EMS, the Belgian franc was unchanged against the D-Mark even
after Mr Philippe Maystadt, finance minister, said Belgium was considering
letting its short-term interest rates fall below equivalent German rates. Mr
Maystadt said informal talks were taking place between the governors of the
Dutch, Belgian and German central banks.
The D-Mark was unchanged from its opening at around DM4.862/3 per 100
Belgian francs, but slightly up from Friday's DM4.865/7. It was slightly
weaker against the lira and French franc, although it maintained its
position in the EMS, at around 33 per cent above its central Ecu level.
