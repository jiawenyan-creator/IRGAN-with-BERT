 

The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index, and pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b) may at any time or from time to
time substitute stocks, or adjust the number of stocks included in the Index, based on changing conditions in Israel.
However, the Exchange will not decrease the number of Index component stocks to less than nine or increase the number
of component stocks to greater than fourteen without prior Commission approval. 

The value of the Index will be calculated continuously and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape
Association's Network B. 



Expiration and Settlement



The Exchange proposes to trade cash-settled, European-style Index options (

i.e.

, exercises are permitted to expiration only). The Exchange also proposes that Israeli Index options will have trading
hours from 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. EST.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 As with other index options traded on the Amex, the options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third
Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''), The last trading day in an option series will normally be
the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (normally
a Thursday). Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day.

The Index value for purposes of settling a specific Israeli Index option will be calculated based upon the primary
exchange regular way opening sale prices for the component securities.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of NM securities, the first reported sale price will be used. As trading begins in each of the Index's component
securities, its opening sale price is used in the calculation. Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value
of the Index is determined and that value is used as the settlement value of the option. If any of the component stocks
do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior day's last sale price is used in the
calculation.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the two additional
calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration
may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may instead list long-term,
reduced-value put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) the Index's full-value. In either event, the interval
between expiration months for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option will not be less than six months.



Eligibility Standards for Index Components 



The Index's component securities all have major business interests in Israel, and have been selected on the basis
of their market capitalization, trading liquidity, and representation of Israeli business industries. The Amex
believes the components represent the largest and most liquid of all Israeli securities trading in the U.S., and that
the Index tracks closely the performance of larger broad market Israeli indexes, such as the Oscar Gruss Israel Index,
which contains all of the more than 50 Israeli securities currently traded in the U.S. this index is carried in the Israeli
press as well as by Bloomberg L.P., a major U.S. data vendor.

In choosing among Israeli stocks that meet the minimum criteria set forth in Exchange Rule 901C, the Exchange will
select stocks that: (1) Have a minimum market value in U.S. dollars of at least $75 million, except that for each of the
lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account for no more than 10% of the weight of
the Index, the market value may be at least $50 million; (2) have an average monthly trading volume in the U.S. markets
over the previous six month period of not less than 500,000 shares (or ADRs); (3) have at least 85% of the numerical Index
value and at least 80% of the total number of component securities meeting the current criteria for standardized option
trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; and (4) are reported securities that trade on either the NYSE, Amex (subject
to the limitations of Rule 901C), or are NM securities.


The Amex will ensure that not more than 20% of the weight of the Index is represented by ADRs overlying foreign securities
that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Currently no Index components have the majority of their trading volume occurring on an exchange with which the Amex
does not currently have in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement.

Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options



Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of regular and long-term contracts based on the Index. These
Rules cover issues such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently
used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options
on the Index. The Index is deemed to be a Stock Index option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Industry Group under
Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (

i.e.

, within ten points above or below the current index value) options series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise)
price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant
to Rule 904C(c), a position limit of 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market. 

The Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in Index options of up to 50 contracts.
Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable
limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Amex represents that it has the necessary systems
capacity to support new series that would result from the introduction of Israeli Index Options.

II. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the trading of Israeli Index options, including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS, will serve to promote the public interest and help to remove impediments to a free and open securities
market by providing investors with a means of hedging exposure to market risk associated with Israeli securities.

</FOOTNAME>
Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding
that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult
for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be
derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence
in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading of listed Index options
and full-value Index LEAPS will provide investors with a hedging vehicle that should reflect the overall movement
of Israeli stocks and ADRs in the U.S. securities markets. The Commission also believes that these Index options will
provide investors with a means by which to make investment decisions regarding Israeli securities traded in the U.S.
securities markets, allowing them to establish positions or increase existing positions in such markets in a cost
effective manner. Moreover, the Commission believes that the reduced-value Index LEAPS, which will be traded on
an index computed at one-tenth the value of the Israeli Index, will serve the needs of retail investors by providing
them with the opportunity to use a long-term option to hedge their portfolios from long-term markets moves at a reduced
cost.
