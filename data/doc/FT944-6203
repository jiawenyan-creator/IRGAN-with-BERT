FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Moves to assist
insolvency recovery - Traders' debts
The chancellor proposes two further deregulatory changes to the rules which
limit the extent to which traders' pre-insolvency debts can be deducted from
VAT credits ('set-off') arising during an insolvency administration.
Customs and Excise said that when companies trade under administration
orders and administrative receiverships, VAT credits arising after recovery
will not be set off against debts remaining from the pre-insolvency period.
Customs also stipulated that the rules preventing set-off during the period
for which a provisional liquidator is appointed in the winding-up of a
company will also be applied during the period when an interim receiver is
appointed in the bankruptcy of an individual.
The chancellor's intention is to assist companies in their recovery from
insolvency and to respond to trade representations about minor anomalies in
existing legislation.
The chancellor also proposes to make a minor amendment to the legislation
affecting relief from VAT on bad debts. The chancellor's intention is to
clarify beyond doubt that relief is available only on supplies made on or
after April 1 1989.
The Insolvency Act 1986 enables creditors to allow a business to continue
trading while trying to make the business commercially viable. These
arrangements are known as voluntary arrangements, administration orders or
administrative receiverships.
Where there is no prospect of rescue the creditors may take action to have
the business declared formally insolvent, either through bankruptcy or
liquidation.
The cost to the Exchequer is estimated to be negligible.
The current bad debt relief scheme allows the recovery of VAT charged on any
supplies or services which remain unpaid after a 'waiting period'.
