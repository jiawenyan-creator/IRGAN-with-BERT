FT  03 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians 'losing cost
advantage'
Russian aluminium producers 'are starting to price themselves out of world
markets', according to a study by the Anthony Bird consultancy.
Russian production costs, which in mid-1993 were 61 per cent of western
levels, up from 46 per cent a year earlier, last month reached 94 per cent
and are 'still rising', Bird says. 'The flood of metal from east to west
will cease,' it suggests, as only two Russian smelters are likely to be
competitive in the longer term.
Bird calculates average western operating costs at 51.5 cents a pound,
compared with a market price yesterday of 49.2 cents. Inclusion of capital
servicing costs and normal profits raises the costs figure to 64.7 cents a
pound.
