FT  02 MAR 92 / EC official urges rapid rescue of CIS reform
A SENIOR European Community official has warned that the world is running
short of time to rescue reform in the former Soviet Union, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC commissioner for external relations said: 'I am
afraid we do not have much time left. We should learn something from what
happened to (ousted President Mikhail) Gorbachev.'
Speaking on his return from a tour of four former Soviet republics, Mr
Andriessen said he might urge relaxation of conditions that have held up a
Ecu1.25bn (Pounds 875m) EC loan to supply food and medicine, making it 'to
some extent a gift'.
Mr Andriessen will brief EC foreign ministers in Brussels today about his
tour, during which he heard several warnings of the risk that economic
chaos, especially in Russia, might lead to dictatorship.
Mr Andriessen dropped Russia from his week-long tour to Belarus, Ukraine,
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan because President Boris Yeltsin was not available
to meet him.
He said an international conference on the CIS in Lisbon in May must launch
a more comprehensive policy than what he called 'piecemeal' efforts so far
if the world wanted to avoid having to arrange new emergency relief next
winter.
New aid might be needed to shore up the reformers' positions even before
May, but it was unlikely to be forthcoming until publication of an
International Monetary Fund report on the CIS economy.
He said CIS member states would send a 'positive signal' if they
co-ordinated monetary policy, set up a rouble zone and avoided trade
barriers.
