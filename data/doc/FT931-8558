FT  18 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Short-dated gilts fall as retail data wipe
out rate cut hopes
SHORT-DATED UK govern-ment bonds fell as news of better-than-expected retail
sales figures wiped out hopes of a cut in the base rate before the March 16
budget.
Meanwhile, longer-dated issues edged higher on domestic buying interest,
resulting in a further flattening of the yield curve.
Retail sales climbed 1.6 per cent in January from December, showing the
strongest increase in more than 18 months and a sharp turnround after the
revised 1 per cent fall in sales during December.
Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, warned that there were no plans to adjust
interest rates.
The 10 per cent gilt due 1994 fell from 105 15/32 to 105 3/8 by late
afternoon to yield 5.75 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds closed higher, with investors encouraged to buy
bunds because of the strength of the D-Mark against the dollar.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 93.70 and traded up to a high of
93.88 before ending the day at around 93.85. Dealers said hopes of a
relatively good M3 figure and yesterday's repo gave the market a firm tone.
The Bundesbank accepted bids amounting to DM70.7bn in 14-day securities
repurchase agreements, representing a net injection of DM2.4bn in liquidity.
The repos were allocated at 8.49 per cent and above, compared with 8.50 per
cent and above at the previous repo.
Elsewhere in Europe, French government bond prices closed firmer, taking
their cue from the bund market. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due
2003 moved from 7.84 per cent to 7.76 per cent.
Among short-dated issues, the rally was less pronounced as the market
expects the Treasury to sell FFr17bn-FFr19bn of two and five-year bonds
today.
JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally, helped by the combination of a
strong yen, initial stock market weakness, and good investor demand for
nine-year and 10-year paper.
The June futures contract, which opened at 109.88, rose to a new high of
110.02 before ending at 109.90. The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB moved
from 4.17 per cent to 4.14 per cent, corresponding to the high price of the
day, but ended at 4.165 per cent.
US Treasury prices firmed across the maturity range yesterday as investors
bet that President Clinton would announce a credible package of
deficit-cutting measures in his State of the Union address to Congress,
which was scheduled for last night.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 100
9/32 , yielding 7.097 per cent, a new historical low. At the short end of
the market, the two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 13/32 , to yield 4.014 per
cent.
Prices initially firmed in the expectation that further losses in equities
would drive investors into government securities. The absence of another big
sell-off in the stock markets, however, kept those gains to a minimum.
Sentiment was also buoyed by the day's main economic news  - a 7.2 per cent
decline in January housing starts.
In the afternoon, Treasuries rose further on hopes that the president would
announce he will stick to his plans to raise taxes and cut spending as a way
of reducing the deficit. In particular, bond investors were looking for him
to unveil measures that would have a serious chance of passing through the
House and Senate.
