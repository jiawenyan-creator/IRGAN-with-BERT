CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
MEASURE LIMITING ELECTED TERMS FILED 
A coalition of taxpayer groups filed a proposed initiative for the November, 
1990, ballot that would limit state politicians to two terms. The measure, 
submitted to the attorney general's office in Sacramento for an official title 
and summary, would amend the state Constitution to limit the governor, other 
statewide elected officers and senators to eight years in office. Assembly 
members, whose terms are two years, could serve only four years. State 
politicians would also be barred from holding one office while running as a 
candidate for another. The measure would also strip lawmakers of special state 
pensions and retirement benefits. Proponents would need signatures from 595,485 
registered voters to qualify the proposed constitutional amendment for the 
ballot.
