CLU RENEWS TALKS WITH SHOUP 
Cal Lutheran has renewed negotiations for a settlement with fired football 
Coach Bob Shoup in an effort to avert a lawsuit, a member of the university's 
board of regents said Saturday. 
Shoup has rejected previous proposals, including one that would have paid him 
$183,000 as a buyout of his contract, and instead filed a grievance that 
claimed he held tenure as a coach as well as a faculty member. 
On Jan. 23, the regents' executive committee upheld a faculty decision denying 
the grievance. A meeting of the regents is scheduled Friday. 
"The executive committee wants to avoid a lawsuit," said Jim Tyner, a CLU 
regent. "I know that people at the school would very much like to get this 
resolved before the regents' meeting Friday." 
Shoup said that he is not personally participating in the negotiations. 
"There is no agreement or anything close to an agreement from what I 
understand," he said. BRENDAN HEALEY
