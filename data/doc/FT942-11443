FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (2): A much
healthier business than it was - Mergers and acquisitions have shrugged off
the stigma of the 1980s
In the 1990s takeover market was meant to be a more peaceful, moderate
affair than the superheated version of the 1980s, a number of 'firsts' in
recent months appear to have exploded the myth.
There was the first three-cornered multibillion dollar battle for control of
a US corporation this decade, for instance - the Dollars 10bn struggle
between Viacom and QVC for control of Paramount Communications.
Or the first big bid battle of the 1990s which was entirely bank-financed -
the Dollars 2bn tussle between Martin Marietta and Northrop for defence
contractor Grumman. And the first hostile proxy battle of the 1990s - GE
Capital's campaign to win the support of shareholders in Kemper, which has
so far rebuffed its Dollars 2bn offer.
These, and a host of other transactions announced since the start of last
year, suggest that the acquisition business has shrugged off the stigma it
acquired at the end of the 1980s, when buy-outs and other debt-financed
takeovers became notorious more for their ability to destroy value than
create it. Emboldened by the success of others - and perhaps fearing that
they will be left out in the race for attractive acquisition targets - more
and more chief executives are joining in.
The availability of finance has had a part to play, as it did in the 1980s.
Then, it was the junk bond market and the willingness of banks to advance
big bridging loans that pepped up the market.
Now, it is cheap equity, even after the recent correction in the stock
market. Also, low long-term interest rates have enabled many companies to
cut their interest bills by refinancing debt taken on in the 1980s, in turn
boosting their internal cash flow. And even the banks are back: financing
takeovers is one of the best-remunerated ways for banks to employ what for
many has become an excess of capital.
For all this, things are not what they were. The frenetic battle for
Paramount appeared to have more in common with the deals of the late 1980s
than the 1990s: the corporate tussle, a thinly veiled fight between the big
egos of the protagonists, the suggestions of overpaying, the strained
financial structure that resulted, the asset sales that will now follow to
play down debt. These characteristics have been largely absent from other
recent big transactions.
'It is a much healthier business than it was,' says Mr Felix Rohatyn, a
leading takeover adviser at Lazard in New York. 'We haven't seen the kind of
purely financially-driven transactions we saw in the 1980s - over-leveraged,
poorly financed, driven by a lot of market speculation.' Financial
engineering is out: other forces are at work behind the latest rush of
deals.
First, much of the takeover activity is being driven by a need to cut costs.
This is concentrated in particular in three industries: healthcare, banking
and defence.
In some corners of the healthcare world, mergers and acquisitions have come
to be seen as one answer to the pressure from managed care organisations to
restrain prices. The Clinton healthcare plan may add to this pressure, but
whatever the political outcome, there is little doubt that the healthcare
sector will remain under pressure to cut its costs.
Takeovers remain one solution. Columbia Healthcare - now the biggest
hospital group in the US, following its takeover last year of Hospital
Corporation of America - has made little secret of its aim to close down
excess hospital capacity.
Another service sector with a big cost problem - banking - has also been
subjected to a wave of takeovers and mergers. Typically, taking over a bank
should yield cost savings of around 30 per cent, says Mr John Tugwell, head
of National Westminster in the US. NatWest has been one of very few foreign
banks to get caught up in the consolidation of the US banking industry,
earlier this year announcing a takeover which will expand its presence in
New Jersey.
A second factor behind these and other takeovers has been a changing
regulatory and legal environment. Bank mergers, for instance, have gained
extra impetus from the likelihood that interstate banking will finally pass
into law later this year. The move by the 'Baby Bell' telephone companies
into cable television has been hastened by the threat to their own local
monopolies posed by planned legislation.
A third factor - technological advance - has also been behind the coming
together of what used to be three distinct industries: telecoms, cable
television and entertainment. A coming revolution in distribution - the
much-vaunted 500-channel cable TV, for instance - has intensified
competition between rival distribution channels, while at the same time
helping to bring together the distributors of programming with the
producers.
Says Mr Rohatyn: 'The things that we're doing, that most people are involved
in, are driven by either technological or regulatory or legislative changes
 -whether it is the regulation and technology of communications and media,
the legislation and the changes that are coming in healthcare, or in
banking, or in mutual funds.'
Partly for these reasons, much of the recent takeover activity by US
corporations has been concentrated within the US. At the end of the 1980s,
transatlantic takeovers were all the rage, reaching Dollars 47bn in value in
1989: since then, interest has dwindled. Takeover activity within the US, on
the other hand, last year bounced back almost to the same level reached in
1988 and 1989.
