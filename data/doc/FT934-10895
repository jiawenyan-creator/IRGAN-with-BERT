FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Powerscreen ahead to Pounds 12.6m - Sales
reach Pounds 59m thanks to the Far East and North America
POWERSCREEN International, the Northern Ireland-based manufacturer of
screening and stone crushing equipment, yesterday reported a 12.5 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits helped by strong sales growth,
particularly in the Far East and North America.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 11.2m to
Pounds 12.6m - the 11th successive increase.
Turnover on continuing activities increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 59.4m
against Pounds 51.3m, which included Pounds 5.92m from discontinued
operations.
Earnings per share rose to 10.8p (9.7p) from which the interim dividend is
being raised to 2p (1.8p). The shares closed up 3p at 372p.
Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, attributed the profit improvement to the
success of the group's strategy of focusing on its core manufacturing
activities.
He said this had resulted in each subsidiary, with the exception of CPV
which was acquired in September last year and therefore made no contribution
to last year's interim results, producing increased turnover.
Powerscreen International Distribution, the biggest subsidiary which
manufactures screening equipment, managed to lift its turnover by 15 per
cent to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 18.9m) buoyed by increased penetration of the
Far Eastern market and the continued recovery in North America. Unit sales
rose from 613 to 710.
Sales of a new jaw crusher launched in February, together with an upturn in
the UK crusher market helped Brown Lenox lift its sales by 18 per cent to
Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 11m.)
However, Matbro, which was acquired in 1991 and makes telescopic handling
machinery for the agriculture and construction markets, recorded the biggest
relative increase in turnover helped by strong exports to continental
Europe. Sales jumped by 66 per cent to Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.91m).
The introduction of the sub-contract labour system at Finlay, which
manufactures washing and screening equipment, lifted both turnover and
profits. Sales grew by 32 per cent to Pounds 7.71m (Pounds 5.51m).
The latest profit figures come after Pounds 700,000 of reorganisation costs
related to CPV, which manufactures pressurised vessels mainly for the
chemicals and food industries.
Overall, Mr McKeown said group order books remained strong, buttressed by
new products and strengthened dealer networks. The group ended the period
with net cash of Pounds 21.4m, up from Pounds 16.7m at the end of March.
