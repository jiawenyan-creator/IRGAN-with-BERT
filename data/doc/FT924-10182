FT  02 NOV 92 / Italian parties keep hold on bank posts
ITALY'S main political parties are down but not out, judging by the clutch
of appointments to head some of the country's big public-sector banks.
The latest batch of names - traditionally appointed on party political
grounds - - suggests the Amato government has only partly responded to the
national desire for change.
There are some new faces among the 72 appointments and re-confirmations,
notably with the choice of a few apolitical academics to bank chairmanships.
However, many former political appointees have also kept their jobs after
the expiry of their mandates.
The most prominent among the newcomers is Mr Giovanni Grottanelli de' Santi,
the new chairman of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which is one of Italy's
biggest and most conservative banks. An academic at the city's university,
Mr Grottanelli fills the job vacated over two years ago by Mr Piero Barucci,
now treasury minister, who left to become joint managing director of Credito
Italiano before joining the new government.
Among the most prominent political appointees to be reconfirmed was Mr
Roberto Mazzotta, Christian Democrat chairman of Cariplo, Italy's biggest
savings bank.
