INGRAM BRINGS OVER 2 EXECUTIVES FOR MERGED COMPANIES 
Ingram Industries, the Nashville-based company that is acquiring Micro D in 
Santa Ana, has appointed two of its executives as vice chairman and chief 
financial officer of the combined firms. 
David Blumstein, president of Ingram Industries' computer distribution business 
in Buffalo, N.Y., will become Micro D's vice chairman. He succeeds Harold L. 
Clark, who has resigned and plans to leave the company May 1. 
Mark Briggs, chief operating officer and executive vice president of Ingram 
Computer, was named chief financial officer and senior vice president. He 
replaces Godfred P. Otuteye, who also resigned and plans to leave the firm 
March 10. 
Ingram Industries is acquiring the 41% of Micro D's stock that it doesn't 
already own for $43.9 million. Ingram is merging its Buffalo distribution unit 
with Micro D, the nation's largest wholesaler of personal computer products. 
Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy will continue as chairman and chief executive of the 
merged company. No name for the merged company has been chosen yet. 
Lacy said the company is searching for a president and chief operating officer 
from outside Micro D and Ingram.
