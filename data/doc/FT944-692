FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Seasonal offers easily refused
Sir, In response to Adrian Furnham's amusing piece, 'The annual agony of
Christmas giving' (December 19), those offers I most easily refused this
year were:
A timeless design of watch;
Unbeatable carpet value;
Incalculable computer savings;
Cordless music centre.
