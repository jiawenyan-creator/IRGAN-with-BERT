FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Trading set to resume in Olipar
and Lucia shares
SHARES in Olipar, the French property company linked to Mr Christian
Pellerin, the property developer, and Lucia, one of its associate companies,
are expected to resume trading on the Paris stock market tomorrow.
The shares were suspended pending the completion of the arrangements for the
recapitalisation of Lucia, which involves a number of France's most
prestigious financial institutions as well as Olipar, and the announcement
of Olipar's interim results.
Olipar and Lucia, like a number of other French property companies, have
been badly affected by the slowdown in the property sector.
Lucia fell into heavy losses. On Friday it announced details of a FFr1.1bn
(Dollars 206m) recapitalisation involving injections of capital from its
major shareholders including the Axa insurance group and Banque Nationale de
Paris, as well as Suez and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, two of France's
largest holding companies.
