  [Text] There are is some disparity between the survey 
results on Finnish support for the EU currently in circulation. 
An unpublished poll carried out by Taloustutkimus Oy indicates 
that support for the EU has now risen to 48 percent, while 
another poll carried out by Suomen Gallup for HELSINGIN SANOMAT 
puts support at 42 percent. The survey carried out by 
Taloustutkimus was ready 16 March, while the survey carried out 
on behalf of HELSINGIN SANOMAT was published Tuesday, 22 March. 
  The Taloustutkimus poll, primarily intended for use by 
organizations, puts opposition to the EU at 26 percent. An 
equal proportion of respondents was undecided about their 
attitude. The Suomen Gallup survey showed 27 percent against 
and 30 percent undecided. The results indicating 48 percent in 
favor of the EU are part of a weekly follow-up study monitored 
by various organizations and the Foreign Ministry. Known as the 
Tele-Bus survey, it interviews 500 people between ages 15 and 
74. Suomen Gallup uses a sample of 1,000 people. Both polling 
institutes now use the same questionnaire format, which is 
intended for use in the forthcoming referendum. 
  The results of Taloustutkimus' published and unpublished 
polls have throughout shown a slightly higher number in favor of 
the EU than have Suomen Gallup's. "This is very hard to 
explain, especially after the harmonization of the 
questionnaires," Hanju Ilkas, research chief with the 
Taloustutkimus Institute, said. According to Ilkas, the only 
possible explanation is that people are simply influenced by the 
institute asking the questions.
