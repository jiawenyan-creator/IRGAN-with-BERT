SHEARSON HIRED TO STUDY FLUOR UNIT'S OPTIONS 
Fluor Corp. said Friday that it has retained Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to 
"explore strategic options" for its A. T. Massey Coal Co., raising speculation 
that Fluor may be considering a sale of the highly profitable unit. 
Fluor spokeswoman Deborah Land would not rule out the possibility that the 
Richmond, Va., coal company might be sold. 
"I never say 'never,' " she said. 
But she stressed that there are other options for the investment banker to 
study, including the possible expansion of the unit's operations or simply 
maintaining "the status quo." 
Herb Hart, an analyst with S. G. Warburg &amp; Co., said Irvine-based Fluor 
would be reluctant to sell Massey unless it got an exceptionally good offer. "I 
think they feel coal is an energy product and Fluor understands energy," said 
Hart, referring to Fluor's longstanding history in the hydrocarbon field. "I 
think they feel all forms of energy have appreciation potential." 
There is speculation that legislation to fight acid rain could make low-sulfur 
coal reserves of the kind Massey mines much more valuable. 
Hart said he thinks that instead of selling Massey immediately, Fluor "would be 
much more likely to sell stock in Massey to the public, as they did with the 
(St. Joe) gold operation, to establish a value for it." 
In 1986, Fluor spun off 10% of St. Joe Gold, its former gold mining unit, in a 
public stock sale. After testing the market, Fluor the next year sold the rest 
of St. Joe Gold and other gold properties for $500 million in cash.
