 

When the Commission originally proposed Rule 3a128, it recognized that the Rule might require amendment in
the future to extend its provisions to debt obligations of other foreign governments.

15

 Subsequently, the Commission amended the Rule to include within its coverage debt obligations issued by Japan, Australia,
France, New Zealand, Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, and Italy.

Release, 

supra 

note 12. In 1986, the rule was amended to include debt obligations of Japan. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23423
(July 11, 1986), 51 FR 25996 (July 18, 1986). In 1987, the Rule was amended to include debt obligations of Australia,
France, and New Zealand. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25072 (October 29, 1987), 52 FR 42277 (November 4, 1987).
In 1988, the Rule was amended to include debt obligations of Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
and West Germany. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26217 (October 26, 1988), 53 FR 43860 (October 31, 1988). In
1992, the Rule was again amended to (1) include debt obligations of the Republics of Ireland and Italy, (2) change the
country designation of ``West Germany'' to the ``Federal Republic of Germany,'' and (3) replace all references to
the informal names of the countries listed in the Rule with references to their official names. Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 30166 (January 6, 1992), 57 FR 1375. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Rule 3a128 has not been amended since 1992. Futures overlying Spanish government bonds originally were, and
currently are, only traded on the Mercado de Futuros Financieros (``Meff''), a Spanish financial futures exchange
located in Barcelona, Spain. For several months in 1993, the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange (``LIFFE'') traded a futures contract based on Spanish government bonds denominated in Pesetas.

17

 The Commission has been informed that U.S. citizens may be interested in derivative products based on securities
issued by foreign governments, including Spain, and has received a request that Rule 3a128 be amended to facilitate
such trading.

Letter from Wesley G. Nissen, Katten Muchin  Zavis, to William H. Heyman, Director, Division of Market Regulation,
Commission, dated January 14, 1993. Subsequent to the LIFFE request, the Commission published a proposal to amend
Rule 3a128 to include Spanish sovereign debt. Shortly thereafter, LIFFE ceased to trade futures on Spanish
debt. Recently, the Commission has been apprised of continuing interest by market participants in the proposed amendment
to Rule 3a128 because of the trading on the MEFF of futures on Spanish government debt. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission is amending Rule 3a128 to add Spain to the list of countries whose debt obligations are deemed
to be ``exempted securities'' under the terms of the Rule. Under this amendment, the existing conditions set forth
in the Rule (

i.e.,

 that the underlying securities not be registered in the United States, that the futures contracts require delivery
outside the United States, and that the contracts be traded on a board of trade) would continue to apply. This should
ensure that a domestic market in the unregistered foreign sovereign debt of Spain does not develop. Therefore, the
amendment should pose no risk for investors in the U.S. securities market. 



III. Discussion 



The Commission received two comment letters from the Finance Ministry of Spain in response to the proposal.

19

 The first letter objected to the rating of Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service (``Moody's'') and AA by Standard and Poor's
(``SP''), stating that such debt obligations should receive the same rating as two public Spanish companies:
Red Nacional de Ferrocarriles Espanoles (``RENFE'') and Instituto Nacional de Industria (``INI'').

20

 The letter also voiced concerns about the possible effects the rule proposal might have on Spain's debt management
and policies, and requested further time to study such effects.
