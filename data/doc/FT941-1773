FT  24 MAR 94 / Scuffles in Polish sell-off
At least three Polish investors were hurt yesterday as scuffles broke out
among thousands queuing to buy shares in a small manufacturer of plastic
containers. At one brokerage a crowd broke down the entrance door and
another was occupied by 200 buyers who refused to leave even when police
were called. The Domplast company offered 691,250 shares to investors who
could buy up to 200 shares each, paying Zl 140,000 (Pounds 4.30) a share on
a first-come, first-served basis. Hopeful investors queued for days outside
94 brokerages, hoping the price of shares would increase sharply when they
began trading, as happened after several recent public issues. Some people
even queued as citizens' committees, but many were later pushed aside by
organised groups hired by big private investors, according to the private
Radio Zet.
