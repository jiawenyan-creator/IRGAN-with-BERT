FT  05 MAY 94 / Pools group to launch lottery
Littlewoods, the football pools group which decided not to be involved in
bidding for the National Lottery, is setting up its own scratch-card lottery
to raise money for charity.
The UK's dominant football pools operator is working with four charities -
Age Concern, the NSPCC, the Roy Castle Cause for Hope Appeal and the
Spastics Society - to launch the lottery.
It will start in the north-west on June 20 with the aim of becoming
nationwide if successful.
The Pounds 1 lottery tickets will have a top prize of Pounds 25,000. By law
the Littlewoods lottery can only be a small affair. The maximum permitted
annual turnover for charitable lotteries was increased last year, but only
to Pounds 5m.
Many specialists believe that the National Lottery, which could begin before
the end of this year, may have revenues of around Pounds 4bn in a year or
two.
Under the rules, Littlewoods would be a promoter - such lotteries can only
be run by charities, local authorities or clubs.
Apart from the public relations benefit of raising money for charity,
Littlewoods may be trying to protect the income of their football pools
collectors who could be affected by a successful National Lottery.
Collectors would get a proportion of scratch-card money for selling the
cards.
The retailing and football pools group had pre-tax profits of Pounds 117.2m
last year. It decided not to be involved in bidding for the National Lottery
because it feared that, as the largest pools group, it would not have a
chance. However the Department of National Heritage made it clear to the
company that any application would be judged on its merits.
The successful bidder for the National Lottery licence is expected to be
announced before the end of this month.
