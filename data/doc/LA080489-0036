MORNING REPORT: STAGE 
Theatergoers who want to observe "Tradition," the opening number of "Fiddler on 
the Roof," at the Music Center should allow a few extra minutes to get to their 
seats. At least 200 patrons were left waiting in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
lobby Wednesday night when the curtain went up precisely at 8 p.m. They were 
ushered to their seats after "Tradition" had been performed. Sandra Kimberling, 
Music Center Operating Co. president, had no explanation for the unusually 
large number of latecomers Wednesday, but she noted that the show must begin 
promptly in order to avoid union charges for overtime, which begin after three 
hours. The show is timed to end at 10:59 p.m., one minute shy of the allotted 
three hours. "Fiddler" will be at the Music Center through Sunday, then moves 
to the Orange County Performing Arts Center for a week.
