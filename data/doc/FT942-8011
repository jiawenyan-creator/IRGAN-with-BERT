FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): New Tupolev
Vnukovo Airlines, the main Russian domestic carrier, hopes to certify the
new Tupolev Tu-204 medium-range airliner by the end of this year, an
official said. The airline plans to use the 214-seat twin-jet on internal
routes to replace the ageing Tupolev Tu-154 airliner. Three Tu-204s are at
present carrying out regular cargo flights inside Russia and abroad. The
first flight tests for the passenger version of the jet started in December
and no serious problems have been reported, the official said. Some
passenger variants of the new aircraft will be fitted with Russian engines
and some with power plants made by Rolls-Royce of the UK.
