FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: IMI to advise on Nuovo Pignone
issue
ENI, Italy's public-sector energy and chemicals group, has chosen Istituto
Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), the investment and financial services group, to
advise on the privatisation of its Nuovo Pignone subsidiary.
Florence-based Nuovo Pignone is the second of the state-owned companies
destined for accelerated privatisation following a surprise announcement by
the government in September. Last week, the IRI state holding group
appointed Merrill Lynch as its adviser in the sale of Credito Italiano.
It is widely expected that Nuovo Pignone, which earned net profits of
L37.1bn (Dollars 29.9m) after minority interests last year on sales of
L1,550bn, will be privatised via a trade sale, probably to one of the
world's big engineering groups.
The company, which employs about 5,000 at seven sites around Italy,
specialises in compressors and gas turbines, as well as a range of
energy-related equipment.
ENI gave no indication of how or when the sale would take place.
The group, which has already mandated Merrill Lynch, Union bank of
Switzerland and Banca Commerciale Italiana to report on how to go about a
disposal, appears concerned to avoid a sale to the highest bidder without
guarantees on job security and the development of Nuovo Pignone.
