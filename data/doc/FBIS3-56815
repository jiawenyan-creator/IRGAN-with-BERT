  [Text] Yerevan -- Under an edict issued by Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, major changes have been outlined 
in the activity of the State Directorate for National Security 
[SDNS]. 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan announced the dissolution of the 
operational services of the SDNS, the discontinuation of state 
border guard activities, and the curtailment of the operations 
carried out by the so-called security services. The president's 
edict also makes cadre changes to the SDNS leadership, namely 
appointing David Shakhnazaryan, until recently the Armenian head 
of state's former special representative at the Nagorno-Karabakh 
talks, to the post of acting chairman. 
  Aram Abramyan, the Armenian president's press secretary, 
noted in an interview with me that the SDNS's functions should 
only include intelligence and counterintelligence tasks. 
Regarding the other functions of the former KGB, Mr. Abramyan 
reminded me that the structures of this organization were 
established during the era of the Soviet Union when they served 
other purposes -- primarily the persecution of dissidents. 
Because we are currently living in a period of democratic 
changes, these tasks no longer exist and Armenia's citizens 
enjoy all freedoms, and therefore the special services should 
only carry out the functions indicated above. 
  Many observers in Yerevan have also focused attention on the 
fact that the new director of the country's special services, 
unlike his predecessor Eduard Simonyants, is a leader of the 
ruling Armenian Pan-National Movement. His appointment to this 
important post is in many ways connected with the increased 
influence of the party in the formation of the country's 
domestic and foreign policy.
