JOHN LONGDEN MADE HIS LAST RIDE PAY OFF 
Conspicuous by its absence among Earl Gustkey's examples of sports figures who 
retired "the right way" was John Longden. 
In the final race of his great riding career, Longden won Santa Anita's San 
Juan Capistrano Handicap by a nose while aboard George Royal on March 12, 1966. 
George Royal was not the favorite, either. He was given only a so-so chance, 
going off at odds of 6-1. Yet, Longden ended his riding career with a win in 
fairy-tale fasion, providing thoroughbred racing with one of its most emotional 
moments ever. 
Longden retired as winningest jockey in history with 6,032 victories. It was a 
record that stood until Bill Shoemaker broke it in 1970. 
The win by Longden on George Royal will be a difficult act to top for Shoemaker 
when he rides in his final race sometimes in the not too distant future.
