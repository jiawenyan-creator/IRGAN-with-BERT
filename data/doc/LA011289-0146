10 : TO-THE-DOOR GROCERS; 
MARKETS PROVIDE HOME DELIVERY OF FOOD ITEMS 
Whether you depend on the service regularly or just use it once in a while, a 
market that delivers can be worth its weight in groceries. Those in the 
Southland range widely in size, specialties and business policies. 
The following information was compiled through interviews with each market but 
doesn't tell the whole story. It would be best to visit the store you plan to 
use, and check the scope of items available, prices and the quality you can 
expect to receive. If it's physically impossible to go to the market, place a 
minimum (or small) order that provides a sampling of fresh produce and meat, 
poultry or fish. 
All of these markets stress personal service, but find out about their other 
specialties. Some pride themselves on their meats, others tout their fish or 
produce. Ask about items they carry exclusively. Prices vary, but don't expect 
to find any discounting. 
Also, to prevent any later misunderstandings, discuss with a person in 
authority: 
 -- What delivery charge, if any, there will be to your exact address. 
 -- Double check the hours and days of the week that telephone orders are 
accepted and how long it will take to receive the groceries once you've placed 
an order. 
 -- Find out if the vehicle used to make the delivery is equipped with 
refrigeration. If not, will the groceries reach you quickly enough to still be 
in optimum condition? 
 -- Arrange how payment will be made. Some stores accept nationally recognized 
credit cards or personal checks. Others invite in-house charge accounts and 
bill monthly.
