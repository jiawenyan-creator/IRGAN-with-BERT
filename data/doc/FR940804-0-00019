SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On April 4, 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 15689) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of New Jersey for its Emission Statement Program. The SIP revision was submitted to satisfy Section 182(a)
of the Clean Air Act which requires stationary sources to report on an annual basis their emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

). 


Conclusion 


The rationale for EPA's proposed approval was explained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and will not be restated
here since EPA's final action does not differ from the proposed action. EPA inadvertently omitted reference in the
Proposed Rulemaking to Subchapter 1, ``General Provisions''; Subchapter 8, ``Permits and Certificates, Hearings,
and Confidentiality''; and Subchapter 16, ``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Volatile Organic Compounds,''
but will take action on the changes made to these subchapters in a subsequent rulemaking. No public comments were received
on the proposed action. Therefore, EPA is approving New Jersey's SIP revision incorporating Subchapter 21, ``Emission
Statements.'' 
Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
This rule makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 15689, April 4, 1994. As noted elsewhere in this notice, EPA received
no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. 
This rule has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the


Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 22142225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements
of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993. 
OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.
