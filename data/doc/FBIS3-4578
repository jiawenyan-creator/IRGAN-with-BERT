  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Monday [28 February] reiterated he will make a 
policy speech to the Diet on March 7, instead of initially 
scheduled March 4. 
  Hosokawa repeated his intention to reporters at the prime 
minister's official residence. Responding to a reporter's 
question if the speech will be on March 7, he said, 
"yes...Probably so." 
  A government source on Monday said preparations were 
continuing on the speech to be in time for March 4. The source 
also said postponement of the policy speech was not caused by a 
delay by government officials. 
  The prime minister, foreign minister, finance minister and 
the Economic Planning Agency director general usually give 
speeches in late January at the start of a 150-day ordinary Diet 
session. 
  Hosokawa and the three ministers have yet to deliver the 
speeches to the Diet because of a delay in the compilation of 
the state budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1.
