  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government welcomed the 
"firm stand" adopted by U.S. President Bill Clinton regarding 
the situation in the Bosnian town of Gorazde. Government 
spokesman Dieter Vogel said in Bonn today that military and 
economic measures against the continued aggression by Serb 
combat troops are among "the allies' options to make the Serb 
leadership see reason." 
  Vogel added that close political cooperation is needed 
between the European Union and NATO as well as the United 
Nations, the United States, and Russia to achieve this. This 
would allow "maximum pressure" to be exerted on the Serb 
leadership. The German Government therefore welcomes Clinton's 
expressed intention to work in close coordination particularly 
with Russia to prepare the ground for further measures.
