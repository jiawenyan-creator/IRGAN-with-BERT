  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Chu Song-il, chairman 
of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade 
Unions of Korea, Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central 
Committee of the League of the Socialist Working Youth of Korea, 
and Choe Song-suk, chairman of the Central Committee of the 
Union of Agricultural Working People of Korea, published 
statements Friday in support of the policy of national 
reunification set forth by the great leader President Kim 
Il-song in his New Year address. 
  They called upon the fellow countrymen in the North, South 
and overseas to accomplish the cause of national reunification, 
firmly united under the banner of great unity of the whole 
nation, regardless of differences in ideology, idea and system. 
  Chu Song-il said that if the South Korean authorities really 
want to pursue civilian politics, they must begin with the 
abolition of the anti-democracy, anti-reunification fascist laws 
and repressive tools and with reforms of the system for 
democracy and institutional reforms for reunification and ensure 
free activities of people of all strata calling for national 
reunification. 
  Choe Yong-hae held that the nuclear problem of the Korean 
peninsula must be peacefully resolved by means of negotiation, 
that is through DPRK-U.S. talks in any case. "The imperialists 
and reactionaries must act with discretion, looking straight at 
the indomitable will of the young people of Korea to defend 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander with their lives, 
becoming 5 million shells and bombs, and defend the sovereignty 
of the country and the gains of revolution with their blood," he 
warned. 
  Choe Song-suk said: 
  "Our agricultural working people can never pardon the 
criminal act of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique in opening the 
rice market, even wringing the necks of the South Korean 
farmers, driven by the foolish intention to do harm to fellow 
countrymen."
