  [Text] The National Assembly narcotics commission yesterday 
approved a draft law establishing stiffer penalties for drug 
related crimes and updating the type of activities considered to 
be money laundering. 
  The commission unanimously approved the draft and passed it 
on to the Assembly plenum for its second debate as an emergency 
bill. 
  The bill defines the strategy for fighting the production, 
consumption, and trafficking of drugs, money laundering, 
possession of goods and assets produced through drug 
trafficking, and related crimes. 
  The document is a combination of proposals presented by 
Legislator Leo Gonzalez and Acting Attorney General Jorge Ramon 
Valdes. It also includes recommendations made by the UN 
International Narcotics Convention held in 1988 in Vienna. 
  The draft improves the current description and adds several 
types of criminal activities to the list, including covert 
operations and controlled deliveries.
