FT  23 OCT 92 / De Klerk move on amnesty draws fire
SOUTH AFRICAN President F W de Klerk has been roundly condemned for his
decision to force through legislation letting the state pardon officials who
committed apartheid crimes.
The African National Congress (ANC) yesterday described the step as
unacceptable and repeated its warning that it would nullify any amnesty
legislation introduced by the existing government.
The Further Indemnity Bill, described by one parliamentarian as a 'charter
for crooks, criminals and assassins', was also severely criticised by Mr
Colin Eglin, chairman of the Liberal Democratic party. 'This is really
minority domination when they should be demonstrating a sensitivity for
power-sharing. They are forcing this through despite overwhelming
opposition,' said Mr Eglin.
Following the defeat of the bill in parliament on Wednesday, Mr de Klerk
decided to refer the legislation to the President's Council, the appointed
body widely considered to be a means of rubber-stamping legislation that has
failed to gain parliament's assent.
