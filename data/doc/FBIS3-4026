  [Text] Geneva, March 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan has formally 
protested a Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) decision to change its name in CITES reports on 
wildlife conservation. 
  The Taiwan delegation to a CITES Standing Committee meeting 
here issued a strongly-worded statement Thursday [24 March] 
saying Taiwan is not a province of the People's Republic of 
China and has never been ruled by Beijing. 
  The statement also expressed regret over Beijing's attempt 
to 
"politicize" wildlife conservation issues. "Such 
politically-motivated moves will do no good for wildlife 
conservation and we will never accept the name change," the 
statement said. 
  Under strong Beijing pressure, the United Nations wildlife 
conservation organization decided to refer to "Taiwan" as 
"Taiwan, China" in its reports on wildlife conservation on the 
island. 
  The statement, issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, said Beijing's attempt to downgrade Taiwan's status in 
the international arena would only worsen relations across the 
Taiwan Strait and cannot alter the fact that Taiwan is a 
separate political entity. 
  The English-language statement also said Taiwan will 
continue 
its efforts to eliminate illicit trade in endangered species and 
actively join in world wildlife conservation programs. 
  The statement has been distributed to foreign delegates to 
the CITES Standing Committee meeting, including committee 
Chairman Murray Hosking.
