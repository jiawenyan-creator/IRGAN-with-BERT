FT  04 SEP 92 / Mexico to privatise nine ports
THE MEXICAN government is to privatise the country's ports in an attempt to
boost their productivity, the finance and transport and communication
ministries have announced.
Mexico is to auction concessions to manage nine ports across the country,
including those at Acapulco, Progreso, Lazaro Cardenas and Manzanillo.
Puertos Mexicanos, the state ports authority, is to be disbanded.
The share of trade handled by Mexico's ports has been steadily falling over
recent years, with the US port at Houston handling more Mexican goods than
any national port, thanks to lower prices and greater reliability.
The privatisation is part of a broader government programme to privatise the
country's infrastructure. The government has said it will sell off
concessions to run selected airports, and has awarded concessions to build
3,700km of toll roads.
While the Mexican economy is slowing down, the transport and communication
and construction industries grew by 7.6 per cent and 4.9 per cent
respectively in the first half of this year.
Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, has said Mexico will need another
Dollars 4bn to complete the toll road programme. The government is designing
international infrastructure bonds, but has urged the private sector to
raise capital.
