FT  08 MAY 91 / Spanish Iberia airline staff force flight cancellations
STRIKING ground staff and cabin crews yesterday forced the cancellation of
168 Iberia flights, most of them to international destinations, in the
opening round of a tough union response to wage restraint policies in
Spain's public sector companies, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
Industrial action over the next two weeks is expected to spread to the
national railways, to Telefonica, the telecommunications monopoly, to the
state-controlled shipbuilding and aerospace industries, and to the publicly
owned gas companies which are all currently involved in annual wage
negotiations.
The Iberia strike, the first of four 24-hour stoppages planned at the
airline this month, followed a management decision to freeze salary
increases this year. The company lost Pta22.5bn (Pounds 123.6m) last year.
