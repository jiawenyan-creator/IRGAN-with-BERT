  [Text] A group of 136 Brazilian gold miners have been 
besieged by Venezuelan soldiers 1 km from the Brazilian border, 
in the jungle area bordering western Roraima. 
  The miners hid in the jungle last week, escaping a military 
operation set in motion by Venezuela to repress gold mining in 
its territory. 
  One miner died and seven others -- who are still being 
treated by their fellow miners -- were seriously wounded. 
  Itamaraty has tried to convince Caracas to permit a joint 
operation for rescuing the besieged miners, who do not want to 
surrender to Venezuelan soldiers, fearing retaliation. 
  In Brasilia, diplomats who are following the developments 
have said that if no negotiated solution is found the Amazonas 
Military Command will be ordered to unilaterally perform the 
action. 
  The report was not officially confirmed, but it prompted 
consultations between Itamaraty and the Army leadership. 
  Brazil and Venezuela are playing with fire. 
  The demarcation of their borders is imprecise and dangerous, 
as in situations of tension when the two countries' forces come 
too close to one another. 
  Jose Altino, president of the Trade Union Gold Miners of the 
Legal Amazonas, yesterday tried to confirm that a new, identical 
incident occurred north of Roraima.
