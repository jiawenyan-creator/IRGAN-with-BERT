METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER ON PICKET LINE KNOCKED DOWN BY BUS 
A picketing Greyhound bus driver was knocked down by a bus driven by a 
temporary employee at the company's downtown Los Angeles bus terminal Friday, 
but was not seriously hurt. 
Frank Turner, 50, of Gardena, said he was hit by a San Diego-bound bus as he 
and about 10 other demonstrators formed a picket line at the Greyhound garage 
near the corner of 7th and Maple streets. 
Turner said he got into an argument with the bus driver and was knocked to the 
sidewalk as the bus moved forward. 
"If the doctors say I'm all right and there are no broken bones, I'll be out 
here again," said Turner, a 23-year veteran driver. "It will take an act of 
Congress to keep me off this picket line."
