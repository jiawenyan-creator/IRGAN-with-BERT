FT  09 SEP 92 / Two peacekeepers die in Sarajevo convoy ambush
TWO French soldiers were killed when machine gun fire raked a United Nations
convoy bringing food and other supplies into the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo
last night.
The convoy of 35-40 trucks, which had travelled from Belgrade, came under
fire as it approached the airport on the western edge of the besieged city,
a UN official said. At least two other soldiers with the convoy were
wounded.
'We do not know at this point which side attacked the convoy,' the UN
official said. Both Serb irregulars and Bosnian government forces are
entrenched in positions near the airport.
It is the second time in five days that UN forces have mourned colleagues
lost in Bosnia. On Thursday UN relief flights were suspended after an
Italian plane carrying humanitarian aid to Sarajevo was apparently downed in
mountains, killing the four crew.
Two other UN peacekeepers, both Ukrainian soldiers, were killed earlier and
48 have been wounded.
The latest convoy was bringing in relief supplies for the UN peacekeeping
mission in Sarajevo.
Earlier yesterday the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said food stocks in
Sarajevo were dwindling rapidly and the city could run out of supplies by
the end of the week. But UN officials warned that international relief
flights were unlikely to be resumed in the next few days.
Last night's incident came as the UNHCR stepped up road convoys to Sarajevo
from Split in Croatia to offset the airlift suspension. But a shortage of
trucks and drivers means the city is getting only half its daily food needs
of 190 tonnes. Ms Sylvana Foa, for the UNHCR, said yesterday only 100 tonnes
of flour and 90 tonnes of rice remained in its Sarajevo warehouses.
Representatives of the three warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina will
today give UN officials in Geneva their response to proposals to improve the
security of humanitarian flights. These include a ban on military flights.
