FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: GE improves 6% to Dollars 1.06bn
GENERAL Electric, the US group whose interests range from power systems to
financial services, unveiled a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter net
earnings, to Dollars 1.06bn from Dollars 999m a year earlier.
Earnings per share advanced 7 per cent to Dollars 1.23 from Dollars 1.15,
reflecting a five-year Dollars 10bn share repurchase programme. Revenues
grew 2 per cent to Dollars 13.5bn from Dollars 13.3bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said the company expected good results in 1992 in
spite of the continued fragility of the global economy. He cited an upturn
in US short-cycle order trends, continued productivity and improvements in
cash generation.
Mr Welch said the company's power systems, medical systems and financial
services operations had contributed to the improvement in the first quarter.
GE's NBC broadcasting operations also recorded better first-quarter results.
However, the recession's impact on short-cycle, high-margin business was
reflected in a decline in operating margins, to 11.7 per cent in the quarter
from 12.1 per cent.
Sharply higher underwriting and retail investor activity at Kidder Peabody,
its stockbroking arm, also contributed to the improvement.
First-quarter operating profits fell in GE's aircraft engines, aerospace,
appliances and materials businesses. In addition, the group's industrial
operating profit was much lower, reflecting a drop in first-quarter
locomotive shipments and continuing recessionary pressure on electrical
distribution and control.
