FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lonrho plays down rights hint
MR RENE Leclezio, chairman of Lonrho, yesterday said the international
trading conglomerate was considering another rights issue.
However, the conglomerate's financial advisers moved quickly to dampen
expectations of an imminent rights issue. One said: 'It was not part of the
prepared script. Mr Leclezio was simply speaking off the cuff. There are no
immediate plans for another rights issue.'
Questioned by shareholders at the annual meeting, Mr Leclezio said: 'Very
soon we will be able, we might even need a rights issue. It would need to be
at a deep discount to the market price at the time.'
Lonrho's recent rights issue was priced at 85p a share compared to the 72p
price of its ordinary shares at the time.
Some shareholders expressed unhappiness that the rights was priced above the
market price. Lonrho's shares yesterday fell 1 1/2 p to 83 1/2 p.
At a subdued, although generally supportive meeting, Mr Leclezio denied that
there was any 'black hole' in the conglomerate's accounts.
He said: 'I often read unjustified press comments implying that there is
something hidden, or something to hide in Lonrho's accounts. There is no
black hole.'
Mr Leclezio also told shareholders that Lonrho's capital expenditure
programme was coming to an end, and he said that by the next AGM he may have
a big new acquisition to talk about.
'I hope by next year to be able to tell you of a further acquisition,' he
said.
