  [Text] V. Kebich, chairman of the Belarusian Council of 
Ministers, has received the leaders of the board of the Russian 
joint-stock company, Gazprom. An agreement was signed, 
according to which 16 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will 
be delivered to Belarus this year. Later it is planned to 
double this figure. The request of the Belarusian side to lower 
prices for supplies of gas to the republic was received 
sympathetically.
