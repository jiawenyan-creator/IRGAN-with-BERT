FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Italian bank set to lift bid for
stake in competitor
Shares in Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), were suspended yesterday morning amid
growing speculation that Credito Italiano (Credit), the Milan-based bank,
was preparing an improved offer for its Bolognese competitor.
Credit revealed a month ago that it was planning a L2,000bn (Dollars 1.24bn)
bid for a 48 per cent stake in Rolo which would give it control of the bank.
Rolo has reacted defensively, reviving plans for a merger with CAER, parent
of the local savings bank, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo).
Credit's shares fell by more than 4 per cent yesterday on speculation that
the bank might have to pay as much as L23,000 a share for Rolo, against
Friday's closing price of L17,096, and bid for a larger stake.
In its original plans, Credit said it was prepared to offer L19,000.
Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, suspended the Rolo shares after
Italian newspapers reported at the weekend that Credit was planning a new
bid in an attempt to win over Rolo's shareholders before December 19, when
they must vote on the merger plans.
Mr Enzo Berlanda, Consob chairman, yesterday told Ansa, the Italian news
agency, that work was under way on the Credit-Rolo dossier at the
authority's Milan offices.
Credit's promised bid has still not been approved by the Bank of Italy,
which supervises the Italian banking system. That puts the Milan bank at a
disadvantage, because the central bank has already given the go-ahead to the
Carisbo-Rolo merger.
The Bolognese banks have laid great emphasis on preserving their regional
roots, which suggests that extra cash would not be enough to win over local
Rolo shareholders to the Credit offer.
The Milan bank might also have to make certain guarantees of shareholder
rights.
