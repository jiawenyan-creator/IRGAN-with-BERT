  [Text] Dozens of Hebron and Qiryat Arba' settlers 
yesterday received orders restricting their movements in Hebron. 
The orders are signed by the commander of the Central Command. 
Orders were also issued yesterday to seven Samaria settlers, 
restricting their movements in Arab population centers, 
including Nabulus. Among those who received the orders are four 
settlers from Kfar Tapuah, including Binyamin Kahana. Two 
others are from the settlement of Yitzhar in Samaria. According 
to the order, the weapons of the seven will be confiscated. 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 2 March, in a page A1 report 
by Nadav Shragay, adds the following: "The settlers who received 
the orders were told they can appeal the order before the 
appeals committee sitting in the Ramallah military court."]
