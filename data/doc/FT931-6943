FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Danske Bank reports DKr1.7bn
loss
DEN DANSKE BANK reported a loss of DKr1.7bn (Dollars 274m) in 1992, against
a profit of DKr1.22bn in the previous 12 months, but the board expects an
improvement this year. Profits on core operations rose from DKr334m to
DKr702m.
The bank displayed its confidence in the future by proposing to maintain
unchanged the dividend of DKr12 a share. Continued high provisions and a
large loss on the valuation of the securities portfolio pulled down the 1992
performance.
Loss provisions increased from DKr2.88bn to DKr2.94bn, but were considerably
lower in both years that in 1990, when they peaked at DKr 4.25bn. The value
of the group's shares and bonds portfolio fell by DKr1.03bn.
The downturn in the economy of the Faeroe Islands contributed to the group's
loss. Foroya Bank, in which Danske owns 81 per cent, made a loss of DKr395m
and had to be recapitalised by Danske.
The bank's equity capital and reserves declined from DKr20.7bn to DKr18.3bn,
but total capitalisation, including tier 2 capital, was virtually unchanged
at DKr27.6bn.
As the balance sheet was reduced to DKr336.7bn from DKr363.4bn, the capital
adequacy ratio increased from 10.2 to 11.0 per cent.
An independent report has criticised Norwegian authorities for failing to
stop Norway's biggest insurance firm, UNI Storebrand, from launching a
disastrous raid on Swedish rival Forsakrings Skandia.
A commission led by former supreme court judge Erling Sandene said the
Finance Ministry and the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission should
have blocked UNI purchases of Skandia shares - which later crashed in value.
