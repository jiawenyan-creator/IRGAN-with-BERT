FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
STOP-LOSS selling in the stock index futures sector helped to restrain the
equity market yesterday, writes Terry Byland.
The December FT-SE 100 contract fell to a discount both against the cash
market and the index's estimated fair value premium as traders sold out
futures positions built up at the market's peak.
Such positions are traditionally subject to 'stop-loss' market levels at
which the trader can sell out his client's position, and it was these
safeguards which sprang into action yesterday.
December was at a discount for most of the session and at its low point
stood at a 7-point discount to cash and around 18 discount to fair value,
now estimated by some houses in the 8 1/2 to 10-point area.
The contract steadied to close at a discount of around one point to the cash
market, or 11 to fair value, after heavy turnover of 13,707 lots. Most
business came from independent traders.
Traded options were less active than on Friday, with contracts dipping to
43,626 from 64,958 and the FT-SE option down from 37,017 to 23,750. The Euro
FT-SE option saw 6,633 contracts transacted. Individual stock options were
headed by J. Sainsbury as investors continued to reshape portfolios in the
light of increased price competition in the sector. Fisons (1,102 lots)
reflected adverse press reports on marketing tactics.
