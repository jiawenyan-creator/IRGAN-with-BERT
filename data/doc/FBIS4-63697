  [Text] Fighting broke out overnight between Russian border 
guards and Tajik rebels who tried to infiltrate into 
Tajikistan's Panj region from neighboring Afghanistan. There 
are no casualties among Russian troops, a military source told 
INTERFAX. No word is given of the number of killed or wounded 
on the rebels' side. 
  There have been as many as four incidents since last Friday 
[20 May] in which Russian forces opened artillery and mortar 
fire on small groups of armed rebels as they tried to infiltrate 
the country along two sections of the Afghan border. None of 
Russian troops were hurt, but there is no word of casualties on 
the rebels' side. 
  Any attempt at illegal border crossing will be suppressed, a 
senior official of the Russian Border Forces in Tajikistan said.
