JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS 
The 1990 edition of the "Vermont Traveler's Guidebook" is packed with 
information on touring, riding, camping, biking, boating, ballooning, 
fairs/festivals, shopping/antiques, music/arts/galleries, lodging. Lists 
hundreds of inns, including the Inn on Covered Bridge Green in West Arlington, 
the former home of Norman Rockwell. Another Rockwell landmark (Four Winds 
County Inn) is surrounded by 50 acres. Borders the Battenhill River in the same 
village. Few inns in the entire state, though, can match the Old Tavern at 
Grafton that's been serving wayfarers since 1801. 
The directory names dozens of other inns. In addition you get a map of Vermont, 
a listing of summer events. For a free kit, send a post card to the Vermont 
Travel Division, Department R044, 134 State St., Montpelier, Vt. 05602.

Pacific Northwest: Photographer Michael Polinder prepares itineraries for 
travelers "interested in venturing off the beaten path" in the Pacific 
Northwest. Loads of inside information on towns, villages, lakes, mountains, 
hiking trails, fishing. Polinder proposes to share his knowledge with travelers 
by "introducing them to places they normally wouldn't think of visiting." A 
seven-day tailored itinerary costs $20. Besides preparing itineraries, Polinder 
publishes a newsletter featuring the Pacific Northwest. Single copies: $1. 
Write to Polinder, 8077 Kayak Way, Blaine, Wash. 98230.

Villefranche-sur-Mer and Cagnes-sur-Mer on the French Riviera. Rates: $350/$700 
a week for two, three, four-bedroom apartments. Villas start at $750. The same 
representative lists condos in Switzerland ($425/$600) per week. Lower rates in 
the off-season. 
Guests travel during the day, return to their home or condo at night. No 
fretting over packing/unpacking. Prepare a picnic lunch and take off for the 
day. The idea of the "home base" vacation is catching on across the Continent.

Beyond the Golden Gate: Vacationers looking for Old World atmosphere can book a 
room at the Pelican Inn at Muir Beach. This is a Tudor-style mansion across San 
Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. Appears like a 16th-Century English country 
inn. Seven rooms with private baths, leaded windows. A bar with a dart board. 
Several years ago we gave the Pelican Inn four hearts for romance. When the fog 
rolls in, the proprietor stokes the fire and guests slip off to rooms with 
half-tester beds. It's like waking up at a pleasant inn on the coast of 
Britain. Because of its popularity, early reservations are necessary. 
Especially on weekends. Worth the stop, though, even if you can't get a room. 
The Pelican's restaurant serves breakfast, lunch, dinner. 
Pelican Inn, Muir Beach 94965, telephone (415) 383-6000. Rates: $115/$140, 
including breakfast. Closed on Monday.
