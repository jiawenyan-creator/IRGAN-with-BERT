  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said today [words 
indistinct] in light of the Sunday [16 January] visit to Greece 
by international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
Papoulias said he might visit the three sides involved in the 
Yugoslav issue, and then he may convene an extraordinary 
European Union [EU] foreign ministers meeting to promote a 
solution to the Bosnian problem. 
  Replying to a question [words indistinct] that the 
recognition of Skopje by EU member states did not violate 
communal solidarity, the foreign minister said Greece considered 
it a serious violation of communal solidarity and that Skopje's 
intransigence -- especially in light of Greece assuming the 
presidency -- should have restrained the European partners. 
Papoulias reiterated that the Greek side wants Skopje to exist 
as a state, but noted that [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov 
must first take goodwill steps toward Greece.
