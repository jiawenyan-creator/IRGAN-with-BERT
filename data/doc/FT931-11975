FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Brandon Hire
A reduction of Pounds 50,000 in the depreciation charge and of Pounds 30,000
for interest costs enabled Brandon Hire to almost treble its interim pre-tax
profit.
Turnover of the group - which hires power and other tools, catering
equipment and furniture - showed no improvement at Pounds 2.17m in the six
months ended October 31 1992, against Pounds 2.19m, but profit rose from
Pounds 23,000 to Pounds 61,000.
Earnings per share were 0.59p (0.23p) but no interim dividend is being paid.
Previously it was 0.1p and represented the total for the year.
