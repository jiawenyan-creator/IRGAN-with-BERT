  [Text] Last night, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman had 
talks with Douglas Hogg, minister of state in the British 
Foreign Office. According to Hogg, the talks focussed on the 
negotating process between the Croatian Government and the local 
Serb authorities from the UN protected areas and the Washington 
agreement. Hogg emphasized that he and the Croatian president 
had not discussed the possibility of using external influence to 
resolve the issue of the UN protected areas. In Hogg's view, 
the London conference remained the most effective mechanism for 
reaching a solution.
