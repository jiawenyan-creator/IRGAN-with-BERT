FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba sets out its stall to
investors
CUBA, RECOGNISING that competition between 'frontier' oil regions for new
investment is fierce, has staged presentations before 30 oil explorers and
producers this month in Calgary and London offering 11 blocks - seven
onshore, three offshore and one offshore/onshore.
Major oil companies present included Statoil, Shell, OMV (Austria) Elf,
Total, Nippon Oil and Lasmo; middle-ranking companies such as Ranger Oil and
Bow Valley (a British Gas subsidiary), and a large number of small
entrepreneurial explorers such as Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy and Sweden's
Taurus Petroleum. Three international US oil companies were represented by
their UK affiliates.
Other companies said by Cuban officials to be 'seriously interested' include
PanCanadian Petroleum and New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge.
Total, Braspetro, Taurus Petroleum, and Canada Northwest Energy, have
already obtained blocks during previous bilateral negotiations.
The presence of a representative from the DTI's offshore supplies division
at the presentation indicates UK government recognition that Britain could
eventually obtain some of this business.
