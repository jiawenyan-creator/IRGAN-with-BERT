FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P cuts Salomon debt rating
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday downgraded the
debt of Salomon Inc, a week after the group's Salomon Brothers securities
broking unit reported its second con-secutive quarter of heavy losses.
The downgrading of Salomon's senior debt rating, from single A minus to
triple B plus, will make it more expensive for Salomon to raise funds in the
capital markets, because issuers with lower ratings have to offer higher
yields to convince investors to buy their debt.
'The immediate effect is a higher cost of funding for Salomon,' said Mr
Michael Flanagan, securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical in New
York.
The loss of an A rating will also shrink the pool of potential buyers of
Salomon's debt, because some institutions do not invest in securities listed
below an A rating.
S&amp;P also lowered its ratings on Salomon's subordinated debt and preferred
stock, but left its ratings on the group's commercial paper unchanged.
Explaining its decision, the agency said: 'Salomon's earnings in the current
market downturn have been substantially weaker than that of other
institutional firms, as the firm lost Dollars 247m in the first nine months
of this year.'
S&amp;P also said it was concerned that, in unfavourable market conditions,
Salomon's volatile trading operations - where most of the losses this year
have been incurred - exposed it to 'additional weak performance'.
Salomon responded to S&amp;P's move by saying that it was confident of its
earnings potential. It also said that it would continue to monitor expenses
closely, and would maintain 'a flexible, responsive attitude toward its
business opportunities'.
