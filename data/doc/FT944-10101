FT  12 NOV 94 / Russian HIV law is endorsed
Russia's parliament yesterday overwhelmingly endorsed a law requiring
foreigners to be tested for the HIV virus before entering the country. Only
three deputies voted against. The draft law, which must still be passed by
the upper house of parliament and the president, would require all
foreigners to submit HIV test certificates or undergo testing at the border.
Western and Russian health officials have criticised the law, warning that
it could prove difficult, and given Russia's shortage of sterilised
syringes, dangerous to implement. Western diplomats are considering lobbying
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to veto the bill, but he may find it
politically awkward to oppose such a broadly popular measure.
