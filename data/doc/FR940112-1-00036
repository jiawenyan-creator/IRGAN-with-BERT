<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) adopted by the Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) on February 23, 1993, and by the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution
Control District (SBCAPCD) on December 10, 1991. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted these revisions
to EPA on April 6, 1993, and June 19, 1992, respectively. The revisions concern SMAQMD's Rule 454, Degreasing Operations,
and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. SMAQMD's Rule 454 controls volatile organic
compound (VOC) emissions from metal parts cleaning procedures, while SBCAPCD's Rule 331 controls VOC emissions
from equipment leaks at sources such as petroleum refineries. The intended effect of proposing approval of these
rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the





requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPR) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules
and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national
primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Sacramento Metro Area and Santa Barbara County. 43 FR 8964,
40 CFR 81.305. Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California
requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40
CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended
Act, that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 74017671q.
In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas
fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of
May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre
amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment
guidance.

 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Sacramento
Metro Area is classified as serious and Santa Barbara County is classified as moderate

2

; therefore, these areas were subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.

 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 ozone and carbon
monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints,
Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue
Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique
guidelines (CTGs).

 The Sacramento Metro Area and Santa Barbara County retained their designations of nonattainment and were classified
by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November
6, 1991).

</FOOTNOTE>


On June 22, 1991, EPA, Region 9, notified the State of California that EPA had not received by the May 15, 1991 deadline
all required VOC rule corrections under section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA. The finding letter identified six districts
in California, including SMAQMD and SBCAPCD, that had failed to submit required rule corrections. The official finding
notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 22, 1991 (56 FR 54554). SMAQMD's Rule 454 and SBCAPCD's Rule 331 were listed in that finding notice. As a result,
both SMAQMD and SBCAPCD had 18 months to submit the rules to EPA before a sanction under section 179(a) of the Act would
be imposed. 
The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on April 6, 1993 and June 19,
1992, including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SMAQMD's
Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance. SMAQMD's
submitted Rule 454 and SBCAPCD's Rule 331 were found to be complete on April 28, 1993 and August 27, 1992, respectively,
pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V

3

, and both rules are being proposed for approval into the SIP. The State's complete submittal of SMAQMD's Rule 454 and
SBCAPCD's Rule 331 satisfies the deficiency for which the finding of nonsubmittal, dated October 22, 1991, was made
and stopped the sanction clock.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the
CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216).

</FOOTNOTE>


SMAQMD's Rule 454 controls VOC emissions from equipment used to clean (degrease) metal parts, while SBCAPCD's Rule
331 controls leaks of VOCs from equipment used in petroleum refining and associated operations. VOCs contribute
to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve
the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A)
CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.


EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 


In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA's interpretation of these requirements, which forms
the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those
provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary
sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act.
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The
CTG applicable to SMAQMD's Rule 454 is entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Solvent Metal Cleaning,''
EPA450/277022. The CTG applicable to SBCAPCD's Rule 331 is entitled, ``Control of Volatile
Organic Compound Leaks from Petroleum Refinery Equipment,'' EPA450/278036. Further interpretations
of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents have been set
forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
SMAQMD's submitted Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, includes the following significant changes from the current
SIP:



1. The definition section has been expanded by 13 terms, which helps to clarify the rule and makes it easier to enforce.
2. The applicability of the rule to solvents is now based on the initial boiling point rather than on solvent vapor pressure.
3. Control Officer discretion for the use of unspecified control equipment has been deleted.
4. The overall (capture and control) efficiency of control equipment has been set at not less than 85%.
5. Records for solvent usage amounts and for maintenance are now required, making the rule more enforceable.
6. Test methods for determining compliance, not identified in the existing SIP rule, are now specified.
SBCAPCD's submitted Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection and Maintenance, includes the following significant
changes from the current SIP:



1. The definition section has been expanded by 28 terms, which helps to clarify the rule and makes it easier to enforce.
2. The rule now requires replacement of components that require five or more repairs in one year.
3. The rule now specifies that major leaks (as defined in the rule) be fixed within 5 calendar days, minor leaks within
15 days, and liquid leaks within 24 hours. Also, the leaking component must be tightened (minimized) within one hour
of discovery of the leak.
4. Recordkeeping requirements have been expanded to include not only tags on equipment, but diagrams of component
location, inspection logs, and maintenance records. 
5. The rule has been significantly strengthened by the identification of test methods to use to determine compliance.
EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, SMAQMD's Rule 454, Degreasing Operations, and SBCAPCD's Rule 331, Fugitive Emissions Inspection
and Maintenance, are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of
section 110(a) and part D. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.


Regulatory Process


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a 
regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action.
The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 25666 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 22142225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two
years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to 
continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive
Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
