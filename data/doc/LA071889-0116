HOLOCAUST MUSEUM SIGNS BUILDING CONTRACT 
The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council announced Monday it has awarded a 
$53.3-million contract for construction of a museum on the National Mall. 
Construction of the Holocaust Memorial Museum 400 yards from the Washington 
Monument will begin next week, with completion expected in three years. The 
contract was awarded to Blake Construction Co. of Washington. 
The five-story, 250,000-square-foot limestone and brick building will be built 
with private funds. Organizers say they hope to raise $147 million to erect and 
equip the museum, prepare permanent exhibits and establish an endowment. To 
date, about $70 million has been raised, officials said. 
The council was established in 1980 by Congress.
