  [Text] South Africa's National Party [NP] has prepared a 
draft constitution for Natal which makes provision for Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini and the aspirations of his followers. Its 
details will be made public within two weeks. Peet Scott 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Scott] The announcement of the NP's draft 
constitution was made by the party's leader in Natal, Mr. George 
Bartlett, in Durban. Mr. Bartlett said a copy of the draft had 
been handed to IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. 
  [Bartlett] Draft copies have been given to the chief 
minister, and at a recent meeting in Pretoria with the state 
president and King Goodwill Zwelithini I quoted from this 
document, and as a result of that I gave him a copy, so the king 
also has a copy of this document. As I say, we're ready, at the 
drop of a hat, to start negotiating on a constitution for this 
province, and we will make this document public in a week or two. 
  [Scott] Mr. Bartlett said the NP would also be willing to 
negotiate with other parties on the contents of the document. 
He said the NP had done everything possible to accommodate the 
IFP and the Zulu monarchy, so as to get the IFP to participate 
in the election, but that they have had no success up until now. 
He made another appeal to the IFP to reconsider its stance. If 
it did not, an all-out effort would be made to secure the vote 
from its supporters. 
  [Bartlett] Should the IFP not respond to our appeal to 
participate in this election, we make an urgent appeal to all 
IFP supporters to throw their weight behind President de Klerk 
and the NP, so as to stop the [South African] Communist Party 
[SACP] and the ANC [African National Congress] from controlling 
our province. 
  [Scott] At the same time Mr. Bartlett appealed to both the 
IFP and the ANC-SACP alliance not to stoke the fires of violence 
and confrontation in the province. But what if people are 
prevented from voting in kwaZulu? Surely it is the duty of the 
government to ensure that the democratic voting process is not 
interfered with. [Home Affairs Minister] Mr. Danie Schutte said 
the government had contingency plans in case there was 
large-scale disruption of the election, but that these would 
only be used as a last resort. [end recording]
