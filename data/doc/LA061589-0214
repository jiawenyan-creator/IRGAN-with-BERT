P.M. BRIEFING; 
JUNK BOND KING MILKEN FORCED OUT OF DREXEL, WILL START HIS OWN FIRM 
Michael Milken, the junk bond king indicted for fraud and racketeering in the 
largest securities crime case ever, said today that he is quitting his job at 
the investment bank and will start his own firm. 
Milken, 42, was placed on a forced leave of absence by Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc. on March 29, the same day he was indicted by a federal grand jury on 98 
counts of racketeering and securities fraud. He has denied the charges, and his 
trial is expected to be long and complex. 
Milken is credited with making billions of dollars for Drexel through his 
pioneering use of junk bonds -- lower-grade securities that offer high yields. 
But he has become a key target in the government's widening case against 
illegal insider trading on Wall Street. 
Milken said he will form International Capital Access Group, a consulting firm 
that he said will provide advice to individuals, communities and companies, 
emphasizing opportunities for employees, minorities and unions. 
Milken said he was disappointed that he was forced to leave Drexel as part of 
the company's settlement of securities fraud charges with the government.
