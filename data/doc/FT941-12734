FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Profit warning from Policy Portfolio
Shares in Policy Portfolio, the marketmaker in second-hand endowment
policies, fell 10p to 88p yesterday after the company warned that second
half profits were likely to be lower than the first half's Pounds 429,000.
Pre-tax profits for the year ended March 31 1993 totalled Pounds 817,000.
The company joined the market last July, via a placing of 3.6m shares at
130p each, which valued it at Pounds 10.4m.
Directors said yesterday that they expected current year sales to show a
'somewhat disappointing' 30 per cent rise on the previous 12 months, while
gross profit margins would be higher than originally anticipated.
They said the continuing strong performance of share markets in the past
year may have caused some potential investors in traded endowment policies
to focus their activities on other opportunities.
In addition, they said, some participants in the traded endowment market
appeared to be pursuing market share at the expense of profit margins.
The directors had decided not to follow that course of action and,
therefore, those factors had made it difficult to achieve the level of sales
growth they would wish, while maintaining an acceptable profit margin.
During the bonus season there had been a greater than anticipated increase
in value of the company's present stock of policies held for sale.
