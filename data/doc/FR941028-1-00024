 

J. Fraud and Manipulation in Connection With Section 4(c) Market Transactions 


Proposed 36.9 applies to section 4(c) contract market transactions the antifraud proscriptions of Sections
4b(a) and 4

o

 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6

o

, those provisions of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 9, 15, 13b and 13(a), that prohibit price manipulation,
and Commission Rules 33.9 and 33.10, 17 CFR 33.9 and 33.10 (1994), which prohibit fraudulent conduct and price manipulation
in connection with commodity option transactions. 
In its petition for exemption, the CBOT included a rule specifically prohibiting fraud and manipulation relating
to professional market transactions. The CBOT petition explains:

 

Fraud and manipulation are the core proscriptions of the Commodity Exchange Act***. Rather than
engage in a hyper-technical legal effort to mesh certain exempt transactions with the requirements of the CEA's existing
fraud and manipulation provisions, the proposal contains a special antifraud and antimanipulation provision.
That approach will make certain that any party committing fraud or engaging in manipulative practices in connection
with an otherwise exempt transaction *** would not be able to wriggle out of liability under the CEA
under some legal technicality.

 

58 FR 43414, 43433 (August 16, 1993). The CME did not suggest the adoption of a specific fraud and manipulation rule;
nonetheless, it did not request an exemption from the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the Act and Commission
regulations. 


In its consideration of the petitions and the comments received thereon, the Commission is also considering whether
to adopt specific stand-alone rules prohibiting fraud and manipulation to supplement proposed 36.9. In this
regard and as noted above, the exemption being proposed would relieve the exchanges and their members from some provisions
of the Act and regulations that are intended to provide prophylactic protection for customers. In the absence of these
protections, it may be appropriate to apply broader antifraud and antimanipulation prohibitions to effectively
control certain abusive conduct, such as trading ahead of customer orders in any form and failure to disclose material
information. As a result, the Commission is proposing, in 36.9(a), a free-standing antifraud rule for section
4(c) contract market transactions modeled after Commission Rule 33.10, 17 CFR 33.10 (1994). The Commission specifically
requests comments concerning whether it should adopt such a rule. 
The Commission is also requesting comment concerning whether those provisions of the Act and rules thereunder reserved
in the manipulation provision, 36.9(b), are adequate in this regard or whether the Commission should also
adopt an additional free-standing antimanipulation rule. Should commenters believe that a free-standing antimanipulation
rule is warranted, comment is requested concerning whether a rule prohibiting manipulation or attempted manipulation
of the price of any section 4(c) contract market transaction or of any commodity in interstate commerce or any contract
of sale of a commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market, would be appropriate. 
In a related matter, the Commission is also seeking comment on whether Part 35 of its rules, 17 CFR Part 35 (1994), which
provides an exemption for certain swap transactions, should be amended to include specific stand-alone prohibitions
of fraud and price manipulation like those discussed above.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 While Section 4b of the Act has provided an adequate tool to address fraud in traditional futures contract trading,
and Section 4o (which is also reserved in Part 35) addresses the giving of advice, questions have been raised about
the efficacy of these provisions as applied to certain of the transactions included in the ambit of Part 35. An amendment
to Part 35 in this regard would eliminate any such questions and could also provide desirable consistency in the legal
standards applicable to both section 4(c) contract market transactions and exempt swap transactions. Comment is
requested concerning the type of antifraud and antimanipulation rules that the Commission should adopt if it determines
to do so.

V. Related Matters 


A. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), Public Law No. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164 (1980), 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.,

 requires each federal agency to consider, in the course of proposing substantive rules, the effect of those rules
on small entities. A small entity is defined to include, 

inter alia,

 a ``small business'' and a ``small organization.'' 5 U.S.C. 601(6).
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission previously has formulated its own standards of what constitutes a small business with respect to the
types of entities regulated by it. The Commission has determined that contract markets,
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 futures commission merchants,
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>
 registered commodity pool operators,
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 and large traders
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 should not be considered small entities for purposes of the RFA. 


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


51

</FOOTNAME>
``Small organizations,'' as used in the RFA, means ``any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned
and operated and is not dominant in its field ***'' 5 U.S.C. 601(4). The RFA does not incorporate the
size standards of the Small Business Administration (``SBA'') for small organizations. Agencies are expressly
authorized to establish their own definition of small organization.

The Commission believes that to the extent that firms defined as small businesses under section 3 of the Small Business
Act could offer or be offered section 4(c) contract market transactions, the proposed rules would not add any legal,
accounting, consulting or expert costs. No one is required to trade section 4(c) contract market transactions. The
proposed rules would merely provide exemptive relief for those trading such transactions. The determination of
whether a section 4(c) contract market transaction would qualify for the proposed exemption requires minimal analysis
of data that will be readily accessible to the offeror. 
Accordingly, the Chairman, on behalf of the Commission, certifies pursuant to section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),
that the proposed rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Nonetheless,
the Commission invites comment from any firm which believes that these proposed rules would have a significant economic
impact on its operations.
