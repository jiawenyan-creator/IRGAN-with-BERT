STUDENTS SUSPECTED IN DORMITORY FIRE 
Several suspects have been identified as responsible for a fire that swept 
through a San Jose State dormitory, critically injuring two students and 
sending 19 others to hospitals, officials said. "The suspects university police 
are looking at are all San Jose students," university spokesman Dick Stanley 
said. 
Stanley said the suspects in Friday's fire, whose names he did not release, are 
believed to have moved a couch in front of a dormitory room and ignited it. One 
student, unable to breathe because of the thick smoke that filled Andrew 
Moulder Hall, suffered a back fracture in a jump from a third-floor window. 
Other students trapped by the flames leaned out windows, screaming for help as 
firefighters set up ladders to rescue them. Rescuers led other students down 
stairways to safety. More than 30 firefighters put out the blaze at the hall, 
which houses 178 residents.
