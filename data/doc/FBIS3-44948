  [Text] The provincial government issued an urgent circular 
on the control of grain and oil prices and stabilizing markets. 
  The circular requests: All relevant departments throughout 
the province should correctly analyze the situation in grain and 
oil markets, unify their understanding on controlling grain and 
oil prices, and unify their actions in lowering grain and oil 
prices. Effective 31 December, state-owned grain and oil shops 
should attach price tags to the grain and oil they sell. Grain 
and oil prices in all localities should be based on Xining grain 
and oil prices. These prices should be reported to the 
provincial price bureau for registration. 
  The circular stresses: Grain departments should play the 
role of the main channel and ensure market supplies. Grain 
departments in all localities should take the lead in 
controlling grain and oil prices and should not refuse to sell. 
They should take the overall situation into account, do a good 
job in processing and transporting grain and oil, and organize 
grain and oil resources well, so that grain and oil can be sold 
at any time. In particular, oil-bearing crops should be 
procured as much as possible, but rush procurements should be 
prevented. Grain and oil storage should be rationally arranged. 
In the meantime, grain departments in all localities should 
improve their service attitude and quality. Grain and oil 
should be supplied to universities and colleges at wholesale 
prices, and this supply should be ensured. 
  The circular also demands stricter management over grain and 
oil markets. Price as well as industrial and commercial 
departments at all levels should ensure that grain and oil are 
sold with price tags. Price, industrial, commercial, financial, 
and public security departments at all levels should provide 
all-out support for grain departments in ensuring market supply, 
in stabilizing grain and oil prices, and in stabilizing the 
market order. Railway and highway departments should give 
priority to grain and oil transportation arrangements. No units 
are allowed to adjust grain or oil prices without approval. 
  In conclusion, the circular stresses: A general check should 
be conducted over market prices. To stabilize markets and 
protect the market order, price departments should supervise and 
conduct inspection over grain and oil prices during the New Year 
and Spring Festivals, with the participation of industrial, 
commercial, financial, and economic commissions. Units or 
traders who do not implement state regulations will be dealt 
with seriously; those who deal in grain and oil without licenses 
will be banned resolutely. Grain and oil sold in markets must 
have clear price tags. Units or traders who are not equipped 
with the necessary wholesale conditions will have their business 
licenses revoked.
