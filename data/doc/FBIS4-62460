<F P=106> ["Shakhray Dismissed To Normalize Russo-Chechen Ties" -- </F>
ITAR-TASS headline; by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] 
  [Text] Moscow May 16 TASS -- Sergey Shakhray has "yielded" 
his office of minister for nationalities and regional policies 
to head of the Krasnodar territory administration, economist 
Nikolay Yegorov, 42. 
  Shakhray indirectly confirmed the information on May 13, 
when 
he signed a Russo-Crimean treaty in his capacity of a Russian 
vice- premier and then explained that it was his sole post now. 
  According to a well-informed source inside the Russian 
Government, who shared the above information with ITAR-TASS, 
"the presidential decree on appointing the new nationalities 
minister was not signed as yet, therefore, press reports on 
forthcoming cabinet reshuffle were a leak of reliable 
information." 
  As a vice-premier, Shakhray will continue to supervise 
various issues of nationalities and regional policies. 
  His dismissal may be associated with a stand taken by the 
Chechen leaders, who did not want Shakhray to represent Russia 
at bilateral talks. 
  President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya possibly bears a 
grudge against Shakhray because the latter repeatedly emphasized 
that Russo-Chechen talks could begin on the condition that 
pre-term elections be held in Chechnya first. 
  Hopefully, the new nationalities minister Yegorov will 
manage 
to find a more flexible approach to reaching a bilateral 
agreement with Chechnya.
