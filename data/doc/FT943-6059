FT  01 SEP 94 / France expels 20 Algerian detainees to west Africa
The French authorities yesterday expelled to the African state of Burkina
Faso 20 of the 26 Algerians who have been detained at a military base for
nearly a month as part of the Balladur government's anti-terrorist
clampdown, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Mr Charles Pasqua, the
pugilistic interior minister who last month orchestrated the detentions
after a radical Moslem group claimed responsibility for the assassination of
five French nationals in Algeria, said the expulsions should act as 'a
lesson to anyone who doesn't respect the laws of the land'.
The Interior Ministry declined to comment on what would happen to the six
Algerians still being held under heavy guard at the disused army barracks in
the village of Follembray on the outskirts of Paris. However, Mr Said Magri,
a Lille pizza parlour owner who went on hunger strike after being interned
in early August, was yesterday allowed to return to his home.
Mr Pasqua came under fire from legal groups for sanctioning the original
internment of the Algerians and for yesterday's expulsions.
