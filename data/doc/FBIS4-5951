  [Text] Kim Chong-su, deputy chief of the North Korean 
mission in the United Nations, stated on 14 April that if the 
United States proposes holding the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean high-level talks, North Korea will accede to 
[unghagettago] it. 
  Expressing the strong desire for the resumption of 
U.S.-North 
Korean high-level talks, Kim said that the United States should 
arrange the resumption of talks since the United States 
unilaterally [ilbangjoguro] canceled the third round of 
high-level talks. 
  He insisted that the additional nuclear inspection issue 
should be discussed at the third round of talks and that the 
South-North exchange of special envoys should not be linked to 
U.S.-North Korean talks because it is a national issue 
[minjokkanui munje].
