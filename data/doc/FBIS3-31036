  [Text] Today, 11 February, the National Assembly gave its 
approval to the 1994 budget bill at its first reading. 
  The budget is austere, and its defense by the parliamentary 
majority was flaccid and unconvincing, Ivan Kostov declared on 
behalf of the parliamentary group of the SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces]. He added -- I quote his words: It is so 
because it is not proposed by a responsible political force and 
a stable executive power with clear economic policies. The 
budget is connected with an increase in the tax burden, which is 
not a gesture toward private business and the population. [no 
reference to close of quotation as heard] 
  According to Nora Ananieva, leader of the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] parliamentary group, the budget, in its adopted 
interim form, contains a number of chances both for various 
social strata in the country and for Bulgaria to obtain foreign 
financing. 
  Stefan Bozhilov of the New Alliance for Democracy declared 
that the imperfections in the budget are due to the legacy of 
communist rule. 
  The Rights and Freedoms Movement positively assessed the 
budget, despite the failure of the privatization process so far. 
  The final adoption of the budget is tied up with many 
demands 
relating to the structural reform, the social sphere, and 
science and education.
