FT  20 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Lucas accused over centralised pay
OFFICIALS of the AEU engineering union have accused Lucas, the aerospace and
automotive group, of returning to centralised pay bargaining in order to
force through a 3 per cent pay offer in most of its big factories. Lucas
abandoned national bargaining in 1989.
Mr Ray Griffiths, an AEU regional official, said that decentralisation was
'a complete joke this year'.
In recent years there have been significant differences between the offers
made and the deals eventually agreed at Lucas's 40 plants.
Lucas said the decision to decentralise pay had been correct and had not
been reversed even if there was still sometimes a 'going rate' that applied
to many plants.
Mr Griffiths said that in his area of the Midlands three plants - Lucas
Aerospace Marston Green, Lucas Automotive Holford, and Lucas Kienzle
Instruments - had all been offered a 'final' 3 per cent pay rise. Other
plants that have also been offered 3 per cent include Lucas Aerospace
Netherton and Lucas CAV. Mr Griffiths said he had not heard of a Lucas plant
that had been offered anything else.
Most plants seem to be settling around the 3 per cent mark although a few,
including Lucas Aerospace Netherton, are balloting on industrial action. A
few others have won more than 3 per cent as part of local productivity
deals.
Some pay analysts will see the Lucas case as further evidence that
decentralisation has been more apparent than real over recent years.
Three quarters of pay rises in December and January were between 4 per cent
and 6.9 per cent with the majority between 5 per cent and 5.9 per cent,
according to the latest settlement data from Incomes Data Services.
