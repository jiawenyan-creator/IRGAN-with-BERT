  [Text] New Delhi -- Various chambers of commerce have 
welcomed the success in negotiations on General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Bansi Dhar, President of Federation of Indian Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (FICCI), said the global trade would now 
move forward with more certainty in the years ahead. 
  "The world merchandise trade of $3800 billion will be able 
to 
come out of sluggish growth which it had slipped into the last 
few years," he said, adding that world trade would grow by 8 per 
cent to 9 per cent per annum for the remaining years of the 
century. 
  N. Sankar, a president of Indian National Committee of 
International Chamber of Commerce (INC-ICC), while complimenting 
the governments of 116 countries and GATT director general Peter 
Sutherland, said that GATT round would strengthen the 
multilaterism and reduce the tempo of building trade blocs and 
scope of bilateral and plurilateral agreements on trade issues. 
  L.K. Modi, president of North Indian Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry (NICCI) said that countries like India would benefit 
because of the larger market access given in the services and 
agricultural products.
