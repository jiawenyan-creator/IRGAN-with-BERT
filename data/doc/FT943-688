FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hanson legacy
Sir, Michael Cassell's review of the biography of Lord Hanson will clearly
open the debate as to the nature of Hanson's legacy to the British
industrial scene (Book review: 'A deal too far for king of capitalism',
September 22).
Is it not part of that legacy that, to date, Hanson proteges have created
from scratch three highly successful and well-regarded public companies
(Tomkins, Wassall, and TT Group) with a combined market capitalisation of
more than Pounds 3.25bn?
Is that not a testimony to the spirit of entrepreneurial capitalism that
James Hanson and Gordon White have for the past 30 years so brilliantly
represented?
