 



Response: 

No change. The Office of Drug Pricing has currently developed a proposed dispute resolution process which will be
published in the 

Federal Register 

with a public comment period.



Comment: 

Require PHS preclearance of all safeguard systems developed by entities to deter diversion and require this information
to be supplied to the manufacturers upon request.






Response: 

No change. Guidelines concerning separate purchasing accounts and dispensing records are quite specific, and procedures
in these areas need no prior approval. If a manufacturer believes that a covered entity is involved in drug diversion,
it has the statutory authority to audit the entity records that directly relate to drugs of that manufacturer purchased
at PHS pricing. Proposed audit guidelines have been developed and will be published in the 

Federal Register 

with a public comment period.






Comment: 

Issue criteria for measuring the adequacy of the safeguards.






Response: 

No change. If a manufacturer believes that a covered entity has established inadequate safeguards and is involved
in drug diversion, then the manufacturer can either audit the entity or file a complaint with the Office of Drug Pricing.




Comment: 

Develop a broad definition of ``patient'' to include all necessary services provided to individuals served by the
covered entities.




Response: 

No change. The notice does not address the definition of patient. The Office of Drug Pricing is in the process of developing
a definition of patient, which will be published in the 

Federal Register. 

Public comment will be invited, and this comment will be considered at that time.






Comment: 

Do not require separate inventories, as this would place a hardship on most hospitals.




Response: 

No change. There is no requirement for separate inventories.




Comment: 

Do not permit entities to develop alternate tracking systems or develop criteria for these systems by March 1, 1994.




Response: 

No change. It is essential that the Office of Drug pricing maintain some flexibility during this period of implementation.
Because these alternate tracking systems require prior approval from the Office of Drug pricing before they can be
implemented, sufficient control is maintained. The Office will develop criteria at a later date and welcomes all
suggestions.




Audit Requirements







Comment: 

Specify the statutory basis for the Secretary to authorize manufacturer audit guidelines.




Response: 

We have amended part 5 of the notice to include a reference to section 340B(a)(5)(C) of the PHS Act, which gives the Secretary
the authority to establish procedures relating to the number, duration, and scope of manufacturer audits.



Comment: 

Move quickly to develop procedures to allow manufacturers to audit records of entities' purchases of covered outpatient
drugs and of Medicaid claims for reimbursement for such drugs.
