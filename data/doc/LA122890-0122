BRIEFLY 
Smoking Banned From EPA Offices: The Environmental Protection Agency announced 
that employees may no longer routinely smoke inside EPA offices and facilities. 
The EPA directive, aimed at protecting nonsmokers from passive smoke, applies 
to 120 agency facilities nationwide. The agency said employees will be provided 
with separate smoking lounges equipped with special ventilation systems. The 
new smoking policy comes as the EPA staff is considering a draft study that 
concludes there is considerable evidence that passive smoke causes lung cancer.
