 

Under section 1902(l)(3)(E), as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4101(e)(3) of OBRA '87, in determining whether
the income of members of the low-income groups of pregnant women, infants, and children meets the established income
standards, States must use the same methodologies as applied in determining financial eligibility for AFDC, or for
title IVE as appropriate, except to the extent that the methodologies are inconsistent with section 1902(a)(17)(D)
of the Act. Section 4101(e)(3) of OBRA '87 clarified that, in determining family income, States must not use any AFDC
methodologies (such as stepparent, grandparent, or sibling deeming) that are inconsistent with the deeming policies
specific to Medicaid under section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act (H. Rep. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 446 (1987)). Section
1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act provides, in part, that in determining financial responsibility of relatives, only the
income of spouses may be considered as available to spouses, and only the income of parents may be considered as available
to a child until the child is 21, unless the child is blind or disabled. The methodologies include, but are not limited
to, those used for disregarding income. States also are not permitted to allow individuals whose eligibility is determined
based on membership in these low-income groups to spend down; that is, the State may not deduct the costs of incurred
medical expenses or any other type of remedial care from income, in determining whether an individual's income meets
the income standard established by the State. 

The requirements for determining financial eligibility of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children were
also affected by section 303(e) of MCCA. Section 303(e) established a new section 1902(r)(2) to permit States, at
their option, to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than those used under the cash assistance
programs (e.g., AFDC or SSI), in determining financial eligibility for a number of groups, including the mandatory
groups of pregnant women and infants in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and the optional groups of pregnant women,
infants, and children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX). Section 6401 of OBRA '89 specifically made section 1902(r)(2)
applicable to the mandatory group of low-income children age 1 up to age 6 in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI). Section
4601 of OBRA '90 specifically made section 1902(r)(2) applicable to the mandatory group of low-income children age
6 up to age 19 in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII). 

We believe that the specific preclusion of a spenddown in section 1902(l) was not modified by section 1902(r)(2).
However, States may use other more liberal methodologies to the extent that they are consistent with section 1902(r)(2).


Section 1902(l)(1) of the Act specifically states that the income standards established by the State must correlate
to a family size that includes the woman, infant, or child. The statute does not specifically address whether the pregnant
woman's unborn child must be counted in determining family size. However, the legislative history supports counting
the pregnant woman as if her child were born and living with her. The language of the 1986 House Committee Report that
addressed the section 1902(l)(1) provision states that ``in determining a pregnant woman's family income level,
the Committee intends that a State would treat the woman as if her child were born and living with her at the time she applied
for assistance. Thus, a single woman would be treated as a family of two, a pregnant woman living with a spouse or child
as a family of three, and so forth ***'' (H. Rep. No. 727, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 100 (1986)). The House
bill that accompanied this report states that the family size should be equal to ``the family including the woman or
child.'' Even though the language is not specific in section 1902(l)(1), we believe the legislative history reveals
that Congress intended that the unborn child be included under this provision. 

We proposed to specify in these proposed regulations that the family size includes the ``unborn child and other members
of the Medicaid budgetary unit.'' Policies relating to the Medicaid budgetary unit were addressed in a final rule
with comment period published in the 

Federal Register

 
on January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4908), and are, therefore, not being addressed in this preamble. The effective date of the
January 1993 rule has been delayed (58 FR 9120, February 19, 1993; 58 FR 44457, August 23, 1993; and 59 FR 8138, February
18, 1994). We will conform the policies on the Medicaid budgetary unit contained in these proposed regulations with
whatever policy is in effect at the time that we issue these proposed regulations as final.
