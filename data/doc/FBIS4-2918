  [Text] Cairo, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Two American F-15 
fighters shot down two U.S. Army helicopters over Northern Iraq 
today, according to reports reaching here. 
  The reports quoting a U.S. Pentagon statement said the 
incident occurred approximately 60 kilometers north of Irbil, 
and the U.S. helicopters had been mistakenly identified as Iraqi 
aircraft operating in the "no-fly zone" in Northern Iraq. 
  An official of the U.S. State Department was quoted as 
saying 
"high level" U.N. officials were on board and between 12 and 24 
were dead. 
  Earlier Western reports said the helicopters were shot down 
by Iraqi warplanes in the allied-imposed zone. 
  The "no-fly zone" was created by the United States and its 
allies in Northern Iraq shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf 
war and allied planes have since been patrolling the zone over 
Northern Iraq allegedly to protect Kurds from government attacks.
