  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
organized a working-level committee to help resettle North 
Korean loggers brought here from Russia, officials said Friday. 
  The committee is chaired by Kim Si-hyong, chief assistant to 
the prime minister for administrative coordination, and includes 
the directors-general of related ministries. 
  The government plans to devise "comprehensive measures to 
support resettlement of the North Korean loggers" through the 
committee. 
  About 500 North Koreans are said to have escaped from 
Siberian logging camps and most of them reportedly hope to 
resettle in South Korea. 
  The government's support is expected to focus on helping 
them 
adapt to South Korean society and lead a stable life here. 
  The committee plans to develop programs for the loggers and 
study such problems as vocational training, employment and 
revision of related laws. 
  The directors-general serving on the committee are from the 
National Unification Board (NUB), the Economic Planning Board 
(EPB) and the Foreign, Home, Justice, Health and Social Affairs, 
Labor and Information Ministries, the Agency for National 
Security Planning (NSP) and the police.
