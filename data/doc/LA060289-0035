SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDER MUST COVER HOLES 
The city of Los Angeles on Thursday ordered a builder to completely cover deep 
holes drilled for foundation pilings at a construction site for a two-story 
house in San Pedro. 
The open work site at 525 Shepard St., near Pacific Avenue, must either be 
fenced or 24 holes must be covered at night, said Alexander Bruce, manager of 
the San Pedro branch of the Department of Building and Safety. 
The order was issued to the home's builder, Atul Jain, who lists a post office 
box in Westchester on permit applications, Bruce said Thursday. 
The home is next to an area that suffered landslides several decades ago and, 
as a result, Jain is building an elaborate foundation, which includes the 24 
holes, ranging in depth from 33 feet to 42 feet. The holes, which are about two 
feet in diameter, will be filled with concrete poured around a steel 
reinforcing frame. 
"But now, they're just big holes in the ground that a kid could fall in very 
easily," Bruce said. "So we want them covered up fast."
