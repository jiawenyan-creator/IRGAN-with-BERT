  [Text] The security of the Visegrad Four meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton will be provided by 3,000 policemen in 
Prague. According to Interior Ministry Spokesman Jan Subrt, 
these will be the most extensive security arrangements on the 
territory of the Czech Republic since 17 November 1989. 
According to Jan Subrt, over 200 U.S. citizens will take part 
in the security of Bill Clinton in Prague. The Czech police, 
however, will assume overall responsibility for the security of 
all five presidents. Jan Subrt said that the rapid deployment, 
antiterrorist, and other crack units of the special police 
forces will take part in the security arrangements. Police 
helicopters will participate in the action and the river police 
unit with divers will be on the alert in connection with the 
proposed walkabout by Bill Clinton on Charles Bridge. 
  [Prague Radiozurnal Radio Network in Czech at 1700 GMT on 4 
January adds that "the police have asked Prague citizens to show 
understanding for certain indispensable restrictions in 
connection with the extensive security arrangements accompanying 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit in Prague. The police 
recommend that citizens living in houses along the transit 
routes not open any windows when the presidential cavalcade 
passes by. The police will inform citizens of specific houses 
in good time. 
  ["Interior Ministry Press Spokesman Jan Subrt emphasized 
that 
the security situation in the Czech Republic is regarded by the 
U.S. side as stable and it is thought that the Prague meeting 
will pass without incident."]
