FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM loses top executive to
Hughes Aircraft
ONE of International Business Machines' top executives, Mr Michael
Armstrong, is to leave the company at the end of the month to become
chairman and chief executive of Hughes Aircraft, where he will succeed Mr
Malcolm Currie, who is retiring.
Mr Armstrong, 53, has been at IBM for 31 years. For the past three years he
hasheaded the computer company's international operations, a post he took
over after serving as director-general of European operations.
He was chairman of IBM World Trade and a member of the company's five-man
management committee and its corporate management board.
Mr Armstrong's departure comes as a surprise. He was considered to be a
potential successor to Mr John Akers, 57, who is expected to retire from the
IBM chairmanship in about three years.
Mr Armstrong is joining Hughes Aircraft as the defence electronics company
begins a drive to increase its commercial business and become less dependent
on defence contracts, which currently represent about 70 per cent of its
revenues.
Hughes, which produces missiles, telecommunications satellites and radar
equipment for the military, posted 1990 revenues of Dollars 7.8bn and is
expecting 1991 revenues of about Dollars 8bn.
The company, based in Los Angeles, is a unit of General Motors.
