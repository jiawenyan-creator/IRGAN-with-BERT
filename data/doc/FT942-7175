FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: NSW State Bank sale details due
in August
An announcement on the future of the State Bank of New South Wales, the
fifth-largest bank in Australia and due to be privatised by the state
government, will be made in August, according to state treasurer, Mr Peter
Collins.
He said that legislation, including the name of the bidder and the sale
price, would be put before the state parliament in September.
The sale is proving troublesome, with many of the interested bidders pulling
out of the bidding in recent weeks. Only one name is known to be left -
Colonial Mutual, the insurance group - while Australia's four big national
banks were barred from entering the auction at the outset.
Earlier this week, the NSW premier, Mr John Fahey, indicated that the
government might be willing to delay the sale to get a better price.
However, Mr Collins denied yesterday that the gov-ernment was backing down
on the sale or planning to defer it.
