FT  15 APR 93 / NZ inflation rate stabilises at 1%
NEW ZEALAND consumer prices in the year to March 31 rose by 1 per cent, a
result only bettered by Australia in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, the government statistician said yesterday.
Australia's inflation rate was 0.3 per cent. The low New Zealand annual rate
continues a trend, with the CPI registering 1.3 per cent in the year to
December and 1 per cent in the 12 months to September.
In the three months to March the CPI was 0.1 per cent, a figure that
surprised economists who had been predicting a rise because of an increase
in home mortgage rates in January.
This followed the Reserve Bank's decision to intervene to support the New
Zealand dollar in pursuit of its low inflation target when it appeared
likely the currency would fall below its target of 52 on the index which
measures the value of the dollar on a trade weighted basis with the
country's main trading partners.
The statistics department also reported yesterday that food prices had
fallen 1.3 per cent in March.
This followed increases of 1.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent in February and
January, which were due to poor weather affecting the price of fruit,
vegetables and meat.
