FT  19 AUG 93 / House price boost for first-time buyers
LOWER HOUSE prices have meant that first-time buyers have been able to buy
properties which previously would have been beyond their means, a survey by
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors of more than 100 English and
Welsh estate agents has found.
Agents said that buyers who previously would have bought studio and
one-bedroom properties were now able to afford two-bedroom and three-bedroom
flats and houses.
