FT  09 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei briefly breaches
17,000 in fresh drop
THE NIKKEI average dropped another 3.5 per cent yesterday, briefly breaching
the 17,000 level in the last hour of trading, as investors were unnerved by
Tuesday's weakness on Wall Street and the sharp decline in the Nikkei
futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally 616.02 lower at 17,175.53, after opening
at the day's high of 17,742.67 and falling as low as 16,892.31 in the
afternoon. The index last closed below 17,000 on November 7, 1986.
Volume for the session picked up to 320m shares from 200m, boosted by buying
by a leading Japanese brokerage house and investment trusts after the Nikkei
fell through 17,000.
The Topix index of all first section stocks plunged 59.69 or 4.7 per cent,
the sharpest single day's fall for this year, to 1,219.88, the lowest finish
since April 1986. Declines predominated over rises by 955 to 49, with 39
issues unchanged. A total of 775 stocks registered new lows for the year. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 4.97 to 977.11.
While traders said the market fell in an 'orderly' manner, the lack of
buying interest increased pessimism. 'Nobody is talking about support levels
any more,' commented Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Continued weakness in banking shares dragged down other sectors. The Nikkei
500 banking index lost a further 8.8 per cent on concern about increasing
bad debt at the banks, especially real estate-related loans. The fall in
bank shares put pressure on companies to liquidate cross-holdings with banks
of lower strategic importance. Traders noted selling by middle-sized life
assurers, traditionally stable shareholders of banks.
Industrial Bank of Japan, seen as a benchmark for the banking sector, ended
Y190 weaker at Y1,330 on heavy selling. Fuji Bank, which expects heavy
losses due to its involvement with the fraudulent loan scheme scandal last
year, receded Y110 to Y1,160. Fuji is also the leading lender to Tobishima,
the contractor and real estate developer, which announced a restructuring
scheme last week.
Speculative issues also plunged. The sharp falls in the market have
depressed values of collateral for margin trading. Clarion, the most active
stock of the day, dropped Y100 to Y623 and Meiji Milk Products Y30 to Y700.
Industrial blue chips were sold. Nippon Steel slipped Y9 to Y291 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries fell Y50 to Y510.
Some electrical issues were bought by foreign investors. Pioneer Electronic
rose Y40 to Y3,800 and Sumitomo Electric remained unchanged at Y965.
However, leading electronics companies lost ground, Hitachi shedding Y17 to
Y771 and Sony Y10 to Y4,010.
In Osaka, the OSE average surrendered 864.86 to 18,545.34 in volume of 11.9m
shares.
