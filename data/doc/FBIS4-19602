`Defender of Human Rights' a Demonstration Is Banned at the Last

  [Text] A march of Romanian opposition organizations in 
France (the Pro-Bessarabia and Bukovina Association, the World 
Union of Free Romanians, and the Liberal Club) was scheduled to 
take place in Paris on Wednesday, 13 April, in the afternoon. 
Initially, the authorities approved the march from Trocadero 
Square (known as the Square of Human Rights) to the Romanian 
Embassy, a distance of about one and one-half kilometers. 
However, at 1700, law enforcement officers -- at least seven 
trucks full of policemen -- surrounded the square and halted the 
march on the embassy. Nevertheless, several hundred Romanians 
remained in Trocadero Square, holding banners demanding 
President Iliescu's resignation and comparing him to Ceausescu. 
  The organizations in France wanted to organize a rally on 
Friday evening in front of the Romanian Embassy in Paris, where 
a reception was scheduled "in honor of President Iliescu's 
presence" in France. This rally was banned.
