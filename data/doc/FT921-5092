FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lack of house sales holds Stat-Plus back
Stat-Plus Group, the retailer of office and legal stationery, ascribed its
fall in pre-tax profits in 1991 to the 'deepening UK recession'.
This, it said, curbed the number of homes bought in spite of the reductions
in interest rates. Inevitably, conveyancing, one of the company's main
business areas, continued to suffer due to lower transaction levels and a
concomitant low demand for law forms and specialist legal stationery.
Profits fell 16 per cent to Pounds 4.81m (Pounds 5.71m) on turnover
marginally down at Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.9m).
However, the final dividend is raised to 4p making 7.125p (6.25p) for the
year. Earnings slipped to 15p (17.2p) per share.
