FT  11 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Kuala
Lumpur rises 3.6%
Stocks pulled back from two-year highs on Friday as profit taking closed a
bullish week writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The 225 average declined 7.60, after a three-day uphill run, to close at
21,395.18 in volume that soared to 1.1bn shares - the heaviest in 14 months
 -for a 2 per cent gain on the week.
After reaching a high of 21,559.81 shortly before the release of the Bank of
Japan's tankan survey, the index dipped to a low of 21,355.37 before
rebounding on support buying near the close. The tankan, although positive,
was not as strong as some had hoped and provided the reason for a wave of
futures-led profit-taking and closing of dealer positions.
In spite of the decline, gainers still led losers 527 to 508 with 155
unchanged.
The Nikkei 300 index slipped 1.88 to 309.72, while the first-section Topix
index fell 8.36 to 1,700.80.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose to 3.13 to 1,404.75.
Large-capital steel companies and shipbuilders continued to lead in volume,
but results were mixed. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained only Y1 to Y820
as 30.1m shares changed hands. Kawasaki Heavy Industries lost Y6 to Y482,
while Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries rose Y9 to Y500, both in active
trading.
Oki Electric, after three days of strong gains, gave up Y6 in the day's
third highest volume to close at Y783.
Major brokerage firms were mixed as profit-taking eroded some of the
previous day's gains. Of the Big Four, Nomura Securities slid Y50 to Y2,500
and Nikko Securities dipped Y30 to Y1,410. But Yamaichi Securities added Y4
to Y994 and Daiwa Securities rose Y10 to Y1850.
In Osaka the OSE average gained 16.59 to 23,647.23 in volume of 54m shares.
