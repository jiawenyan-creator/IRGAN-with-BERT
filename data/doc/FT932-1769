FT  22 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Dutch Treasury bond trading
system launched
FIVE foreign banks and brokerage houses have been accepted as special
corporate members of the Amsterdam stock exchange so they can take part in a
new inter-professional trading system for Dutch government bonds that was
officially launched yesterday.
The new Amsterdam Treasury Bond Market (ATM), designed to allow direct
dealing in transactions exceeding Fl 2.5m (Dollars 1.3m), is part of the
Dutch exchange's continuing campaign to win back trading in stocks and bonds
that has seeped away to London.
The next significant step is scheduled for early 1994, when the share
trading system will effectively be split between the wholesale and retail
markets.
The five, mainly London-based foreign members are Goldman Sachs
International, JP Morgan Guarantee Trust, Salomon Brothers International,
Warburg Securities and the UK securities subsidiary of Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The Amsterdam stock exchange said it expected that within the next two weeks
four more foreign banks and brokers would take out a special membership,
costing Fl 40,000, which was needed to give them access to ATM.
Under Amsterdam's new bond trading rules, transactions below Fl 2.5m will
remain the preserve of the central trading system, in which orders must be
channelled and executed through one of two 'hoekman' (or market specialist)
firms in the field of Dutch government bonds, Bondgeest &amp; Springer and Van
Hees.
Under ATM, by contrast, a joint venture between these two 'hoekman' firms,
Bondgeest &amp; Van Hees, will run an order book in the form of a
non-interactive screen and also act as interdealer broker, if required.
Participants can close deals either by using the inter-dealer broker or by
direct trading between institutions.
