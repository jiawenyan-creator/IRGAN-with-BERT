FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Clayton Dubilier in further
acquisition
Westinghouse Electric has agreed to the sale of its electrical supply
company for Dollars 340m, marking the latest in a series of disposals
planned by the troubled US conglomerate.
The company, with annual sales of Dollars 1.6bn and 3,000 employees, is
being bought by Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, a private investment firm which has
been an active buyer of businesses shed by ailing corporations.
Westinghouse said last year it was in negotiations to sell Westinghouse
Electric Supply to shed unprofitable businesses which it no longer
considered core. The price for the company is put by Clayton Dubilier at
just below its book value.
The deal brings to about Dollars 1bn the purchases made by the investment
firm in the past two months. At the end of last year, it paid Dollars 310m
for General Motors' Allison Engine subsidiary, and Dollars 300m for Du
Pont's Remington Arms business.
The purchase price comprises Dollars 100m of equity and Dollars 50m of
mortgage notes, with the balance in the form of bank debt, said Mr Alberto
Cribiore, a principle at the firm. Westinghouse will keep a 10 per cent
stake in the company, with an option to increase the stake.
Wesco distributes electrical products to manufacturing and construction
companies.
The investment firm said its policy was to strengthen the management of
companies it bought and run them as stand-alone businesses. Mr Charles Ames,
a Clayton Dubilier principle and former chairman of Reliance Electric, will
become chairman of Wesco.
Other acquisitions have included Xerox's Van Kempen Merritt, an investment
management company, and IBM's Lexmark International, a computer workstation.
