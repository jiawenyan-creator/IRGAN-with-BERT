BULLET HITS PLANE, GRAZES PASSENGER 
A twin-engine commuter plane was hit by a bullet Sunday while on final approach 
to Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport, the Broward County Sheriff's 
Office said. 
A passenger, Edward Clark Wright, 42, of Dove Canyon, Calif., was grazed by the 
bullet, which authorities believe was fired from the ground. Wright was treated 
for a superficial scalp wound at Broward General Medical Center and released. 
The bullet was recovered but a search for the gunman continued Sunday night, 
Jim Leljedal, spokesman for the Sheriff's Office said. 
"This is certainly an isolated incident. It could have been an accident," he 
said. 
USAir Flight 4343 from Eleuthera and Governors Harbour in the Bahamas was 
flying at less than 1,000 feet on final approach with the landing gear down 
when the bullet hit the plane. The twin-engine turbo prop Hinson commuter plane 
was carrying 16 passengers and three crew members.
