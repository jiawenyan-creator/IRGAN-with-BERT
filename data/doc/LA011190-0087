NATION IN BRIEF; 
WASHINGTON, D.C.; 
DEMOCRATS GO FOR POST-CENSUS POWER 
House Democrats announced a fund-raising drive in anticipation of perhaps 18 
congressional districts shifting toward the Republicans after the 1990 Census. 
The campaign, IMPAC 2000, will try to raise $1 million to help Democrats keep 
or win state offices before congressional districts are redrawn. With six or 
seven new seats in California at stake, Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), chairman 
of the drive, noted that the party in power will decide which party the 
boundaries will favor when the legislatures adjust them to reflect population 
shifts since 1980. California's delegation is expected to grow from 45 
representatives to 51 or 52, or almost 12% of the House.
