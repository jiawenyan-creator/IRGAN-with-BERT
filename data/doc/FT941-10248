FT  10 FEB 94 / Observer: Belgian yawn
In terms of news value, the latest press release from the Belgian-based
direct marketing Montreux Symposium is a humdinger. 'No Montreux symposium
this year' it reads - thanks to lack of interest.
'We'll be back,' promises Erik Van Vooren, the symposium's president. Can't
wait.
