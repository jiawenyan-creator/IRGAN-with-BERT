  [Text] Riyadh, 18 Mar (SPA) -- A responsible source at the 
Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources said in a statement 
to SPA today that what was published yesterday, 17 March, by the 
TEHRAN TIMES on Saudi Arabia's oil production and policy was 
merely unfounded newspaper fabrication which was not based on 
reality. 
  He added that "the international oil industry and 
international oil organizations, including OPEC, consider the 
TEHRAN TIMES to be an unreliable source of information and oil 
analyses. That is, it is a newspaper that lacks credibility and 
no trust can be placed in what it says about the oil situation 
in the Arab Gulf region or outside it." 
  He said: "All specialized oil publications, organizations, 
and oil information centers certify that the Kingdom adheres to 
its allotted quota and to all the agreements it signs. In 
contrast, Iran, according to most sources, adheres to its quota 
only when it is incapable of production." The source added: 
"The untrustworthy Iranian oil policy has become a source of 
annoyance inside OPEC and helped prices to fall over the past 
four months." 
  The source concluded his statement by saying: "The attempt 
by the TEHRAN TIMES to avoid talking about the deteriorating 
economic conditions inside Iran as a result of the poor 
financial and oil policies of the Iranian Government and to 
blame others for this is a desperate effort; neither the outside 
world nor the Iranian people themselves will believe it."
