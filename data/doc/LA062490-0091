BETTING WITH BOB; 
MAN VS. MICROCHIP 
Once again, I had two-thirds of a triple bet, losing $18 Saturday. My bets for 
today are $30 exactas from Iroquois Park to Saddle Up and P.J.'s Image in the 
fourth race and $10 exactas from Saddle Up and P.J.'s Image to Iroquois Park. 
Bob's Saturday Bankroll: $1,964 
Saturday's Loss: $18 
Current Bankroll: $1,946 
The computer lost $70 Saturday when Elegant Bargain, the longest shot on the 
board, ruined its exacta in the sixth race. Elegant Bargain finished second 
behind the computer's key horse, River Master, and ahead of its second pick, 
Stylish Stud. Perhaps feeling down in the dumps, the computer is betting there 
today: a $10 exacta box on $10,000 claimers Jungle Jaklin, Ki Nobre and 
Kamikaze in the second race. 
Computer's Saturday Bankroll: $1,689.50 
Saturday's Loss: $70 
Current Bankroll: $1,619.50
