Europe"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Mar (ANSA) -- The European Union's 
decision to approve an Italo-British proposal for 
institutionalisation of relations with Central and East Europe 
was described as "important and significant" by Italian Foreign 
Minister Beniamino Andreatta Monday [7 March]. 
  In comments to journalists here, Andreatta explained that 
the 
timetable for economic integration with the six former Soviet 
satellites would be dictated by "economic factors and therefore 
be rather slow." 
  But "threats of instability in Europe, such as those 
deriving 
from the situation in Moscow," he said, made "speeding up the 
timetable for political cooperation" essential. 
  Andreatta voiced hopes that the plan would soon be extended 
beyond Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania 
and Hungary to take in the three Baltic states as well.
