LOCAL; 
ROCK HUDSON INSURER NOT LIABLE 
A federal judge has ruled that Rock Hudson's insurance company, Aetna, is not 
liable for the $14.5-million judgment awarded by a jury to the late actor's 
lover, a lawyer said today. 
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, in issuing his ruling here Monday, 
found that because Hudson never told Marc Christian that he had AIDS, the 
actor's insurance coverage does not apply. 
As a result, Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. will have to pay no part of the 
award. 
Aetna will also not be responsible for the legal costs of the ongoing appeal of 
the February, 1989, verdict against Hudson's estate, Aetna attorney Michael 
Leahy said.
