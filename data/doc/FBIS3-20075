  [Begin Tsoundos recording] There was intensive movement 
toward solution of the FYROM problem during the deliberations at 
the informal EU foreign ministers meeting, which is continuing 
and will conclude later today in Ioannina. 
  A short time ago, it was learned that Hans Van Den Broek, EU 
commissioner in charge of foreign policy, will discuss the issue 
in Athens tomorrow with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. 
  At yesterday's meeting of the EU foreign ministers, the 
Greek 
presidency briefed its partners on the Greek countermeasures 
against FYROM and stressed the justified political character of 
the countermeasures. Mr. Papoulias stressed that the 
countermeasures are in agreement with EU law and are provided 
for by Article 224 of the EU Treaty. The exchange of views that 
followed were held in a friendly atmosphere and emphasis was 
given to role of the United Nations and mediator Cyrus Vance for 
a solution to the FYROM problem. In a statement late last 
night, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that some 
progress was made but did not commit himself to the possibility 
of a final solution in the current period. [end recording]
