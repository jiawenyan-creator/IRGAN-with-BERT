FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Rolls-Royce workers lose their daily
bottle
'THATCHER the milk snatcher' did it to school-children 20 years ago. Now a
group of Rolls-Royce foundry workers have also lost their daily bottle of
milk.
Since before the Second World War the company has been providing a daily
pint of milk to each member of a group of workers at its Derby plant's light
alloy foundry.
As with schoolchildren before Mrs Margaret Thatcher's decision as education
secretary to end the era of free school milk for those over seven, it was
for the good of their health.
Rolls-Royce started the practice because it was thought milk would alleviate
the effects of toxic fumes given off by molten metal.
Twenty years ago Rolls-Royce's medical advisers decided that this was not
the case but the company carried on the tradition anyway.
Now, however, the free milk has become a victim of the latest round of cost
cuts at a company coping with the effects of a worldwide recession in the
aerospace industry.
The end of the milk round for about 25 workers at the foundry, employing
300, was condemned yesterday by the AEU engineering union.
Mr Ken Smith, AEU divisional organiser, said it was a penny-pinching move.
He said conditions in the foundry were much better because of improved dust
extraction facilities. But the company's decision saved it very little money
and was 'too petty for words'.
Rolls-Royce said there was no medical benefit to the workers in drinking
milk as had once been thought. The move was part of a series of measures to
improve the company's efficiency.
Earlier this year the company announced that it was cutting between 1,200
and 1,500 jobs at its Derby commercial aerospace operations because of the
recession.
Union leaders fear there will not be enough volunteers for redundancies and
that the company will try to introduce compulsory redundancies.
