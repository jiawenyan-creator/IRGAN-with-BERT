FT  01 MAY 92 / ASB will not include revenue investment activities in
financial reporting standard
A PROPOSED requirement for companies to list their spending on items such as
advertising and training has been dropped from the forthcoming accounting
standard on the profit and loss account, it emerged yesterday.
The Accounting Standards Board said it would not include so-called revenue
investment activities in its second financial reporting standard, due in the
autumn.
Revenue investment is designed to show expenditure charged to the profit and
loss account incurred to enhance profits. It includes spending on research
and development, and big maintenance and refurbishment projects.
The withdrawal comes after widespread condemnation of the proposal from
companies which claimed that spending on these items was difficult to
identify and that disclosure would threaten their competitive position.
But there was also a noticeable absence of support for the idea from users
of accounts during the consultation period on the standard. 'We flew a kite,
but no one seemed to want revenue investment,' said Mr David Tweedie, board
chairman.
