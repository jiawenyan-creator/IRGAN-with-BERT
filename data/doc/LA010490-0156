COLLEGE STUDENT FOUND SLAIN, HIS YOUNGER BROTHER MISSING 
A college student was shot to death on New Year's Eve in his family home in 
Agoura Hills and his younger brother has disappeared, authorities reported 
Wednesday. 
The bullet-riddled body of Michael Minkoff, 20, an engineering student at 
Moorpark College, was found about 11:30 a.m. Sunday on the kitchen floor of the 
house in the 28900 block of Dargan Street, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy 
Roger Hom said. 
The victim's brother, Bradley, 18, is missing, along with the family's Volvo, 
the deputy said. 
Detectives want to question the younger brother about the shooting, but they 
have not ruled out the possibility that he could be a victim as well, Hom said. 
"There's always been sibling rivalry" between the two brothers, Sgt. Bill 
Gaynor said, "but I don't know there was enough to kill." 
Investigators said they found no weapons and there was no indication of forced 
entry into the home. 
Michael Minkoff's body was found by deputies sent to the one-story stucco home 
in response to a 911 call that apparently was placed by the victim, Gaynor 
said. 
"He didn't say anything," Gaynor said. 
However, the address of the location from which a 911 call is made appears on a 
monitor screen at the dispatch office, the sergeant said. When deputies 
arrived, the phone was off the hook, he added. 
Gaynor said neighbors did not report hearing or seeing anything unusual. 
The parents, Barbara and David Minkoff, were vacationing in Mexico. They were 
told of the shooting by deputies who met them as they arrived late Sunday at 
Los Angeles International Airport, Gaynor said.
