ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 
FREE DESIGN SERVICE OFFERED MERCHANTS 
The Redevelopment Agency is providing local businesses with free architectural 
services in a store-rehabilitation program, hoping to spur merchant 
participation in a city effort that has so far received only a lukewarm 
response. 
The Storefront Rebate Program, introduced last year, offers financial 
assistance to merchants in specified redevelopment areas who want to give their 
buildings a face lift. 
Assistant City Manager Donald S. Anderson said the city hopes to upgrade 
buildings that are outdated or in need of repair. 
"This program was initiated due to the realization that much of the city was 
developed in the 1950s and 1960s and we're now into the 1990s," Anderson said. 
"In some cases, the building owner or tenant hasn't done any remodeling or 
rebuilding because they just didn't have the money." 
The program offers rebates of 50% to 75% for improvements ranging from a new 
coat of paint and new signs to new awnings and outside landscaping. 
To provide further incentive, the agency voted this week to provide up to 
$2,500 worth of free architectural design services to businesses that decide to 
join the program. 
Anderson said without the free design services, there would probably be little 
interest in the program from the business community. 
"We think providing the designs is really going to help. This way, they can see 
what their building can look like, it's at no cost to them and they are under 
no obligation to proceed," Anderson explained. 
The stretch of older commercial buildings along Westminster Boulevard near 
Golden West Street is the type of area that the city wants to upgrade. 
"We're anxious to get this program off the ground," Anderson said. "It's good 
for the business community and it's good for the city." GREG HERNANDEZ
