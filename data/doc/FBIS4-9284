  [Text] At the end of a meeting this morning with Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu, FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic stated to the press that the NATO ultimatum against 
the Bosnian Serbs provokes antagonism and complicates the 
situation in Bosnia because NATO is only pressuring the Serbs 
and is not taking into account the military actions of the 
Bosnian Muslims. On the other hand, Mr. Vladislav Jovanovic 
declared that the cease-fire agreement in Gorazde, which was 
reached yesterday in Belgrade, represents an appropriate way to 
find a solution to the crisis and that the Belgrade leadership 
insists on the immediate cessation of hostilities. 
  Apart from the Bosnian conflict, discussions between the two 
foreign ministers also focused on bilateral relations. The 
sides agreed that Romanian and Yugoslav experts will soon meet 
in order to finalize the text of the basic political treaty 
between the two states, our correspondent Eugen Baboi informed 
us.
