FT  07 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: CME relaunches futures
contract on MMI index
THE CHICAGO Mercantile Exchange hopes to give a new look to the 10-year old
Major Market Index futures contract when it relaunches the derivative on its
trading floor today.
Futures trading on the MMI, which tracks 20 of the most heavily capitalised
companies in the US, is being transferred to the CME from the Chicago Board
of Trade in a renewed marketing effort.
'The MMI futures contract is an undervalued asset with tremendous
potential,' said Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman. 'We have serval important
initiatives planned that will enhance the MMI as a tool to be used by
institutional investors to manage their assets and their risk.'
The MMI, designed to track movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is
licensed to the Chicago Exchange by the American Stock Exchange, which
trades options on the index. Interest in MMI futures has dwindled in recent
years, with daily volume falling to less than 800 contracts.
The CME has encouraged 35 pit traders to migrate from the CBoT to
participate in the MMI contract under a special membership programme.
In addition, the Amex will this Friday launch flexible options on the MMI in
New York as a means of attracting fresh trading interest.
In October, pending Securities and Exchange Commission approval, the Chicago
Stock Exchange plans to trade a 'Chicago basket' of the 20 blue chip stocks
in the index. This is aimed at encouraging institutional arbitrage between
the spot index and the derivative contracts.
The MMI expands the CME's range of existing equity index futures, which
include futures on the FTSE-100, the S&amp;P 500, the S&amp;P 400 midcap index, and
the Nikkei 225 Japanese stock index.
