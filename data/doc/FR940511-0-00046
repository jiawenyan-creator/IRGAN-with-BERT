 



Response: 

NOAA believes that the Sanctuary is large enough to buffer the sensitive canyon and coastal ecosystems from negative
impacts of mineral development. Further, NOAA's authority to regulate discharges from outside the Sanctuary boundary
that subsequently enter and injure Sanctuary resources or qualities provides additional protection over mineral
activities. 


Comment: 

NOAA should commit in the FEIS/MP and Record of Decision to the preparation of an EIS before lifting the prohibition.



Response: 

As previously discussed, the Oceans Act of 1992 prohibits oil and gas explorations, development and production within
the Sanctuary. This prohibition may only be lifted by an Act of Congress. 


Comment: 

The oil companies should be excluded from voicing an opinion regarding the Sanctuary because this privilege should
be extended only to those who have spent time enjoying the State of Washington coastline. 


Response: 

The Sanctuary program does not and cannot discriminate against any individual, agency, or interest group. All individuals
have the right to voice an opinion. 



Comment: 

Has NOAA come across any proposal for offshore wind generated power? 


Response: 

NOAA is not aware of any proposal for offshore wind generated power. 


Comment: 

The President's decision to postpone OCS activities off the coasts of Washington and Oregon until after the year 2,000
should expire at that time unless affirmatively extended. 



Response: 

Section 2207 of the Oceans Act of 1992 indefinitely bans oil and gas exploration, development and production within
the boundary of the Sanctuary. These prohibitions could only be lifted by an Act of Congress. 



Contingency Plans 




Comment: 

The Sanctuary should establish a contingency plan in coordination with existing state and Federal contingency plans.
Efforts should be made to coordinate with the State of Washington Departments of Wildlife, Fisheries, Ecology, and
Natural Resources and pursue data sharing opportunities. 



Response: 

The FEIS/MP identifies existing oil spill contingency plans and efforts in the State of Washington to cover the Strait
of Juan de Fuca and Outer Coast. NOAA will coordinate closely with the existing agencies involved in contingency and
emergency response planning, particularly the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guard and the State of Washington Office of
Marine Safety (OMS). However, NOAA agrees that the Sanctuary requires its own contingency plan to ensure that resources
are protected during events that threaten the environment. A prototype Sanctuary Contingency Plan is being tested
at the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Once implementation experience has been gained, the plan will
be adapted to other sites, including the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. To implement successfully an organized
emergency response, NOAA will incorporate state and Federal legislation as well as local efforts into the Sanctuary
Contingency Plan. 


Comment: 

NOAA needs to provide for better oil spill response planning. 


Response: 

NOAA is coordinating with the regional response committees of the OMS to ensure that the equipment is available to
address an emergency that would threaten Sanctuary resources. 



Comment: 

An Oil Spill Response Center should be sited in close proximity to the Sanctuary to address small spills north of Grays
Harbor where there is currently a lack of oil spill response capability. 



Response: 

NOAA is promoting this idea in its participation on the regional response subcommittee whose jurisdiction is the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Outer Coast. However, priority will be placed on the stationing of tugs and barges dedicated
to emergency response. 


Comment: 

The tribes should be properly funded to handle resource damage assessment as well as other activities where an oil
spill could impact their subsistence and ceremonial harvest and cultural values. 


Response: 

The reservations are not within the Sanctuary boundary. Therefore, the Sanctuary cannot dedicate funds to the Tribes
for the purpose of damage assessment pursuant to a spill of hazardous materials. 


Comment: 

NOAA should request that the oil industry's Marine Spill Response Corporation station a tractor/tug response vessel
at Neah Bay. 


Response: 

NOAA has made the recommendation to the subcommittee on emergency response for the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Outer
Coast. NOAA is actively participating in formulating the recommendation to the State, and will coordinate with the
Makah Tribe in their planning initiative to expand their marina to plan to accommodate a tug or emergency response
vessel that is of appropriate size to service the Outer Coast and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. 


Comment: 

NOAA should ensure that drills are conducted for the Clean Sound Cooperative with outside evaluation. 


Response: 

NOAA intends to hire an operations manager immediately after designation to address issues related to vessel traffic
and contingency planning. One of the priorities of this position will be to encourage the Coast Guard to focus on the
Sanctuary during its emergency response drills.
