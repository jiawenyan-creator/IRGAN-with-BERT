FT  19 JUL 93 / Russia reinforces Tajik troops
Moscow sent military reinforcements to the troubled central Asian republic
of Tajikistan at the weekend, where fighting between the government and its
Moslem opponents threatens to involve Russia, Chrystia Freeland writes from
Moscow. The move came as the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported that 40
rebels and five government soldiers had been killed in a clash during a
rebel raid on a village.
Tensions rose last week after the Tajik opposition forces, aided by seasoned
mujahideen fighters from neighbouring Afghanistan, killed 25 Russian
soldiers in a shoot-out on the Tajik-Afghan border.
Kabul accused Russia of mounting a retaliatory attack against Afghan
villages close to the border in which they say more than 80 people were
killed or injured.
Russian and Tajik officials deny the charges, but over the weekend top
Russian military leaders vowed to crack down on the Tajik opposition.
