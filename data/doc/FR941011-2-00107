Kenneth Wayne Green, Jr., M.D. Revocation of Registration



On May 4, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Kenneth Wayne Green, Jr., M.D. The order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr.
Green's DEA Certificate of Registration, BG124039, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration
as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The statutory predicate for the issuance of the Order to Show Cause was Dr.
Green's lack of authorization to handle controlled substance in the State of Texas. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). In addition,
the Order to Show Cause alleged that Dr. Green's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest,
as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).

The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Green by registered mail to his DEA registered address, 2728 Oak Lawn, Dallas,
Texas and to Post Office Box 191428, Dallas, Texas. Both Orders were returned to DEA unclaimed with the notation ``addressee
unknown.'' DEA Investigators made numerous attempts to locate Dr. Green. Investigators went to Dr. Green's DEA registered
location, which was his medical office, and learned that the office had been closed and the doors padlocked. Investigators
also went to Dr. Green's residence and to his parent's residence. Additionally, they contacted the state medical
authorities and the post office.

In their attempt to locate Dr. Green, DEA Investigators learned that he maintained a mailbox at a mailbox service company
located at 729 Grapevine Highway, Hurst, Texas. DEA Investigators personally delivered the Order to Show Cause to
that location. An employee confirmed that Dr. Green had a mailbox with that company. Some time later, that Order to
Show Cause was returned to DEA unclaimed.

The Deputy Administrator finds that the DEA Investigators made numerous attempts to locate Dr. Green and have determined
that his whereabouts are unknown. It is quite evident that Dr. Green is no longer practicing medicine at the address
listed on his DEA Certificate of Registration. The Deputy Administrator concludes that considerable effort has
been made to serve Dr. Green with the Order to Show Cause without success. Consequently, the Deputy Administrator
now enters his final order in this matter based on the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.54 and 1301.57.

The DEA investigative file reveals that Respondent had abused Demerol and Vicodin, Schedule II and III controlled
substances, respectively; had been hospitalized for drug and alcohol abuse on February 7, 1991; had participated
in an impaired professional program between March and June 1991; and lost his clinical privileges at a medical center
in April 1991, due to his intemperate use of Demerol and Vicodin. Based upon those findings, on April 10, 1992, Dr. Green
and the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), entered into an agreed Order whereby Dr. Green's license to
practice medicine was suspended for ten years. The suspension was probated under certain terms and conditions. One
term provided that Dr. Green abstain from the consumption of alcohol and chemical substances. Another term required
that Dr. Green provide either a urine or blood specimen at the request of a Board representative.

On June 5, 1992, a compliance officer with the Board collected a urine sample from Dr. Green. The sample tested positive
for cocaine. As a result, on August 28, 1993, the Board again suspended Dr. Green's license to practice medicine for
ten years, said suspension stayed. Dr. Green's medical license was placed on probation under certain terms and conditions.
One condition required that Dr. Green abstain from the consumption of alcohol and chemical substances.

On November 2, 1993, the compliance officer returned to Dr. Green's office to obtain a urine specimen. Dr. Green initially
refused to comply with that request. Approximately three hours later, he provided a urine sample. The sample tested
positive for amphetamines and methamphetamine.

The investigative file further reveals that Dr. Green violated other provisions of the Texas Board Orders dated April
10, 1992 and August 28, 1993. Dr. Green failed to participate in the activities of the Dallas County Medical Society
Committee on Physician Health and Rehabilitation; failed to receive treatment from his counselors and from his treating
physician; and failed to immediately submit himself for a random screening for alcohol or drugs on November 2, 1993.

As a result of the foregoing, the Board issued a Final Order, dated August 19, 1994, revoking Dr. Green's license to
practice medicine in the State of Texas. Additionally, Dr. Green failed to renew his Texas controlled substances
registration on or before March 31, 1994. Consequently, he is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances
in the State of Texas.

The Deputy Administrator concludes that, based upon the information contained in the investigative file, there
are sufficient grounds for the revocation of Dr. Green's DEA Certificate of Registration and for the denial of any
pending applications for renewal. The fact that Dr. Green is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances
in the State of Texas is a sufficient ground, by itself, to order the renovation of his registration. DEA has consistently
held that it cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not authorized to handle controlled substances
in the state in which he practices. 21 U.S.C. 823(f); Stephen A. Richards, D.D.S., 59 FR 42074 (1994); Scot Kazalla,
D.D.S., 59 FR 28424 (1994); Myong S. Yi, M.D. 54 FR 30618 (1989); William D. Romers, D.D.S., 52 FR 12621 (1987); Ramon
Pla, M.D., 51 FR 41168 (1986); Kenneth K. Birchard, M.D., 48 FR 33778 (1983); and cases cited therein. Since Dr. Green
is no longer authorized to handle controlled substances in the State of Texas, the Deputy Administrator cannot maintain
his DEA Certificate of Registration in that state.

In addition, the information regarding Dr. Green's history of drug abuse provides further support for the revocation
of his registration and for the denial of any pending applications for renewal. The Deputy Administrator finds that
Dr. Green's continued drug usage and relapses leads to the conclusion that he cannot be entrusted with the responsibilities
of a DEA registrant and that his continued possession of a registration would be contrary to the public interest. Allan
L. Gant, D.O., 59 FR 10826 (1994); David M. Headley, M.D., 58 FR 58183 (1994); Robert W. Sonntag, M.D., 53 FR 45606 (1988).

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637) hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
BG1204039, previously issued to Kenneth Wayne Green, Jr., M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked. The Deputy Administration
further orders that all pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and hereby are, denied. This
order is effective November 10, 1994.
