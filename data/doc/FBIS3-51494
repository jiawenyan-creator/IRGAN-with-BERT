  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 12 Jan (EFE) -- The rebel 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) today threatened to 
occupy Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas State, and it called 
on the people to join its struggle. 
  The EZLN issued the warning in a communique released before 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced an 
unilateral cease-fire by the Army in Chiapas in an effort to 
achieve peace in the region. 
  "On 12 January, we will enter and seize Tuxtla Gutierrez, 
the 
capital of the state, and our comrades already located in 
different parts of the Mexican Republic will rise up until we 
achieve the overthrow of the evil government which has been in 
power for many years," the EZLN said in reference to the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
  Until noon today, there had been no clashes between the Army 
and the rebels in Tuxtla Gutierrez and calm prevailed in the 
conflict zone. 
  "It is deceitful that we are being controlled by foreigners. 
We are all 100 percent Mexican, and we are asking for justice 
for both us and our children," stated the rebel communique, 
which was issued to the local media. 
  Meanwhile, civilian sources stated that all roads in Chiapas 
State have been opened and that there have been no clashes or 
shelling within the past few hours. The last fighting occurred 
on the night of 11 January at Military Garrison No. 31 in Rancho 
Nuevo. It is unknown whether there were any casualties. 
  The Army has advanced up to the community of El Momon, some 
30 km from Guadalupe Tepeyac -- the last rebel stronghold in 
Chiapas -- where the Army will try to reestablish civilian power.
