Appendix L to 1915.1001_Work Practices and Engineering 
Controls for Automotive Brake and Clutch Inspection, Disassembly, 
Repair and Assembly_Mandatory 


This mandatory appendix specifies engineering controls and work 
practices that must be implemented by the employer during 
automotive brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair, and 
assembly operations. Proper use of these engineering controls 
and work practices will reduce employees' asbestos exposure below 
the permissible exposure level during clutch and brake 
inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly operations. The 
employer shall institute engineering controls and work practices 
using either the method set forth in paragraph [A] or paragraph 
[B] of this appendix, or any other method which the employer can 
demonstrate to be equivalent in terms of reducing employee 
exposure to asbestos as defined and which meets the requirements 
described in paragraph [C] of this appendix, for those 
facilities in which no more than 5 pairs of brakes or 5 clutches 
are inspected, disassembled, reassembled and/or repaired per 
week, the method set forth in paragraph [D] of this appendix may 
be used: 


[A] Negative Pressure Enclosure/HEPA Vacuum System Method 


(1) The brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair, and 
assembly operations shall be enclosed to cover and contain the 
clutch or brake assembly and to prevent the release of asbestos 
fibers into the worker's breathing zone.
