  [Text] Having violated the cease-fire reached with the 
Russian mediation, the Azerbaijani troops have been launching 
constant attacks for the last two weeks now all along the entire 
front in Karabakh. 
  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army press service 
reported that the defensive positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon in 
the north, and those in Martuninskiy Rayon to the south have 
been coming under attack for the last day. The Karabakh Army 
units are successfully resisting the pressure of the Azerbaijani 
formations in both sectors. 
  The NKR Defense Army spokesman provided the following 
information concerning the enemy's losses since the Azerbaijani 
Army launched its latest offensive: Six Azerbaijani tanks and 
four armored cars were hit. Five captured tanks have already 
been repaired. The number of Azerbaijani troops and officers 
killed reach 700. 
  Some 42 soldiers were killed and three tanks destroyed on 
the 
Karabakh side. 
  In the opinion of the military observers, the huge losses 
suffered by the Azerbaijani Army are ascribed to the inclination 
of the new Azerbaijani leadership to achieve some military 
breakthrough for certain domestic political reasons. The same 
sources said that haphazardly formed and poorly trained 
infantrymen are being used in active combat operations against 
the Karabakh positions. 
  Another offensive was launched against the Karabakh 
positions 
to the north of Mardakertskiy Rayon at around 0730 this morning. 
After having lost two tanks and 40 infantrymen, the Azerbaijani 
units were forced to retreat to their initial positions.
