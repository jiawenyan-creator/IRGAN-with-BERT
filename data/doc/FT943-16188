FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Italians hold off Nigeria for extra-time
victory
Italy beat Nigeria 2-1 yesterday in the first game of the World Cup finals
to go to extra time, setting up a quarter-final clash with Spain on
Saturday.
Amunike scored following an error by Italian captain Maldini to give Nigeria
a 1-0 half-time lead against the run of play.
Italy beseiged Rufai's goal in the second half but were kept at bay by
Nigeria's powerful, physical defense and their own lack of punch.
The Italians, reduced to 10 men after Zola was sent off, equalised in the
last minute of regular time.
Roberto Baggio broke the deadlock from the penalty spot in the 12th minute
of extra time after Eguavoen had brought down Italian defender Benarrivo.
While Italian fans held their breath, Baggio stayed cool and planted his
penalty to the right of goalkeeper Rufai.
Two minutes later Yekini might have hauled Nigeria level again. However,
with the Italian defence all at sea, he could not fasten on to a proper
shot.
