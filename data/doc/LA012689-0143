Weirton Steel Corp. said it would go public to raise money for a $600-million 
modernization project under a plan allowing workers at the nation's largest 
employee-owned company to retain a majority stake. The West Virginia company 
said it will apply for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange when it goes 
public later this year, pending approval of the plan by employees. The 
agreement between the company's management and the Independent Steelworkers 
Union would reduce the 8,000 employees' profit sharing from 50% to 35% of the 
company's after-tax income. The company's pension plan would not change.
