  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry and 
the Bank of Japan were shocked Saturday by the yen's sharp rise 
to the 100 yen level to the dollar at one point in New York the 
day before. 
  The Japanese currency recovered to the mid-101 yen level to 
the dollar after concerted interventions by Japanese and U.S. 
monetary authorities, but dealers are anticipating the yen will 
rise again. The dollar temporarily plunged to a record postwar 
low for the New York market of 100.65 yen and ended Friday 
trading at 101.55-65 yen, up 0.25 yen from Thursday's close. 
Dealers said the yen surged on speculation that new Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority government, formed 
Thursday, might not be able to carry out effective economic 
stimulus measures. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii expressed appreciation of 
the 
Japan-U.S. concerted interventions, saying the recent meeting in 
Washington of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations agreed that 
excessive exchange fluctuations are not desirable. Fujii said, 
however, that "the exchange market is seeing sharp 
fluctuations," expressing concern about its effects on the 
Japanese economy, which has showed signs of recovery.
