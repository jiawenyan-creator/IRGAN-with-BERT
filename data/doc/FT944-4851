FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: BMW signs motorcycle joint
ventures in India with Hero
BMW of Germany and India's Hero group have agreed joint ventures to make and
market motorcycles in India, agencies report. Hero is the world's largest
bicycle manufacturer.
The aim is for Hero to assemble BMW's single-cylinder motorcycle F650 in
India for sale there, the German group said. BMW's F650 model is the
third-highest selling motorcycle in Germany, with 4,000 units sold this
year.
BMW said the company expected to sign a contract with Hero in 1995, with
production beginning soon after. Hero would build about 600 F650 motorcycles
a year, BMW said.
'We are convinced that by working together we shall be able to open a new
and promising market in India for larger-engined motorcycles,' said Mr W.
Hasselkus, president of BMW's motorcycle division, after signing a
memo-randum of understanding with Majestic Auto of the Hero group.
Majestic said there would be two new joint ventures. BMW would hold a
majority in a venture to source car components and market finished
motorcycles, while Majestic would hold a majority in a new motorcycle maker.
The two companies said they would carry out a feasibility study on the
possibilities of their making car products.
India's sales of motor cycles has doubled to 2m from 1m in the 1980s.
Mr Brij Mohan Lall, Hero chairman, said the details of the new joint
ventures would be discussed later. 'Both of us are committed to financial
participation but the minute details are yet to be worked out.'
Hero Motors would immediately start production of BMW's 650cc engine
motorcycles in India, adding Rs300m (Dollars 9.5m) in sales in the first
year, Majestic said.
