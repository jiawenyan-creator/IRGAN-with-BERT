EX-JOINT CHIEFS ON GULF CRISIS 
Oh, that we had elected a facsimile of Harry Truman! He wasn't about to let 
countless American youths be slaughtered invading an alien land, not when he 
had an ace up his sleeve. 
He weighed the odds, then kaboom! 
He carried a big stick and he used it. May our current leader love our young 
that much should all hell break loose!
