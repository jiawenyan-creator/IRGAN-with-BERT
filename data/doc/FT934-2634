FT  13 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television
Not the most promising night's broadcasting. It is one of those days when
television seems to be determined to heap Pelion upon Ossa, and drive us all
into a deep depression. On Channel 4, Refugee Story visits Rada Kovacevic
who fled from Bosnia after returning home to find her husband and children
dead with their throats cut (7.50). Panorama is also concerned with Bosnia,
asking how the West came to ignore the lessons of history and allow people
to get away with 'ethnic cleansing', a process so similar to Nazi policies.
Steve Bradshaw talks to refugees and victims in Foca (9.30 BBC1).
Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) is another programme about a mental hospital from the
team that has exposed conditions in Greek mental hospitals and in Ashworth
Special Hospital, and the activities of one doctor in Broadmoor. Today's
programme is about Gartnavel Royal Hospital in Glasgow. It investigates a
number of 'untimely' deaths.
To mark the centenary of Maupassant's death Radio 4 begins a new Book At
Bedtime: 'Bel Ami' (10.45).
