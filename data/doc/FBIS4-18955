  [Text] Yeltsin's visit to Spain should mark the beginning 
of a new period of bilateral relations. Today, the two foreign 
ministers signed several cooperation agreements and tomorrow a 
friendship treaty will be signed. 
  The agreements might not be very important if one refers to 
their content, but they are interesting because they relaunch 
Spanish-Russian relations. 
  [Begin Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana recording] 
This 
afternoon we signed five agreements, five important agreements 
that determine the new framework of relations between the 
Russian Federation and Spain. [end recording] 
  Regarding defense -- that is, one of the areas where there 
is 
the most bilateral cooperation -- a red phone line has been 
installed between the Kremlin and the Moncloa Palace. 
  A cultural and educational cooperation agreement builds on 
the Russian desire for links with foreign countries and 
democratization. Another agreement covers social security and 
labor relations providing for exchanges between the two 
countries. 
  The social security agreement puts an end to the 
uncertainties and difficulties of the children of the war, some 
600 Spaniards and their descendants who went to the territory of 
the former Soviet Union during the Spanish civil war. 
  They will now get the minimal pension payments without 
having 
paid into the Spanish social security system. This agreement, 
which does not cover the Spaniards in other former USSR 
republics, was not agreed upon until the very last minute. The 
Russians thought that it was the best way of putting pressure on 
Spain to get a more efficient financial aid.
