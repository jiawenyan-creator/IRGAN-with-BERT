  [Text] Donetsk -- On 8 February approximately 3,000 persons 
refused to work at the Chelyuskintsiv mine of the Donetsk Coal 
production association. A spontaneous rally of miners began 
outside the mine at 1200. Ivan Pashko, head of the mine's trade 
union committee, said in a conversation with a UNIAN 
correspondent: "The first thing which the miners are demanding 
is the payment of money earned by them. Neither do we have 
sufficient funds to provide material and technical for the work 
to go smoothly." 
  On the same day the Northern mine of the Dzerzhinsk Coal 
association stopped work. The strike at a mine of the Artemovsk 
Coal association is continuing, and the Torez Anthracite 
association is preparing for a strike.
