 

Because of the need to provide immediate guidance for the valuation of benefits in single-employer plans whose termination
dates fall during June 1994, and in multiemployer plans that have undergone mass withdrawal and have valuation dates
during June 1994, the PBGC finds that good cause exists for making the rates and factors set forth in this amendment
effective less than 30 days after publication.
The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866, because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866.
Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this amendment, the Regulatory Flexibility Act
of 1980 does not apply. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2).
