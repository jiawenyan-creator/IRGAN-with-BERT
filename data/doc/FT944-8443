FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): Star rating systems,
are they good or bad? - Critics have savaged them but their defenders are
equally passionate. Gillian O'Connor sets the scene for a heated debate
Two new systems for giving unit trusts star ratings are being introduced to
Britain amid a flurry of criticism. London Business School professor of
finance Elroy Dimson, and Peter Jeffreys, managing director of the widely
respected analyst Fund Research, are both vehement critics of the new
ratings, which are being published by measurement services Micropal and
Morningstar.
They are worried that the ratings will be treated as 'best buy' labels and
could also be used in advertisements to mislead the public. Dimson says:
'There is no question of there being high levels of predictability in these
rankings.'
The star ratings are based on risk-adjusted performance figures. These are a
more sophisticated version of the conventional performance tables, which
measure different trusts' total return over various periods of time.
The conventional tables take no account of the fact that some trusts take
greater risks than others and that their progress is, correspondingly, more
volatile. This volatility can be measured by statistical yardsticks such as
the standard deviation.
Both Micropal and Morningstar have their own methods of adjusting a fund's
performance for its risk. In very broad terms, such adjustments penalise a
very risky fund and reward one that is very steady.
The stars are intended to encapsulate the net risk/reward relationship.
Funds with the highest overall score get five stars; those with the lowest,
one. But statistics relating to past performance are of little use in
predicting how funds will do in future.
Dimson argues that risk-adjusted performance figures have no more predictive
power than conventional performance figures. Advertisements from unit trust
groups already use conventional performance figures as part of their sales
pitch.
The attacks on the star ratings took place at a recent FT Roundtable. Others
taking part were Chris Poll and Keith Sheffield, who run UK statistical
services Micropal and HSW respectively; James Coursey, who is UK editor of
Morningstar; and John Cuthbert, a freelance fund analyst. The Roundtable was
chaired by Barry Riley, investment editor of the FT. Edited extracts of the
discussion appear below.
POLL: The flaw in conventional five-year performance figures is that they
have only two common factors - what the price was five years ago and what it
is today, with nothing about what went on in between.
They do not give you the basis for any sort of qualitative evaluation
whatsoever. But people are using these figures to draw conclusions and make
recommendations.
At the end of the day, what do we all want? We want more people investing in
stock markets, either directly or indirectly through funds. And we want to
educate the public.
DIMSON: I don't know who 'we' is.
POLL: The unit trust industry.
DIMSON: But that is a million miles away from where the industry is. What
the industry does is to make promises of performance in which past
performance is extrapolated through to the future.
They build in part on data drawn from your services, making sometimes
implicit and sometimes explicit claims of the most outrageous nature about
the predictability of their returns.
They would be outrageous whether they take a price five years ago and a
price today or whether they take the period in between.
They would be outrageous whether they look at returns embracing data in
between or embracing volatility.
POLL: With commercialism, you're never going to stop people making claims.
SHEFFIELD: I'm not convinced that historical performance is even a relevant
starting point to future performance - partly because it fails to take
account of the market conditions under which we achieved that performance.
Historical performance tables have been useful in exposing the public to the
risks: the fact that some funds underperform others dramatically over
certain periods of time.
But you can't form total judgments from the collation of numbers. You need a
mixture of numbers and qualitative appraisal.
CUTHBERT: I find this argument bizarre. You are saying that you have this
historical world and you can't do anything with it in future. Doesn't this
imply that you can't pick good managers - or even that there aren't good
managers?
DIMSON: There is no dispute that there is a slight persistence in
performance at the bottom end: poor performers have slightly more than their
fair share of being poor performers in the following period. So, there is
something to be learnt from looking at the data. And it is appropriate for
individuals to know what's been happening to their unit trust.
But those are different functions from spotting a money manager who's going
to be better than all other money managers.
CUTHBERT: I think we may be missing something. We have a problem relating
past performance to future performance. But that does not necessarily mean
that we have a problem measuring managerial ability.
And if we can measure managerial ability - even though that process does not
have predictive content - it may still be rational to pick managers who have
shown more managerial ability than others in the past.
SHEFFIELD: I agree with some of your analysis, John. But I feel the
conclusions take us into dangerous territory. The danger is that a 'good'
fund manager will be expected to perform well in future.
RILEY: How should star ratings be used?
POLL: What we're trying to say by introducing star ratings is ' . . . in
addition to performance, is there another measure that will give an
indication of how that fund performs?' The star rating system says ' . . .
if you've got five, it's either an excessive performance and excessive risk
or medium performance with medium risk'.
We also spell out what the volatility is, separately. The star rating goes
out as part of a sheet on every fund which gives you a variety of
quantitative information. But the problem is that if you just put the basic
components of the star rating system down - the average investor won't
understand it.
We are not trying to say that the star rating system has predictive ability;
we are just trying to identify the characteristics of different funds.
COURSEY: It is important to make sure the star rating appears in context. We
have a statement that the star rating is an introduction, not a conclusion.
If you had a portfolio consisting only of funds with five stars and sold
them when the ratings went down to four stars, your portfolio would not
perform well.
SHEFFIELD: Do you put your customers (the unit trust management groups)
under any contractual obligation as to how they use your star ratings?
Because the advertisements will appear - as you know - saying 'Morningstar
five-star rating, Micropal five-star rating'. Do you explain that the star
ratings really must be related to other information?
POLL: We have a 20-page user guide which spells this out. Whether this is
going to be effective is a different question. Any star system is open to
abuse. Anything's open to abuse.
SHEFFIELD: Whatever you say here, the star ratings will actually be used if
you publish them.
POLL: But there is so much information published at the moment that is more
misleading - five-year performance tables and so on.
DIMSON: I feel you are all conniving. You are on your own side and so you
are on your customers' side.
There is no question of there being high levels of predictability in these
rankings. You need something like 25 years' data to conclude that someone
has superior capabilities which persist over time.
One can't say that star ratings based on three-year or five-year performance
are not helpful - people must have information that tells them what has gone
on in the past. But the implication that these are good-quality funds to
invest in for the future is overstated.
POLL: I'm not saying it is predictive, I'm saying it is informative.
RILEY: So, should we give up and say there is no connection between the past
and the future except for the dud funds?
POLL: What we are saying is that there is a balance between risk and reward
and there is a relationship. The star is not doing any more than
encapsulating that relationship.
DIMSON: I've heard the Consumers' Association explain the same thing. They
say: 'You look down this column and you can see how long the wash cycle is,
this one and the number of choices of different temperatures. You don't have
to look for the best buy'. But, in fact, they labelled it the 'Best Buy'.
You make it clear your stars aren't the 'Best Buy' . . . but it's terribly
tempting.
JEFFREYS: You would not dream of producing a star rating system based just
on cumulative relative performance, and risk-adjusted returns are no more
predictive than those. That's the killer.
DIMSON: All my Peps are in the Gartmore index fund. I put my money where my
mouth is.
