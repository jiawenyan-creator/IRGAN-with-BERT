BETTING WITH JANICE; 
THE REMATCH 
A wise woman once said: "It is better to have a short price than a long face." 
On Saturday, Mobile Phone finished first paying $3.60. Today, I will wager $100 
to win on Barrage in the sixth. 
Janice Goldinger's Sat. Bankroll: $1,785 
Saturday's Profit: $80 
Current Bankroll: $1,865 
SURELOCK, who was nosed out when Brown Bess finished second, lost $400 on the 
Bay Meadows simulcast. And, to make a bad day even worse, lost $100 when Wajd 
finished out of the money. Today his selection will be $100 to win on Salsabil 
in the Arc de Triomph simulcast race. 
SURELOCK's Sat. Bankroll: $1,800* 
Saturday's Loss: $500 
Current Bankroll: $1,300 
* Corrected total. 
Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in. 
SURELOCK does not own horses. 
Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.
