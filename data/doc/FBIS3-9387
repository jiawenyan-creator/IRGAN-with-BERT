<F P=106> [Hamid Deronjic report from Brcko] </F>
  [Text] The aggressor has intensified his attacks on the 
Brcko front, where -- since the outbreak of the war -- there has 
been fierce fighting against these Serbian-Montenegrin occupying 
forces. This morning at 0530 [0430 GMT] the Chetniks launched a 
fierce artillery and tank attack on the central part of the 
Brcko defense. From the direction of Cadjavac, the enemy has 
been firing from tanks and 120-mm mortars, and with antiaircraft 
guns and machine guns from several positions. This morning's 
attack on our positions has just been the continuation of what 
the aggressor was up to on the Brcko front overnight, when the 
defense lines were exposed to enemy attacks from recoilless 
guns, mortars, hand grenades, and antiaircraft guns and machine 
guns. Djukici and the central part of the Brcko defense were 
the main target of the aggressor's attacks. 
  The key part of the so-called northern corridor is the 
reason 
why the free Brcko territory has been under constant and fierce 
offensives by the Serbian aggressor ever since the outbreak of 
the war. That this is not going to end is confirmed by frequent 
reports on attacks by our forces that can be heard on Radio 
Bastille [radio bastilja, derogatory term for Belgrade Radio]. 
This, the central nervous system of Serbian fascism, has been 
spreading lies about alleged offensives of our units on the 
temporarily occupied Brcko, and thus calling for a new 
mobilization of Serbs in the so-called Yugoslavia for the Brcko 
front. 
  The alertness and combat readiness of our fighters, and the 
high morale of all the citizens of the free Brcko territory are 
in line with the seriousness and importance of the Brcko front.
