FT  03 SEP 92 / 'Secrecy' claim over Docklands
ALLEGATIONS of excessive secrecy were levelled at the government yesterday
over the planned move of Department of the Environment officials to London's
Docklands.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow minister for local government, accused the government
of suppressing reports about the state of the department's Marsham Street
headquarters, and about the full range of other possible sites.
The department is due to leave Marsham Street by the end of next year and
has published a shortlist of four possible new locations, including Canary
Wharf in Docklands.
In a letter to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, Mr Straw
contrasted the behaviour of the government in not publishing information
with the stated policy of 'open government' as expressed by Mr William
Waldegrave, the public service minister.
Mr Straw drew attention to empty office space available in and around
Westminster, both in the private sector and in government buildings soon to
be vacated, such as Alexander Fleming House in south London.
There was, he said, an estimated 6.56m sq ft of empty office space in
Westminster.
Unless the government was more open about the information on which it based
its decisions, there would be doubt about whether the balance of financial
advantage was really as ministers stated.
'There is a nasty whiff around the Docklands move, made much more pungent by
all this secrecy,' he added.
'If the Tories now reckon that taxpayers' money should be used to bail out
overblown Docklands property development, they must do so openly.
'This private, secretive decision making with other people's money - the
public's - is an abuse of power,' he said.
The department said some of the information had not been published because
it was commercially confidential.
Other buildings under consideration for the department's future location are
Thomas More Square, East India Dock and Harbour Exchange.
