FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Yasuda Trust to set up
securities subsidiary
Yasuda Trust and Banking yesterday announced that it planned to become the
third Japanese trust bank to set up a securities subsidiary, the latest step
in the industry's gradual deregulation.
Yasuda, the fourth-largest trust bank - which traditionally specialise in
managing clients' assets - said it would open the new unit by the end of
June at the earliest.
Under a relaxation in rules made in April last year, trust banks and
long-term credit banks are allowed to launch subsidiaries to issue
convertible and warrant bonds - but not deal in them - and to deal in
straight bonds. This privilege was extended early this year to the powerful
city banks.
So far, the finance ministry has licensed five banks to set up securities
subsidiaries, in line with its strategy of cautious deregulation.
