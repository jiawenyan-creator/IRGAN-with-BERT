FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Upton &amp; Southern cuts losses to Pounds
321,000 after reorganisation
Following a period of reorganisation, Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the
retailer which is buying the Reject Shop chain, reported reduced losses for
the 52 weeks to January 29.
The pre-tax deficit for the period amounted to Pounds 321,000, against
Pounds 636,000 for the previous 53 weeks. Turnover fell from Pounds 10.7m to
Pounds 8.67m, of which Pounds 685,000 (Pounds 2.79m) came from discontinued
operations. Losses per share were reduced from 7.03p to 0.29p.
In the latter 24 weeks of the period the company swung back into the black
with a profit before tax of Pounds 176,000. However, this included a Pounds
92,000 profit from the sale of the Huddersfield investment property and the
company's participation in a development in Kettering, the directors said.
Upton has changed its year end to July 31, a move made in contemplation of
the proposed acquisition for Pounds 2.5m of The Reject Shop.
Agreement had been reached on the purchase which, for management accounting
purposes, would be operated as a separate cost centre from the group's
retail business, said Mr James Hodkinson, Upton's chairman.
The benefits from the acquisition would begin to be seen in the new
accounting year commencing August 1, he added.
