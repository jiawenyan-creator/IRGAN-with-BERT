FT  19 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): World Cup surge is good for
brewing profits - Guinness
The luck of the Irish football team in the World Cup is thought to have been
good for Guinness, the spirits and brewing group which reports its interim
results on Thursday.
Sales of the famous stout surged on both sides of the Atlantic as fans drank
in celebration of Ireland's progress to the last 16 teams. Guinness, which
sponsored the Irish team, became the fastest growing imported beer in the
US.
The City is expecting pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June
to come in around Pounds 320m, compared with a restated Pounds 305m
previously. The group's strong cash flow is expected to result in a sharply
lower interest charge from the previous Pounds 98m.
Mr Tony Greener, who took over as chairman at the beginning of last year,
warned at the annual general meeting in May that there was no sign of
generally improved market conditions, but he did forecast modest profit
growth for the half year.
Operating profits from brewing, which last year contributed Pounds 99m, are
expected to rise, lifted by higher sales in Ireland and Malaysia, where the
market had suffered under duty increases.
There could be signs that the market in Spain, where Guinness operates the
Cruzcampo brewery, is beginning to improve.
But Guinness makes the bulk of its profits in the spirits market, where it
sells dozens of brands. Conditions have been tough as recession has hit the
group's big markets in the US, UK, and Japan.
Operating profits are expected to be flat, but there are signs of a recovery
in volumes in the UK, while the group is gaining market share in the US.
The City hopes that Mr Greener will announce a new managing director for
United Distillers to replace Mr Crispin Davis, who resigned almost a year
ago.
