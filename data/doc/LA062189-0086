THE WORLD 
Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey, his dream of an overall majority 
shattered in last week's election, decided to meet with all opposition parties 
in a bid to extricate Ireland from the political crisis he created. Haughey 
called the election in an attempt to win outright control of Parliament. He 
ended up worse off and is now six seats short of a majority. After a Cabinet 
meeting to discuss the political impasse, Haughey said he will meet his foes, 
whose backing he needs to become prime minister for the fourth time when 
Parliament returns June 29.
