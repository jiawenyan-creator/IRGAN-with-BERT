FT  05 JUL 94 / First CSA annual report published
The Child Support Agency failed to meet almost all its main targets on costs
and services, says the agency's first annual report published yesterday,
John Willman writes.
The agency assesses and collects maintenance payments from absent parents to
support parents caring for the children. In its first year it took on
850,000 cases and made more than 200,000 maintenance assessments. However,
it fell Pounds 112m short of its target for saving the Treasury Pounds 530m
in the cost of benefits paid to parents caring for children. The agency also
achieved barely half its target of arranging maintenance for 60 per cent of
parents making eligible applications.
In spite of the controversy surrounding the agency - and a fierce campaign
against it by absent fathers - 61 per cent of clients regarded the service
as satisfactory in an independent national survey. This was only a little
short of the agency's target of 65 per cent.
On customer service, only 30 per cent of assessments were provided within
five days of receiving all the information needed - the target was 100 per
cent.
Ms Ros Hepplewhite, chief executive, blamed the failure to meet targets on
problems in bedding in the new system and campaigns against the agency's
work.
The agency is to take on an additional 700 staff to deal with the growing
workload, to add to the existing 5,300.
