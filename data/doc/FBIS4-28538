  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- A group of Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) lawmakers discussing Asian security issued a 
statement Thursday expressing regret over North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development program, saying it has caused 
grave distrust for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The statement came as the largest opposition LDP is going to 
send a small group of its legislators, headed by former Defense 
Agency Director General Taku Yamasaki, to North Korea on Tuesday 
in an effort to find a solution to the nuclear row. 
  In the statement, the party's study group on Asian security 
called on North Korea to return fully to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) at the earliest possible date. 
  Japan's largest political party, which up until last August 
had held a 38-year reign, also demanded that North Korea 
cooperate with the IAEA's request for inspections of its nuclear 
sites, including two undeclared facilities. 
  North Korea is suspected of secretly converting plutonium 
obtained from its plants for development of nuclear weapons, and 
has refused to accept full inspections by the IAEA. 
  The Japanese coalition government, repeatedly expressing its 
regret over the issue, is maintaining close contact with the 
United States and South Korea on how to deal with the north's 
nuclear problem.
