FT  07 NOV 94 / Observer: Peripatetic
Not high on everyone's list of emerging market possibilities, Uzbekistan is
among the former Russian republics or satellites being closely studied by
the First Russian Frontiers Trust, just set up by Pictet Asset Management.
It helps if you have an experienced pioneer, and Pictet's Douglas Polunin -
whose family originates from Russia - seems just the chap. His grandfather,
a renowned artist and stage designer, left St Petersburg in 1902 to settle
in Russian emigre circles in Paris. His father, Nicholas Polunin, an eminent
explorer, botanist and environmentalist, discovered Prince Charles Island in
the Arctic in the mid-1940s. Polunin himself was raised in Nigeria; he has
also lived in Baghdad and has a sister who runs a Buddhist centre in South
Korea.
If Tashkent gets him down, Polunin could always try writing a travel guide
to doing business in the world's difficult spots. Like London.
