  [Text] National Police Chief Fernando Caldera said 
yesterday he did not have any details concerning a U.S. State 
Department report that charges Nicaragua has made little 
progress in its struggle against drug trafficking and money 
laundering. Nevertheless, Caldera said, "the Nicaraguan state 
has made progress in its fight against drug trafficking--a fight 
that started from nothing." 
  Caldera indicated that in Nicaragua drug trafficking is a 
relatively new crime. The police chief said: "Drug 
consumption, particularly cocaine consumption, is a new element 
that has increased significantly in the past two years with 
trafficking." 
  He said this kind of criminal activity has increased 116 
percent. "These actions have increased significantly since 
1993," the high-ranking police officer asserted. 
  Nevertheless, Caldera explained that last year the National 
Assembly began discussing a draft drug fighting bill, which he 
termed modern. He also stressed that last year the government 
created the National Antidrug Commission, while police created 
the Narcotics Directorate. 
  "We now have a higher level of coordination with the DEA and 
Central American police forces," Caldera remarked as he recalled 
that the amount of drugs confiscated has increased sharply. "We 
are not yet doing everything we can, but the foundations have 
been laid," he pointed out. 
  Caldera explained that the U.S. DEA does not have an office 
in Managua, "but we maintain a close, cooperative relationship." 
He insisted a large publicity campaign will be needed to fight 
drug trafficking and consumption, but he warned that there will 
not be enough resources this year to undertake such a campaign. 
  Caldera said he wants "all of us" in Nicaragua "to develop a 
social disapproval for those engaged in drug-related activities 
in order that these people do not acquire the levels of 
notoriety they have in other countries in which there is a 
certain status attributed to narcotraffickers." 
  The police chief added there are abuses by some judges who 
lend themselves to the objectives of drug traffickers. "These 
are very rare cases, and they do not mean that everyone within 
the judiciary branch is in on it," he explained. 
  In addition, Caldera admitted some policemen have been 
punished for collaborating with drug traffickers, and he 
reiterated that police organizations are determined to fight 
these crimes. 
  The police chief said money laundering is an activity that 
is 
very easily detected in our country, although he admitted it 
might take place on a small scale in Nicaragua. "Dollars are 
laundered everywhere, even in the United States," Police Chief 
Caldera concluded.
