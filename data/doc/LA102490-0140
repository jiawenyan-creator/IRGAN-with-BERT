HALF A MILLION POLES BACK WALESA CANDIDACY 
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa upstaged his presidential rival Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki on Tuesday by presenting half a million signatures backing his 
candidacy for next month's Polish elections. 
Walesa's campaign chief said he presented the national election commission in 
Warsaw with sacks of signatures -- at least 500,000 names and five times the 
number required to register as a candidate. Prime Minister Mazowiecki 
registered last Wednesday with about 140,000 signatures. 
The number has only symbolic importance, but Walesa deliberately waited a week 
longer to register in order to upstage his rival.
