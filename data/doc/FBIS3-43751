  [Text] Pretoria Jan 13 SAPA -- An African National Congress 
[ANC] member's reported boasts about how he and his comrades 
killed political opponents like chickens vindicated Afrikaner 
Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] warnings and should 
not surprise the government. AVF spokesman Stephan Maninger said 
on Thursday: "Not only have we been saying as much, but the 
National Party [NP] government also has had access to security 
infrastructure through which it must have been aware of the fact 
that the ANC has never stopped conducting terror attacks which 
include political killings." 
  Mr Maninger was reacting to newspaper and radio reports 
quoting an East Rand Self Defence Unit [SDU] member, codenamed 
Tembo, as saying killing particular people did not worry him. 
  Tembo reportedly said: "I don't think about it because that 
is the situation, that when we kill particular people, for me it 
is like I have killed a chicken because I see no reason for him 
to live if he does not understand what the will of the people 
is, and what we are fighting for." 
  The AVF found it strange that the NP had reacted to the 
report by accusing the ANC of a "massive disinformation campaign 
to blame others for the violence", said Mr Maninger. "Two days 
ago State President F W de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela 
were jointly blaming so-called elements on the right for the 
township violence. "Consequently we see (NP information 
director) Marthinus van Schalkwyk's attack on the ANC as 
shadow-boxing for political gain. 
  "Instead, he and his party should refrain from fabricated 
and 
false accusations against the AVF and we suggest they act 
against the true culprits who kill people."
