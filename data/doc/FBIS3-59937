United States and UKRINFORM: "News Conference of the Ukrainian 
Ambassador in the United States"] 
  [Text] Ukraine's Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary in the United States Oleh Bilorus spoke at a 
news conference in Washington on issues of nuclear disarmament 
following the ratification of START-1 by the Ukrainian 
Parliament. 
  Even with the reservations made by Ukraine's Supreme 
Council, 
said Oleh Bilorus, the parliament's decree on the ratification 
of START-1 opened up new possibilities for the practical 
implementation of Ukraine's international obligations on the 
destruction of nuclear weapons on its territory. 
  At the same time, Oleh Bilorus stressed the special position 
occupied by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who insists on 
a new discussion and ratification by a future new parliament of 
START-1 complete with the Lisbon Protocol on Nuclear 
Nonproliferation.
