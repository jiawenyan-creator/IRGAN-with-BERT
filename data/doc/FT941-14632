FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: McDonald's in buy-back
McDonald's Corporation, the international hamburger restaurant chain, said
it intends to buy back Dollars 1bn of common stock within the next three
years, funded primarily by excess cash flow.
Since 1983, the company has bought back stock worth nearly Dollars 2.2bn.
Mr Jack Greenberg, chief financial officer, said the repurchases would
enhance shareholder returns, but would not dent the equity base needed to
support future growth worldwide.
McDonald's recently announced that it would accelerate its global restaurant
expansion, constructing 900 to 1,200 new stores annually, with about
two-thirds outside the US. It currently has 14,000 restaurants in 70
countries, with nearly 80 per cent independently owned by local franchisees.
