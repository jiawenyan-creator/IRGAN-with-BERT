  [Text] Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today hits 
out at the crafty preach of "labor-management cooperation" by 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam. 
  Preaching "labor-management cooperation" recently at the 
"new 
economy promotion council," the traitor driveled that 
"labor-management cooperation" is "an indispensable requisite" 
to serviving "the limitless competition" and he would "support" 
the enterprises successful in it. He cried that "efforts" must 
be made for "making this year the first year of labor-management 
cooperation." 
  The analyst says: 
  It is out of question for the employers and workers to 
cooperate with each other in such exploiter society as South 
Korea. It is like urging the wolf and the sheep to live in 
harmony in one pen. 
  Worse still, the traitor Kim Yong-sam cried for 
unconditional 
"cooperation" with existing labor act defending the interests of 
the employers left intact. This is tantamount to trying to 
pursuade the workers to put up with the exploitation by the 
employers, not minding the unfavorable working conditions and 
hunger wages. This is as good as preaching the workers to be 
calmly fleeced and trampled down till their death. 
  The eloquence of the traitor Kim Yong-sam about "limitless 
competition" is a tricky phraseology for lullig the resistance 
of the workers while slashing their wages. 
  The traitor's doctrine of "labor-management cooperation" is 
a 
motto of exploitation and repression veiled with the word of 
"cooperation." 
  Underlying this doctrine of traitor Kim Yong-sam is his 
ulterior intention to squeeze political fund from the employers 
by ensuring their profits.
