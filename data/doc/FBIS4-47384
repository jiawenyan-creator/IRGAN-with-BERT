  [Abstract] The alpha track method is used to determine the 
growth rate of nine iron-manganese concretions obtained in the 
southeast Pacific Ocean, on either side of the East Pacific 
Ridge at the Bellingshausen Sea. The tracks were recorded on 
cellulose nitrate. The growth rate varies from 1-16 mm/million 
years. For three concretions the growth rates are determined for 
the two opposite sides: for two of them, the concretion did not 
increase in one direction, and in the third, the growth rate 
differs by a factor of two. The rate of accumulation of the 
sediments on which the concretions lie was determined through 
radiocarbon dating and with the excess [.sup]230[/]Th method. 
The rate varied slightly, with an average of 0.4 mm/million 
years. The divergence in the age of concretions and the 
sediments on which they lie is associated with the activity of 
benthic fauna, which explains the inversion of radiocarbon date 
with depth. Figures 5; tables 4; references 23: 16 Russian, 7
