WCC ROUNDUP; 
SAN DIEGO BEATS PORTLAND 
Pat Holbert and Anthony Thomas ignited a second-half rally that lifted the 
University of San Diego to a 71-66 West Coast Conference basketball victory 
over Portland Saturday night at Portland, Ore. 
Holbert scored 24 points and Thomas had 14 for the Toreros (12-10, 7-3 in the 
WCC). 
Craig Cottrell put the Toreros ahead to stay, 63-62, when he sank a short 
jumper with 4:16 left. 
Steve Hutchinson scored 18 points for Portland (7-16, 4-6). 
Santa Clara 74, Gonzaga 72 -- Melvin Chinn sank two free throws with four 
seconds left to give the Broncos a victory over the Bulldogs at Spokane, Wash. 
Gonzaga (6-17, 1-9) tied the score, 72-72, on Mike Winger's three-point shot 
with eight seconds left. Winger thought the Santa Clara (8-14, 5-5) still led 
and fouled Chinn intentionally.
