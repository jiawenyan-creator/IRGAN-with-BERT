TAKESHITA SAYS JAPAN WILL HAVE TO OPEN RICE MARKET 
Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita says Japan will be unable to avoid 
partly opening its rice market in a world looking for freer trade in 
agriculture, two Japanese newspapers reported Friday. 
"It would be impractical if Japan had to leave GATT (the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade) to keep its rice import ban," Yomiuri Shimbun quoted 
Takeshita as saying. 
Tokyo Shimbun quoted him as saying Japan should encourage rice farmers to raise 
productivity while liberalizing the rice market. 
Japanese pay about six times world prices for rice, and the government has come 
under heavy pressure, especially from the United States, to end the import ban. 
Japan bans all commercial imports of rice and last year spent $2.1 billion 
subsidizing domestic production.
