FT  31 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: UK equestrianists fail
Mary Thomson squandered her chance of an Olympic medal in spectacular
fashion, demolishing five fences in the decisive show-jumping phase of the
three-day event to slump to ninth overall. Team-mate Karen Dixon removed
only one rail to finish fifth.
Either woman would have snatched a bronze if she had gone clear after New
Zealand's Andrew Nicholson completely re-arranged the Barcelona show-jumping
circuit, with nine fences down - a round which cost him the chance of
individual gold and gifted the team event to Australia. Individual gold went
to Australian Matthew Ryan and silver and bronze to German Herbert Blocker
and Kiwi Blyth Tait. Britain finished sixth overall.
