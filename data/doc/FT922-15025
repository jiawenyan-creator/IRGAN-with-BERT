FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Great Southern up 45% despite static death
rates
GREAT SOUTHERN Group, the USM-quoted funeral director, achieved record
results in 1991 despite static mortality rates in the UK.
The 45 per cent rise in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 3.22m to Pounds 4.68m
 -exceeded analysts' estimates.
Mr James Smillie, chairman, said the outcome reflected tight control of
overheads and debtors, which in turn led to improved margins and cash flow.
Gearing was reduced from 123 per cent to 96 per cent.
The core funeral services side contributed operating profits of Pounds 4.34m
(Pounds 3.8m) on turnover ahead from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 20.3m.
Higher overall volumes were behind a rise to Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 1.1m) in
crematoria and cemeteries operating profits. Turnover rose to Pounds 4.82m
(Pounds 4.23m).
Ancillary services put in operating profits of Pounds 575,000 (Pounds
288,000) on turnover of Pounds 2.59m (Pounds 2.03m), attributable mainly to
the continued growth of Chosen Heritage, the group's pre-paid funeral
scheme.
Fully diluted earnings per share jumped 47 per cent to 21.6p (14.7p). A
proposed final dividend of 6.7p lifts the total for the year to 10p (8.5p).
