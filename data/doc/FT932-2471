FT  18 JUN 93 / Futures exchanges compete for right to trade Mid 250
derivatives
TWO London-based futures exchanges are competing for the right to trade
futures and options contracts on the FT-SE Mid 250 index, made up of the 250
UK stocks which rank below the FT-SE 100 index by market value.
The London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and
OMLX, the London-based arm of Sweden's OM Group, are both expected to submit
bids to the London Stock Exchange for the licence to trade these new
instruments in the next few months.
Interest in the Mid 250 index, created last October, has accelerated because
it has substantially outperformed the FT-SE 100 index of larger companies
over the last six months.
The creation of the Mid 250 index futures would allow fund managers to shift
their exposure between different parts of the market - a process known as
asset allocation - more easily.
But the success of new equity index products is not a foregone conclusion,
even when there is growing interest in the underlying market. Liffe launched
futures on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index of continental European stocks in
June 1991 but had to suspend the contracts last year due to low trading
volume.
Smith New Court, the integrated securities house, already quotes
over-the-counter futures on the Mid 250 index on Reuters but 'overall volume
has been disappointing,' according to Mr Gerald Freedman, director of
derivatives.
Both OMLX and Liffe are currently conducting research on the level of demand
for Mid 250 index products - in Liffe's case, in conjunction with the stock
exchange.
Liffe is the favourite to win the race, since it already trades futures and
options on the FT-SE 100 index. However, Mr Lynton Jones, chief executive of
OMLX, said OMX Swedish stock index options are more heavily traded than the
FT-SE 100 options.
