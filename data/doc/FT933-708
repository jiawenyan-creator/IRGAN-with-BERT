FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Cook puts case for workers' rights
LABOUR'S industrial strategy was based on a shift in power towards people
working in manufacturing industry and away from speculators, Mr Robin Cook,
the shadow trade secretary, emphasised yesterday.
He said the lack of rights for workers had been one of the reasons why the
recession in the UK had been steeper than in other European countries.
Multinational companies found it easier to make employees redundant in
Britain.
Speaking in an economic debate which saw successive speakers call for
greater rights, for example in union recognition and employment protection,
Mr Cook insisted that protection for workers and industrial recovery went
together. 'We won't build stability in the economy when we offer only
insecurity in the workplace'.
Mr Cook highlighted the commitment to long-term investment in the
consultation paper on industrial strategy which he published in April.
Its suggestions include encouraging pension funds and building societies to
channel personal savings into industry as well as property, reform of
takeover law to bring greater stability and representation of employees on
company boards.
He also underlined the need for regional development, saying that parts of
the UK outside south-east England should have a stronger role in economic
decisions, through regional development agencies.
Over the months since his paper had been published, he said, a further 18
coal pits had been shut because of the 'rigged' energy market the government
had created when it privatised electricity, and which a Labour
administration would end.
In the same period, some 30,000 more companies had gone bankrupt: 'Stephen
Dorrell tells us this government is creating an inflation-free world. What
worries me is they are creating a factory-free Britain,' he said.
