JURY TOLD OF LUCAS RAGE AT WOMEN 
A psychologist who examined convicted killer David Lucas told jurors Tuesday 
that Lucas harbors "a great rage" toward women. 
Dr. Alvin Marks testified as a defense witness for Lucas, 34, whose attorneys 
are trying to persuade a jury to recommend a life sentence without possibility 
of parole rather than the death penalty. 
Lucas of Spring Valley was convicted June 21 of three throat-slashing murders 
-- of two women and a child -- and of the attempted murder of another woman. 
Marks said Lucas' is ambivalent toward women and "loved them and hated them." 
He said Lucas' father, Clarence Lucas, had a "total contempt . . . for women" 
and cited instances where his father mistreated Lucas as a boy. 
Lucas' 16-year-old niece, Trisha Graves, urged jurors to spare his life. She 
said Lucas "has done a lot for me." 
Lucas was convicted of killing USD student Anne Swanke, 22, on Nov. 20, 1984, 
as well as Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and Colin Jacobs, 3, both on May 4, 1979, in 
their Normal Heights home. 
The same jury acquitted Lucas of a 1981 killing. The jury stalemated, 11 to 1 
for conviction, in two 1984 Lakeside Killings. 
San Diego Superior Court Judge Laura Hammes told jurors that they may have 
final arguments in the penalty phase on Thursday.
