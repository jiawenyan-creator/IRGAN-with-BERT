FT  06 MAY 94 / BZW to sue over collapsed group
BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, is likely to sue several other
parties over the collapse of the financial services group British &amp;
Commonwealth in 1990, Sir Peter Middleton, BZW chairman, said yesterday.
Sir Peter told Barclays annual general meeting that BZW would respond to
being sued by Ernst &amp; Young, administrators to B&amp;C, by issuing its own
writs. 'By the end of the process, quite a lot of people are going to be
sued,' he said.
Sir Peter said that BZW had received writs from Ernst &amp; Young because the
six-year limit on liability was about to expire. He said that the writs were
'completely unspecified' and BZW was unsure of what was being claimed.
He declined to say which companies BZW would sue, but it is thought that
other corporate advisers involved in B&amp;C's purchase of Atlantic Computers in
1988 - such as NM Rothschild, the merchant bank - could be sued.
The collapse of Atlantic in 1990 was one of the main factors which led to
the closure of its parent company. B&amp;C bought Atlantic for Pounds 407m but
was then forced to write off Pounds 550m against the investment.
Barclays, which was B&amp;C's biggest lender, wrote off Pounds 100m against
expected losses from its loans to B&amp;C in its 1990 accounts.
Sir Peter told the meeting that corporate advice was an area in which there
was an increasing amount of litigation but that BZW had controls to limit
the risk of losses from being sued.
