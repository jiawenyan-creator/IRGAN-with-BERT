FOOTBALL ASSN. PROPOSES 16-TEAM PLAYOFF 
The College Football Assn. has presented a plan to bowl representatives for a 
16-team national championship playoff in the early 1990s that could bring 
participating schools millions of dollars but undermine the present bowl 
system, a newspaper reported. 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said CFA Executive Director Chuck Neinas 
revealed the plan at a closed meeting with eight bowl representatives in 
Atlanta Wednesday. Attending the meeting were officials from the Orange, Sugar, 
Cotton, Holiday, Citrus, Fiesta, Liberty and Peach bowls, the newspaper said. 
The CFA is a group of 63 schools that play Division I football, including teams 
from the Southeastern, Atlantic Coast, Southwest and Big Eight conferences, 
plus leading independents such as Notre Dame, Penn State and Florida State. 
The playoff would exclude the Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences which have 
their own television package, the paper said. 
Bowl sources said the CFA has been seriously studying a playoff system for the 
past four months and considered more than 40 plans before deciding on the one 
revealed Wednesday. 
According to the Journal-Constitution, the plan calls for a selection committee 
similar to the one that picks the field for the NCAA basketball tournament. The 
committee would pick and seed the 16 teams for the playoffs. 
The top eight seeds would host first-round games on the campuses. The four 
quarterfinal, two semifinal and championship games would be held at current 
bowl sites yet to be determined and would essentially take the place of those 
bowls. The championship game, which may be rotated among several bowl sites, 
would be held on the weekend before the NFL's Super Bowl. 
The CFA will take the plan to its membership at its annual convention June 2-4 
in Dallas. If it passes there, the CFA will try to get it on the ballot for the 
NCAA convention in January.
