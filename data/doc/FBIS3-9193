<F P=106> [CTK report: "The Civic Democratic Party Leads With 30 </F>
Percent, Followed by the Civic Democratic Alliance and the Czech 
Social Democratic Party"] 
  [Text] If elections to the Chamber of Deputies were to be 
held now, the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] would win with 30 
percent of the vote. The second-strongest party would be the 
Civic Democratic Alliance, with 11 percent, and the Czech Social 
Democratic Party would come in third, with 10 percent. This is 
apparent from the results of a poll conducted at the beginning 
of March by the Institute for Public Opinion Research. The 
other parties would not attain the 5-percent limit. The 
Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party and the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, with 4 percent each, and 
the Left Bloc and the Association for the Republic-Republican 
Party of Czechoslovakia, with 3 percent each, would win the most 
votes of these parties. More than one-quarter of citizens (26 
percent) have still not made up their minds which party they 
would vote for. Only 12 percent of respondents consider the 
newly established Democratic Union to be necessary. Of the 
ODS's current supporters, 21 percent are of the opinion that 
this party is necessary, and 8 percent of them would perhaps 
vote for it.
