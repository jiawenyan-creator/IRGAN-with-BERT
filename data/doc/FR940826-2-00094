 

B. As this Court Has Held Repeatedly, Cellular Exchange Service Is ``Exchange Service'' Subject To the Decree's Equal
Access Requirements.
Alone among the Bell Companies, BellSouth urges the Court to declare that the Decree's equal access and interexchange
provisions ``do no apply'' to wireless services. (BellSouth Mem. 6, Apr. 15, 1994) BellSouth has not withdrawn this
argument, which the United States rebutted in its earlier opposition to BellSouth's Motion (U.S. Mem. 610,
Apr. 29, 1994) BellSouth nonetheless argues that Section II should not be interpreted to have been intended by the
parties and the Court to be limited to the landline local exchange.
As more fully set forth in our prior brief, BellSouth's argument is frivolous. Whether or not the issue was ``fully
litigated'' (BellSouth Mem. 11) as part of a trial that addressed all aspects of the telecommunications industry,
the Decree's interpretation is settled.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The Decree's terms are not themselves limited to landline telecommunications (see Section IV.O, defining ``telecommunications''),
and that understanding was set forth in the Department's filings prior to the Decree's entry.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 ATT and regional company executives committed prior to divestiture that cellular systems would provide equal
access.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 This Court has repeatedly ruled that cellular services are subject to Section II of the Decree, e.g., Mobile Services
Opinion, 578 F. Supp. at 645; Triennial Review, 673 F. Supp. at 551; ATT/McCaw Decision, 154 F.R.D. at 4, and has
likewise entered more than 49 waiver orders premised on the proposition that cellular services are subject to Section
II. The Court of Appeals has likewise proceeded on that assumption without questioning this premise.

The Tunney Act contemplates the filing and entry of consent decrees in cases in which no testimony has been taken, 15
U.S.C. 16(a), much less that the issues address had been ``fully litigated.'' If BellSouth were correct, consent
decrees otherwise authorized by the Tunney Act could not be enforced.

``As set out in the Department's Competitive Impact Statement, the proposed modification would not prohibit the
BOCs from offering either cellular radio or land mobile radio. These types of services fall within the definition
of exchange telecommunications.'' Response to Public Comments, 47 FR 23320, 23335 (May 27, 1992); accord, Mobile
Services Decision, 578 F. Supp. at 645 (``mobile radio services are `exchange telecommunications' within the meaning
of Section II(D)(3) of the Decree'').

ATT's Memorandum Replying to the Responses to the Court's Order of April 22, 1983, at 5  n.* (May 19, 1983);
Affidavit of Joseph T. Ambrozy (Mid-Atlantic Region), sworn to May 18, 1983, p. 9; Affidavit of Delbert S. Staley (Northeast
Region), sworn to May 18, 1983, p. 15. These representations are quoted at U.S. Mem. 8, Apr. 29, 1994. BellSouth's assertion_ignoring
all these statements_that ``the contemporaneous statements of the parties further confirm that they did not intend
to impose equal access obligations and interLATA restrictions on wireless networks'' (BellSouth Mem. 8) is at best
uninformed.

Southwestern Bell does not join BellSouth in arguing that Section II does not apply to cellular services_although
it comes close, arguing that concerns about market power in cellular ``are illegitimate under the decree.'' (Southwestern
Mem. 15) Southwestern argues that ``the wireless switch is not an `essential,' `bottleneck,' or monopoly facility.'''
(Southwestern Mem. 711, June 20, 1994)
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 This argument_if it is meant to suggest that the cellular duopoly is not a source of competitive concern because there
are two cellular carriers permitted to operate in any particular market
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
_is without merit, whether argued as a matter of decree interpretation or as a matter of competitive analysis.

ATT made the same argument in support of its effort to acquire McCaw. Memorandum in Support of ATT's Motion
for a Waiver of Section I(D) of the Decree insofar as it Bars the Proposed ATT/McCaw merger, pp. 5057 (May
31, 1994) (``ATT I(D) Mem.''). Before announcing its plans to acquire McCaw, ATT recognized that the integration
of cellular and interexchange services without equal access ``would extend the cellular exchange duopoly_and the
apparent noncompetitive pricing of cellular `air time'_into the provision of interexchange services to all cellular
customers.'' ATT's Opposition to RBOCs' Motion To ``Exempt'' Wireless Services from Section II of the Decree,
p. 7 (Apr. 27, 1992). Two years later, after ATT announced its proposed acquisition of McCaw, ATT offered
exactly the opposite view. ``These [cellular] systems are not monopolies that can be leveraged into long distance
and manufacturing markets.'' ATT I(D) Mem. 52.

Southwestern argued to the FCC that it would promote competition if the cellular duopolists were awarded all of the
new PCS spectrum. ``[A] choice among service providers stimulates and ensures competition. ***
[A] choice would exist *** because there are already at least two such providers in each market.''
Comments of Southwestern Bell Corp., In the Matter of Amendment of the Commission's Rules to Establish New Personal
Communications Services, p. 12 (F.C.C. Nov. 9, 1992) (Gen. Docket No. 90314). Southwestern makes the same
claim here. ``[N]o provider has the ability to leverage anything at all, regardless of its incentives. There is always
a competing mobile provider down the road.'' Southwestern Mem. 12. As we show below, two providers is insufficient
for genuine competition in these markets, and Southwestern itself observes internally that these duopolies are
``highly attractive'' because of their ``absence of significant price competition.'' [SWB 218486]
The BOC documents quoted in this memorandum, and exhibits derived from cellular company data cited in this memorandum,
have been submitted to the Court under separate cover. Documents produced to the Department in its investigation
are grouped by producing party, and within those groupings by document number, and are cited in this memorandum by
party name or abbreviation and document number. The exhibit volume has been provided to the Court. It will be provided
to any party to this proceeding that signs the non-disclosure agreement the Department submitted to the Court today.
The Department plans to file the exhibit volume and to make it available to the public on August 1. We request that any
producing party objecting to disclosure of a particular document do so by July 27 so that, if warranted, any confidential
documents will be filed under seal.
