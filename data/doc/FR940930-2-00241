 In its May 26, 1994 

Federal Register

 Notice, the Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA'') implemented a new program under which GNMA would
guarantee multiclass mortgage-backed securities. The Notice provided for implementation in two stages, the initial
stage and the full participation stage. With the completion of the initial stage, GNMA is now commencing the full participation
stage of its multiclass securities program. The program is intended to benefit borrowers using federally insured
or guaranteed mortgages by increasing investment demand for GNMA guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'')
that are backed by these mortgages, thus reducing financing costs for these mortgages; and raise revenues through
the receipt of guarantee and other fees by GNMA.
