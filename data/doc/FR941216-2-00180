SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor vehicle
is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States,
certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model of the motor
vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register

.
Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer R90009) petitioned NHTSA
to decide whether 1992 Ferrari 348TB passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published
notice of the petition on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 37126) to afford an opportunity for public comment.
As stated in that notice, the vehicle which Champagne claimed to be substantially similar is the version of 1992 Ferrari
348TB that Ferrari S.p.A. manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The petitioner alleged that it had carefully compared
the two vehicles, and found them to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claimed that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is identical to its U.S. certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence ....,
