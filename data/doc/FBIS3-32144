  [Text] LTU President Hans Joachim Driessen has announced 
that the German charter airline is going to study the 
possibility, with Cubanacan S.A., of forming a mixed civil 
aviation enterprise by 1995-96. The German businessman also 
offered to collaborate in promotions and advertising encouraging 
German tourist travel to Cuba. Another aspect is the possibility 
of increasing the German airline's flights from Dusseldorf to 
Cuba; nor did Driessen discard the idea of cruise ships.
