<F P=106> ["Clarification issued by the spokesman for the Party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea on rumors regarding Democratic Kampuchea's 
internal affairs;" dated 29 January -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 1. There have been rumors concerning Democratic 
Kampuchea's [DK] internal affairs. 
  2. The spokesman for the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] 
would like to clarify that the DK is a movement of the nation 
and the people that has been building, consolidating, and 
expanding for years. The DK enjoys unity and internal 
solidarity in its policies, organization, and activities. The 
DK is carrying out noble tasks -- along with the entire 
Cambodian nation and people --to struggle and fight with a lofty 
sense of responsibility against the Vietnamese aggressors, 
territorial expansionists, and race exterminators and their 
lackeys. 
  People inside and outside of the country are aware of and 
clearly understand the PDK's role in collaborating with the 
Cambodian nation and people to liberate the nation and people 
and safeguard the Cambodian race. 
  The DK has been preserving its unity and internal solidarity 
as well as its solidarity with the nation and people. It will 
continue to do so in the future; this is vital to the DK and to 
our nation and people for many generations to come. This is the 
sole ideal and the cement that binds the DK's unity and 
solidarity; that is, love for the nation and people and the 
political platform of the Cambodian National Union Party [CNUP]. 
  Every PDK member, regardless of whether they are from the 
old 
or the new generation, carries out their task according to their 
sector and field -- that is, within the framework of this lofty 
and sacred love for the nation and people -- and firmly adheres 
to the CNUP's political platform. Historical circumstances, the 
actual situation, and current and future geopolitics require the 
DK and the CNUP to adhere to this policy and organize new and 
appropriate generations of cadres. This is aimed at maintaining 
unity and internal solidarity so as to continue to join the 
nation and people in ensuring that a Cambodian nation and people 
exist in the world and absolutely preventing today's Cambodia 
from becoming a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian 
territory now part of Vietnam]. 
  If the DK did not enjoy unity and internal solidarity, it 
would not have been able to join with the nation and people in 
carrying out successive national tasks in the face of its savage 
and brutal enemies.
