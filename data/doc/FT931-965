FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Swedish property group slumps to
SKr1.22bn loss
NCC, the Swedish property and construction group, slumped to a SKr1.22bn
(Dollars 157m) loss in 1992 after property write-downs of SKr1.4bn.
The group was also hit by SKr417m in losses from associate companies,
including the stainless steel group Avesta Sheffield and the shipping
company Effjohn. It is scrapping its dividend after paying out SKr2 per
share in 1991, when its loss was SKr122m.
NCC said its result before property write-downs and excluding associate
companies improved to SKr587m from SKr430m despite weak construction markets
and falling rent levels. Its rationalisation programme, which has cut 4,300
jobs, had started to yield results, with overheads down by more than
SKr500m.
The construction division improved profits to SKr811m from SKr742m, while
real estate operations returned a SKr88m profit before write-downs, against
a SKr25m loss in 1991. The international division recorded a reduced loss of
SKr20m, compared with SKr128m.
NCC has written down its property portfolio by SKr1.8bn in the past two
years. The latest write-down was bigger than its forecast of SKr700m-SKr1bn.
