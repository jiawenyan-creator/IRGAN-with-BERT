SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
A frightened 8-year-old girl who testified Wednesday in the murder trial of an 
El Cajon man accused of killing his girlfriend's daughter said she saw the 
victim being abducted by someone in a red car. 
The third-grader spoke very softly and appeared frightened during her testimony 
in Matthew LeSure's trial in San Diego Superior Court. LeSure, 28, is charged 
with brutally beating 2-year-old Sarah Toussant on June 14. Her body was found 
in a trash bin not far from their home. 
The 8-year-old, who took long pauses before answering questions, said she saw 
Sarah Toussant get into a red Ford with four doors the day she disappeared. She 
said the girl was wearing a sailor suit. 
Her testimony is at odds with the prosecution's theory of the case, which is 
that LeSure beat the child and put the body in the trash bin. 
She said the 2-year-old was crying and was grabbed by someone in the red car. 
A playmate who testified later said she told the first girl about Sarah 
Toussant being missing. 
The second girl, a sixth-grader, said the third-grader did not mention seeing 
the little girl taken away in a red car. 
A tape recording of a phone call to El Cajon police was also played for the 
jury. LeSure was heard telling police about the girl's disappearance. 
"I had her there (in a park), and I fell asleep, and when I woke up she was 
gone. This is killing me."
