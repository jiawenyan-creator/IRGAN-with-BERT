FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington appoints new group chief
executive
PILKINGTON, the glass group, is appointing Mr Roger Leverton as group chief
executive. He is replacing Mr Derek Cook, group managing director and deputy
chairman, who will retire in June having reached the normal retirement age
of 60 last December.
Mr Leverton is currently president and chief executive of Indal, a Canadian
subsidiary of RTZ, the mining and industrial group. He is 53, and will join
Pilkington in July.
Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said that Mr Leverton had 'an excellent
track record as an international manager'.
His appointment would help with the strategy of 'increasing the group's
focus in our key business territories around the world,' Sir Antony added.
Mr Leverton was chief executive of MK Electric, the electrical products
maker, which RTZ took over in 1988 through a hostile bid.
Previously he had been with Black &amp; Decker, the electrical goods group. Sir
Antony said the appointment was the result of a search, aided by
headhunters, for a new chief executive and Mr Cook had stayed on past
retirement age until the place was filled.
Lord Croham, an independent director, is to retire in December and Sir
Michael Quinlan, a former permanent under-secretary at the Ministry of
Defence, will join the board as a non-executive in October.
Pilkington, which makes glass for both the construction and automotive
industries, has suffered badly in the recession in the UK and North America
with profits down from Pounds 314.3m to Pounds 151.6m in the 1990-91 year.
Its shares have been under a cloud since it fought off a hostile takeover
bid from BTR, the conglomerate, in January 1987.
In the past two years Pilkington has been reviewing all its operations and
has sold a number of peripheral activities which were not performing.
Bid speculation flared again when BTR increased its stake in December 1990
but has since subsided once more.
