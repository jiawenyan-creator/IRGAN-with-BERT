FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 16m loss for Allied Leisure
Shares in Allied Leisure fell 16p to 27p yesterday after the nightclub and
ten-pin bowling company announced interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 16.1m and
a board shake-out.
The company blamed the deficit, struck against a Pounds 1.2m profit last
time, on restructuring provisions of Pounds 14.2m and large asset
write-downs.
As part of the upheaval Mr Richard Carr, chief executive, has agreed to
resign and two other directors are leaving the main board to concentrate on
operational affairs.
Their departure follows a 72 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds
592,000 in the 24 weeks to January 2.
The operating figure, achieved on flat turnover of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds
11.5m), was also depleted by Pounds 300,000 in one-off payments to out-going
directors, including Pounds 180,000 payable to Mr Carr.
Mr Damien Harte, appointed finance director last November, said: 'We had to
take action. The company was suffering from a combination of problems which
threatened its ultimate survival.'
Determined to safeguard Allied's future, he initiated the restructuring,
which included Pounds 9.7m in asset write-downs, Pounds 3m to cover the
disposal of lossmaking operations and a further Pounds 1.5m for further
reorganisation. The company has also decided to sell its Liverpool bowling
alley and close four clubs and bars in Dundee and Bedford, which reported a
combined trading loss of Pounds 941,000.
Market uncertainty increased after the company admitted it was in breach of
its banking covenants over the write-downs and provisions.
Mr Harte, however, said the group's bankers remained supportive and had
agreed to a three-month moratorium on capital repayments of its Pounds 14.9m
debt. 'We expect to be able to present some structural solutions to our
lenders and shareholders by the middle of the year.'
Losses per share emerged at 25.2p (2.92p earnings) and the interim dividend
is passed - 1p was paid previously.
The company also said Mr Carr had sold 1.5m shares yesterday - reducing his
stake to 5.06 per cent - but retained full confidence in the board.
