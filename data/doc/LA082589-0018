SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: ROWE IS SLOWED, TUIOTI STOPPED BY KNEE PROBLEMS 
In what otherwise was termed an outstanding day of practice Thursday at San 
Diego State, Coach Al Luginbill had a couple of not-so-pleasant subjects to 
discuss -- both involving knee injuries. 
Receiver Patrick Rowe, a junior, is still ailing from an irritation in his left 
knee and may not be ready for the Aztecs' opener a week from Saturday at Air 
Force. 
"Patrick Rowe's situation has become more doubtful for the opener," Luginbill 
said. "We'll know by Monday." 
After the Air Force game, SDSU has a week off before the home opener against 
UCLA Sept. 16. Luginbill indicated he should know by then if Rowe would be 
redshirted. 
Junior Dennis Arey will start at flanker if Rowe is unable to. 
Reserve defensive lineman George Tuioti, a sophomore, has been declared a 
"medical hardship" because of persistent left knee injuries. 
"He will be on scholarship at the university as long as he keeps a 2.0 
grade-point average and continues to pursue his degree," Luginbill said. "It's 
all related to a previous knee injury that medically cannot be corrected." 
Luginbill said he and SDSU's medical staff do not want to run the risk of 
having Tuioti permanently crippled.

Air Force. JIM LINDGREN
