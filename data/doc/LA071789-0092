THORNBURGH SUBPOENA QUASHED 
A judge today rejected defense efforts to subpoena Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
to testify in the Wedtech bribery trial about a report lambasting his 
predecessor Edwin Meese III's unethical conduct. 
The ruling came as Meese wrapped up his testimony at the racketeering trial of 
E. Robert Wallach, Wedtech's lawyer, in U.S. District Court. Meese's one-time 
lawyer and friend is accused with two others of taking $2 million in Wedtech 
stock payoffs and using his influence with Meese to get lucrative defense 
contracts for Wedtech. 
Wallach's lawyers urged U.S. District Judge Richard Owen to allow them to 
subpoena Thornburgh, promising he would testify that he refused to adopt an 
internal report by the Office of Professional Responsibility that accused Meese 
of violating government ethical standards. Owen quashed the subpoena, however, 
saying Thornburgh's testimony would be "irrelevant."
