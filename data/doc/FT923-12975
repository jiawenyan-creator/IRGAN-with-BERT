FT  16 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK market
Yesterday's further 17 per cent slump in the shares of the management
consultant Alexander Proudfoot makes one suspect that a trend is emerging in
the London market. Proudfoot is one of a clutch of medium-sized stocks -
others include BM Group and MTM - to have collapsed suddenly in recent
months. Most have suffered sudden changes in top management. All were at
their peak relative to the market when they came to grief. The reaction has
in each case been savage. Proudfoot's shares are down 45 per cent since late
May. BM and MTM are down 79 per cent and 88 per cent from their peaks in
June and February respectively.
The last time the market was this jumpy was in October 1990, immediately
after the collapse of Polly Peck. That time, the targets were companies with
heavy borrowings. This time it is companies with doubtful earnings. It is
worth recalling that in 1990 the market made some shrewd choices of victims,
such as Maxwell Communication and Brent Walker. It is perhaps also worth
recalling that the worst of the price collapses coincided with the bottom of
the market, when the FT-SE index bounced off the 2,000 mark.
The complicating factor this time is the lack of warning. Investors in
Maxwell or Brent Walker knew them to be heavily indebted and were taking a
calculated risk. The problem now is pressure from the real economy, which is
harder to assess. But all the companies mentioned - the list could be
extended to include Albert Fisher - were essentially creatures of the 1980s.
Perhaps, in markets like these, one criterion for stock-picking is companies
which were kicked around in the recession of 1980-81 and managed to survive.
