FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Windsor fund may be set up
A PRIVATE fund to contribute towards the restoration of Windsor Castle after
the fire last year was in prospect, Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary, told MPs yesterday.
Mr Brooke, who provoked criticism from some Labour MPs for immediately
offering government money to rebuild the castle, said that the cost of
clearing up the site and making it safe would be about Pounds 1.5m, and that
while it was too early to estimate the total costs, there was 'no reason to
suppose' they would be as high as the often-quoted Pounds 60m.
