<F P=106> [Interview with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F>
Xavier Gautier in Paris; date not given: "Hurd: Serbs Must 
Return One-Fourth of Their Territory"] 
  [Text] [Gautier] After the "success" of the talks in 
Sarajevo, do you think an ultimatum is required to unblock the 
situation in Tuzla and Srebrenica? 
  [Hurd] The situations in those places are different. 
However, we need to open the Tuzla airport and provide relief 
for Srebrenica. A Netherlands reconnaissance unit is already in 
Srebrenica. There is a plan to open an air corridor and channel 
aid from Tuzla (...). It is almost ready to be executed, but 
there are other towns where the suffering is greater: Mostar, 
Vitez, and the Maglaj pocket. The United Nations must prepare a 
plan that is suited to each of these situations (...). 
  [Gautier] After Sarajevo, is the threat of air strikes still 
necessary in Bosnia? 
  [Hurd] Everything depends on what happens. The ultimatum is 
holding in Sarajevo. If the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
forces are attacked anywhere in Bosnia, they will be defended 
from the air (...). I do not rule out the use of force in the 
future (...). 
  [Gautier] The situation in Sarajevo was unblocked following 
Russian mediation. You were the first to welcome the "success" 
of Russian diplomacy. What kind of inspiration does Moscow's 
big return to the Balkans have for you? 
  [Hurd] I would first like to point out that this initial 
success in Sarajevo is due to three factors. First of all, 
obviously, there was the NATO decision. Then there was the work 
on the ground by an excellent British general and excellent 
French troops. Lastly there was the Russian initiative, which 
was very positive. The Russians have always exerted an 
influence on the Balkans. The question is knowing whether they 
are using this influence for the right cause. That was indeed 
the case this time (...). The lesson (of recent days) is that 
we must keep the Russians informed and involved in the peace 
process. 
  [Gautier] Have the negotiations regarding Bosnia, which have 
stalled for months, been given a new boost? 
  [Hurd] I hope so, but I am not sure. I hope that all the 
parties will now admit that military victory is not possible 
(...). Reestablishing peace may take some time yet. We must be 
sure that Europe, the United States, and Russia work together to 
bring the deadline closer. A European peace plan was adopted 
before Christmas. The Americans also have ideas based on the 
same principle: giving the Muslims one-third of the territory 
and access to the sea. There also may be Russian ideas, but 
they are less clear. 
  [Gautier] What solution do you advocate for Sarajevo: a UN 
protectorate or partition? 
  [Hurd] The situation in Sarajevo will temporarily require an 
intense international commitment. I prefer to avoid talking 
about an administrative protectorate, because that solution is 
likely not to be acceptable to any of the sides. 
  [Gautier] Outside Sarajevo the war is continuing, especially 
in central Bosnia. You recently went to Vitez. Can we remain 
confident? 
  [Hurd] The fighting continues in Vitez and Mostar (...). I 
hope that the United Nations will be able to draw up a peace 
plan for these two regions. We now need to see whether or not 
this plan will commit NATO. Perhaps there will be no need, but 
we must not concentrate solely on Sarajevo. 
<H5>  `Permanent Danger' </H5>
  [Gautier] In Mostar, a town besieged by the Croats, the 
situation is rather similar to that in Sarajevo. Will we have 
to threaten the Croats with air strikes? 
  [Hurd] That remains to be seen. Mostar needs a plan ensuring 
the reconstruction of the old bridge, the reopening of the roads 
that cross the town heading toward central Bosnia, and the 
removal of the siege against the Muslims. This plan will commit 
the United Nations, General Rose (...), and perhaps NATO (...). 
  [Gautier] Even if all the sieges were to be lifted, the 
political impasse would remain intact: The Owen-Stoltenberg map 
is not applicable and no Muslim state is viable without access 
to the Adriatic. What is the solution? 
  [Hurd] Peace cannot be imposed from the outside. It must be 
accepted freely. We must try and convince the three sides. The 
positions have already moved closer together, but there is still 
disagreement about the extent of the Muslim territory and about 
the territories into which the Serbs will withdraw. What 
everyone does agree about is that the Serbs must give up about 
one-fourth of the territory that they are occupying. 
  [Gautier] There is a risk of seeing the conflict turn into a 
bloody guerilla war. If that happens, will Great Britain 
withdraw its UN troops, which are particularly exposed in 
central Bosnia? 
  [Hurd] They are currently living in a situation of permanent 
danger (...). At present, the positive effects of our presence 
are greater than the risks being run, which tends to makes us 
lean toward leaving our UN troops there. If the situation were 
to change, it would be possible to draw another conclusion. 
  [Gautier] The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] 
risks becoming the next area of tension in the Balkans. Greece, 
which is one of the parties in the crisis, is a member of the 
European Union. What is your solution? 
  [Hurd] Talks between Greece and The FYROM under the aegis of 
the United Nations are needed to alleviate Greek concerns. I do 
not think it is wise for the Greeks to increase the difficulties 
of the people of that small republic, which is fighting (for its 
survival) in the middle of the Balkans, especially since Greece 
is currently the president of the Community.
