FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: French home products groups
forge alliance
CONSOLIDATION of the French retail sector continued yesterday with the
announcement of an alliance between Domaxel and Semaphor, two leading home
products retailing groups.
Domaxel is a group of independent French retailers involved in the
do-it-yourself and household products market which owns 533 stores under the
names Bricosphere, Maison Conseil and Bricofrance.
Semaphor is another group of independents with 108 stores, including Jardin
Facile and Planete Verte, mainly specialising in garden products.
The two groups have signed an agreement whereby they will merge, on a
commercial basis, for two years.
The agreement does not include any exchange of equity between them.
Domaxel sees the deal as a way into the buoyant garden products market. It
plans to open garden products departments in a number of its own stores.
Semaphor, the smaller of the two companies with annual sales of FFr500m
(Dollars 92.6m) to Domaxel's FFr6.8bn, needed to join forces with a larger
player to continue its expansion.
The alliance is the latest in a series of deals in the French retail sector.
The home products sector has been one of the main areas of consolidation
following the Pinault group's purchase of the Conforama furniture chain in
1991 and its subsequent takeover of the Au Printemps store group, together
with a number of mergers in the hypermarkets sector.
