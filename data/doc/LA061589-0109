WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA; 
CONSTRUCTION BAN EXTENDED 
The City Council has voted to extend a moratorium on multifamily residential 
construction in the neighborhood north of Wilshire Boulevard for another six 
months, limiting what residents have called a "demolition derby" and allowing 
city staff to draw up a plan that would restrict future development in the 
area. 
In early May, complaints from residents about new development in the 
neighborhood bounded by Ocean Avenue, Montana Avenue, 14th Street and Wilshire 
Boulevard prompted the council to pass a 45-day emergency ordinance banning 
residential construction. 
"More and more, Los Angeles is looking like Manhattan -- dark and dirty, 
disallowing for warmth and sunshine," said resident Linda Wilson at the City 
Council meeting on Tuesday night. "We must endeavor to protect the quality of 
life in our city," she said. 
The council voted 6 to 1 to continue the moratorium until December. For the 
next six months, a task force of staff, tenants, condominium owners and 
resident landlords will work on a plan that would limit the number of projects 
per block and develop design standards that would make new buildings more 
compatible with those already there. 
Residents also asked the council to consider downzoning their neighborhood. But 
Planning Director Paul Berlant said that lowering density would only make land 
and rental values skyrocket. 
Construction of single-family homes, low- and moderate-income housing and city 
projects are exempt from the moratorium, as are projects that received permits 
before April 28. 
Councilwoman Christine Reed voted against the measure, saying a moratorium was 
not the solution to the neighborhood's problems.
