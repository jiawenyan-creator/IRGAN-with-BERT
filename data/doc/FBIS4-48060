  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] has infiltrated four battalions into Huila 
Province to carry out major military operations. General 
Francisco Furtado, commander of the Southern Military Front, has 
said that those forces have been moved from Huambo and are now 
engaging in operations in the north of the province, where the 
military situation has deteriorated since 2 May. Gen. Furtado 
had this to say: 
  [Begin Furtado recording] On the Southern Military Front, 
the 
situation has been deteriorating in the northern part of Huila 
Province over the last few days. Our forces have been coming 
under attack from UNITA troops estimated to total up to four 
battalions. Those forces have come from Huambo and areas north 
of Caconda, and they have been carrying out those operations 
since 2 May. Fighting is continuing in the area of Quilengues. 
This has necessitated major efforts by our forces to defend the 
people in the area. The Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, have also 
been efficiently annihilating those UNITA forces that have 
attacked that position. 
  By 1500, when we contacted the commander in the area, some 
81 
UNITA soldiers had been confirmed killed on the ground and our 
forces had also made three prisoners. The first thing those 
prisoners said was that they had come from Huambo and that their 
mission was to take Quilengues before the government and UNITA 
had signed any accord at the Lusaka peace talks. [end recording]
