FT  08 JAN 93 / People: Analyst Plaut
Timothy Plaut, the number one Extel-rated analyst for German equities, has
left SG Warburg after six years. Plaut, along with the rest of the team,
Nick Jones and Stefan Sanne, will be joining Goldman Sachs at the start of
February.
Goldman, which two years ago had no physical presence in Germany, has
expanded rapidly with around 75 staff now based in Frankfurt. The US
investment bank says the Warburg hiring reflects the need to expand its
German equity coverage.
However, Plaut and his team will be based in London, along with all the rest
of the European research team - save one or two economists.
In an unusual move, the previous head of equity research, Mark Edmiston, is
transferring to New York as a senior European equity salesman.
*****
Ian Brindle, senior partner of accountants Price Waterhouse, has been
appointed a member of the Accounting Standards Board, the UK accounting
standards body.
Brindle, 49, replaces Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young, who
resigned from the ASB recently.
He is no stranger to professional bodies, having been a member and then
chairman of the Auditing Practices Committee from 1986-90.
He brings membership of the ASB back to nine voting members at a time when
it is entering the most testing phase since its creation in August 1990. The
others are David Tweedie, Alan Cook, Robert Bradfield, Sir Bryan Carsberg,
Michael Garner, Donald Main, Roger Munson and Graham Stacy.
Until his new appointment, Brindle was also a member of the ASB's urgent
issues task force, which produces judgments on newly emerging accounting
approaches. He has been temporarily replaced by Mary Keegan, another PW
partner, who is likely to take his place permanently.
