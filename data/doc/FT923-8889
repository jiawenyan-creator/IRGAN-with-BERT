FT  08 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK building sectors
Careless talk costs lives; loose talk of a fresh rise in the mortgage rate
costs further misery for quoted housebuilders and building material
businesses. The two sectors have been among the most dismal stock market
performers since the general election as hopes for an early let-up in
interest rate pressures disappeared. Building material shares are now just
over half what they were at the peak in July 1987. The contractors' paper is
worth less than a third of its value five years ago.
It would be nice to believe that the worst is now behind. The shake-out has
been severe by any standards, with bears hitting out indiscriminately ahead
of next month's interim results season. The trouble is that with scant faith
in the market's earnings, dividend or net asset value forecasts, it is hard
to see where the buying will come from in the short term.
From the anecdotal evidence of the past few weeks, investors are worried
that there are shocks on all these counts in store, and are equally nervous
about 1993. Uncertainty is spreading about the impact on profits of a
further round of rationalisation as stronger companies increasingly seek to
match capacity to lower levels of activity. Only very brave investors will
touch the contractors; leading material companies such as RMC, Redland and
Blue Circle may well prove to be cheap on a medium-term view.
