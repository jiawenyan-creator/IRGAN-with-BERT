SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
The stock market celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday in an indecisive manner by 
continuing to rise and fall in opposition to the price of oil, which has been 
moving up or down with the threat of war or potential for peace in the Mideast, 
said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
Only eight San Diego stocks managed moves of more than one point in either 
direction during the past week, Katz said, with five of those stocks heading 
down. 
HomeFed Corp., which fell $1.75, was a major casualty, Katz said. The parent of 
HomeFed Bank was the largest percentage loser among San Diego stocks, closing 
the week down 23.7%. 
HomeFed received a sell recommendation last week from a leading 
savings-and-loan analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research who 
cited HomeFed's potential increases in problem loans. 
Other stocks moving down were Mail Boxes Etc., down $2, National Health 
Laboratories, down $1.75, Rohr Industries, down $1.375, and Magma Power, down 
$1.25. 
On the upside, the consistent gainer during the past week continued to be Price 
Co., which gained an additional $1.75, to $38.25. The stock, which sold for 
$30.50 on Oct. 29, has gained 25.4% in less than a month. Many investors 
evidently believe that Price "could be their best investment in the shrinking 
wholesale club arena," Katz said. Two local stocks that made significant upward 
moves were also coming off recent lows, Katz said. PS Group gained $2, to $32, 
as it rose from its low of $29.375. Maxwell Laboratories gained $1.25, to 
$10.25, up from $8.25.
