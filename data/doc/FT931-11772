FT  01 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad
The two belligerents in the package holiday bidding war have thumped each
other with their respective documents. Yet all they have achieved is to
induce mutual headaches: both have damaged the other's reputation whatever
the bid's outcome.
Airtours has highlighted Owners' patchy trading record and the financial
deficiencies of its proposed link-up with Thomas Cook. Owners has raised
doubts about Airtours' calculations for synergy benefits and questioned the
predator's growth prospects if the bid were to fail.
Hostilities will abate until the competition authorities have had their say.
The likelihood must still be that Airtours will be allowed to proceed. That
will fix attention on whether the flirtation of Thomas Cook's German parent
with Owners will develop more serious intent.
