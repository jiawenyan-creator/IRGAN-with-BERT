BEHIND THE SCENES 
Obviously Harlowe had not stopped in other cities than Moscow and Leningrad, 
for instance Smolensk, Zagorsk, Kalinin and Yaroslavl in the Russian Republic. 
If you really want some fun, see what happens when you land in Lviv, Odessa, 
Ternopil or Kaniv in the Ukrainian Republic. As an exchange student who 
recently finished studies in the Soviet Union, I can tell you that if you 
believe in glasnost, then I have a bridge to sell you.
