  [Text] Ankara--The best example of an election economy is 
seen in the Central Bank's actions. It sold foreign exchange 
worth $6.857 billion on the market in the past six months, thus 
reducing its foreign exchange reserves to $3.29 billion as of 8 
April. The Central Bank's available foreign exchange reserve is 
reportedly down to $600 million. 
  Economic circles are stressing that the political 
responsibility for developments lies with the government, 
commenting, "The refusal to take serious measures on the eve of 
elections and just selling lots of foreign exchange virtually 
put the brakes on exchange rates, and 100 trillion lira [TL] in 
profits were distributed. Is no one going to ask for 
accountability in this?" 
  According to information obtained by CUMHURIYET from Central 
Bank circles, the Central Bank's foreign exchange sales began to 
"climb" in November last year and reached a record level in 
March, when local elections were held. In March alone, $2.2 
billion in foreign exchange was sold on the markets. 
<H5>  `Government Distributed Profits' </H5>
  Economic circles draw attention to the average exchange rate 
of TL15,000 to the dollar in the past six months and made the 
following evaluation: 
  "It was quite clear that there was an expectation of 
devaluation on the markets. However, the government, prior to 
the local elections, had the Central Bank sell a total of 
$6,857,192 in foreign exchange to force exchange rates to stay 
low so the markets would not experience this shock prior to the 
local elections, and a negative impression of the government 
would not be formed among the people. In other words, if you 
figure the average dollar exchange rate at TL15,000, over TL100 
trillion in profits were distributed. Central Bank reserves were 
at the level of $7.198 billion at the beginning of these 
operations, but dropped to $3.2 billion through depletion as 
profits. Only $600 million of these reserves are available for 
use at present. Is no one going to ask for accountability in 
this?" 
<H5>  Lost Donkey Found </H5>
  The same circles recall also that Prime Minister Ciller's 
U.S. trip was intended to "create fresh resources" and say the 
following: "In finding resources, the consequences are 
important. There is a saying: `Even the mountain cannot 
withstand it.' You are going to fritter away $6.8 billion in 5.5 
months, then get the U.S. president into the act to find $1 
billion. God willing, resources will be obtained, and we will be 
happy because we had lost our donkey and you found it." 
<H5>  Treasury Status </H5>
  It is pointed out that short-term advances "were completely 
used up" as a result of the Treasury's cancellation in recent 
months of perpetual contracts and insistence on low interest. 
Because the Treasury could not have recourse to short-term 
advances in recent weeks to recover from its cash shortage, it 
is trying to finance itself by selling cash-equivalent bonds to 
the Central Bank. 
  Central Bank authorities point out that this was experienced 
also during the Gulf crisis and say that they have transferred 
TL10 trillion in cash to the Treasury in recent weeks by this 
method. 
<H5>  TL70 Trillion Expected </H5>
  While the tax laws sent to the Turkish Grand National 
Assembly are expected to create TL70 trillion in revenues, some 
say that this situation will increase the Treasury's domestic 
debt burden because of rising interest and that "one must at 
this point consider that TL70 trillion as already spent." 
  One official draws attention to the goal in the 1994 budget 
of paying TL216 trillion in principal and interest on domestic 
loans. 
  The official says, "Think of this figure as at least TL300 
trillion."
