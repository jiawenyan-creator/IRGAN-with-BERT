FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television
Despite the popularity of ITV's soap opera built around a London police
station, The Bill (8.00) and its Scottish detective series Taggart (9.00),
each normally capable of capturing 15 or 16 million viewers, there seems
little doubt that tonight's biggest attraction will be Elizabeth R on BBC1
(8.00). Covering a year in the life of the Queen, it comes 21 years after
Richard Cawston's seminal documentary 'Royal Family' which, for the first
time, provided an informal portrait of the royals and was watched by nearly
40 million people. Today's programme has been made by Edward Mirzoeff to
mark the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne. It shows
formal and informal aspects of her life: an audience with John Major, a
state banquet for Lech Walesa, but also moments relaxing with her
grandchildren in one or other of her homes - Sandringham, Windsor and so on.
Also at 8.00, BBC2 starts Episode 2 of its series Redundant. John, who was
earning Pounds 50,000 as a regional sales manager for Everest Double Glazing
in 1988, has been out of work for more than three years. He has debts of
Pounds 170,000, has applied for over 200 jobs, but feels the good times may
be gone for ever.
