FT  13 OCT 94 / Private bidders' dash for coal: Heseltine may have made some
shrewd decisions over the sell-off of the UK's pits
Mr Michael Heseltine's relief was palpable yesterday as he announced the
preferred bidders for British Coal, the state-owned mining company, and the
industry moved into the final stages of privatisation.
'We have received offers which can be measured in hundreds of millions of
pounds,' he told representatives at the Conservative party conference in
Bournemouth. 'By next January nearly 30 British Coal pits will be in the
private sector.'
The trade and industry secretary's exultation was understandable. It was
almost two years to the day since a crisis erupted over pre-privatisation
pit closures that many observers thought would end his political career.
Mr Heseltine received the applause he expected from the party faithful, some
of whom have been highly critical of the government's coal policy. But the
government's problems with coal are not over yet.
First, ministers and their advisers must complete the final negotiations
with what Mr Heseltine called the 'likely successful bidders'. These are RJB
Mining, a quoted company whose bids have been conditionally accepted for the
three English regions and two closed pits, Thorne in Yorkshire and Ellington
in Northumberland; Celtic Energy, a management buy-out for most of Wales;
Mining (Scotland), a consortium, for the Scottish pits; an employee buy-out
team for Tower pit in south Wales; and Coal Investments, another quoted
company, for the Annesley Bentinck pit in Nottinghamshire.
Nothing is signed yet. A failure to reach final deals with the preferred
bidders would be embarrassing for Mr Heseltine, who would then have to try
to find an alternative buyer among other bidders.
But the real test for the government will be what happens to the industry
after the privatisation, which is expected to be completed on December 24.
If more pits close, blame is likely to be laid at the door of the government
even if the industry is privately owned. Ministers will also face strong
criticism if any of the companies they have selected to run Britain's pits
find themselves in financial difficulty.
The government has taken a lot of trouble to ensure that such embarrassments
are avoided. Rothschild, the government's merchant bank adviser, said that
while the successful bidders had offered the largest amounts of money, they
had also satisfied it on 'intangible issues', including their financial
viability and their long-term commitment to the industry.
The outcome of the tendering process has also given the government a result
that is politically attractive. By choosing a management buy-out for the
south Wales pits and a consortium in which trade unions have a stake for
Scotland, they have been able to give credence to the government's desire to
give employees a stake in the industry.
The selection of locally based companies in Wales and Scotland will also
avoid accusations in those countries of an English takeover.
Ministers have taken a risk in disappointing the ambitions of the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers, the breakaway union, which was in a consortium
bidding for the two central English regions.
But the choice of RJB for all three English regions could prove a shrewd
move. If RJB succeeds in completing the negotiations, it will take on 15 of
the 16 British Coal pits that are still open. The company reckons that when
these are added to the opencast interests that it will also take over and
the three pits it already leases from the government, it will control more
than 80 per cent of the coal industry.
The government's willingness to concentrate so much power in one company has
taken the industry by surprise. Even in his speech yesterday, Mr Heseltine
was stressing the benefits of competition that have arisen from other
privatisations.
But giving all three regions to RJB allows ministers to argue that they are
not driven by free-market dogma and that they have listened to British
Coal's advice. British Coal has argued throughout the privatisation process
that the industry should remain as one.
'Privatising English coal in one chunk is a good outcome for the industry,'
said one British Coal executive yesterday. 'It will give the company
strength through size, particularly in its discussions with the electricity
generators for coal sales deals.'
There was less rejoicing in the industry that the government's choice had
fallen on RJB. Some executives said they would have preferred to work for Mr
Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal marketing director who now heads Coal
Investments, or for Mr Bob Siddall, the opencast director who led a
management buy-out team.
Mr Richard Budge, the entrepreneur who heads RJB, is viewed as highly
competent within British Coal, but there are fears that his personality may
be too forceful for the good of the industry. If he lives up to his image,
he could face confrontation with Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the
National Union of Mineworkers, who is resolutely opposed to the changes in
work practices and culture RJB says it needs to make a success of the
English pits.
'The negatives are probably more in people's minds than in reality but he is
viewed as domineering and dictatorial,' said one executive. 'We will want to
see evidence that he can delegate.'
Mr Budge yesterday played down the potential for confrontation. 'Some of our
existing pits have NUM members and there are no problems there,' he said.
RJB's other main task is to sort out the finance needed to fund the bid.
Since the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange last year, the
shares have outperformed the market, but the company is still capitalised at
less than Pounds 160m.
Neither RJB nor the government was prepared to discuss the size of its
tenders yesterday, but the company is believed to have paid at least Pounds
900m. With gearing of about 70 per cent already, an issue of shares and more
borrowing seems inevitable.
Stockbrokers' analysts said yesterday they saw no problems with raising such
sums. Some said RJB's share price would rise when the shares returned to the
market following yesterday's suspension. Much, however, will depend on the
detail of the financing which has yet to be announced.
Details of the successful Scottish and Welsh bids were similarly
undisclosed. However, to win the Welsh bid, Celtic Energy beat off powerful
competition, including a consortium grouping Powell Duffryn and Wimpey.
'Both companies wanted the Welsh region pretty badly to preserve their
opencast interests there,' said one analyst. 'Celtic Energy must have put in
a substantial offer.'
But perhaps the largest determinant of the companies' future success will be
the market for their coal, over which they have only limited control. The
biggest problems are the potential growth of competing fuels in the
electricity market.
The 'dash for gas' that has forced the closure of so many pits in the past
few years has spluttered back into life in the last few weeks. Two regional
electricity companies, Midlands and Electricity, have announced their
involvement in consortia to build gas-fired power stations which will
eliminate the need for 3m tonnes of coal a year. British Gas is negotiating
on the possibility of building a 1,200MW station near Bristol that could
displace another 3m tonnes of coal.
British Coal executives and some of the unsuccessful bidders say they have
been taken by surprise by the announcements. They also pointed out that the
marketplace will be more crowded than expected because of the acceptance
yesterday of bids to reopen some pits closed in the past year by British
Coal.
Mr Budge was unconcerned. He had no plans for further closures because he
believed the market would shrink only marginally from its current capacity.
'Don't forget that there are 17m tonnes of imports and we can displace most
of them,' he said.
The 8,000 or so deep-pit miners who remain in the industry will be praying
that Mr Budge and not the industry pessimists are right.
