Perhaps communist totalitarianism wasn't so bad after all: it was pretty
successful in eastern Europe at suppressing tribalism and anti-semitism and
keeping huge numbers of people in jobs. It must have been pretty unpleasant
living under dictators and being spied on by secret police, but was life
really worse than it is today in Jugoslavia or Azerbaijan, or even, for the
unemployed anyway, in eastern Germany? Assignment considers 'The Tunnel At
The End Of The Light' in Czechoslovakia where the populace goes to the polls
this week in the second election since the collapse of the Warsaw Pact (7.40
BBC2).
ITV's comedy drama Angels (8.30) has an impressive cast: Tom Bell and Cathy
Tyson play guardian angels sent to earth to help souls in crisis. These
include a tabloid journalist played by the versatile Alfred Molina.
The Racing Game (9.50 BBC2) is proving to be a highly professional
documentary series about horse racing. After punters, stable lads and
breeders, this week's programme deals with members of The Jockey Club which
has run British racing for almost 250 years.
