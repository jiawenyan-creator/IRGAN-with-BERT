FT  18 JUN 92 / Letter: Appeal should be for better statistics
Sir, City economists feel deprived because of their lack of access to the
aggregated sales figures of retailers which are submitted in confidence to
the Treasury. The exercise is carried out to convince the policymakers that
the official retail sales statistics are, and have been for some time,
misleading.
Rather than plead for privileged information, City economists should join
those who for many years have appealed for the provision of better-quality
official statistics.
