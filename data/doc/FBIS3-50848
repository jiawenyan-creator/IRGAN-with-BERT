  [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 7 Jan, CANA -- Jamaica's 
inflation rate for last November was 3.2 percent, boosting the 
rate for the first eleven months of the calendar year to 26.6 
percent, according to official figures just released here. 
  The statistical institute of Jamaica said the inflation rate 
for the first eight months of the fiscal year was 23.3 percent. 
Since July, inflation has averaged three percent per month, 
largely because of the weakening Jamaican dollar, which has 
fallen from an equivalent of 4.50 U.S. cents in mid-year to just 
over 3.10 cents currently. 
  Inflation for the 11-month period in the calendar year 1992 
was 39.4 percent and 17.3 percent for the equivalent fiscal year 
period.
