<H6>  Euroelections, Legislative Elections </H6>
  The 5 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO published the results of 
a poll on the upcoming European Parliament elections conducted 
on 2 March by the Norma-Gallup organization among 500 
individuals over 18 years of age, with a commentary by Lilia 
Marcos. The poll carried a 4.5 percent margin of error. 
Respondents were asked their choice of parties for the June 
European Parliament elections. Results showed that, with 30.6 
percent of the respondents answering that they do not know, 
Europe "continues to be a distant vision for Portuguese voters," 
Marcos notes. The Social Democratic Party (PSD) won first place 
with 27.2 percent, followed by the Socialist Party (PS) with 
25.4 percent, the Communist Party (PCP) with 5.9 percent, and 
the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) with 5 percent. Some 
0.3 percent chose "other parties," and 5.6 percent did not 
answer. The poll also revealed that if legislative elections 
were held at this time, the PSD (33 percent) and the PS (31.4 
percent) would be neck and neck, Marcos notes. The PCP and the 
CDS would follow (7.1 percent and 3.3 percent respectively), 
while 20.7 percent would not know, 0.4 percent would choose 
"other parties," and 4.1 percent would not answer. 
<H5>  Youth Attitudes </H5>
  The results of a recent Marktest poll conducted in the 
Greater Lisbon and Greater Porto areas among 200 individuals 
between 18 and 30 and carrying a 6.9 percent margin of error 
appeared in the 2 March Lisbon daily PUBLICO. According to the 
article, results indicated that political activity does not 
interest Portuguese youth, notably those between 18 and 24. In 
fact, 25 percent of the respondents said they take "a lot of 
interest" in politics, 53.5 percent said they have "little 
interest" in it, 20.5 percent expressed "no interest," and 1 
percent did not know or did not answer. When asked whether the 
young are mature enough to be in politics, 61.5 percent answered 
yes, 34.5 percent answered no, and 4 percent did not know or did 
not answer. Finally, respondents were asked whether they belong 
to any party. Some 8.5 percent answered affirmatively and 91.5 
percent answered negatively.
