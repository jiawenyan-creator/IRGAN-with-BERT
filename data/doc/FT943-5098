FT  06 SEP 94 / Employer moves attacked
Nearly half of all employers who derecognised unions between 1987 and 1990
introduced no new employee involvement initiatives during that time, says a
report on human resource management published yesterday by the TUC.
The report stresses that unions are broadly in favour of the principles
underlying human resource management - treating workers as assets rather
than factors of production and developing a wide range of communication
systems - and that there is no necessary link between it and anti-unionism.
The report says: 'The more anti-union the employer, the less likely it is
that HRM techniques will be used.'
The report shows that workplaces which recognise unions are likely to have
more channels of communication, more opportunities for staff to influence
their working lives and as much likelihood of having financial participation
schemes as non-unionised workplaces. But Ms Bernadette Hillon, of the
shopworkers' union Usdaw, said that some hostile employers are using human
resource management as a smokescreen for an anti-union strategy. Mr John
Monks, TUC general secretary, singled out the printing and publishing
industries for criticism in the latest issue of the Personnel Management
magazine.
