<F P=106> [Report on interviews with Dr. Zakariya al-Agha and Lawyer </F>
Furayh Abu-Middayn, members of the Palestinian Self-Rule 
Authority, by Hasan Abu-Zayid "after the signing of an agreement 
on transferring the civil administration's powers to the 
Palestinian Self-Rule Authority" on 17 May; place not given; 
from the "With the Events" program; broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Al-Agha] ... according to the 
Cairo agreement, signed on 4 May 1994 between the PLO and the 
Israeli Government on transferring all powers and 
responsibilities from the Israeli authority to the Palestinian 
authority, and following continuous and comprehensive meetings 
held by the Civil Liaison Committee of the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides. During these meetings, the conferees discussed, 
scrutinized, and reviewed all issues pertaining to all civil 
departments. A few moments ago, a protocol on the handover of 
powers was officially signed by the two sides. From this moment 
on, the Palestinian authority will completely assume its powers 
in accordance with the Palestinian regulations and laws. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Zakariya al-Agha: When will the Palestinian 
authority begin its work? 
  [Al-Agha] This will take place once the formation of the 
Palestinian authority is finalized, and once the brothers from 
outside and inside the territories assume the tasks. I believe 
that, after 25 May, it will be possible for the Palestinian 
authority's council to begin work. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Until this takes place, and from now until 25 
May, who will run the affairs of residents in the territories? 
  [Al-Agha] The departments will continue their work. We, the 
representatives of the Palestinian authority; namely, myself, 
brother Furayh [Abu-Middayn], and brother Dr. Riyad [not further 
identified], will begin our missions and carry out this work 
until the Palestinian authority is finalized and until it 
assumes work. [end recording] 
  With regard to the issues which the Palestinian authority 
will address first, Lawyer Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the 
Palestinian Authority Council, says: 
  [Begin Abu-Middayn recording] The first priority will be 
given to the daily life of all residents. There are such 
problems as travel abroad as well as students' problems, which I 
believe were solved today with General Rothchild. Perhaps, the 
first step in this work would be to issue permits to West Bank 
university students. In fact, daily life will continue. We 
also give priority to organizational affairs [words indistinct] 
because this would be a basis for us. As you know, there were 
resignations from police ranks and there are no civil courts. 
This may be the first department in which we will begin orderly 
and intensive work. [end recording]
