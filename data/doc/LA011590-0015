'CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE' 
The Times is to be commended for focusing editorial attention on the problem of 
long-term care for America's elderly. 
If we are to treat the problem intelligently, however, we must begin to draw a 
distinction between health care -- curing the sick and injured -- and long-term 
care, which is primarily providing help in day-to-day living for those elderly 
persons who need it, whether at home or in nursing homes. 
The distinction is more than a mere question of semantics. The United States is 
almost alone among nations in lumping into its health care expenditures the 
"housekeeping" functions of aiding the elderly, such as room and board, being 
fed, bathed and dressed. It would be a more accurate representation of actual 
services rendered to regard such expenditures as part of social services, 
rather than health care. Allocating funds from health service budgets to 
provide non-health care translates into fewer dollars to treat acute health 
problems. 
To be sure, the elderly among us do require more health care than the general 
population. But providing the means to treat the ill and injured and providing 
nursing home care for the elderly are nonetheless two different challenges.
