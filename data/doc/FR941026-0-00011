<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is issuing in final form amendments to the regulations issued under
the Government Securities Act of 1986 (the ``Government Securities Act'' or ``GSA'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Section 405.3 of the GSA regulations requires registered government securities brokers and dealers to comply with
the requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'' or ``SEC'') Rule 17a11 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), with certain modifications. The SEC has amended Rule
17a11 and the Department's amendments parallel the SEC's changes.

Pub. L. No. 99571, 100 Stat. 3208 (1986).

</FOOTNOTE>


The amendments will, among other things, ease the regulatory and reporting burdens on registered government securities
brokers and dealers by eliminating the requirement that they submit certain supplemental financial reports previously
required by 405.3 of the GSA regulations. Registered government securities brokers and dealers will remain
obligated to transmit notice of a capital deficiency or certain other events.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background



When the Department first adopted rules and regulations affecting government securities brokers and dealers, it
took into consideration the already existing regulation of securities brokers and dealers registered with the SEC
under sections 15 or 15B of the Exchange Act, with a view toward preventing overly burdensome or duplicative regulations.
In that regard, the GSA regulations incorporated, by reference, many of the SEC's rules regulating brokers and dealers,
including, with modification, Rule 17a11.

On July 7, 1993, the SEC adopted amendments to 17 CFR 240.17a11 (Rule 17a11), which became effective
August 12, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The primary purpose of Rule 17a11 is to provide the SEC and other regulatory bodies with advance warning and
information regarding brokers and dealers that are experiencing financial or operational difficulty. Prior to
the SEC's amendments, Rule 17a11 required a broker or dealer to give notice and transmit supplemental reports
to the Commission and other regulatory bodies when its net capital declined below its required minimum level or when
its total outstanding principal amount of satisfactory subordination agreements exceeded allowable levels for
more than 90 days. The SEC's amendments, among other things, eliminated the requirement that brokers and dealers
file Part II or Part IIA of Form X17A5, Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report (``FOCUS
Report'') after a net capital deficiency. Brokers and dealers, however, remain obligated to transmit same-day notice
of such a capital deficiency. Additionally, prior to the amendments to Rule 17a11, brokers and dealers whose
net capital fell below certain ``early warning levels''
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 were required to file monthly FOCUS Report for at least three successive months. This requirement was eliminated
by the amendments and replaced with the requirement that brokers and dealers promptly notify the Commission and their
designated examining authority (``DEA'') of the triggering event. However, the changes to SEC Rule 17a11
did not apply to registered government securities brokers and dealers because the Treasury is the rulemaker for these
firms.

</FOOTNAME>
Early warning levels are capital levels set at amounts that are higher than the minimum capital requirement. In situations
where the capital level of a broker or dealer is declining, the early warning level serves the purpose of alerting regulatory
agencies that the firm may be experiencing financial or operational difficulty. This early notification enables
the regulatory agencies to monitor the activities of a broker-dealer and assess its financial condition while there
is still time to take action to prevent the broker-dealer from falling out of compliance with the minimum capital requirement.

</FOOTNOTE>


Section 405.3 of the GSA regulations requires, with certain modifications, every registered government securities
broker or dealer to comply with Rule 17a11. Consistent with the SEC's pre-amendment Rule 17a11, 405.3
has required registered government securities brokers and dealers, including interdealer brokers and futures
commission merchants (FCMs), to provide notice of capital deficiencies, to submit financial reports within 24 hours
of a capital deficiency, and to file supplemental reports for three successive months when capital falls below early
warning levels. Since the SEC's amendments to Rule 17a11, without conforming amendments to 405.3 of
the GSA regulations, the rules applicable to government securities brokers and dealers have been unclear. At the
time of the amendments to SEC Rule 17a11, Treasury was unable to revise the GSA regulations accordingly because
its rulemaking authority had expired in October 1991 and reauthorization legislation was still being considered
by the Congress.
