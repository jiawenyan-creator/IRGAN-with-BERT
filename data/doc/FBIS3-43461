  [Text] Monrovia, Jan 5 (AFP) -- The United Nations has 
called on a Liberian armed faction to return goods stolen when 
it raided a refugee camp in the north of the country, as a 
precondition for resuming relief work, a UN statement said 
Wednesday. 
  General Daniel Opande, a Kenyan officer leading the UN 
Observer Mission in Liberia, at the weekend met the head of the 
United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), Alhaji Kromah, telling him 
that UN agencies would not pursue aid to some 200,000 displaced 
people in the region until the equipment was returned, the 
statement said. "We will only return to Lofa when the vehicles, 
satellite phone and communications equipment have been returned 
(and we) have a security guarantee for our workers from ULIMO," 
an official with one agency said Wednesday. "Until that is 
done, we have no plans for returning to Lofa." 
  For some eight hours during the night of December 25, about 
a 
dozen ULIMO fighters raided a UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) camp at Vahun near the border with Sierra Leone, 190 
kilometres (120 miles) north of Monrovia, where they made off 
with stocks of food and clothing with an estimated value of more 
than 150,000 dollars. They drove away, with the communications 
equipment, in 12 stolen vehicles including a lorry. 
  Following the attack, the UNHCR, the UN Children's Fund, and 
other relief organisations operating in Lofa County suspended 
their work and withdrew staff from the region. 
  Kromah "promised full cooperation in defusing tension in the 
area," the UN statement said.
