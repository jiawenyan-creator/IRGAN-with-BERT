FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stead &amp; Simpson considers buy-out
STEAD &amp; SIMPSON, the UK shoe retailer, is considering a buy-out from
Clayform Properties, the property development and investment group which
acquired it for Pounds 120m in 1988.
Rumours have been circulating in the shoe trade that S&amp;S believes it would
be able to operate more effectively and gain greater support from suppliers
if it separated from Clayform, and has been looking for a possible exit for
some months.
The shoe chain reported an increase in operating losses from Pounds 2.7m to
Pounds 3.2m when Clayform announced a half-year pre-tax deficit of Pounds
10.9m last September.
Mr Peter Gee, S&amp;S managing director, said yesterday he could neither confirm
nor deny that a buy-out was planned. 'I can make no comment at the moment.
If we had got something together then we would tell you. We have looked at
all sorts of things.' Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the chartered accountants,
are believed to be working on a deal with S&amp;S but also refused to comment.
Clayform first bid Pounds 89.5m for S&amp;S in 1988, but was defeated despite
raising its bid to Pounds 108m. The company retained a 41 per cent stake and
talks were reopened in May 1989. The two sides reached agreement on a
revised Pounds 120m cash offer the following month.
The acquisition created a heavy debt burden which Clayform found difficult
to service after the fall in property values with the onset of the
recession. Borrowings have, however, been reduced from Pounds 130m to about
Pounds 35m in the last two years.
S&amp;S profits peaked at Pounds 10.9m on turnover of Pounds 90.5m for the year
to March 1989, but has since has fallen into losses.
