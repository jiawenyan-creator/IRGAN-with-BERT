FT  09 NOV 93 / Amec Offshore faces full strike
AMEC OFFSHORE, the Tyne-side offshore fabrication company, faces a strike
over new terms and conditions.
In a secret postal ballot, the result of which was declared yesterday, the
company's 900 manual workers voted for strike action over its attempt to
make night-shift employees work seven hours a week longer for their present
pay rates.
The company, which recently said union 'intransigence and shortsightedness'
was threatening its future, said it was only asking the night shift to work
'gift hours' currently paid but not worked. It said it had to reduce costs
to remain competitive.
The unions said the seven hours, which would bring the basic weekly night
shift to 47.5 hours, were part of the premium rate for working overnight and
arose in compensation for breaks forfeited to give continuity of production.
The ballot, among members of the GMB general union and the AEEU engineers
and electricians union, backed strike action by more than two to one.
Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and
Engineering Unions, said there would be discussion with members on the next
move, which 'could be all-out strike action'.
Amec Offshore said it was disappointed at the ballot and had tried, up to
national union official level, for a resolution.
