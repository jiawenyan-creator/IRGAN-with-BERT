  [Text] Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen has 
called on all Afrikaners to vote. He told a business community 
in Krugersdorp that this was a better way of achieving 
self-determination than through an armed struggle. This report 
from Danie Hefers. 
  [Begin recording] [Hefers] Addressing members of the 
Krugersdorp business community in a game park outside the town, 
Gen. Viljoen said he was calling on all Afrikaners to vote. He 
said it would be wrong to lead his people back to the days of 
apartheid when South Africa was seen as the polecat of the 
international community. 
  [Viljoen, in Afrikaans] And for that reason I am calling on 
everyone, especially the Afrikaners, to please support us in the 
Freedom Front because all the votes brought out for the Freedom 
Front at provincial level will be yes votes for 
self-determination. 
  [Hefers] Gen. Viljoen also said it would be wrong to ignore 
the Zulu nation in the coming election. 
  [Viljoen, in Afrikaans] It has been a big mistake to leave 
out the Zulus in this manner. It is a big mistake to refuse to 
postpone the election. The Freedom Front is involved in 
attempts to have the election postponed. [end recording]
