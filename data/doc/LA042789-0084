PASADENA CONSIDERS TAX INCREASES 
Increases in utility taxes and business license fees and a tax on interstate 
and international telephone calls are among the revenue options that will be 
considered by the Pasadena Board of Directors as it begins work on a proposed 
$106.5-million budget for the fiscal year beginning in July. 
City Manager Donald F. McIntyre told directors this week that about $3.5 
million worth of programs have not been included in the proposed budget because 
there is not enough money to pay for them without cutting other programs or 
increasing revenue. 
The proposed budget includes a $1-million revenue increase from an extension of 
the city's telephone tax to interstate and international calls. Other revenue 
increases that could be considered, city officials said, include a $1-million 
increase in business license fees and $750,000 from raising the utility tax for 
residential customers to the level paid by commercial users. The residential 
rate is now about 2% below the commercial rate.
