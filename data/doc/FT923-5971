FT  27 AUG 92 / Swedish interest rates up to 16%
SWEDEN'S central bank raised its lending rate yesterday by 3 percentage
points to 16 per cent to defend the krona and stem a rapid outflow of
capital.
Bankers expressed doubts, however, that the increase would be enough to
resolve the country's economic difficulties and calm the financial markets.
They said concern about the Swedish minority government's perceived
inability to carry out its tough economic policy had not gone away. Hopes of
a broad-based economic agreement between the government and the opposition
remain slight.
Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, in an interview with the Financial Times,
said there was no reason for the government to change its economic policies
or introduce new spending cuts to contain a growing budget deficit.
The non-Socialist government was last night making informal soundings on
negotiating a broad agreement with the main Social Democratic opposition on
measures to restore financial confidence. But Mr Bildt said he 'doubted'
this would lead anywhere, while Social Democrat leader Mr Ingvar Carlsson
said there were 'no conditions for co-operation' if the government stuck to
its existing policies.
Both sides agree there should be no devaluation and the fixed exchange rate
of the Swedish currency should be maintained. They also want the krona to
shadow the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System as soon
as possible.
There was a sharp difference of opinion between Mr Bildt and the central
bank yesterday. The premier said he found it 'difficult to understand' what
had been happening on Swedish markets in recent days with the huge outflow
of capital, soaring short-term interest rates and plummeting stock market.
He blamed the financial troubles mainly on international factors.
But Mr Bengt Dennis, the central bank governor, disagreed. 'The key to low
interest rates lie in the hands of the government and the parliament,' he
said.
