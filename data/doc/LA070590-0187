GUNMAN IN PHOENIX WOUNDS 2 
A gunman opened fire today in a Mormon Church parking lot where about 120 
children were boarding buses for camp and wounded an off-duty police officer 
and a woman. He later surrendered without incident. 
No children were believed injured in the incident at the Phoenix 36 Ward of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Steve Checketts, 43, an off-duty officer who was at the church with his family, 
was hit in the left arm and chest and was taken to a hospital in serious 
condition. Rachel Beech, 47, was wounded in the left ankle and taken to another 
hospital. 
The gunman holed up in a nearby house for about 90 minutes, then surrendered. 
He was not immediately identified. 
"We don't have any motive at all," a police spokesman said.
