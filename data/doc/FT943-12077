FT  27 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Communication made easy
Sir, Getting the most from information technology (Mr John Dodd, Letters,
July 23, commenting on previous articles) could be given a considerable
boost at quite a small expense.
The difference between being literate (being able to read) and being
computer literate (being able to operate some program) is enormous but
unnecessary. Today, F1 summons the 'help' menu in many programs. To save,
print, create a graph, or whatever else one may wish to do, involves
different sets of key strokes in different orders, according to the program
in use.
If hardware manufacturers can agree protocols to allow computers (and fax
machines) to communicate, it must be possible for software writers to do the
same. The saving for companies (even nations) would be enormous.
