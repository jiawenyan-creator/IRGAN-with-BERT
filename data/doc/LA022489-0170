WORLD; 
INDICTED MEXICO CITY OFFICIAL QUITS 
The head of Mexico City's police intelligence branch, accused by opposition 
groups of torturing prisoners during the 1970s and under U.S. indictment, has 
resigned his post, a City Hall spokesman said today. 
He said Miguel Nazar Haro, director of the newly created intelligence services 
of the city police force, tendered his resignation after just over two months 
in the job. Nazar, 60, was previously deputy director of the federal security 
office between 1975 and 1982, when he resigned after being indicted by a U.S. 
grand jury in San Diego on charges of participating in a stolen car ring. 
Government officials reject the charges, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City 
said a warrant for his arrest is still standing in San Diego.
