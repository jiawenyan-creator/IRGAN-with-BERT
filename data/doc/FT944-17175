FT  10 OCT 94 / Arts (Openings): Tate Gallery, London
Ruskin described his work as 'a pot of paint flung in the public's face' but
today the paintings of James McNeill Whistler look decidedly conservative
alongside many works at the Tate. The Tate's major exhibition, which opens
on Thursday, aims to give new perspectives on the artist's role as teacher,
polemecist, aesthetic theorist and critic.
