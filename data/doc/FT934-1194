FT  21 DEC 93 / Lautro seeks drop-out rate
Life insurance companies would have to draw up standardised statistics about
the rates at which people give up long-term investment policies under
proposals published yesterday by the sector's regulator.
Persistency - the extent to which customers stay with policies - is seen as
an important indicator of whether they were suitably advised.
So far it has been difficult to compare the performance of companies because
statistics have not been collected on a standard basis.
Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry,
issued a consultation paper on establishing a basis for compiling
persistency figures.
Earlier this month Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading,
renewed his call for life companies to have to publish how many clients
cancel policies in the early years.
Lautro's central proposal is to measure the number of premiums still being
paid in the 13th month. Information about premiums maintained in the 25th
and 37th months would also be collected.
A range of products would be covered, including endowments and pensions,
about which there has been the most concern, as well as unit trusts and
personal equity plans.
