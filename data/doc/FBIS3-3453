  [Text] Beijing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman seriously condemned here today the anti-China 
practice of some Indian parliamentarians. 
  It was reported that an all-party Indian parliamentary forum 
for Tibet held a meeting in India recently and condemned the 
Chinese Government for violating human rights in Tibet and 
called for supporting the independence of Tibet. 
  The so-called "All-Party Indian Parliamentary Forum for 
Tibet" was initiated by a small number of Indian 
parliamentarians in collusion with the international anti-China 
force, the spokesman said while commenting on the issue at the 
request of some Beijing- based reporters. 
  He said they openly trumpeted for "liberation of Tibet" on 
the ground that there were human rights problems in Tibet. This 
anti-China act and gross interference in China's internal 
affairs has aroused great indignation of the whole Chinese 
people including the Tibetan compatriots, the spokesman noted. 
  "We sternly condemn the anti-China clamors made at the 
meeting. We deeply deplore that such anti-China political 
activities had not been forestalled on the territory of India," 
he said.
