FT  13 FEB 93 / Powell plan unveiled
THE chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff unveiled a plan yesterday for a
post-Cold War military that calls for consolidating all US-based forces so
as to better meet crises at home and United Nations peacekeeping missions
abroad, Reuter reports from Washington.
In a report billed as his own strategic blueprint for the armed forces,
General Colin Powell stressed the need to join some elements of the military
to save money and gain efficiency, such as consolidating depot maintenance
functions, but left others intact, including the four separate air forces of
the Air Force, Army, Marines and Navy.
'The report should be seen as a snapshot - a snapshot in a continuous
process of self-evaluation,' Gen Powell said.
The main points were to maintain US commitments around the world and the
quality of the military, emphasise US technological superiority, adjust to
the 'changing security environment' in the post-Cold War world and further
trim military programmes.
