FT  20 JAN 93 / Errors found in sick-pay scheme
CHECKS on employers' administration of statutory sick and maternity pay
schemes have consistently found monetary errors in 25 per cent to 30 per
cent of cases, the National Audit Office says in a report today, Alan Pike
writes.
The Department of Social Security's monitoring of the schemes was
'insufficient for the effective supervision of a programme costing more than
Pounds 1bn a year,' concludes the report. It says there was 'little
assurance' that the objectives of the sick pay and maternity pay schemes
were being fulfilled, that public funds were being adequately controlled or
that employees could always expect to receive their correct entitlements.
In 1991-92 statutory sick pay payments totalled Pounds 900m and maternity
pay totalled Pounds 350m. Employers pay the benefits but recover most of the
cost - Pounds 1.1bn in 1991-92 - from the National Insurance fund.
The DSS, says the report, had sought to keep the schemes as simple as
possible for employers to administer. It was, with the Contributions and
Benefits agencies, working hard to improve monitoring and oversight.
'But their plans will need to be pursued vigorously, and supplemented by
further action, if the interests of the exchequer and employees are to be
fully safeguarded,' the report says.
