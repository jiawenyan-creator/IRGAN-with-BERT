FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: ADT price falls
ADT's share price fell by 44p yesterday to close at 579p following
speculation that ADT's largest shareholder, Ontario-based Laidlaw, might
sell its 24 per cent stake in the Bermuda-based security services and
vehicle auction group.
The speculation followed news that Mr Donald Jackson, Laidlaw's chief
executive, will submit his resignation at a board meeting on October 13
following 'differences of opinion concerning Laidlaw's strategic direction'.
Earlier this year Mr Jackson described Laidlaw's stake in ADT, which was
acquired under his predecessor Mr Michael DeGroote, as a 'portfolio
investment'.
In July Laidlaw decided not take up its proportionate share of ADT's public
offer in the US of 18m shares at Dollars 8 each. The Dollars 144m proceeds
were used help ADT refinance Dollars 1.3bn of debt and meet preference share
obligations. As a result of the public offer Laidlaw's stake fell from 28.4
to its current level.
ADT declined to comment on the share price movement yesterday.
