SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 These Rules are hereby issued as a final rule. The Board issued these Rules as an interim rule, with request for public
comments, on February 18, 1993. This final rule deviates from the interim rule in only a few particulars, based upon
recommendations received from the Commission and from interested members of the Board's staff.



With regard to laws respecting discrimination in employment, the Board as a matter of policy has long recognized that
it should afford to its employees, applicants for employment, and others the same substantive and procedural rights
that are enjoyed by persons in their dealings with other government agencies. Pursuant to this policy, part 268 has
been revised by the Board after the issuance by the Commission of its federal sector complaint processing regulations
(29 CFR part 1614) which became effective on October 1, 1992. A new part 268 was issued by the Board as an interim rule
effective February 18, 1993; (58 FR 9517, February 22, 1993) and is now issued as a final rule with revisions following
receipt and consideration of public comments. 

Consistent with the Commission's new regulations, this final rule addresses matters of the kind addressed by Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e 

et seq

.), the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 791), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended (29 U.S.C.
621 

et seq

.) and the Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. 206(d)). Subpart G (Prohibition Against Discrimination In Board Programs And Activities
Because Of A Physical Or Mental Handicap) of the interim rule has also been revised consistent with recent revisions
to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794). 



Summary of Comments 



The Commission and one commenter recommended that the terms ``handicap'' and ``handicapped'' should be replaced
with ``disability'' or ``disabled'' throughout the Rules. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 substituted
the term ``disability'' for the term ``handicap'' throughout the Rehabilitation Act (Section 102(f), Pub. L. 102569).
It is the Board's intention to update the language of its Rules to conform to the 1992 amendment with whatever updates
are made by the Commission. Although such revisions have not yet been incorporated in the Commission's regulations
(29 CFR part 1614), in light of the Commission's specific recommendations, the Board has substituted appropriate
language throughout the Rules as set forth above. 

One commenter took exception to the deletion of section 703 (Self evaluation) of the prior Rules, which was in effect
prior to February 18, 1993. Section 703 had required the Board to evaluate its then current policies and practices,
and to make necessary modifications, regarding the upgrade of its facilities to conform to the standards of Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The time limits stated in section 703 have passed. The Board has conducted the required
survey of its facilities, and the Board has been implementing appropriate modifications to its facilities. Therefore,
the Board believes that section 703 has become moot. The Board believes that this is a technical deletion that does
not affect the Board's strong and continuing commitment to equal opportunity and equal access for individuals with
a disability.
