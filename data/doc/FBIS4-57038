  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 11 May (EFE) -- Acting on the orders 
of President Itamar Franco, the Brazilian Army today occupied 
the headquarters of the Federal Police [PF] in Brasilia and Sao 
Paulo, seeking to end the strike the police has been observing 
for the past 51 days. 
  The Brazilian Government yesterday warned the PF that it 
would retaliate against the PF if it continues its strike, which 
was declared illegal because it affects basic services like the 
issuance of passports and drug enforcement. 
  After meeting with the military ministers, President Itamar 
Franco yesterday afternoon ordered the Army to intervene. This 
took place today at dawn when the two main PF buildings in the 
country were taken over. 
  A government spokesman has said the Armed Forces were 
summoned by the president "to guarantee national security."
