  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Japan decided Monday [24 
January] to totally lift a ban on exports to South Africa in 
view of progress in the abolition of apartheid, government 
officials said. 
  The officials said Japanese exports of computers and 
four-wheel drive vehicles to Pretoria will be excluded from a 
restricted list effective Friday, totally removing export 
controls to the African nation. 
  Japan's decision comes ahead of a national election in South 
Africa in April without racial discrimination.
