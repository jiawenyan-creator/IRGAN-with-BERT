FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Rank faces questions over film
interests
THE possible sale of Rank Organisation's film interests is likely to
dominate investors' questions when the leisure and entertainment group
announces annual results on Thursday.
Analysts are expecting the heavily indebted company to report pre-tax
profits of between Pounds 233m and Pounds 245m, against Pounds 254m last
time.
Rank refused to comment on weekend speculation of an offer from a consortium
involving Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4.
It is understood that no formal approach has been made, while Mr Michael
Gifford, Rank's chief executive, has stressed the business has not actively
been put up for sale.
However, Mr Grade has confirmed that he is in contact with an unnamed bidder
for Rank's film business. The potential bidder, believed to be a consortium
of investors, is being advised by Chemical Bank. Mr Grade has said he would
be prepared to be a non-executive director of the Rank Organisation's film
and cinema business if it is sold.
Rank is in the process of trying to reduce its almost Pounds 1bn debt
through disposals of assets such as hotels. To date, it has sold just four
of the 22 hotels earmarked for disposal, raising about Pounds 88m. In
December 1991 Rank sold its motorway services arm for Pounds 90m. The debt
was largely the result of the Mecca takeover in 1990.
The film interests, which include the Odeon cinema chain and Pinetree
Studios, are believed not to be considered core assets.
