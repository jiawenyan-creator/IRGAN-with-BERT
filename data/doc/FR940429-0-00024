 



HUD and FmHA response: 

Section 

XXX

.240 of the rule has been revised to allow fees to include cash contributions of the program participant, food stamps
and any other contributions or donations. Cost sharing and fees collected by any eligible new or expanded service
program for the CHSP are currently eligible. However, due to the statutory constraints concerning matching funds,
funds for existing services which are not expanded are not eligible for match. Matching funds must pay for 50% of the
cost of the services under CHSP and therefore, only costs for new or expanded services are eligible for match. 



Definitions





Comment: 

One commenter urged the Department to reconsider its definition of activities of daily living (ADL) and the way that
its definition is applied in the interim common rule. The commenter stated that the definition of ADL promulgated
in the new rule combines what are now commonly known in the worlds of gerontological research and community-based
aging programs as ``activities of daily living'' (ADL) and ``instrumentalities of daily living'' (IDL). The commenter
stated that the rule definition of ADL was created by combining these terms without regard to what is currently used
in the community and other common programs. The commenter argues that this definition is not in the spirit of coordination
of housing and services which it believes is intended by the CHSP. The commenter further states that the way in which
the definition of activities of daily living is applied is ``antithetical to the concept of aging in place.'' The commenter
states that when one looks at the definition and all its caveats, the potential population to be served is not what is
commonly known as the frail elderly but rather a fairly narrow niche of somewhat frail older adults. The commenter
stated that while it understands HUD might want to be cautious about this definition in order to maintain a housing
rather than an institutional character to its developments, it is also important that such appropriateness decisions
be reviewed on an individual rather than a categorical basis whenever possible.



HUD and FmHA response:

 Program participants are limited to the frail elderly deficient in at least three activities of daily living by statute.
Therefore, HUD and FmHA decided to combine the ADL's and IDL's based upon HUD's past experiences in operating the CHSP
of 1978. By combining ADLs and IDLs for the definition of ADLs and stating the minimum deficiency level, the program
is able to serve a larger population of frail elderly persons than would be served by the traditional definitions of
the ADLs. 



Comment:

 One commenter states that the definition of activities of daily living (ADL) should be more concise and the minimum
requirements of ADL which are listed in 

XXX

.225(c)(2) should be initially stated under the definitions.



HUD and FmHA response:

 Section 

XXX

.225(c)(2) restates the definition of activities of daily living found in the definition section.



Comment: 

One commenter states that instead of including PHAs specifically in the definition of ``Applicant'' PHAs are identified
as eligible grantees under the definition of ``Local nonprofit housing sponsor.'' The commenter suggests that the
rule specifically identify PHAs and IHAs as eligible grantees. 



HUD and FmHA response:

 The definition of ``Applicant'' has been revised to specifically identify PHAs and IHAs as eligible grantees.



Comment: 

One commenter states that the definition of qualifying supportive services found in 

XXX

.105 and the eligible activities found in 

XXX

.210 do not tie in directly to the minimum requirements for ADL. The commenter states that the minimum requirements
of ADL do not include non-medical supervision and personal emergency response systems.



HUD and FmHA response: 

Qualifying supportive services and eligible activities should not tie directly into the requirements of ADL. The
ADLs are used to determine if frail elderly persons are minimally eligible to participate in the program. Program
participants (frail elderly persons deficient in at least three ADLs and persons with disabilities) would then be
eligible to receive qualifying supportive services such as non-medical supervision and personal emergency response
systems, if they need them.



Comment:

 The commenter states that the section number in the reference for the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and
Bill of Rights Act contained in 

XXX

.105(7) should be changed from (7) to (5).



HUD and FmHA response:

 This error has been corrected.



Comment: 

The commenter states that in 

XXX

.205(e) Eligible housing projects of the interim rule the reference to non-elderly ``disabled'' should be changed
to non-elderly people with ``disabilities.''



HUD and FmHA response: 

All references to non-elderly handicapped or non-elderly disabled have been changed to non-elderly people with
disabilities.
