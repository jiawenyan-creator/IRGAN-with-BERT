  [Excerpt] No candidate of the Mozambique Liberal and 
Democratic Party [Palmo] will contest the presidential elections 
scheduled for October. This has been revealed in Beira by Palmo 
Chairman Martins Bilal, who added that his party will 
concentrate its attention on legislative elections. Bilal told 
our reporters in Beira that it would be viable for the 
Mozambique Liberation Front to continue in power, or as a last 
resort, the Mozambique National Resistance. [passage omitted]
