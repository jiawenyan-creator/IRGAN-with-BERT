ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
TERROR STALKS THE VIETNAMESE 
An implied article of American faith is that people shouldn't be persecuted 
either for their political ideas or their commitment to them. A fierce 
intramural squabble in the local Vietnamese-American community is putting that 
belief to an important test. 
It's no small added concern that lives are literally at stake. 
For several years now, shadowy anti-Communist groups have terrorized the 
Vietnamese community with threats and occasional violence. The FBI has been 
investigating the arson death in 1988 of a Garden Grove newspaper publisher, 
for example, and Westminster police are concerned about a death threat recently 
made against the editor of a Vietnamese-language newspaper and several other 
prominent citizens. At issue is whether the U.S. should normalize relations 
with the Communist government of Vietnam. The targets of the threats all are 
certifiably anti-Communist, but they're apparently not anti-Communist enough 
for extremists in the refugee community. But even if they were Communists, they 
would have the right to express their views in this country without fear. 
Normalization of relations with Vietnam may seem like strictly an internal 
matter to Vietnamese-American extremists. It isn't, of course, because the 
larger American community has a stake in this issue -- just as it has a stake 
in how the debate is conducted. The chairwoman of the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission recently condemned the death threats, and it would be good 
for the entire commission to do the same. 
Freedom has lured many immigrants to these shores. But freedom lies as much in 
a willingness to allow others to exercise it as it does in claiming it for 
ourselves. Debate over normalization of relations with Vietnam should be held 
in a rational and peaceful atmosphere, in keeping with the best American 
tradition.
