FT  23 DEC 94 / Thyssen to spend DM4bn on expansion of telecom interests
Thyssen, the German steel-based conglomerate, plans to spend up to DM4bn
(Pounds 1.60bn) expanding its fledgling telecommunications operations into
an integrated service business turning over DM10bn a year by the end of the
decade.
Existing interests in mobile communications, terrestrial network and
satellite-based services will be bundled together in a stand-alone
joint-stock company called Thyssen Telecom, said Mr Dieter Vogel, deputy
group chairman.
Medium-term plans include a stock market flotation, and collaboration with a
strategic partner might also be considered, he said. However, Thyssen would
retain a majority stake.
The company would specialise in services rather than networks and other
hardware, Mr Vogel said, as 80 per cent of the added value in telecoms came
from services rather than networks.
Current operations were already turning over DM2bn, Mr Vogel said. This
would be augmented soon by income from an added-value data transmission
service and a personal computer-based multimedia 'users' club' offering
shopping and information services.
The new company, to be chaired by Mr Vogel, would also be applying for a
licence in 1996/97 to offer the public speech telephone services from early
1998, the time set by the government for the ending of the state network
monopoly.
Although relatively late in joining the line of companies unveiling firm
investment plans and sales targets for the telecoms market, Thyssen has been
building on its base of an extensive in-house voice transmission service.
It and the Veba group each have 28.4 per cent stake in the E-Plus German
mobile phone business with most of the balance held by BellSouth of the US,
Britain's Vodafone, and France's Caisse de Depots.
