  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- Russia's representative at the 
United Nations was instructed to appeal to the U.N. Security 
Council, initiating a discussion of military operations which 
are being carried out by the Bosnian Government Army against 
Bosnian Serbs, said director of the Press and Information 
Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Georgiy Karasin, at 
a briefing held here today. 
  "The aim of the Russian diplomacy is to prevent further 
deterioration of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 
whole," the Russian diplomat said. 
  "Russia is particularly concerned about an unstable 
situation 
around Tuzla, Moslem refusal to join the agreement on a safe 
area of Gorazde and increased shelling of the area of Brsko 
controlled by the Serbs," the Russian diplomat said.
