FT  19 JAN 93 / Ministers study pay options for dentists
OPTIONS ON how dentists should be paid, ranging from tinkering with the
much-criticised system to a radical restructuring of the dental health
service, were presented to ministers yesterday.
The review of dentists' remuneration makes no recommendations but sets out
possible improvements. It was launched by the government last July to defuse
a crisis that led to dentists threatening to leave the health service and a
vote to stop taking new NHS patients.
There will be long consultation before ministers decide how to proceed. It
appears the setting up of the review, chaired by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield,
former head of the Civil Service in Northern Ireland, has helped to defuse
the dispute between dentists and the government.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said after receiving the report that in
the past six months there had been a net loss of only 15 dentists in the
health service.
The review has underlined the lack of consensus both inside and outside the
dental profession on what should be done to upgrade the service and make it
more cost effective.
The only agreement seems to be that the status quo is unsatisfactory.
The options presented by Sir Kenneth include relatively minor changes to the
complex system under which the country's 18,000 dentists are paid by
reimbursement for practice expenses, fees for specific treatment, and bulk
payments for the number of patients signed up.
Radical reforms might include limiting treatment available under the health
service, or further restricting those eligible for free or subsidised dental
care. The report favours keeping free treatment for children, but not
neces-sarily for all pregnant women.
