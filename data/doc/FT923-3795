FT  10 SEP 92 / ECC makes surprise Pounds 13m provision
THE share price of English China Clays, the world's largest producer of
china clay, plunged almost a sixth yesterday from 446p to 371p after the
company announced an unexpected Pounds 13m provision against its depressed
UK housebuilding and building materials business.
The stock market value of the company fell by more than Pounds 200m as 6.7m
shares were traded, the highest daily volume in the company's shares for
four years.
The provisions, of which Pounds 11.2m were against housebuilding, were
revealed as the company announced a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 53.2m to Pounds 40.8m. There is an unchanged interim dividend of
6.6p.
English China also announced that it would be cutting 400 jobs in its UK
building materials division. Last year the group reduced its worldwide
labour force by more than 2,000 to 10,800. Most of the job losses were in
the UK.
The company has already announced its intention to run down its UK housing
operations by developing or selling its remaining housing land. The market,
however, had not expected the company to make write-downs at this stage.
Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said: 'There has been a marked
deterioration in the UK housing market during the past three to four weeks
and this prompted our decision. The fall follows from the ending last month
of government concessions on stamp duty on the purchase price of homes up to
Pounds 250,000.' Following the company's announcement, stockbrokers cut
their pre-tax profits forecasts for English China for this year, from
between Pounds 120m-Pounds 135m, down to Pounds 90m-Pounds 95m.
The company said that first-half profits before the provision were
marginally up at Pounds 54.1m, from Pounds 53.2m, helped by an interest
charge of only Pounds 600,000 against Pounds 11.4m at the corresponding
stage last year.
Net debt of Pounds 128m is mostly in US dollars. The group therefore is
benefiting from very low interest rates in the US as well on currency
translation into sterling.
Profits from china clay, used mainly for fillers and coatings by the paper
industry, slipped from Pounds 48.9m to Pounds 46.5m while building material
profits fell from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 7.5m. Housing profits fell from
Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 4.5m.
Earnings per share declined from 12.63p to 10.22p. Group turnover fell from
Pounds 511.8m to Pounds 479.4m.
