FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (27): Back on the
road to economic growth - Eastern Europe / The economic prospects for the
former communist states
POLAND, only four years ago a communist basket case par excellence, will
this year win accolades as the fastest growing economy in Europe.
Had it not been for a clutch of special factors - the recession in Germany
and western Europe, the second consecutive year of drought in Hungary, the
one-off negative effect of the divorce between the Czech and Slovak
republics, and the impact on Slovenia of the collapse in the former Yugoslav
market, Poland would have been accompanied around the top of the European
growth league by its neighbours in central Europe as a whole.
Next year, barring disasters, the whole of post-communist Europe outside
former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union, but including Albania,
Romania and Bulgaria, and probably the Baltic states, should return to the
path of economic growth.
Statistics prepared by PlanEcon Europe indicate that GDP growth in the
region next year will range from a low of 2.6 per cent in Romania to more
than 5 per cent in Slovenia and Bulgaria and 6 per cent in Poland and the
Czech republic.
If so, next year should mark the start of what could be a prolonged period
of self-sustaining growth capable of stimulating the development of a
pan-European market from the Atlantic to the eastern borders of Poland.
At that point, the political leaders of the European Community, who were
able to escape ultimate responsibility, and the need to offer real
leadership during the 45-year Soviet-American hegemony over a divided
continent, might finally switch their focus away from the cold-war version
of a united Europe enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, towards serious
contemplation of the kind of confederal structure required to accommodate an
additional 105m people, and a dozen new member states into an enlarged and
re-structured European economic and defence community.
Even if they do rise to the occasion, however, the politicians will be far
behind the bankers, businessmen and entrepreneurs of Europe, North America
and Asia, for whom a pan-European market is already a reality. First prize
for market awareness perhaps goes to the German ice-cream manufacturer who
now routinely labels the ingredients of his humble ice-lollies in Czech,
Hungarian and Polish, in addition to German, French, Dutch, Spanish and
English.
This example of pan-European marketing helps to illustrate the thinking
which has made the multinational food and consumer goods corporations the
spearhead for integrating the former communist states into the global
economy.
Throughout the region a raft of new plants have been, or are being built by
the big food and detergent groups such as Unilever, Procter and Gamble,
Henkel, Nestle and Sara Lee, rival tobacco companies, such as Philip Morris
and BAT, consumer durable companies, such as Electrolux, and the big
automobile makers led by Volkswagen, Fiat and General Motors.
Production from new greenfield plants, or from restructured, former
state-owned facilities, privatised in the biggest sell-off of state property
ever seen, is rising rapidly.
The elimination of subsidies, introduction of internal currency
convertibility and adherence to tight IMF-monitored budget deficit limits
has also helped shape a macroeconomic framework in which many of the former
loss-making state enterprises have been down-sized and made more efficient
by asset sales, the closure of loss-making sections and job losses.
Relatively few state enterprises have yet been closed down completely,
especially in the Czech republic where tight control over public sector
wages has enabled state enterprises to keep workers on their books rather
than the unemployment register. But throughout central Europe the scale of
losses from state-owned enterprises awaiting privatisation has been cut, and
in a few spectacular cases, such as the Szceczin shipyards on Poland's
Baltic coast, managers have been able to turn round loss-making state
enterprises before the introduction of a form of privatisation which
includes a strong management and worker buyout elements.
General awareness of the scale and speed of the economic transformation of
central Europe has been masked to date by the official statistics, the
accuracy of which is limited mainly to recording the speed and extent of the
decline in output from the big state sector plants.
Perversely, the most rapid transformers, Poland and Hungary, show the
steepest rise in unemployment and more than 30 per cent declines in
industrial output over the last four years. At the same time rapid
inflation, especially in Poland, has wiped out the savings of millions of
people.
The emergence of a lost generation of managers and workers who have been
sacked from their former secure jobs, lost their savings and found
themselves virtually unemployable in the new economy, has placed a huge
pension and unemployment payment burden on state budgets.
At the same time, the bad debts of many state enterprises continue to limit
the ability of under-capitalised and inexperienced banking systems to
satisfy the rising credit demands from the rapidly expanding private sector.
All this means that the transition process is far from complete, while
nostalgia for the lost security of the age of socialist mediocrity, coupled
with resentment at the emergence of many from the old communist nomenklatura
as the new capitalists and entrepreneurs, has embittered the political
atmosphere. In Poland, for example, the post-Solidarity parties most closely
associated with market reforms, have been unable to capitalise on Poland's
current rapid recovery from three years of wrenching recession. Polls show
that voters have been swinging back to support for parties with roots in the
collectivist past because unemployment remains stubbornly high while the low
incomes of millions of ordinary workers keep the new consumer goods
tantalisingly out of their grasp.
In Hungary, the main recipient of foreign capital but the most indebted
country in the region, the delayed resumption of growth after so much macro
and micro-economic change is also undermining the popularity of the
conservative government and re-awakening a frustrated nationalism.
Only in the Czech republic, where Mr Vaclav Klaus, the economist turned
prime minister has made a deliberate effort to explain the merits of
capitalism and the advantages of privatisation to the electorate, have
voters clearly given their support for those in charge of still painful
reform.
What remains to be seen is how far Nato and the European Community respond
to the desire of central Europe's new market-based democracies for full
integration.
