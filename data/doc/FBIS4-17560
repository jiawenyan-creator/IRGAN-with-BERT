  [Text] The Foreign Affairs and Security Committee of the 
Cabinet of Ministers today approved the concept of the defense 
system of the Republic of Latvia. According to this concept, 
the state defense system comprises the national armed forces, 
the joint systems of personnel and supplies, and non-military 
institutions of the state defense system. 
  The concept of the defense system provides for Latvian 
involvement in general and regional processes of the European 
economic and political development and the unified European 
security system, coordinated exercises of the Baltic states, 
setting up weaponry and information exchange systems and joint 
military units with them, and cooperation with them in the 
spheres of control of the state border, territory, territorial 
waters, the economic zone of the Baltic Sea, and airspace. The 
concept lays down tasks for each constituent part of the 
national armed forces in implementing the state's defense.
