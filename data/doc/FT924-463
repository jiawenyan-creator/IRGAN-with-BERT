FT  24 DEC 92 / Shops see late buying surge despite bomb scares
RETAILERS around the country were yesterday celebrating a last-minute surge
in shopping, in spite of a series of bomb scares which caused chaos in some
city centres.
Shops from Scotland to south-east England said a customer build-up which
began on Monday peaked yesterday. Many now expected final results for the
Christmas period to be at least as good as last year, and in some places
better - particularly in the north of England.
They emphasised that a late Christmas rush had been expected after
disappointing results in November and early December, and they saw few signs
of a wider recovery in consumer confidence.
Mr Andrew Bauer, manager of Whiteleys shopping centre in Bayswater, west
London, said shoppers had become more 'canny'. 'People have been
window-shopping for weeks, choosing exactly what they wanted. Now, having
got their December pay cheques, they are buying,' he said.
Central London was thronged with shoppers in spite of a series of bomb
scares which closed many mainline stations for part of the day and
underground stations around Oxford Street.
Other cities were also disrupted after a caller telephoned the Dublin
Evening Press newspaper warning of bombs in Newcastle, Manchester and Milton
Keynes. In Manchester, shoppers and office workers were evacuated from
buildings around four bus stations, and in Milton Keynes a shopping centre
was cleared while police conducted a search.
Newcastle was particularly hard hit: all 46 stations on Tyneside's Metro
rapid transit rail system were shut and Intercity trains on British Rail's
east coast line were delayed for up to 1 1/2 hours after the closure of
Newcastle Central Station.
But trading at Newcastle's Eldon Square, the largest city-centre shopping
centre in Europe, was little affected and the manager said shoppers were
'spending to a surprising degree'.
