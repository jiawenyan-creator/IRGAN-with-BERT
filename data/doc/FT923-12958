FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Underwriters top up in MFI share issue
MFI FURNITURE Group's public offer of shares attracted 16,654 applications
in total covering 60.3m shares - 44 per cent of the 137m shares available.
The rest will be taken up by sub-underwriters.
However, sub-underwriters to the issue applied for 39.6m of the 60.3m
shares, leaving retail applications covering 20.7m shares, worth Pounds
23.8m at the 115p offer price. There were 379 applications from employees
for a total of 432,000 shares.
Of the shares applied for by sub-underwriters, 26.2m can be offset against
underwriting commitments and another 13.4m shares were in excess of their
sub-underwriting commitments.
Sub-underwriters still receive their commissions when they offset shares
applied for against their commitments.
The numbers underline the recent trend of retail investors shunning public
offers.
The institutions who bought stock through the placing of 410.2m shares also
sub-underwrote the public offer in the same proportions.
Bankers said sub-underwriters would have known, given market conditions,
that the offer would not be fully subscribed and so were sure of getting a
proportion of their underwriting commitments.
They said that by applying for shares under the offset arrangements they
showed a desire to be sure of getting stock. Those which applied for
additional shares may have felt it would be difficult to buy a large number
when dealings start on Friday, given that a fairly high proportion of the
shares are in firm hands.
