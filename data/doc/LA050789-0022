CARTOON MOONSHINE 
I recently took my young son to see the Walt Disney movie, "The Rescuers," and 
I was extremely disturbed by one aspect of it. 
A character in the film (whose name I believe is Barnaby) is very attached to 
his jug of moonshine. Barnaby repeatedly offers moonshine to characters who 
have become tired or despondent. Each time he exhorts, "It'll make a new man of 
ya!" or words to that effect. And each time the potion seems to have an 
energizing effect. 
Parents, schools, law enforcement, the government, children's television 
programmers and others are struggling to teach our young that drugs are not the 
answer to problems. I am at a loss for words to express my anger, 
disappointment and sorrow that a company such as Walt Disney Productions 
apparently is not sensitive to the importance that its messages and images can 
carry for young children.
