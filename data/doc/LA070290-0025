BUTTE COUNTY LOSES BID ON WELFARE COSTS 
The state Supreme Court has refused to order the state government to pay Butte 
County's share of welfare costs, prompting a lawyer for the county to warn that 
radical measures may be needed to stave off bankruptcy. "Proposition 13 is 
about to result in the death of the first county," attorney Ephraim Margolin 
said after the Supreme Court's action. 
The court unanimously denied a hearing on Butte County's appeal of a 
lower-court ruling that the county's current financial plight did not excuse it 
from paying 5.4% of Aid to Families with Dependent Children costs -- the share 
counties must pay under state law. The county says it was particularly hard hit 
by Proposition 13 because its property tax base was the lowest in the state 
when the 1978 measure rolled back and froze tax rates and assessments. Butte 
County supervisors must pass a balanced budget for 1990-91 by Aug. 31.
