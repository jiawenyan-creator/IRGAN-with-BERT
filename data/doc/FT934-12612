FT  26 OCT 93 / People: Waste Management International
WASTE MANAGEMENT International, the rapidly expanding environmental services
group, has appointed Humphrey Claxton to the new position of managing
director in charge of the water deparment of its services subsidiary.
Waste Management, which is the UK-listed arm of WMX Technologies of the US,
says the appointment will enable it to offer a full range of environmental
services to industrial and municipal customers.
Claxton, 47, a chartered engineer with an MBA from Cranfield, has
considerable international experience in this field, most recently as
managing director of Costain Environmental Services and earlier with Portals
Water Treatment.
Although Waste Management already provides water treatment services in a
number of countries, Claxton's appointment is designed to provide
co-ordination and leadership.
The group's newly formed water department 'will be working on a number of
big projects worldwide,' says Edwin Falkman, chief executive. 'These include
expanding activities in those countries where we have a water business, such
as Italy and the Netherlands, but more importantly in those countries where
there is a substantial need for our total environmental services package,
particularly in Asia.'
