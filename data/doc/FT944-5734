FT  02 DEC 94 / Activity continues to expand rapidly
US manufacturing activity continued to expand rapidly in November with
production hitting its highest level for 11 years, the National Association
of Purchasing Managers reported yesterday.
The NAPM index rose to 61.2 per cent from 59.7 per cent in October, while
the association's production index climbed to 66.7 per cent from 64.2 per
cent in October.
Mr Ralph Kauffman, manager of procurement at Oryx Energy and chairman of the
association's business survey committee, said the advance was spread across
all but three of the 20 industrial sectors surveyed. The strongest expansion
came in printing and publishing, paper, furniture, leather, petroleum,
plastics and rubber and transportation equipment industries.
The NAPM index of prices paid to suppliers fell in November, but this was a
result of seasonal adjustment factors. Mr Kauffman said all 20 sectors were
still reporting higher prices.
Similarly, the association's index of supplier deliveries - which can
indicate industry bottlenecks where inflationary pressures may build -
improved slightly, but Mr Kauffman said most purchasing managers remained
concerned about slow deliveries.
