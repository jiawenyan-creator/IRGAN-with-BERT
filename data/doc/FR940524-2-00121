 

I. Introduction 



A. Authority



Sections 5 and 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) (42 U.S.C. 1437c and 1437u); and section 7(d) of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). 

Public housing development regulations are published at 24 CFR part 941; demolition/disposition regulations are
published at 24 CFR part 970; section 5(h) regulations are published at 24 CFR part 906. 

The interim and final regulations for the public housing FSS program were published on May 27, 1993, at 58 FR 30858,
and 58 FR 30906, respectively, and will be codified at 24 CFR part 962. (The FSS final rule simply adopts the FSS interim
rule as the FSS final regulations.) 

The Notice of Program Guidelines for the HOPE1 program was published on January 14, 1992 at 57 FR 1522. The Catalog
of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.850. 



B. Fund Availability



The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriation Act
of 1994 (Pub. L. 103124, approved October 28, 1993) (1994 Appropriations Act) makes available up to $598 million
of budget authority (grants) for public housing development/Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing (MROP)
under section 5(a)(2) of the USHA. Since some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from the recapture of prior
year obligations, the actual amount available may be less. At the beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, the available
amount was $542,796,616, which included $149,534 in available carryover funds. As recaptures of funds within the
Annual Contributions account occur during the fiscal year, these amounts will be made available for allocation to
public housing development up to the fully appropriated amount, plus carryover. 

In accordance with section 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102550, approved
October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992), HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of appropriated funds (up to $29,900,000
depending on recaptures) for the development of housing designated for disabled families, and up to $119,200,000
(depending on recaptures) for activities involving MROP activities. Applications for designated housing for disabled
families and for MROP activities will be the subject of separate NOFAs to be published by the Department. 

The use of funds for replacement housing subject to section 18 of the USHA is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the
amount appropriated for development or $150 million. One half of one percent of the appropriated amount (up to $2,990,000)
has been set aside for technical assistance and inspections. Units transferred or sold to residents under HOPE I or
section 5(h) are subject to replacement in accordance with section 304(g) of the USHA. Based on experience, the Department
will provide up to $76,059,534 for such replacements. The balance of funds will be fair shared. 

The following table illustrates the distribution of grant authority.

C. Fund Assignments



Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated
on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts identified as Headquarters Reserve and (b) amounts determined incapable
of geographic allocation. The amounts identified by category below are maximums. 



1. Headquarters Reserve



Threshold-approvable applications for housing resulting from unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural
and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters;
housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and housing in support of desegregation efforts shall
be assigned Headquarters Reserve funding. (Headquarters Reserve amounts are limited in accordance with section
104 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101235, approved December
15, 1989), to five percent of the financial assistance that becomes available under the USHA and section 101 of the
HUD Act of 1965. Thus, Headquarters Reserve funding decisions will be made by Headquarters and may affect the distribution
of grant authority shown above.) 



2. Fair Share



Depending on recaptures, up to $220 million will be fair shared to approve category 4 (``other'') applications. These
fair share funds will be distributed to Areas (formerly Regions) on the basis of the following fair share factors,
which reflect the most recent decennial census data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies,
amount of substandard housing, and other measurable conditions. 

Because of errors in FY 1993 in calculating category 4 scores under the June 28, 1993, NOFA (58 FR 34670) for the Laconia
Housing and Redevelopment Authority (LHRA) in New Hampshire and the Nahunta Housing Authority (NHA) in Georgia,
fair share funds in the amounts of $753,400 and $759,400, respectively, will be awarded from the fair share amounts
provided to the New England and Southeast Area before making FY 1994 selections, and assigned to the LHRA and NHA applications.
The correction of these errors shall not adversely affect their participation in the FY 1994 rating and ranking process.
If a new application is filed by the LHRA or NHA under this NOFA, they will be rated and ranked on the same basis as other
applications, as if no error had been made. Any unused assignments will be redistributed, proportional to need, among
remaining Areas with approvable unfunded ``other'' applications. 

Fair share and Headquarters Reserve funds are also subject to the requirement of section 213 of the HCD Act of 1974 that
not less than 20 percent nor more than 25 percent of the HUD aggregate program funds covered by the statute be allocated
for use in nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, public housing development fund allocations to select ``other'' applications
may be modified before assignment in order to ensure Departmental compliance with this statutory and regulatory
requirement (see 24 CFR 791.403(a)).
