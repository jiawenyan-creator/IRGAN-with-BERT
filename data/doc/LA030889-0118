Britain Regains Optimism: Britain's leading business executives are regaining 
confidence in the economy despite government efforts to curb growth with high 
interest rates, a survey said. The Institute of Directors, which groups 37,000 
business leaders in Britain and overseas, said its members were increasingly 
optimistic about prospects for their own businesses and for the British economy 
as a whole. In February, 54% of directors in the survey were more optimistic 
about their companies' prospects than they were six months earlier, up from 47% 
in December.
