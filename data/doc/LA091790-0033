SPECIAL SCREENING: LEWIS KLAHR'S VINTAGE GRAPHICS TELL 'FUTURE' 
For his highly evocative "Tales of the Forgotten Future," which Filmforum 
screens tonight at 8 at LACE, filmmaker Lewis Klahr digs into a treasure-trove 
of vintage graphics to bring the past alive with a powerful emotional effect. 
A master of decoupage, Klahr cuts out figures from old magazines, comic books, 
etc. 
-- the list of his source materials is endless -- and animates them against 
backgrounds of photographs, engravings and so on. 
However, for all its reprocessing and layering, his work is fundamentally a 
rigorous example of achieving maximum impact through minimal means. 
What he achieves is two-fold: to evoke the American experience through popular 
culture, especially of the '40s and '50s, and to tell us little stories, often 
merely narrative fragments, to create the effect of eavesdropping on life. 
He takes us into the idealized, homogenous world of advertising and 
commercials, in which everyone is WASP-y, well-dressed and well-fed, only to 
reveal beneath impeccable surfaces a whole range of emotions -- fear, 
loneliness, sexual craving. 
Most poignant is the endless parade of pert, smiling Jon Whitcomb/Barbie 
doll-like creatures, calling attention to an image that straitjacketed a 
generation (or two) of young American women.
