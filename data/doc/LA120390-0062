IRAQ APPROVES PANEL TO TELL HUSSEIN STORY 
The government announced Sunday that it is setting up a new agency to produce a 
biography immortalizing President Saddam Hussein. 
The official Iraqi News Agency said the National Assembly has passed a law 
giving the new body the sole mandate of preparing a true account of Hussein's 
life. 
It said the law is aimed at "documenting the biography of His Excellency 
President Saddam Hussein in an accurate manner to immortalize his leading and 
historic role in the national construction of Iraq politically, economically, 
militarily and intellectually."
