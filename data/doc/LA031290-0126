VOLKSWAGEN TO PRODUCE CARS IN E. GERMANY 
Volkswagen AG of West Germany, Europe's leading mass car maker, unveiled the 
biggest joint venture to date with East Germany today, a $3-billion pact to 
build Volkswagens at sites where East Germany's Trabant autos are now produced. 
One result of the deal will be to consign the boxy little Trabant sedan, which 
became a symbol for East Germany's political upheaval last year, to history by 
1993. 
Thousands of the sputtering, two-stroke-engined cars brought refugees into West 
Germany in 1989. Once the borders opened in November, they carried in hordes of 
Eastern visitors eager to sample Western lifestyle for the first time. 
Volkswagen AG Chairman Carl Hahn told reporters at the Leipzig Trade Fair today 
that a joint venture firm in East Germany will start assembling 50 VW Polo 
models a day from September with output set to reach 250,000 cars a year by 
1994. 
"We see this as a European car project, with Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia 
just around the corner," Hahn said, giving an indication of the potential 
target markets for the new car. 
VW signed a commitment to the joint venture in December soon after revolution 
in Eastern Europe began breaking down the region's rigid barriers to the West. 
The project, with a factory at Karl-Marx-Stadt, is by far the most ambitious 
yet announced by any Western firm in East Germany. 
Adam Opel AG, the West German subsidiary of General Motors Corp., announced a 
venture Sunday which aims to make 150,000 cars a year in East Germany.
