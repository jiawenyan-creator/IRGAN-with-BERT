FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue hit
Bank note printer De La Rue failed to maintain its sharp rise established
after top of the range figures on Tuesday. Perceptions that the group's
rating was too demanding was compounded by a sober appraisal of the
prospects for the National Lottery.
De La Rue is one of the companies in the Camelot consortium which runs the
Lottery, and one investment institution was believed to have been selling
heavily after deciding its benefits were overvalued.
Once it began, the rest of the market followed, taking the stock down 20 to
1014p with turnover reaching 3.7m, the highest for around four years.
A division of opinion over figures from British Gas ensured that it was one
of the most actively traded stocks in London. The shares closed a penny
firmer at 304 1/2 p with 9.8m changing hands.
British Gas's third-quarter losses, calculated on an historic cost basis,
fell to Pounds 164m, from Pounds 225m previously. The figures were better
than analysts' forecasts of between Pounds 178m and Pounds 232m. But at
least one leading integrated securities house said they masked a one-off
Pounds 40m boost from lower gas prices and the company would suffer from
heavier than expected redundancies.
However, Nomura argued that the benefits of the cost cutting would show
through in 1995 and 1996, while UBS told clients that Gas's three-pronged
strategy to reduce costs, achieve medium growth out of the exploration and
production side and boost long term growth was proceeding faster than hoped.
The Queen's Speech news that Gas's monopoly is to be abolished had long been
discounted and analysts are expected to raise end of year forecasts to above
Pounds 900m.
British Airways made up some of its recent market underperformance, bouncing
12 1/2 to 386p in turnover of 7.1m for a two-day advance of 20.
Dollar recovery and renewed focus on the strength of the airline's core
business helped investors to shrug off more gloomy tidings on the USAir
front. Legendary US investor Mr Warren Buffett announced in an SEC filing
that his Berkshire Hathaway group, which like BA has a big stake in USAir,
could shortly take an earnings charge against the shareholding.
Eurotunnel retreated 12 to 272p, with turnover in Paris running at nearly
five times the level of the 1.2m shares traded in London.
International conglomerate Hanson saw a surge of dealing after traders
suspected that Hoare Govett, the company's broker, had published an
enthusiastic recommendation. Hoare was unavailable for comment. The stock,
restrained by a block of 4.2m shares traded just before the end of dealing
on Tuesday, ended the day marginally firmer at 232 1/2 p with turnover
totalling 12m.
BAT Industries advanced 8 1/2 to 466 1/2 p, with Smith New Court backing the
shares.
Motor industry engineers sprang to life, with GKN up 11 to 642p, T&amp;N gaining
11 at 229p, and BBA adding 9 at 207p in 4.5m turnover, as the engineering
sub-sector attempted to shake off a prolonged period of stock market
weakness.
An 81-page study on the recently integrated FT distributors sector from
NatWest Securities helped to underpin relevant stocks. Inchcape moved ahead
11 to 442p, while Farnell Electronics, the ambitious components distributor,
jumped 17 to 530p.
The prospect of Euro Disney falling off the CAC 40 list of leading French
stocks weakened the shares in London. They declined 4 to 106p.
Institutional buying in Ladbroke brought turnover of 13m. The shares firmed
2 to 157p.
Profit-taking in Boots, which has announced the sale of its pharmaceuticals
division and a Pounds 500m share buy-back, saw the stock give up 8 to 517p.
Hopes of a share buy-back continued to underpin trading in Great Universal
Stores. The shares added 3 at 574p.
Dairy group Unigate firmed 2 to 357p after a 6.8 per cent increase in
interim profits.
Profit-takers moved in on Vodafone, which has been strong ahead of next
week's interim results, pushing the shares down 6 to 215p. There was said to
be heavy switching into BT and Cable and Wireless, both of which benefit
from the upturn in the dollar. C&amp;W rose 5 1/2 to 399p, and was also heavily
traded in the options market.
Merchant bank SG Warburg jumped 24 to 671p as the benefits to the securities
arm from an active market were compounded by resurgent takeover talk.
Financial advice group Towry Law plunged 44 to 86p after warning that it
expected to make a half-year loss of Pounds 1.25m, compared with a previous
Pounds 565,000 profit.
