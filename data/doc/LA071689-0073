THE STATE 
A Sacramento disc jockey accused of making anti-gay jokes on the air has 
apologized after being reprimanded by his bosses. Pat Garrett of radio station 
KWOD offended many homosexuals last month when he complained that his 
girlfriend had left him for a man named Bruce, who was probably "a limp-wristed 
queer" or "faggot." Calling the remarks "verbal gay bashing," gay leaders 
gathered 350 signatures on a petition calling for a boycott of the station and 
its advertisers. The station's management agreed to publish an apology in the 
gay media and to establish a policy prohibiting anti-gay remarks on the air.
