  [Text] Moscow, 6 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia has not taken 
and does not intend to take any unilateral steps in transferring 
the Black Sea Fleet's air wing from the Crimea. "We will not 
engage in hooliganism, nor do we intend to capture anyone," said 
[Defense Minister] Pavel Grachev, replying to an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent's question on a Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
statement about alleged Russian plans to seize 20 Tu-22 military 
aircraft during the forthcoming Black Sea Fleet exercises. 
  Regarding the state of affairs on the division of the Black 
Sea Fleet, the minister noted that Russian and Ukrainian groups 
of experts are currently at work. Their findings on this 
question will be examined at the second round of talks on the 
future of the Black Sea Fleet. At the same time Grachev stated 
that the Russian version will scarcely differ substantially from 
the one it proposed at the talks in Sevastopol between the 
Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers. "It has been endorsed 
by the Russian president and reflected in five previous 
agreements signed by the presidents of the Ukraine and Russia," 
Pavel Grachev said.
