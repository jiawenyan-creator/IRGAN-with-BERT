FT  23 JAN 93 / British Airways: BA staff 'advised' to read Lord King's
statement on system
WHEN British Airways staff at Heathrow airport switched on their computers
yesterday, they were greeted with the next twist in the British Airways
affair - Lord King's latest statement had been placed on the system and
staff were 'advised' to read it, Gillian Tett writes.
In spite of the official apology, desk staff in Heathrow remained defiant,
insisting that BA was not alone in its aggressive marketing campaigns.
'It's not just us that have done this sort of thing. Other airlines do it
too,' said Ms Karen Granahan, a BA customer service duty manager, citing two
other carriers which she claimed had previously tried to poach BA customers
at the airport - a claim echoed by other airline staff throughout the
terminal.
