FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Quality Care Pounds 4.05m placing
QUALITY CARE Homes, a north-east England-based company which owns and
operates nursing homes for the elderly, yesterday placed 3.6m shares at 136p
raising Pounds 4.05m.
Most of the shares were taken up by institutions.
The company, until now entirely owned by founder and managing director Mr
Duncan Bannatyne and his family, has applied to join the main market.
Dealings are due to start on Thursday.
The placing comprises 27.2 per cent of the enlarged issued share capital and
gives the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 18m.
It is forecasting pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 1.75m in the year
to end-October. In the first six months turnover was Pounds 2.77m, against
Pounds 3.32m in the full year to end-October 1991.
The company has expanded rapidly since opening its first nursing home at
Darlington in 1987.
It has 11 freehold nursing homes providing 540 beds. It aims to have 20
homes, with 1,000 beds, by the end of 1994.
Mr Hamish Grossart, chairman, said the group generated quite strong cash
flow but saw the proceeds of the share sale as a means of financing capital
expenditure on new homes.
