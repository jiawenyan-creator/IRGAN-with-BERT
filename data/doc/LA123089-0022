ABT, JOFFREY AND THE STATE OF DANCE THEATER IN L.A. 
Having read "ABT Cancels L.A. Dates; Frozen Out by Joffrey?" (by Lewis Segal, 
Dec. 20), I feel compelled to, if not set the record straight, at least clarify 
it as to the role of the Music Center Operating Co. 
The Operating Co. administers the Music Center Complex pursuant to a sublease 
from the County of Los Angeles. The charge given to the Operating Co. is to 
operate the center so that the citizens of the county shall have the benefit of 
a wide array of the finest "performances essential to the educational and 
cultural development of the community." 
For 25 years the Operating Co. has faithfully undertaken that responsibility 
without succumbing to any pressure or influence of the interests of any group, 
and will continue to do so for the next 25 years. 
CHARLES I. SCHNEIDER, Chairman of the Board, Music Center Operating Co., Los 
Angeles 
 Segal's article quoted an executive of American Ballet Theatre as saying that 
despite an earlier announcement of a July engagement, the company will not 
dance in Los Angeles in 1990. Sources were quoted as saying the American Ballet 
Theatre decision came after collapse of negotiations with the Music Center 
Operating Co.
