FT  15 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report
GOLD declined on the London bullion market as profit taking set in after the
release of the US retail sales data, which was exactly in line with
forecasts. News that the Russian Congress had approved in principle a
declaration that would allow the government's radical economic reforms to
continue was seen as mildly bearish. Rising political tension between the
Congress and President Yeltsin's government had been seen as supportive for
gold. PLATINUM futures on Nymex were lower at midday as the market braced
for more selling by Japanese investors, analysts said. Light selling by the
Japanese overnight was enough to keep the metal in the doldrums. A decline
in GM car sales from April 1 to 10 also undercut sentiment. On the LME
ALUMINIUM lost ground in the afternoon as an early rise to a nine-month high
of Dollars 1,373 a tonne for three-month metal proved unsustainable. New
York arabica COFFEE futures were mostly firmer at midday. However, analysts
said coffee remained under siege, citing disappointment that the ICO last
week did not hammer out a new price-supporting pact, high supplies and a
seasonal decline in consumption.
