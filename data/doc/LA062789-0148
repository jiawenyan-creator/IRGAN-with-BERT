ON THE SIDELINES; 
OLYMPIC HURDLES CHAMP KINGDOM CLOCKS YEAR'S FASTEST TIME: 13.13 
Two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom clocked the fastest time of the year in 
the 110-meter high hurdles today in winning his first rematch with the Seoul 
Games' silver and bronze medalists. 
Kingdom, of the United States, whose best time is 12.97 seconds, was timed in 
13.13 into a slight head wind, leaving behind silver medalist Colin Jackson of 
Britain on the last two hurdles. Jackson, who knocked over three hurdles, 
finished second in 13.23. Greg Foster of the United States, the two-time world 
champion, was third. 
The rematch from last year's Olympics was among the highlights of the 
Athletissima meet, an International Amateur Athletic Federation Grand Prix 
event. Seoul bronze medalist Tonie Campbell of the United States finished sixth 
in 13.45. 
Jackson beat Kingdom last Friday at Birmingham, England, the first time the 
Briton defeated him in six meetings.
