<DOCTITLE>General Motors Corporation; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>



General Motors Corporation (GM) of Warren, Michigan, has determined that some of its vehicles fail to comply with
49 CFR 571.209, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies,'' and has filed an
appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' GM has also applied to be exempted
from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that
the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.

This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise
of judgment concerning the merits of the application.

Paragraph S4.6(b) of FMVSS No. 209 states that a seat belt assembly shall be labeled with the following statement:




This seat belt assembly is for use only in [insert specific seating position(s), e.g., `front right'] in [insert specific
vehicles make(s) and model(s)].




GM produced two different populations of vehicles which do not meet the labeling requirements stated in the standard.
The first population of vehicles, 68,405 1994 model year Chevrolet and GMC G-vans, were built with left-side seat
belt assemblies that were labeled as right-side assemblies.

The second population of vehicles, 31,978 199294 model year Chevrolet and GMC K20753 extended cap pickups,
were built with front outboard seat belt assemblies with the appropriate model designation omitted. The model designation
is K20753.

GM supports its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following.




For both these issues, the GM part numbers and manufacturer's model numbers correctly identify the affected seat
belt assemblies. In addition, the service parts manuals correctly specify the proper part numbers if replacement
parts were needed. In the case of the G-van seat belt assemblies, it is not possible to install the left front seat belt
assembly at the right front position. For the K 20753 model, the issue is the omission of an appropriate model. Usage
of the seat belt assembly in any of the models identified on the label is appropriate, as would be usage in the K 20753.

It is GM's understanding that the purposed of the subject requirement was to provide the person 

replacing

 a seat belt assembly in a vehicle with appropriate seat position and vehicle model information. However, original
equipment seat belt assemblies have already been installed in the appropriate models and positions at the assembly
plant. The Agency stated in a recent rulemaking proposal (Docket 7414; Notice 81, dated May 10, 1993), ``***
that seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment in new motor vehicles need not be required to be labeled
with position model information. This information is only useful if the assembly is removed with the intention of
using the assembly as a replacement in another vehicle. NHTSA does not believe this is a common practice.'' GM agrees
and believes that the removal of original equipment seat belt assemblies for the purpose of replacement installation
in another vehicle is rare. The Agency finalized that rulemaking action on April 15, 1994, eliminating the required
label verbiage on seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment by vehicle manufacturers.




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of GM, described above.
Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted.

All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicate below be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date, will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the application is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below.




Comment closing date: November 2, 1994.
