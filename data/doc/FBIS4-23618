  [Text] Point seven in the working agenda at the peace talks 
in Lusaka between the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] to reestablish peace in 
Angola has been concluded. It was agreed that UNITA will occupy 
the 70 seats it has in parliament. There will be no 
replacements. Everything will be done in accordance with the 
law. There are deputies which UNITA will appoint to the 
government. (Joao Vaiken), from UNITA's negotiating team, could 
become the next minister of geology and mines, while Jaka Jamba 
could become minister of culture. These two names are contained 
in two lists that UNITA will present to its Political 
Commission, with a view to appointing its members to the 
government as part of the national reconciliation. The parties 
did not do any work here in Lusaka today. After concluding 
discussions on the swearing-in of UNITA deputies in Parliament 
yesterday, Alioune Blondin Beye sent the negotiating teams away 
to reflect on the next topic, the extension of the state 
administration throughout the national territory, to be 
discussed on 13 June.
