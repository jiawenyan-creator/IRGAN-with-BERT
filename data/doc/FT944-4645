FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Heinz rises 23% in quarter
H. J. Heinz, the US food group, yesterday showed signs of a strengthening
recovery from last year's disappointing performance by announcing that
underlying operating profits had risen by 23 per cent in its second quarter
to October.
Net profits were sharply down, falling from Dollars 193.1m to Dollars
139.6m, but the comparison was distorted by a big increase in the tax charge
and by non-recurring gains in the year-ago period that resulted from the
disposal of its confectionery and specialty rice business-es.
Heinz said a better indicator of underlying performance was at the operating
profit level. Stripping out the comparable period's non-recurring gains
totalling Dollars 127m before tax, operating profits rose from Dollars
220.4m to Dollars 272.1m.
Earnings per share, adversely affected by an increase in the tax rate from
28.4 per cent to 37.5 per cent but boosted by company share repurchases,
were 56 cents. This represented an increase of 10 per cent from the
comparable period's 51 cents excluding the non-recurring gains, but fell
short of the 60 cents seen in the second quarter of 1992.
Heinz said the profits increase resulted from a 9 per cent increase in sales
to Dollars 1.98bn. Volume gains accounted for 4 percentage points of the
increase, acquisitions accounted for 3 percentage points, and the remaining
2 percentage points came from changes in currency translation rates.
The company said all divisions were performing well and it was still on
target for achieving double-digit earnings growth in the current fiscal
year.
During the quarter Heinz expanded its infant food business by completing the
acquisition of the family products division of Glaxo India. Since the
quarter-end it has also completed the acquisition of The Budget Gourmet
frozen foods brand in the US, which it predicts will add annual sales of
about Dollars 650m.
