FT  29 JAN 94 / Travel: FT Round the World Ski Expedition
Arnie Wilson and his companion Lucy Dicker are fast becoming celebrities
with frequent television appearances in North America, on the first leg of
their trip round the world.
Arnie reports: 'People who have seen us on a TV show hosted by Steve
Podborsky, one of the celebrated crazy Canucks who won nine downhills, or on
BCTV, keep coming up to talk to us. One said: 'Are you the guys who are
skiing for ever and ever?'
'We are collecting a lift ticket from each resort in an album - and Clint
Eastwood autographed the one we got in Sun Valley, Idaho when we bumped into
him in a mountain restaurant.'
Arnie and Lucy aim to ski every day during 1994 and to cover 5,000 miles on
the slopes. A full report on their progress, plus a reader competition, will
appear in next week's Weekend FT.
