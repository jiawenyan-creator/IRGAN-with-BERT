<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60158), the Department of the Interior published a notice of availability and a request
for comment regarding its proposed Section 4(e) conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric Project license. In an effort
to allow more time for public participation the Department is extending the comment period for an additional 45 days.
Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797(e), the proposed conditions provide for the adequate protection
and utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation and the Fish and Wildlife Service administered Flathead Waterfowl
Production Area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60158) notice of availability and request for comment provided a 30 day period during which
the Department would receive comments regarding its proposed Section 4(e) conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric
Project. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797(e), the proposed conditions provide for the adequate protection
and utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation and the Fish and Wildlife Service administered Flathead Waterfowl
Production Area. The proposed conditions for the Flathead Indian Reservation provide for the imposition of a base
load operational scenario at the Kerr Project. This operational scenario precludes the use of Kerr Dam as a load regulating
or peak power generation facility, and requires minimum flows, certain restrictions on flow fluctuations (ramping
rates), and a two year ramping rate study. In addition, the proposed conditions provide for non-operational measures
designed to protect and provide for adequate utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation in conjunction with
operational measures. The non-operational measures include the development of a Fish and Wildlife Implementation
Strategy, development of an operational rule curve, habitat acquisition, habitat development, fishery supplementation
and reintroduction, development of recreational resources, and the identification and protection of cultural
resources on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The proposed conditions for the Flathead WPA provide for the imposition
of erosion control on the north shore of Flathead Lake and the upper Flathead River, island restoration, and habitat
acquisition and development. The costs of all measures will be borne by the project licensees.



The deadline for comment on the proposed Section 4(e) conditions is extended for 45 days by this notice. The comment
period, which began on November 22, 1994, therefore, consists of a total of 75 days. All comments are due to the Department
on or before February 6, 1995. In addition, the Department will be making available two technical reports that further
support the proposed Section 4(e) conditions, the ``Kerr Hydro-electric Project Report'' by Stetson Engineers,
Inc., and ``An Evaluation of the Wildlife Components of the Kerr Dam Project Mitigation and Management Plan and Recommended
Section 4(e) Articles'' by BioSystems Analysis, Inc. The proposed conditions and the above referenced reports are
available for review and copying at the Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC in room 6443.
Copies of the proposed Section 4(e) conditions and the above referenced reports will be made available to all interested
parties upon request.
