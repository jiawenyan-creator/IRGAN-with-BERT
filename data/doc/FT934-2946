FT  10 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei jumps 3.4 per
cent in a strong region
The Nikkei average jumped 3.4 per cent, rising above the 17,000 level for
the first time in four trading days following comments by the governor of
the Bank of Japan, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor, said that further falls in the stock market
would dampen business sentiment and have an adverse impact on the economy.
The 225-issue index, which had fallen by 2.3 per cent on Wednesday,
rebounded 553.96 to 17,061.91. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 41.20, or 3 per cent, to 1,437.74. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
put on 2.54 at 1,174.58.
The governor's comments sparked a late afternoon rally, pushing the Nikkei
up to a day's high of 17,089.01 just before the close, having opened at a
low of 16,545.15.
Activity was also supported by index-linked buying prompted by Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the prime minister, pledging on Wednesday that he would do
whatever possible to ensure a market recovery.
Volume was 232m shares, against Wednesday's 286m, while rises overwhelmed
declines by 1,015 to 65.
Investors were also encouraged by the passage of the supplementary budget
through the lower house and reports that some leaders of the coalition were
calling for the establishment of a public entity to buy land held by banks.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y35,000 to Y720,000 and East Japan
Railway gained Y10,000 at Y423,000.
Index-linked buying supported banks, Industrial Bank of Japan adding Y60 at
Y2,840 and Fuji Bank Y80 at Y1,900.
Construction companies, which have been battered by the recent spate of
bribery scandals, were bought by institutional investors, who believe that
most of the bad news is now in the market. Taisei moved ahead Y17 to Y640,
Obayashi Y14 to Y595 and Shimizu Y20 to Y770.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 575.14 to 18,909.35 in volume of 27.8m
shares.
Roundup
The region saw strong performances yesterday.
HONG KONG surged 2.5 per cent to a record high, powered by hefty gains in
index futures on the back of strong US demand. The Hang Seng index added
240.03 at 9,990.26, surpassing the previous intraday high of 9,937.36 set on
December 7 and Wednesday's closing record of 9,750.23. Turnover came to
HKDollars 9.31bn.
In subsequent London trading, the indicative index rose a further 126 to
10,117.
December futures contracts touched a high of 10,215 before closing at
10,190, a 200-point premium to the local market, having ended at a 60-point
discount the previous day.
Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel commented that the market had become
increasingly technical, with futures trading reflecting options hedging. He
added that a convincing break through 10,000 on the Hang Seng today could
open the way for a rise to the 12,000 level although, because of the
technical nature of trading, the market could also fall back very quickly.
SINGAPORE followed Hong Kong's lead, climbing to a new closing peak amid
strong demand for banking and infrastructure stocks. The Straits Times
Industrial index put on 7.11 at 2,166.32.
BANGKOK forged ahead 3 per cent to a record high, with the SET index rising
43.71 to 1,480.63 in Bt25.92bn turnover.
Finance and securities issues have been favoured on the expectation that the
increased daily turnover in the stock market would raise these firms'
profits, while the property sector has found support from lower interest
rates.
JAKARTA edged higher in moderate late trading and the official index added
2.0 at 525.32. Strong demand which took Indah Kiat Rp175 higher to Rp2,250
surprised some analysts following the company's recent lower than expected
third-quarter earnings.
KUALA LUMPUR saw demand for speculative and laggard stocks, while a rebound
in Telekom Malaysia helped to lift the composite index 6.55 to a closing
1,067.34. Telekom finished 50 cents ahead at MDollars 19.90.
SEOUL saw a continuation of Wednesday's strong performance as turnover
soared to record levels. The composite index ended 7.24 up at 843.95 after a
day's high of 855.30. Turnover came to Won1,430bn.
KARACHI was pulled higher by active foreign interest in major issues. The
KSE 100 index rose 14.87 to 1,868.31.
MANILA eased in spite of a solid rise in the mining sector, which advanced
after the price of gold firmed in New York overnight. The composite index
slipped 8.30 to 2,510.62, as the mining sub-index soared 375.61 to 5,250.16.
Turnover dipped to 697m pesos from Wednesday's 762m pesos.
AUSTRALIA also declined slightly as profit-taking in the industrial sector
was balanced by a surge in resource stocks. The All Ordinaries index lost
just 0.3 to 2,095.7, after hitting a high in early trading of 2,107.2.
Sentiment was dampened by News Corporation, which retreated 62 cents to
ADollars 10.28 after the company withdrew its plan to issue shares with
'super voting rights'.
