FT  04 JUL 92 / Letter: Pensions thinking at odds with working patterns
Sir, You report on June 30 ('Pension age for women may rise') that the
government is moving in favour of equalising the state pension age at 65; a
flexible decade of retirement has apparently been ruled out.
You discuss the options solely in terms of benefits - or losses - to the
exchequer. This is precisely a reflection of the narrowness of government
thinking. The state pension age is critical in influencing individuals'
retirement decisions. A fixed state pension age encourages employees to
think in terms of an arbitrary and absolute end to their working lives. This
is at odds with the trend in working patterns, where flexibility is
paramount. A flexible decade of retirement would allow and encourage
employees actively to think about a range of options rather than
perpetuating the damaging belief that full-time work should end at 65.
