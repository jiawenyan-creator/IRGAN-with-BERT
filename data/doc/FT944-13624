FT  27 OCT 94 / Scandal reaches Italian left
Italy's former communists, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), is facing
a sizeable corruption investigation for the first time. The investigation,
which the PDS says is government-inspired, centres on public works contracts
awarded in Sicily during the 1980s to communist co-operatives. Over the last
two years magistrates in Sicily have arrested hundreds of businessmen and
politicians on corruption charges relating to distribution of lucrative
public works contracts. But this is the first time the PDS has been
targeted. Mr Massimo D'Alema, the PDS leader, accused the government of
orchestrating a campaign to discredit Italy's largest opposition party. The
move is seen by some as an attempt to draw the main opposition party into
the corruption scandal in an attempt to win support for a political
'solution' to end the investigations.
