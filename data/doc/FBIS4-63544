  [Text] [Announcer Igor Vykhukholev] INTERFAX has learned 
that a conference devoted to the political situation in the 
Crimea began in the Kiev office of President Leonid Kravchuk at 
about 1500 hours Moscow time [1100 GMT]. The Ukrainian 
parliament is expected to debate the same question at its 
evening session. The session will be addressed by Leonid 
Kravchuk. It is likely to be closed to the press. According to 
reports from informed sources, the Ukrainian president has 
already sent the Supreme Soviet a draft decision in which the 
Ukrainian parliament will rescind the Crimean Supreme Soviet's 
decision to restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992.
