  [Text] Belgrade, 27 Jun (TANJUG) -- A group of 260 Serbs 
from Zenica crossed to the territory of the republic of Srpska 
at border crossing in Cekrcici around 2030 this evening. The 
convoy was delayed eight hours because, as the released Serbs 
from Zenica said, the Muslim soldiers redirected the vehicles 
from the main road to travel through the Lasva river canyon 
where the Serbian civilians were maltreated and robbed. 
Following a short breather in Ilijas, as SRNA news agency has 
reported, the Serbian civilians around 2200 set off in vehicles 
of Canadian UNPROFOR battalion towards a reception centre in 
Sokolac.
