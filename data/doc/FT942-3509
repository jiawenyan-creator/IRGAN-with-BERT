deal
MBf Holdings, the diversified Malaysian conglomerate which is one of the
country's biggest stock market listed companies, has purchased the Papua New
Guinea based WR Carpenter group for MDollars 151m (Dollars 58m) in cash.
WR Carpenter and its associate companies are a long established group whose
activities include motor vehicle distribution, shipping, transport and
financial services in the South Pacific region.
MBf is making the purchase through its wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary,
MBf Asia Capital Corporation Holdings (MACCH).
MBf describes itself as Malaysia's biggest finance company.
It is widely expected that MBf will seek an international listing for its
MACCH subsidiary later this year, possibly in New York.
