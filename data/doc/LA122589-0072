WOMAN JUST BOOKED INTO JAIL DIES 
A 25-year-old San Diego woman died at an El Cajon hospital early Sunday after 
she was found unconscious Saturday at the County Jail at Las Colinas. 
Cynthia Denise Floyd of the 300 block of South Melrae had been arrested at her 
apartment at 9 a.m. Saturday on misdemeanor warrants, San Diego Police Sgt. 
Chuck Curtis said. She was booked at the women's jail in Santee and was 
scheduled to be released on her own recognizance, Curtis said. 
Paramedics were called about 7:40 p.m. after Floyd was found lying on the floor 
of the jail's release room, where she had been sleeping. Police said she was 
taken to the AMI Valley Medical Center hospital in El Cajon and died there at 
5:19 a.m. Sunday. 
An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of death.
