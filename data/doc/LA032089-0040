CBS FAMILY COMEDIES: RELATIVELY FEW LAUGHS 
Two comedies premiere back-to-back on CBS tonight (Channels 2 and 8). Neither 
is funny. 
"Live-In" (at 8 p.m.) finds pretty Australian Lisa Wells (Lisa Patrick) saying 
"G'day" as live-in help for the Mathews family of New Jersey. She's a 
mini-skirted nanny with a fanny, her assignment to care for the Mathews' infant 
daughter and elude the clutches of their older son Danny (Chris Young). 
Lisa gets mad when Danny and his friend (Lightfield Lewis) try to see Lisa in 
the nude. Then she gets mad when he tries to come on to her. Then he gets at 
her for rejecting him. This is dumb. 
G'bye. 
Following "Live-In" is "Heartland" (8:30 p.m.), which is CBS' answer to Fox's 
"Married . . . with Children," a sort of "Married . . . with Pigs." 
The setting is a Nebraska farm, home for Tom and Casey Stafford (Richard 
Gilliland and Kathleen Layman), their two sons (Jason Kristofer and Devin 
Ratray), adopted Vietnamese daughter (Daisy Keith) and Casey's father, B. L. 
McCutcheon (Brian Keith, in his seventh series). 
On the premiere, a tornado sends them all into the cellar for safety. The scene 
begins promisingly, but the family survives. 
B.L. is crusty, but yessssssss, lovable -- one of them-thar' lovable bigots. At 
least he looks like he belongs on a farm, compared with the rest of the family, 
who look like they're dressed up as farmers for a costume party. 
This is TV's new class -- the rural hip. Despite their words ("We got a big day 
tomorrow, boys. We gotta finish cuttin' that wheat"), you can't imagine these 
people with dirt under their nails or straw under their feet. 
The funniest thing about the opener is unintentional -- a scene where seven 
people (the family and a visitor) sit squeezed together around only half of the 
round kitchen table, leaving the other half open so that the camera will have a 
clear view of everyone from the front. 
Farm folk -- Hollywood style.
