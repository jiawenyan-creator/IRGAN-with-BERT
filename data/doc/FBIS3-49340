  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Immediately after the meeting 
of Visegrad defense ministers ended in Warsaw today, Slovak 
Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak gave an interview to our 
colleague Jozef Hybel. 
  [Begin recording] [Hybel] Minister, how satisfied are you 
with the outcome of the Visegrad defense ministers' meeting? 
  [Andrejcak] I am naturally satisfied. We agreed that all 
four 
countries would prefer to become NATO member countries 
immediately. All four countries will however accept the 
partnership for peace program. I am glad that our president is 
seeking a way that will enable us to become a member soon, at 
least in the political aspect. If we cannot realize the first 
aspect, let us hope that this idea of his will speed up our 
acceptance as a full member. 
  In addition, we agreed that we will continue all areas the 
original Visegrad countries set before themselves toward 
cooperation, and I proposed that, after clarification by a NATO 
representatives with regard to what the partnership for peace in 
fact is, we would meet to consider how to coordinate our steps. 
  [Hybel] Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia hold very close views 
on their future membership of NATO. The Czech Republic's view is 
however somewhat different. How do you view the endeavors of the 
Czech Republic? 
  [Andrejcak] Through its first deputy defense minister, the 
Czech Republic presented two variants. I believe that we cannot 
reproach them for this, as such an opportunity also exists for 
us. The other thing is that prevalent among the countries at 
this moment is the idea that they will be able to gain entry 
more speedily into NATO as individuals. I believe that life 
itself will show that cooperation is in the end a faster course 
than individual steps. They have not, however, rejected such 
cooperation. 
  [Hybel] Do you think that Slovakia is today prepared for 
entry into NATO? 
  [Andrejcak] I have not encountered a view that would assess 
our armed forces as being less capable than any other. However, 
this matter has another aspect. It is the member countries who 
make the choice. It therefore depends on their view and not on 
mine or that of our politicians. 
  [Hybel] How do you see the fact that Western politicians 
frequently forget to name Slovakia when there is talk about 
letting Central European countries into NATO? 
  [Andrejcak] Naturally, as with every Slovak, I bear this 
with 
difficulty. Nonetheless, let us remember that we have not yet 
succeeded in presenting ourselves to the world, so not everyone 
feels compelled to talk continuously about Slovakia. We must 
promote ourselves to ensure that everyone knows about us and 
that their knowledge of us is so strong that they do not forget 
us. [end recording]
