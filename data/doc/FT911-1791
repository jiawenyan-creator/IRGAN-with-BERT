FT  03 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Lucas wins Pounds 25m US harpoon missile
contract
LUCAS, the international engineering group based in the West Midlands of the
UK, has extended its penetration of the US defence market with a contract to
supply harpoon missile capsules worth at least Pounds 25m over the next five
years.
The defence fabrications division of Lucas Aerospace won the contract from
McDonnell Douglas Missile Systems. It becomes the sole supplier of the
capsules. Previously it had provided a portion of McDonnell Douglas's needs.
The capsule, which contains electronic recording and monitoring devices,
protects a missile as it launched from a submarine and is jettisoned once
the missile breaks through the surface of the water.
Work on the contract will be done at the Lucas Aerospace plant in Burnley,
Lancashire. The company is the biggest employer in the town, but has been
reducing the size of its workforce because of the recession.
