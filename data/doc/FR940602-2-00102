 




<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(``CERCLA'')</DOCTITLE>




In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed consent decree in 

United States 

v.

 Apache Energy  Minerals Co., et al.,

 Civil Action No. 86C1675, concerning the California Gulch Superfund Site in and near Leadville, Colorado
(the ``Site'') was lodged on May 16, 1994 with the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The proposed
consent decree is between the United States and the State of Colorado, as plaintiffs and counter-defendants (collectively
the ``governments''), and defendants and counter-plaintiffs ASARCO Incorporated (``ASARCO''), Resurrection
Mining Company (``Resurrection''), Newmont Mining Corporation (``Newmont''), and the Res-ASARCO Joint Venture
(``Res-ASARCO'') (collectively the ``Settling Defendants'').


The decree provides for the reimbursement of the response costs incurred by the United States between February, 1991
and July, 1993, and the response costs incurred by the State of Colorado between February 1992 and July, 1993, from
Res-ASARCO in the combined amount of $7.6 million (the claims against the Settling Defendants for the governments'
response costs prior to these time periods having been previously addressed in a prior partial consent decree), and
the reimbursement of the governments' future response costs incurred at the Site after July, 1993 from ASARCO and
Resurrection in proportion to their assigned ``work areas'' under the decree. The decree establishes a process by
which ASARCO and Resurrection will perform and pay for the clean-up of assigned ``work areas'' within the Site which
are defined in the decree. In exchange for their commitments under the decree, the Settling Defendants are released
from any alleged liability at those portions of the Site outside their respective ``work areas,'' subject to specific
exclusions from the decree which are reserved for resolution at a later date.


The decree also resolves the counterclaims of the Settling Defendants against the governments, and the alleged liability
of the United States and the State at the Site, subject to the same exclusions applicable to the Settling Defendants
(plus one additional exclusion applicable to the United States), on a cash basis. Under the terms of the decree, the
United States will pay $6.1 million to ASARCO from the Judgment Fund plus an additional amount, not to exceed $4.05
million, equal to 15% of ASARCO's costs of implementing certain work under the decree if ASARCO's costs exceed $23
million. The State of Colorado will pay ASARCO a lump sum payment of $271,250.


The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment
and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to
