BRIEFLY 
Regulation for Traders to Be Proposed: Responding to charges of cheating in 
U.S. futures pits, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said 
the agency will propose a bill by July 1 to require all traders to register 
with federal authorities. In a letter to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman 
Patrick Leahy, CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm said the agency will also propose 
regulatory changes in trade monitoring standards and dual trading by September 
if those changes are warranted. Some critics say exchanges, now required to 
keep track of all trades to the nearest minute, should be required to tighten 
the standard, called the audit trail, to prevent unscrupulous traders from 
cheating.
