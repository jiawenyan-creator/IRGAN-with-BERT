FT  14 DEC 94 / Green light for Swiss brothel
Zurich's building and planning department has issued a permit to an
entrepreneur to operate a brothel in the city. If no objections are filed
within 20 days the Eros Centre, with its 12 apartments, could be operating
by summer. Despite concern, the application complied with building use
regulations and the building, under a motorway, has few neighbours likely to
complain.
