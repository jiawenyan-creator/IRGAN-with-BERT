BRIEFLY 
United Flight Attendants Vote to Strike: Flight attendants at United Airlines 
have overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike, the Assn. of Flight Attendants 
said. However, negotiations between the union and United are under the 
supervision of a federal mediator who would have to declare an impasse and 
order a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike could be called. The 
negotiations are in recess. The union represents about 13,500 United attendants 
and has been negotiating with the carrier for nearly two years.
