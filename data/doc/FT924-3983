FT  04 DEC 92 / Roman road to privatisation: The Italian government faces a
bruising battle as parliament begins debate on its sell-off proposals
Italy is on the verge of its biggest public-sector shake-up since the 1930s,
when Mussolini first gave the state a dominant role in economic development.
The government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato is planning the largest and
most concentrated sell-off ever proposed in continental Europe. Over the
next three years privatisation is expected to raise almost L40,000bn (Pounds
18.6bn). The figure could be higher if the planned sale of the state's
property portfolio gets going soon, alongside a determined effort to clean
up local government finances via the privatisation of many municipal
services.
'Privatisation on this scale is like pulling away the central stone in the
whole postwar politico-economic edifice,' observed one official involved in
the privatisation programme. 'The political parties have relied on a large
public sector to provide thousands of jobs, especially in the south,' he
added. State control of the economy has been a central element in permitting
the political parties to trade patronage in return for votes, and run the
public sector with political rather than economic objectives.
The privatisation process will begin with a radical reduction in the state's
two-thirds control of the banking and financial system, especially that part
owned by IRI, the giant state holding company. Within five years IRI, which
generates 5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, could cease to
exist, having sold off its assets or turned its subsidiaries independent.
Sectors previously regarded as strategic and closed to private investment -
including Alitalia, the national airline, ENEL, the electricity authority,
and ENI, the state oil concern - will be partly sold off. Loss-making state
activities in fertilisers, chemicals and ship-building are threatened with
closure if no buyers can be found.
Those with most to lose in the privatisation process are at the core of the
present four-party coalition: the long-ruling Christian Democrats and
Socialists. They are being asked to commit a form of hara-kiri since
patronage has been the main element of their traditional power.
But privatisation also represents a challenge to business and industry in
four main areas:
Italy needs to create more large-scale companies. The strong state presence
throughout the economy has prevented the proliferation of large industrial
groups, which can compete internationally. Only four private groups employ
more than 30,000 people (Fiat, Ferruzzi-Montedison, Olivetti and Pirelli),
an exceptionally small number for the world's fifth industrial power.
Italy must drop its long-standing mistrust of foreign capital if
privatisation is to succeed. No other EC member has maintained such strong
barriers against the entry of foreign capital. Domestic investment at best
can cover only half the amount expected to be raised by privatisation.
A revolution has to occur in Italian savings habits. A combination of
security, high returns and anonymity for the investor has made Treasury
paper the most attractive savings instrument for both the rich and the small
saver. The high demand for Treasury bills (Bots) and the risks of investing
on the bourse have restricted the Milan stock exchange. Trading volume in
relation to gross domestic product is half that of France and a quarter that
of the UK. The so-called Bot-people have to be persuaded to jump ship and
put their money into the shares of privatised companies. Equally, the
public-sector deficit has to be cut to lessen the Treasury's need to produce
such seductive borrowing instruments.
Job security and high redundancy payments conceded by successive governments
to a powerful trade union movement must make way for a more flexible labour
policy. Otherwise the much-needed rationalisation of the workforces in the
companies due to be privatised cannot take place. The unions talk of 150,000
jobs being at risk; depressed regions such as Sardinia and Sicily are likely
to be among the worst affected.
The proposals on privatisation, which parliament began to debate this week,
address all these issues, although the government's intentions regarding job
losses and plant closures remain ambiguous. The programme  - set forth in a
107-page outline, a Treasury green book and four volumes of appendices
running to 2,000 pages - has been prepared in three months. This was an
extraordinary achievement by the dilatory standards of Italian government,
especially since the Treasury has been at the centre of preparing the 1993
budget and coping with the currency problems.
Parliament has undertaken to formulate a response by December 16. The
response will not be binding, since the proposals are consultative; but the
coalition could be brought down if it tried to go it alone in the face of
strong parliamentary opposition from those who see the privatisation
programme as a vote-loser.
'It is going to be a tough battle,' observes Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury
minister.
In preparation for this battle, Mr Amato has subtly moved the goalposts  -
not once but several times. He began his five-month-long game of political
survival by persuading the politicians that Italy's international
credibility and the stability of the lira depended on their endorsement of
an emergency budget. Next he said credibility rested on their approval for
the 1993 budget and their support for structural reform of pensions, public
health, the civil service and local government. Now his message is that
privatisation is the only way to rescue the disastrous state of Italy's
public finances, and thus it is necessary to the country's continued
credibility. He also warns that failure to back the plan could force the
resignation of the government, lead to a collapse of the lira and raise the
spectre of hyper-inflation.
The underlying goals of privatisation are to increase competitivity, end
subsidies, raise cash and broaden the scope of private ownership. However,
the government believes the state should retain control in areas such as
energy and advanced technology, which require long lead times on investment,
or where strong socio-economic considerations in depressed areas prevail.
For instance, IRI's Finmeccanica is set to become a publicly quoted company
with a controlling state stake to guarantee Italy has a presence in advanced
engineering and information technology.
In practice, necessity is the overriding philosophy. The immediate cash
requirements of the Treasury and the deteriorating financial health of most
state-run enterprises have made raising money paramount. Despite
unprecedented austerity measures, the budget deficit next year will be more
than 11 per cent of GDP - nearly triple the European Community average. Even
if the EC permitted state funding of loss-making industries and continued
high subsidies, the state cannot add to Italy's accumulated debt, equivalent
to 104 per cent of GDP. Meanwhile, the combined debts of those companies
targeted for privatisation or rationalisation amount to L140,000bn.
Divestiture will begin with banking and financial assets which offer high
returns and require the least preparation to sell. The previous Andreotti
government made tentative steps in privatising this sector. Crediop, the
Treasury-controlled long-term lending bank, was sold earlier this year for
L2,100bn to San Paolo di Torino, one of Italy's largest banks, and the
Treasury's 50 per cent stake in IMI, the financial services group, is due to
be sold for L4,000bn, principally to Cariplo, the Milan savings bank.
The Amato government, in contrast to its predecessor, has made a stronger
commitment to banking's privatisation, deciding that the state should no
longer dominate the sector. It has paved the way for a broader sell-off by
converting IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA, the insurance institute, into publicly
quoted companies owned by the Treasury.
The initial proposal, put forward in July by Mr Guiseppe Guarino, the
industry minister, was to reorganise state assets into two 'super-holdings'
 -one involving financial assets, the other industrial and energy assets -
as a preliminary step toward privatisation. This approach was quickly
dropped as being financially clumsy.
The government has since clarified its ideas and pushed Mr Guarino to the
sidelines. In the case of IRI, the holding will keep the proceeds and the
responsibility rests on the management to raise funds. No formal limit has
been fixed on the dilution of state control in any company. Pending
parliamentary advice, the process will be monitored either by a special
commissioner or a four-person technical commission.
INA will be sold off soon as possible. Its sale would unravel many of the
incestuous links within the old system. IRI, for instance, rents its Rome
headquarters from INA at a cheap rate; INA has an 18 per cent stake in Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro, the Treasury-controlled commercial bank, and is
reluctant to contribute to the L2,500bn to L3,000bn of new capital required
by BNL in the wake of Iraqi loans scandal at its Atlanta branch.
The commercial banks in IRI's portfolio - Credito (67 per cent-owned), Comit
(55 per cent) and Banca di Roma (35 per cent) - will be sold off in two
years. With debts of L70,000bn and projected 1992 losses of at least
L2,000bn, IRI is expected to proceed with the immediate sell-off of
companies in SME, its foodstuffs, manufacturing and distribution
conglomerate, plus parts of its telecommunications business. At the other
end of the scale, IRI must find ways to cut losses in steel (ILVA), civil
engineering (Iritecna) and shipbuilding (Fincantieri). IRI will retain the
proceeds from any asset sales.
All proceeds from non-IRI asset sales are due to go to the Treasury, raising
L27,000bn in the next three years. ENI is expected to sell non-core business
such as Agip coal, Nuovo Pignone, the turbines company whose planned
privatisation was announced in September, and parts of its chemicals
interests. Strategic assets such as Agip's oil operations are to be floated
on the bourse. ENEL, much eyed by foreign investors, has been given up to
two years to prepare for flotation, largely because electricity tariffs are
currently frozen.
These are ambitious plans at a time of recession, a free-floating lira and
international financial uncertainty. The political establishment may well
endorse the privatisation programme, though the programme itself is likely
to move more slowly than projected. But the government risks seeing the most
profitable state companies moving into the private sector, while it becomes
saddled with the loss-makers.
