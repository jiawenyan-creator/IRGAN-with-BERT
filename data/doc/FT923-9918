FT  01 AUG 92 / Olympic News In Brief: Stich eliminated
German Michael Stich became the fifth men's seed eliminated from the Olympic
tennis when he lost to countryman Carl-Uwe Steeb 6-4 6-2 4-6 6-3 in a
baseline battle played in an on-court temperature of 45'.
Stich, who won the Wimbledon title last year, was seeded eighth in the
64-player tournament.
'That was a very poor performance. Charly didn't win the match, I just kept
on giving away breaks,' said Stich.
In another second-round match, No. 5 seed Conchita Martinez helped Spain
remain unbeaten by upcoming Sandra Cecchini of Italy, 6-4, 6-3.
