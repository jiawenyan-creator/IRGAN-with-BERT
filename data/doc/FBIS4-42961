  [Text] Ottawa, June 6 (CNA) -- Overseas Chinese Affairs 
Commission Chairman Chang Hsiao-yen arrived in Ottawa to a warm 
welcome Monday [6 June], the first cabinet minister of the 
Republic of China [ROC] to visit the capital city since Canada 
and Taiwan severed official ties in the early 1970's. Chang, 
who arrived from Vancouver where he attended the annual meeting 
of Overseas Chinese community leaders in North America, said he 
could feel the marked improvement in relations between Canada 
and the ROC. He had visited Ottawa in 1990 as chief of the 
ruling Kuomintang's Overseas Operations Department. After 
receiving flowers from ethnic Chinese representatives, he told 
reporters at the airport VIP lounge that in addition to meeting 
with Overseas Chinese in Ottawa, he will also call on some 
members of Parliament of Canada during his two-day stay. Chang 
will then proceed to Montreal and Toronto, two eastern Canada 
metropolises with large Chinese communities. As the top 
official in charge of Overseas Chinese affairs, he will seek 
their input and help resolve any problems. He recalled being 
welcomed by an 80-year-old Overseas Chinese carrying a walking 
stick, and expressed his deep appreciation for the love shown by 
Overseas Chinese toward the ROC founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen early 
in this century. "Chinese abroad are a growing source of power 
for our country," he said. "It's extremely important to pool 
their forces to serve our national goals." But he stressed 
that the ROC Government would not like to see its rivalry with 
the communist regime in Beijing "extended overseas."
