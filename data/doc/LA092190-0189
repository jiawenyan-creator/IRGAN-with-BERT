A'S MCGEE KEEPS EYE ON BATTING RACE 
Willie McGee admits he peeks. 
McGee leads the National League in hitting, but finds himself left out of the 
batting race, on the other side of the statistical fence in the American 
League. 
"I look," McGee said. "It's out there everywhere. You can't help but see it. 
I'm a fan too." 
McGee was plucked from the NL batting race on Aug. 29 when the St. Louis 
Cardinals traded him to Oakland for outfielder Felix Jose and two 
minor-leaguers. 
With enough NL plate appearances to qualify as batting champion, McGee left 
behind Philadelphia's Len Dykstra with an unwavering .335 mark to shoot for. 
"Lenny is in a tough situation," McGee said. "But Lenny is a tough little 
player, and he's got a lot to look forward to with all he's got going for him. 
I wish him the best of luck. 
"But you have to remember there's Eddie Murray (of the Dodgers) and a couple of 
other guys. You hate to see this kind of thing happen, but it was out of my 
control." 
McGee has watched Dykstra, the NL's leading hitter most of the season, slide to 
second with a .330 average. Meanwhile, McGee is batting .280 in 82 at-bats with 
the A's; his cumulative average is .328, and he leads the majors in hits with 
191. 
The switch-hitting outfielder won the NL's Most Valuable Player award and the 
league's batting title in 1985. Winning a second batting title in absentia does 
not sit well with him. 
"It's not my choice," McGee said. "Even when I was over there I wasn't 
concerned about the batting race. I don't get caught up with that. I leave that 
to the fans."
