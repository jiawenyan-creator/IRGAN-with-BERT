FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sycamore's Pounds 1.7m financing deal to
proceed
Sycamore, the laboratory, office and garden furniture manufacturer, said the
principal parties had agreed, with some amendments, to go ahead with the
financing package announced in August.
The deal involves the issue of Pounds 1.7m convertible loan stock. Royal
Bank of Scotland and Tufton Capital, a corporate recovery specialist, who
have agreed to subscribe to the new stock, will make the funds available to
Deanes Furniture, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sycamore, which will make
advances to its parent.
Part of the long-term finance will be a secured loan and the balance a
convertible loan which will enable holders to convert into 80 per cent of
the enlarged capital of the company or, in certain circumstances, Deanes.
Shareholders will not be invited to subscribe new capital at this stage.
They will be given the opportunity to subscribe to new shares after the
interim results for the year to March 30 1996 are released.
