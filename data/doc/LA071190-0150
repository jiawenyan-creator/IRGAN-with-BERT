P.M. BRIEFING; 
IMF PRODS EAST BLOC ON REFORM 
The head of the International Monetary Fund today urged East European countries 
to move quickly toward market economies. 
Warning against half-measures in Eastern Europe, IMF Managing Director Michel 
Camdessus stressed that market reform programs must be introduced as rapidly as 
possible and must be as general as possible for them to succeed. 
"You can't take a little liberalization of prices, a little autonomy of 
enterprises . . . a little less state regulation, because that doesn't work," 
he said. 
He also emphasized the need for a "social safety net" to cushion the impact of 
the reforms on vulnerable sectors of the population. 
"The passage to a market economy does not create poverty, but it reveals it," 
he said. "The characteristics of a centralized economy are unemployment and 
inflation in waiting. When you liberalize prices . . . these increase."
