Final rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 18 Standard
Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Fayette County Airport has recently been developed. Controlled airspace
extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth is needed to contain Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) operations
at the airport. The operating status of the airport will change from Visual Flight Rule (VFR) to include IFR operations
concurrent with publication of the SIAP. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for
pilots.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History




On March 31, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 18 Standard Instrument Approach
Procedure (SIAP) was developed for the Fayette County Airport at Somerville, Tennessee (59 FR 15136). The proposal
was to add controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain IFR operations in controlled
airspace and to change the operating status of the airport from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent
with the publication of the SIAP. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by
submitting written comments on the proposal to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). No comments objecting
to the proposal were received.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Designations for Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations established Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee,
to provide controlled airspace from 700 feet above the surface for aircraft executing an NDB SIAP into the Fayette
County Airport.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
