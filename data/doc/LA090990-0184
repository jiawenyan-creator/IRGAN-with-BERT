CANCELING EGYPT'S $7-BILLION DEFENSE DEBT 
The world should have the determination to tighten the encirclement of Hussein 
by these or similar efforts: 
 -- Somewhere in Egypt, now the beneficiary of $7-billion forgiveness of debt, 
there should be saboteurs capable of stopping the convoys moving vital suplies 
from Aqaba to Baghdad. 
 -- Somewhere in Saudi Arabia, including the absentee government of Kuwait, 
there must be Kuwaitis who, with minimal instruction, should be capable of 
returning to their homeland and sabotaging the Iraqi occupying forces. 
 -- Somewhere, in the rest of the world, Iraq's commercial planes should be 
seized in partial payment of their massive foreign debt, rather than allowing 
them to be used for blatant propaganda purposes as the only egress for European 
and American hostages. 
Man cannot live by negotiation alone.
