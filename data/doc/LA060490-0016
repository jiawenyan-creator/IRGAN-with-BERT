SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
A fight between two women at the South Mission Beach jetty shortly before 6 
p.m. Sunday resulted in a crowd of spectators throwing rocks, bottles and beer 
cans at police officers who attempted to pull the combatants apart, police 
spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
About 80 officers responded to radio calls for assistance and eventually 
dispersed the rowdy crowd, Cohen said. 
Jeffery Robertson, 20, was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer 
and a second person was given a misdemeanor citation for having a beer bottle 
on a public beach, Cohen said. 
Cohen said two police officers sustained minor injuries and a windshield on a 
police car was broken.
