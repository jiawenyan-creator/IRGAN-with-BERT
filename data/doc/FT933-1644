FT  23 SEP 93 / Iraq frees three after Swedish king's plea
IRAQ yesterday unexpectedly freed three Swedes who were among at least 10
foreign nationals held in Iraqi jails for entering the country illegally.
Their release came after a letter from King Carl Gustaf, calling on Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein to free the men, was delivered in Baghdad.
The three were arrested on September 3 last year after straying across the
border from Kuwait where they were working for Ericsson, the Swedish
telecommunications company, on a contract for the Kuwaiti government to
repair radio base stations. They were given seven-year jail terms.
Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, welcomed news of their release.
Sweden has supplied three tranches of humanitarian aid to Iraq since the men
were arrested. The latest, worth SKr50m (Pounds 4m), was announced in June.
But Sweden's only diplomatic presence in Baghdad since last September has
been two officials working on the case of the Ericsson men.
The release of the three - Mr Stefan Wihlborg, Mr Leif Westberg and Mr
Christer Stromgren - will raise hopes for the other foreigners held on
similar charges, including three Britons.
Ericsson said the three Swedes were treated well during their imprisonment.
