  [Text] (ANSA) Fiuggi, April 12 -- Silvio Berlusconi, the 
media magnate whose new Forza Italia movement emerged victorious 
from the March 27-28 elections at the head of alliances with the 
autonomist Northern League and the neofascist National Alliance, 
today indicated that his interpretation of the League's 
federalist platform would not require changes to Italy's 
existing Constitution. 
  Reiterating his willingness to look at ways of satisfying 
the 
League's ardently federalist urges, the probable premier said 
that "federalism is a word that can have many meanings." 
  "We believe that you have to move towards decentralisation, 
not only in the fiscal field. But we also believe that these 
indications are already present in the Constitution and that the 
Constitution must be completely enacted in this direction." 
  The latest, unofficial version of the League's federalist 
vision, propounded by radical cantonisation theorist Gianfranco 
Miglio, envisages splitting Italy into eight "macroregions" 
providing members for a house of parliament; their locally 
elected governors would also run the country alongside a premier 
elected directly by the people. 
  This would entail an overhaul of the Italian Constitution 
that other political forces say cannot be pushed through by 
government fiat, even if there is a pledge to ratify the results 
by referendum. 
  So far there has been no official response from the League's 
future government partners, other than the National Alliance's 
approval for a directly elected premier. 
  Berlusconi in the past has hinted that a commission of 
experts could be set up to examine German, U.S. or even Spanish 
federalist models, with the final word resting with the Italian 
people, by referendum.
