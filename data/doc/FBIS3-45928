Chinese college students provided special services at China's 15

day of China's annual rail transport strain during the Spring 
Festival period. 
  Their voluntary services included cleaning station 
facilities, serving passengers and assisting the old and the

and middle school voluntary student activities being launched by

  The official said that middle school students' voluntary 
activities, lasting from January 31 to February 15, will provide
