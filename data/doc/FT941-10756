FT  08 FEB 94 / Management (The Growing Business): UK bank support for
franchising - In a Nutshell
European companies seeking bank support for franchising operations are

Elsewhere, banks have a poor knowledge of franchising and little interest in
developing its potential.
The study* is by Professor John Stanworth of the University of Westminster
and Peter Stern, franchise manager at NatWest Bank.
