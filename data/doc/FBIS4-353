  [Text] Bujumbura, 8 Apr (AFP) -- Fighting with heavy 
weapons continued in Kigali this morning, notably in the 
district where the former Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front 
movement's contingent is based, according to a Rwandan reporter. 
According to telephone reports received in Bujumbura, capital 
of neighboring Burundi, soldiers of the Rwandan Presidential 
Guard, who are almost exclusively Hutus, and Hutu militiamen, 
have killed several Tutsi tribesmen and burned down their 
houses. According to officially unconfirmed reports, several 
ministers and opposition party members who were kidnapped 
yesterday by soldiers of the Presidential Guard have been 
assassinated. It was not possible to establish telephone 
contact with Rwanda this morning from any country other than 
Burundi.
