FT  07 SEP 94 / Observer: A taxing Olympian task
Among the aristocrats, military generals and multi-millionaires who grace
the International Olympic Committee, Craig Reedie, a Glaswegian independent
financial adviser, constitutes a breath of fresh air.
Better known to sportsmen as the chairman of the British Olympic
Association, Reedie has just beaten runner-turned-MP Sebastian Coe to become
the second Briton on the IOC (alongside the Princess Royal), replacing Dame
Mary Glen Haig.
A law graduate from Glasgow University, Reedie has still been spending most
of his time working for DL Bloomer &amp; Partners, the firm he joined nearly 30
years ago, where he is now the partner flogging pension plans.
But his IOC election is good news not solely because it means one persuasive
salesman with less time to spend on your doorstep. More than most, he has
been sensitive to the fragmentation of British sports administration. With
his hugely enhanced kudos, he can surely win a more powerful role for the
BOA.
