READERS REACT: TAKING ISSUE WITH TIMES' STANDS; 
NOTE: MANY LETTERS WRITERS SUPPORT OUR VIEWS; MANY DO NOT. IN THE SPIRIT OF 
VIGOROUS DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES, HERE IS A SELECTION OF LETTERS THAT 
DISAGREES WITH US.; 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES: PROPS. 128, 130, 138 
According to my sample ballot, Prop. 130 wins the prize for the highest cost 
bond issue. 
The total is $1,327,000,000! 
For the $1.3 billion, Prop. 130 proposes to buy 3,000 acres of something called 
the "Headwaters Forest." It would be outrageous to allow Earth First! (one of 
the sponsors of Prop. 130) to siphon off this many taxpayer dollars for its 
selfish purposes when there are so many unmet needs in our society.
