CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
GARDENS; 
WEDDINGS AND WANDERINGS 
STARTED in 1920 and completed in the '40s, the adobe house at Orcutt Ranch is 
now a popular site for weddings. But it's the small botanical garden -- eight 
acres of an eclectic mix of monkey puzzle, bamboo, huge ancient live oak (one 
is 700 years old, another a teen-ager of 350) and sycamore trees, winding 
paths, a creek, stone otter gargoyles and a grassy picnic area -- that's the 
real treat. Historical tours are conducted on the last Sunday of each month 
between 2 and 5 p.m.
