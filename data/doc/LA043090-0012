ABANDONED CHILDREN 
Regarding the April 14 article on the abandoned children, "Cast-Off Babies on 
the Rise in the County," why is the Department Children's Services spending any 
of its valuable time looking for people who don't want their children and who 
have made that quite clear? Go look for some good adoptive parents, and 
quickly. 
Running cute little mug shots of these waifs and pleading for their mothers to 
reconsider reminds me more of a Hollywood movie of the 1930s than the reality 
of Los Angeles in the '90s. 
We're not talking about poor but impeccably dressed Constance Bennett leaving 
her beloved child with nuns at the convent. We're talking about abuse, drugs, 
poverty, foster homes and, possibly, death at an early age. We're talking about 
leaving kids in dumpsters. 
It's going to get worse. It's time to sever parental rights and save these 
kids.
