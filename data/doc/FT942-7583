FT  25 MAY 94 / Polly Peck auditor faces investigation
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's highest
regulatory body, yesterday formally announced an inquiry into Polly Peck
International, the collapsed conglomerate formerly controlled by Mr Asil
Nadir.
The scheme will examine the professional and business conduct, efficiency
and competence of Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm which was auditor to
Polly Peck.
It said it would also examine the work of members of the UK professional
accountancy bodies belonging to Erdal, an accountancy firm based in Cyprus
which audited Polly Peck's local subsidiaries, and any members of the bodies
involved or engaged in the management of Polly Peck.
It said Mr Michael Chance, the executive counsel of the scheme, would
investigate the case and decide whether there were grounds for a complaint,
which would lead to a disciplinary tribunal.
