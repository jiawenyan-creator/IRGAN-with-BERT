FIBREBOARD WINS $6.1-MILLION LAWSUIT AGAINST CHUBB UNIT 
In one of California's longest and costliest civil trials, a state jury has 
decided that an affiliate of Chubb Co. must pay Fibreboard Corp. $6.1 million 
to cover asbestos-related legal costs. 
Concord, Calif.-based Fibreboard, a lumber and insulation company, said Monday 
that a San Francisco Superior Court made the award in the lawsuit late Sunday 
against Pacific Indemnity Co. 
Fibreboard, which manufactured asbestos-containing insulation products until 
1972, said it has been hit with over 75,000 personal injury claims related to 
asbestos. Inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer and other serious 
illnesses. 
Fibreboard has been involved in a long-running battle with the insurance 
companies that had issued coverage to it over the years. Fibreboard said most 
of the insurers have previously settled the company's claims.
