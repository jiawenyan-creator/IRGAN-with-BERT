FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: NWA seeks funds with jet
leaseback deal
NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, is seeking to raise Dollars 700m to
Dollars 900m in debt through bond financing and sale of assets, a source
familiar with the plans said, Reuter reports from Chicago.
The bulk of the funds, roughly Dollars 600m to Dollars 700m, would flow from
the sale of 27 wide-body jets to investors that would be leased back, the
source said. The aircraft are collateral for bank loans, and lenders would
have to agree to the sale.
A further Dollars 200m would come from bond financing.
The company's plans call for selling the jets to a special subsidiary that
would raise cash backed by debt secured by the aircraft.
The 27 aircraft tagged for sale have a market value of about Dollars 1bn.
