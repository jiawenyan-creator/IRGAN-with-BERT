LOG ALL HUD CALLS, FORMER SENATOR URGES 
Top officials in the Department of Housing and Urban Development should have to 
keep a log of every visitor and telephone call as a means of discouraging 
influence-peddling that pervaded the agency, a former senator proposed today. 
"Some will say that requiring such reports as a matter of law is too 
burdensome, is an interference with privacy or is micromanaging," former Sen. 
William Proxmire (D-Wis.) told a House panel. "Keep in mind these are public 
officials. They are on the public payroll. They are dealing with hundreds of 
millions of dollars of the public's money." 
Proxmire, who was chairman of a Senate subcommittee with responsibility for 
overseeing the department, acknowledged today that he was "chagrined that I had 
no idea what was going on at HUD" until congressional hearings began in recent 
months. 
Witnesses before the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and 
employment have said that HUD contracts worth millions of dollars were awarded 
on the basis of political influence. 
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who took office this year with a pledge to clean up 
the department, has estimated that the corruption has cost the government $2 
billion. 
Many of the deals now under investigation involved former HUD officials or 
well-connected Republicans who used their influence at the top levels of the 
agency to gain approval for projects in which they had some financial interest. 
Proxmire said his proposal, requiring reports on such meetings be given to 
Congress and the news media, would force HUD officials to make an immediate 
public accounting of their actions in the future. 
The subcommittee heard later today from Maurice Barksdale, a former HUD 
assistant secretary, and John Knapp, former general counsel to the department.
