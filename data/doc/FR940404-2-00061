Title: 

1994 Industrial Laundries Questionnaire (EPA No. 1685.01).



Abstract: 

This is a new information collection sponsored by the Office of Water in support of the development of technology-based
effluent limitations guidelines pursuant to the Clean Water Act. The development of effluent limitations for the
industrial laundries industry is required by court order to be proposed by 12/31/96. The questionnaire will be mandatory
pursuant to section 308 of the Clean Water Act.

The survey respondents will be randomly selected using the information gathered from the industrial laundries screener
survey (OMB Control No. 20400163). Respondents will be asked to complete a two-part questionnaire, providing
information that includes:

(1) Quality and type of items accepted by industrial laundries,

(2) Water use and waste characteristics,

(3) Current waste/wastewater treatment operations and waste minimization practices,

(4) Cost of industrial laundry operations and treatment capacity,

(5) Market characteristics for industrial laundry services,

(6) Financial information,

(7) The extent of facility operations unrelated to industrial laundering and the liquidation value of their industrial
laundering operations, and

(8) The number of facility employees. As a follow-up to the questionnaire, a subset of respondents will be requested
to provide last year's wastewater monitoring data.

EPA will use the information to develop effluent limitations guidelines and standards that reflect the best available
technology within economically achievable limitations and the best practicable control technology.



Burden Statement: 

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 85 hours per response for the two-part
questionnaire and an additional 2 hours per response for the subset of respondents providing monitoring data. This
includes time for reviewing instructions, gathering and compiling the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the questionnaires.



Respondents: 

Facilities engaged in industrial laundering in the United States such as hotels, hospitals, and prisons that accept
laundry from off-site.



Estimated Number of Respondents: 

250 industrial laundry facilities and 50 hotels, hospitals, or prisons.



Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent: 

1.



Frequency of Collection: 

One time.



Estimated Total Annual Burden On Respondents: 

25,000 hours.
