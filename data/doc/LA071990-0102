DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY SIGNS PORTER RANCH AUTHORIZATION 
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has quietly signed into law the authorization for 
the Porter Ranch project, the giant commercial and residential complex that he 
once sharply attacked. 
Bradley signed the ordinance authorizing the project, to be built in the hills 
above Chatsworth, on Monday. 
Bill Chandler, the mayor's press secretary, said Bradley gave the go-ahead 
because the aspects of it that he had objected to had been remedied. The Los 
Angeles City Council voted 14 to 0 July 10 in favor of the project. 
Bradley threatened in December to veto the 1,300-acre project, saying its 
provisions for public transit, low-income housing and recycling were 
inadequate. But within days, Bradley and Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents 
the area, agreed upon a series of amendments. 
Although its dimensions were unchanged by the compromise, the project's 
developer, Porter Ranch Development Co., agreed to set aside several hundred 
multifamily housing units for low-income residences, set up a privately funded 
public transit system and reduce the number of parking spaces. The developer 
also made provisions for trash recycling, composting and reuse of some waste 
water. 
When fully built over the next 20 years, the project will include 3,395 
residences and 6 million square feet of commercial space, providing 11,000 
housing units and 20,000 jobs.
