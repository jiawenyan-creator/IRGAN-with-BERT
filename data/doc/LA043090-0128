SHORT TAKES; 
BUILDING NAMED FOR BURL IVES 
Eastern Illinois University is honoring one of its dropouts, folk singer Burl 
Ives. 
The university named an art studio after the 81-year-old folk singer and actor, 
who enrolled at the college in 1929 but dropped out in his third year as his 
grades slipped. 
Ives said it felt good to be back at Eastern, despite not having a degree. He 
said he hoped that people who use the building will follow his example and go 
where their creativity takes them. After leaving college, Ives' wanderings as a 
hobo and as a troubadour took him through 46 states, and he memorized about 500 
folk songs.
