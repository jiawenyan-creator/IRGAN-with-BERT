BEST BETS: ENCHANTED EVENING 
Eight magicians will materialize in the Dorill B. Wright Cultural Center on 
Saturday, trying to prove the hand is indeed quicker than the eye. 
"An Evening of Magic" -- a two-hour magical revue -- will feature a full range 
of magical performance styles, such as classical magic, large illusions, comedy 
magic and mystical wizardry, including many surprises and special effects. 
Featured performers will be Jay Scott Berry and Christopher Broughton, both of 
Hollywood. Berry has entertained audiences worldwide and has performed at 
medieval castles in Scotland. Broughton won a recent international competition. 
The other magicians -- all of whom are members of Hollywood's famed Magic 
Castle -- are Christopher J. DePalma of Newbury Park, Paul Dwork of Camarillo 
and David Brown, Shirley Lorraine, Shawn McMaster and James Spencer, all of 
Ventura. 
The magical evening will benefit the Pleasant Valley Cooperative Preschool in 
Camarillo and the local assembly of the Society of American Magicians. 
Two performances are scheduled: a 2 p.m. matinee and a 7 p.m. showing. 
Tickets are $8 and available at the door or at Merlin's Mystical Emporium, 350 
N. Lantana St., Camarillo. The cultural center is at 575 Surfside Drive, Port 
Hueneme. Call 388-7669.
