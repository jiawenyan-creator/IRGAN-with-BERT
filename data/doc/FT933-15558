FT  08 JUL 93 / Daf receivers form components group
RECEIVERS at Leyland Daf have formed a new company to run the collapsed
Anglo-Dutch truckmaker's parts distribution arm - the last and potentially
most valuable operation still to find a buyer.
The formation of Multipart Distribution by Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch
McKillop, the Arthur Andersen joint receivers, helps clear the way for an
expected sale in about two months.
The operation is based in Chorley, Lancashire and employs about 350 people.
The receivers are holding talks with a number of parties, including a
management buy-out team. Unipart Group is understood to be one of at least
three other possible bidders.
Mr McKillop said: 'Although the eventual ownership of Multipart has still to
be decided, we believe it is important that the parts operation also makes a
fresh start and carries on trading as a company no longer in receivership.'
The business, which used to trade as Leyland Daf Parts, had a turnover of
Pounds 140m in its last year and has been described as making 'significant
profits'. Estimates of its value run as high as Pounds 100m.
Whoever buys the business will have contracts with the three newly formed
truck and van manufacturing companies, including Birmingham-based Leyland
Daf Vans.
