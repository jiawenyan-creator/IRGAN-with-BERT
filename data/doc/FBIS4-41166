  [Text] Brussels, 22 Jun--The heads of the foreign policy 
departments of Russia and the United States noted the importance 
of the work carried out by the contact group that is drafting 
proposals on the territorial demarcation in Bosnia. According 
to Warren Christopher, the group should meet again on 28 June. 
He declared Washington's willingness, if necessary, to hold an 
additional meeting at the ministerial level, attended by Russia, 
the United States, and five countries of the European Union. 
  Christopher said that the international community's 
influence 
on the parties to the conflict to prompt them to accept the 
peace proposals should be based on something like the "carrot 
and stick" principle. For his part, Andrey Kozyrev made it 
clear that work was proceeding within the contact group on a 
list of inducements and sanctions, for cases in which both of 
the antagonists did not agree to accept the settlement plan, or 
if just one of them proved to be uncompromising. 
  The ministers gave different answers to a question about 
abolishing sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro if the 
Bosnian sides agreed to the proposed plan. Kozyrev replied 
affirmatively, while Christopher said that it would depend on 
the contact group's recommendations.
