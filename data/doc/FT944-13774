FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: LMS buys shopping arcades
London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, has
acquired Arcadia, a private company with a portfolio of Victorian shopping
arcades.
LMS acquired an 80 per cent stake in Arcadia by providing Pounds 14.5m of
five year redeemable loan stock. The capital will clear Arcadia's bank
borrowings of about Pounds 10m and enable the purchase of further shopping
centres.
In exchange, Arcadia has taken over a Pounds 2m portfolio of four LMS retail
properties across the UK which are expected to be sold on.
Mr Robert Spier, LMS finance director, said: 'We were looking to expand our
retail interests, which are very much larger. Arcadia is going to stick to
this type of business, rather than going into big shopping centres.'
Arcadia was formed in 1988 to manage arcade properties in Cardiff, Walsall
and Stirling, with its revenue mainly deriving from independent retailers on
short-term leases or licences.
The remaining 20 per cent of Arcadia shares will be held by Mr Peter Smith,
who founded the company, and Mr Rod Pearson, former managing director of
Raglan Property Trust. Mr Nicholas Driver and Mr Robert Rayne, directors of
LMS, will join Arcadia's board.
LMS reported a 20 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.3m last
year. Its properties were valued at Pounds 379.8m.
