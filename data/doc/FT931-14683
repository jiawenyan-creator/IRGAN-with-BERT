FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead
Photo-Me International, the world's largest photo-booth manufacturer and
operator, is expected on Monday to report a marginal increase in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.7m to about Pounds 8.9m.
Analysts will be interested in the degree of increased competition in the UK
from overseas companies, and the performance of new products.
On Tuesday, Eurocamp, the camping holiday company floated in July 1991, is
forecast to reveal pre-tax profits for the year to October of about Pounds
9.4m, up from Pounds 8.2m. Lower interest payments, increased demand and
broader markets - especially Germany and the Netherlands - all lie behind
the rise.
Yorkshire Tyne-Tees, the merged ITV company, should announce pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 17.5m for the year to September, with two months included
from Tyne Tees. This would be a little below original estimates of about
Pounds 19m, but still a solid base to begin tackling its new franchise.
Anxiety about the preference dividend at Kunick, the fruit machines to
nursing homes group, seems set to prove unfounded at the announcement of the
annual results on Wednesday. Forecasts are for a pre-tax loss of about
Pounds 3.5m, after some Pounds 6m of exceptionals, against a profit of
Pounds 12.4m.
The seasonality of Park Food Group's main business (selling Christmas
hampers) means it regularly reports pre-tax losses at the interim stage. A
smaller first-half deficit is expected to be announced on Friday, down from
Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 4m.
