  [Text] Lagos, June 21 (AFP) -- The main Nigerian opposition 
group Tuesday [21 June] ruled out using military means to 
restore democracy to Nigeria, just over a year after the 
military annulled presidential elections here. 
  "We have no intentions whatsoever to seek the interaction or 
assistance of military action in our patriotic pursuit", the 
National Democratic Coalition said. 
  The recently-formed coalition, comprising politicians, 
former 
ministers, ex-state military governors and retired military 
officers, has called on the military ruler General Sani Abacha 
to hand over power to Yoruba politician Moshood Abiola. 
  Abiola was the widely accepted winner of the presidential 
elections, organised last June. The then military ruler Ibrahim 
Babangida banned the publication of the results. 
  The current military ruler, Abacha, took over in November. 
  The pro-democracy coalition has supported Abiola who earlier 
this month proclaimed himself head of a parallel government 
after breaking out of house arrest and going into hiding.
