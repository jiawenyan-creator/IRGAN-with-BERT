  [Text] Tbilisi, 10 Mar -- According to Iberia news agency, 
the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has circulated information, according to 
which Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan said at a news 
conference in Moscow: "Georgians must come to terms with the 
idea that they shall not have the gas which is sent from 
Turkmenistan for Armenia. The situation in connection with the 
Armenian minority in Georgia is becoming tense. Very soon the 
issue of Javakheti [south Georgia] will rise and it will assume 
the scale of the Karabakh conflict." 
  In this connection, Van Baiburt, chairman of the charity 
Society of Armenian Culture in the Republic of Georgia, and 
editor in chief of the `VRASTAN' newspaper, in conversation with 
an Iberia correspondent, has said that he is aware of the good 
will for Georgia cherished by Armenia's President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan and his colleagues, and that it enables us to 
assert that the statement published in the Russian mass media is 
yet another attempt by the third force to strain the relations 
between Armenia and Georgia. Van Baiburt also notes that the 
letter of protest sent by the Armenian foreign minister to the 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper is proof of this interference. 
  "A large part of the Armenian population knows very well 
that 
the Georgian authorities are not to blame for blocking the vital 
raw material to Armenia, although the Armenian opposition is 
over-suspicious and considers that it is being done 
intentionally, and is allegedly the result of a Georgian-Azeri 
alliance," said Van Baiburt. 
  According to Baiburt's opinion, the third force wishes to 
wage a conflict between Armenia and Georgia and therefore it is 
necessary to carry out a very smooth policy which completely 
contradicts deputy Tengiz Sigua's statement at a parliament 
session. 
  "Georgian and Armenian people are wise and will not be 
beguiled into these provocations," concluded Baiburt.
