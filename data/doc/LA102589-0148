P.M. BRIEFING; 
TRAVEL RUBLE DEVALUED TENFOLD 
The State Bank today announced a tenfold decrease in the value of the ruble 
against the dollar for people and firms needing convertible currency to travel 
abroad. 
The new rate, set at 6.26 rubles to the dollar, is a tacit admission by Soviet 
authorities that the ruble is not worth anything approaching the existing 
official rate of .6277 to the dollar. 
The announcement, reported by Tass press agency, indicated the standard rate 
will remain in effect for most transactions, such as for foreign firms doing 
business in the Soviet Union and for most international trade with the West. 
Because the ruble cannot be freely exchanged for dollars, yen, marks and other 
hard currencies, it has virtually no value outside the Soviet Union. 
Tass gave no explanation for the devaluation, and Igor Kozlovsky, deputy chief 
of the joint currency economics department of the Finance Ministry, refused to 
give more details on the decision. He would say only that it had been approved 
by the Council of Ministers.
