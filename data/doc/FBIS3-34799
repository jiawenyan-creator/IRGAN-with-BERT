  [Text] Khartoum, Feb 13 (AFP) -- Sudanese security 
authorities have arrested a fourth suspect in the assault on a 
mosque in which 16 people were killed and and 20 others wounded 
earlier this month, a newspaper report said Sunday [13 February]. 
  Two of the assailants were killed and two others were 
wounded 
and arrested in a shootout with security forces on February 5, 
the day after the massacre. 
  A Palestinian identified as Munir Khalil, had been arrested 
on the day of the attack at the Ansar Souna mosque in Omdurman, 
near here. 
  The AL SUDANI INTERNATIONAL daily Sunday reported that the 
fourth suspect, identified as Mohamed al-Mahi, a Sudanese, was 
arrested at Er-Roseiris in central Sudan and brought to Khartoum 
for interrogation. 
  Mahi told investigators that he left Khartoum the day before 
the attack because he was not convinced of the assassination 
operation despite his conviction of the teachings of his 
extremist group. 
  Mahi, according to the paper, confessed that they were 
planning to assassinate Sudanese Islamist leader Hassan Abdalla 
al-Turabi and that for this reason their ring-leader, Libyan 
Mohamed Abdalla al- Khilaifi (now under arrest in hospital) 
inspected the surroundings of Turabi's residence in preparation 
for carrying out the assassination.
