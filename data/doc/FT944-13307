FT  28 OCT 94 / Overseas forces to be cut
The US will end or reduce military operations at 27 more overseas
facilities, mostly in Germany, as a part of continuing post-cold war defence
cuts, the Pentagon said yesterday. The cuts are at 24 sites in Germany, two
at Lajes Field in Portugal's Azores islands and one at a radar site in
Iceland. The 21 closures and six reductions bring to 871 the number of US
installations in Europe where operations are being ended, reduced or placed
on stand-by status. The latest reductions will affect nearly 2,000 US
military personnel, 600 US civilian employees and 1,700 local workers.
