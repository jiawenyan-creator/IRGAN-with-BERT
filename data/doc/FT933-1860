FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Labour lays fresh claims of
'fascism'
A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT council leader was proposed for election by a known
activist for the extreme right, Labour claimed yesterday, calling on Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, to extend his inquiry into
'Liberal-fascist links across London,' David Owen writes.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, published a copy of a 1990
nomination paper signed by a Mr Gary Russell for Mr Colin Beadle, a Hackney
Liberal Democrat leader. Mr Russell was 'a known activist in the fascist -
and now defunct - National Front,' Mr Straw said.
Mr Ashdown has said expulsions would follow if the inquiry he has ordered
establishes that Liberal Democrats in the Tower Hamlets area of London had
used racist tactics.
Mr Beadle reacted furiously to Mr Straw's use of his name, while a spokesman
for the Liberal Democrats last night called the allegations 'total
nonsense'.
