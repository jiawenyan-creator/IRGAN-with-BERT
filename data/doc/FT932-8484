FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: S Korea wins Norwegian ship order
LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, yesterday announced it had
awarded a contract valued at Dollars 106m (Pounds 69.3m) to South Korea's
Hyundai Heavy Industries to build two car carriers for delivery in the
fourth quarter next year, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Hoegh said that the de-livered price of the carriers included interest and
other costs.
The contract includes an option for a third car carrier.
The shipowner said the carriers would replace two ships which had been sold.
The new ships can carry 6,100 cars and will have flexibility to use capacity
for high and/or heavy rolling stock.
