  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [16 February] the excessive volatility 
of foreign exchange rates is "undesirable." 
  Speaking at the House of Representatives plenary session, 
Hosokawa said, "it is a common view among the G-7 (Group of 
Seven) nations that foreign exchange rates should reflect the 
economic fundamentals of nations and that excessive exchange 
volatility is undesirable." 
  "We will act appropriately to ensure stability in the 
market," he said. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii also dismissed market 
speculation that the United States seeks to guide the yen higher 
to cut its trade surplus with Japan. 
  "The U.S. believes that currency markets should not be 
artificially manipulated. Their attitude has not changed," he 
said. 
  In the wake of the breakdown of bilateral "framework" trade 
talks, which fueled the speculation, the yen zoomed up by more 
than 6 yen during the first two days of the week, though caution 
over the high pace of the yen's advance pulled it back somewhat 
during Wednesday dealing.
