FT  19 FEB 93 / Dozens of railway charters expected
RAILWAY privatisation will lead to the publication of dozens of Passenger's
Charters as each train operator draws up its own version of the existing
British Rail charter, it emerged yesterday.
The government said franchisees operating state-subsidised services would
continue to compensate passengers for punctuality and reliability in much
the same way as BR does now.
