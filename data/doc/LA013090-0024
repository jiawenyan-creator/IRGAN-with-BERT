JAIL PROPOSAL 
In response to "Hard Heads and Tender Hearts for L.A." by Mark Ridley Thomas 
(Op-Ed Page, Jan. 15), I simply ask the question, where has this guy been? 
His reference to the community being duped on the proposed county jail for 
South-Central Los Angeles is slanderous to the community and speaks volumes 
about his lack of regard for people of South Los Angeles to reason and make 
intelligent decisions without his divine intervention. 
Either he is ill-advised, uninformed, not in line with the community he's 
supposed to serve or all of the aforementioned. 
For Mr. Ridley-Thomas' information, the 2,000-bed jail was and still is a 
legitimate proposal being studied by the county Board of Supervisors. The 
proposal in its current form is designed to be built in the middle of 
South-Central Los Angeles. The proposed jail will be built near elementary 
schools. The proposal requires 29 to 40 acres of vacant land that is not 
available in the community, therefore, condemnation would be necessary, which 
means people in the community would lose their homes. 
He should get involved with this issue and show some of that leadership he 
wrote about. It's not too late because, contrary to what he wrote in his 
article, the issue unfortunately is still very much alive!
