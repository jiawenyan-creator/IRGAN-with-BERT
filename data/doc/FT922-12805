FT  15 APR 92 / British Airways sues Virgin
BRITISH AIRWAYS is counter-suing its rival Virgin Atlantic, and its chairman
Mr Richard Branson, for libel over allegations that BA had used 'dirty
tricks' to win custom.
The move comes three weeks after Virgin began an action against BA for
alleged defamation. BA had asserted that the dirty tricks allegations were a
publicity stunt.
Explaining the decision to counter-sue, Mr Mervyn Walker, BA's legal
director, said: 'Virgin and Mr Branson have chosen to continue their
campaign against us by commencing legal proceedings. They have left us no
other choice.'
BA's decision followed within hours of Virgin's application for its case to
be listed for trial.
Mr Justice Drake said the listing should be on June 15, a decision which
each side claimed as a victory.
'Virgin failed in its application for a speedy trial,' said BA.
Virgin replied: 'That's not true. We applied for the earliest possible date
which was June 15.'
Both sides seem entrenched in their positions. BA is not prepared to
withdraw unless Virgin does so first. Virgin said that it needed an apology
and a recantation of alleged actions to damage Virgin.
It is understood that a trial would probably take place before the end of
July. BA said it would not apply for any postponement.
BA said yesterday that it had conducted an internal review to check whether
'some corner of the company' could be to blame for any orchestrated campaign
against Virgin. The review found nothing.
The company then decided to go ahead with the counter suit, which claims
that a letter dated December 11 last year, and circulated to some BA
directors and the press, was defamatory of BA.
'We have made it clear that those accusations are untrue,' said Mr Walker.
Talks between the two companies broke down in mid-March and have not
restarted.
