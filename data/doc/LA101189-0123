MOTORISTS IGNORE PLEA OF HIT-AND-RUN VICTIM 
A 32-year-old Laguna Hills woman, the victim of a hit-and-run accident on 
Interstate 5 in El Toro Monday night, said she stood on the freeway covered 
with blood and waved her arms at oncoming traffic for about 10 minutes but no 
passing motorist stopped to help. 
Cynthia Marcari said Tuesday that the accident occurred at 8:30 p.m. Monday 
while she was traveling north on Interstate 5 near the Lake Forest Drive exit. 
She said her pale yellow 1979 Alpha Romeo was struck from behind by a large 
truck and knocked across three lanes of traffic before it slammed into the 
central guardrail. 
After the shock of the collision wore off, Marcari said she looked around but 
saw no sign of the truck. 
"I got out of the car. I was covered with blood, I was screaming and nobody 
stopped," she said. "I was waving my arms." 
After about 10 minutes, a California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer stopped 
and summoned help, said Marcari, who underwent plastic surgery for facial cuts 
and a broken nose at Saddleback Hospital and Health Center in Laguna Hills. 
While Marcari was upset that no motorist stopped to help, Ken Daily, a 
spokesman for the CHP office in San Juan Capistrano, said drivers might not 
have been able to see that Marcari was hurt. 
"You're zipping along at 65 or 70 like most of them do, and you might not 
notice anything," Daily said. Because Marcari's car was facing oncoming 
traffic, Marcari would have been silhouetted against her car's headlights, 
making it difficult for drivers to see that she was bloodied, he said. 
A spokeswoman for the CHP in Santa Ana, which is handling the investigation, is 
asking any witnesses to the accident to call Officer Rocky Hamilton in the 
Santa Ana office at (714) 547-8311.
