  [Excerpt] As it is expected, the start of the first regular 
session of the Serbian Assembly tomorrow will be the sign for 
the election of the new republican government. Prime Minister 
Mirko Marjanovic will present his program to the deputies and 
propose the members of the government, on which a discussion 
will ensue. The deputies will vote for a prime minister and the 
members of the government, together and secretly, that is, 
unless the Assembly opts for public voting, of course. The 
government needs to obtain the votes of a simple majority of the 
total number of deputies in order to be elected. [passage 
omitted]
