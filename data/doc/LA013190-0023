ZOO SOCIETY CUTS ANIMAL DEALER TIES 
The San Diego Zoological Society has suspended relations with a Kansas animal 
dealer who said he took four endangered addax antelope from the San Diego Wild 
Animal Park to a Missouri auction in 1985. Zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said ties 
with Jim Fouts were severed in October because of "suspicions" that he did 
business with wild animal auctions. 
The San Diego Zoo and others nationwide condemn the sale or transfer of any 
animals to auctions, where some end up at private hunting farms whose clients 
pay to kill and mount the wildlife for trophies. Fouts confirmed to The Times 
that he took the four addax to an auction in Cape Girardeau, Mo. He said two of 
the animals were bought by a private collector and the others were sold to the 
highest bidder. Fouts also said he was unaware of the San Diego Zoo's decision 
to stop dealing with him.
