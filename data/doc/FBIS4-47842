  [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- For the first time since 1964 
a South African delegation has been allowed to take part in the 
international meeting of the World Health Organisation, the 
Department of National Health and Population Development said on 
Tuesday [3 May]. 
  The department said in a statement the delegation was in 
Geneva, Switzerland, where the World Health Assembly began 
meeting on Monday. Health officials from 187 countries are 
attending. 
  "At the opening of the assembly a resolution was submitted 
to 
immediately restore South Africa's voting privileges," said the

participation in the work of the WHO, ensured access to the 
WHO's resources and allowed South Africa to significantly 
contribute to regional public health initiatives.
