RIGHTS OF UNBORN 
Dr. Milos Klvana has been convicted of murder in the cases of eight babies and 
a fetus (Part A, Dec. 19). 
This fetus received equal treatment by the law as the full-term babies. 
If an obstetrician can be found guilty of murder under "implied malice" for the 
death of a fetus, what should the charge be for a doctor who takes the life of 
the fetus through abortion? The same -- murder. 
Our laws are grossly inconsistent regarding the legal rights of the unborn. All 
unborn children deserve equal protection under the law.
