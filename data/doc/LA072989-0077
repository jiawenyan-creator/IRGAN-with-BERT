HOUSE PANEL REJECTS BASE CLOSURE LIMITS 
The House Rules Committee has rejected an amendment that would have prevented 
the government from closing some bases unless an audit found the savings to the 
Pentagon over six years exceeds the cost of closure or reorganization. 
The move means the amendment will likely be dropped next week when the House 
considers the military construction bill. But the committee delivered a victory 
Thursday to supporters of the Presidio, a San Francisco base that has been 
ordered to close. Lawmakers will be allowed to offer an amendment that would 
keep that base open. 
Other California bases that might have benefited from the rejected amendment 
are George AFB, Mather AFB, Norton AFB and Hunters Point Naval Station.
