FT  18 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy - Correction
STANDARD &amp; Poor's has asked us to point out that it has never accorded a
triple-A rating to Italy, as was implied in a report on March 16, 'Debt
mountain still unclimbed amid turmoil'. It rated Italy double-A plus until
March 2 1983, when the rating was lowered to double-A.
