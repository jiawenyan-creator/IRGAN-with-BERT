FT  18 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
The Australian wool market is continuing to ease steadily. Individual
woolgrowers are again attempting to stand out for more economic prices by
withdrawing wool either before or during each sale, but even with offerings
down by a third from amounts originally scheduled, prices are still drifting
to new low points for the season. The downward price trend itself helps to
check buying confidence which is already widely affected by recession in
major wool using countries, more particularly on the continent of Europe
during recent months.
