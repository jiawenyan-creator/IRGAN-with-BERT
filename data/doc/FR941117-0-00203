Due to the time sensitive nature of notices of material event and failures to provide annual financial statements,
it is important that such notices are disseminated quickly. These market requirements will dictate that disseminators
have a system in place by which information vendors can make such notices available to broker-dealers and investors
quickly and contemporaneously. 

NRMSIRs and other information vendors have indicated in their comment letters that under certain circumstances
a 15 minute turnaround
<FOOTCITE>176</FOOTCITE>
 time for notices of material events, and a 24 hour turnaround period for annual financial information may be feasible,
and, in some instances, already is in place.
<FOOTCITE>177</FOOTCITE>
 Nonetheless, because the ultimate scope of the information undertakings was not known to the existing and potential
NRMSIRs at the time they submitted their comments, the Commission intends to discuss with the NRMSIRs during the recognition
process appropriate and practicable turnaround standards for information re-dissemination. Because SIDs are
alternative sources of information for every type of disclosure, the Commission does not intend to impose strict
turnaround times for SIDs. Instead, SIDs should provide the Commission and users with a clear statement of turnaround
times that they will meet consistently.

The Commission considers ``turnaround time'' or ``turnaround period'' to mean the time between which a NRMSIR initially
receives information, and the time when such information is made available to the public. NRMSIRs will be required
to make available the full text of notices of material events, and post the receipt and availability of other documents
within the designated turnaround time period.

The Bond Buyer stated that it broadcasts, through its Munifacts News product, material events and time critical announcements
within 15 minutes of their receipt to municipal market participants throughout the country. It stated that it also
posts documents within 24 hours of a document's receipt to the Bond Buyer's On-line Index which is updated throughout
the day. Letter of The Bond Buyer. Similarly, Dow Jones Telerate stated that electronic dissemination will allow
the turnaround time of 24 hours for an official statement and 15 minutes for secondary disclosure documents on material
events to be feasible. Letter of Dow Jones Telerate. Material information is electronically disseminated on a ``real
time'' basis by Bloomberg L.P. Letter of Bloomberg L.P.

6. Technological Considerations 



The Commission also received many suggestions from information gatherers and vendors on streamlining the filing
of disclosure information. These suggestions included requiring electronic filing of disclosure information,
providing filings on computer disks and providing information to NRMSIRs as images of original source documents
rather than exclusively as coded text.

 Rather than dictate standards, the Commission encourages municipal securities market participants to coordinate
their requirements and preferences on an industry-wide basis.

J.J. Kenny Co. requested that documents be required to be filed as images of original source documents rather than
exclusively as coded text. Dow Jones Telerate requested that Official statements be filed along with one electronic
disk copy of the original Word Processing/Desktop publishing file with the label marked as to which software and version
was used. For secondary market disclosure documents, Telerate advises using the NFMA proposed worksheets. The Bond
Buyer stated that ``collection would be most efficient if documents were in ASCII and a common word processing or publishing
format''.

D. Exemptions 



The Proposed Amendments contained two new exemptions, which are being adopted with certain modifications. A third
new exemption from the annual financial information requirement, for short-term securities, also is being adopted.
In addition, Rule 15c212's limitation to primary offerings of municipal securities with an aggregate principal
amount of $1,000,000 or more, and its existing exemptions, also apply to the amendments.

or less or; (3) at the option of the holder may be tendered to an issuer at least as frequently as every nine months. 

</FOOTNOTE>


1. Small Issuer Exemption 



The Proposed Amendments would have exempted from the provisions of the undertaking and recommendation prohibitions
of the rule municipal securities issued in Offerings by issuers that had (i) less than $10,000,000 in principal amount
of securities outstanding, including the offered securities and (ii) issued less than $3,000,000 in aggregate amount
of municipal securities in the most recent 48 months preceding the offering.
