<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Viktor Zelenkin, by </F>
VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Marina Loboda; place and date not 
given: "State Duma Commissions Began To Frequent Vladivostok"] 
  [Text] Another (the third by now) State Duma commission 
investigating the political situation in Maritime Kray's central 
city arrived in Vladivostok on Sunday. Viktor Zelenkin, a State 
Duma deputy and member of the Russia's Choice faction, explained 
the commission's tasks to VLADIVOSTOK correspondent. 
  [Zelenkin] Events in Vladivostok have attracted quite 
serious 
attention in the Duma. Information we received in the form of 
communications from citizens, public organizations, and the city 
mayoralty, warrant concern. It was impossible to come to any 
conclusions on the basis of press reports--they are too 
contradictory. So the only solution was to form a commission and 
sort things out right here; the commission includes four persons 
representing the Russia's Choice and Communists of Russia 
factions, as well as Travkin's and Zhirinovskiy's factions. 
  [Loboda] How do you plan to proceed? 
  [Zelenkin] I want to emphasize from the outset that we are 
not interested in the charges brought against a number of 
mayoralty officials by competent organs--the investigation will 
sort it out. We are interested first and foremost in the 
political and moral underpinning of the events. According to 
information in our possession, the kray administration's actions 
appear improper to us. But this has been in the works for some 
time: I was in Vladivostok as a member of the previous 
commission, and during a personal conversation the vice 
governor, Mr. Lebedinets, admitted that they were already 
preparing documents to remove your mayor--the obstacle was the 
kray procuracy. 
  [Loboda] Have you formed some opinion on the conflict of 
authorities in Vladivostok on the basis of results of previous 
commission's inquiry? 
  [Zelenkin] I think that the current confrontation between 
the 
kray and city authorities is just the very tip of the iceberg. 
The roots are much deeper, and most likely these roots are of a 
criminal nature. But this is only a guess; the important part 
right now is to study the situation. We plan a number of 
meetings with representatives of local authorities, law 
enforcement organs, and Vladivostok residents. 
  [Loboda] What will your commission produce? 
  [Zelenkin] A detailed report that will be submitted to the 
State Duma and the president. 
  [Loboda] I have to confess that today we were expecting not 
so much the arrival of the Duma commission as that of Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy, as promised by the mass media. 
  [Zelenkin] We guessed it as soon as we arrived at the 
airport: The group of journalists waiting by the aircraft ladder 
were clearly disappointed. It is quite alarming that some city 
residents pin their hopes on Zhirinovskiy to solve their 
problems: Just wait, he will come and settle everything. Believe 
me, he will not. He will only make political points for himself 
in your complex political situation. He will simply use you, as 
he always does. 
  [Loboda] How long are you planning to stay in Vladivostok? 
  [Zelenkin] As long as needed. We will certainly hold a press 
conference for the mass media on the results.
