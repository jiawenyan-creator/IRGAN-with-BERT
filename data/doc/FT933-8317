FT  17 AUG 93 / Hopes rise over Hong Kong talks
CHINA and Britain yesterday expressed hope that progress in negotiations
over Hong Kong's future could be achieved in time for a scheduled meeting
later in September between the foreign ministers of the two countries, Mr
Jiang Enzhu, China's chief negotiator, told reporters. He said there would
be several more rounds of negotiations before the end of September and 'we
hope that more progress will be made in these rounds of talks'.
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, and his Chinese counterpart,
Mr Qian Qichen met in Beijing in July in an attempt to break the impasse on
the Hong Kong issue.
They agreed then to meet again at the United Nations General Assembly in New
York.
China has been deeply angered by plans advanced by Mr Chris Patten, Hong
Kong's governor, to broaden the franchise for elections due in 1994 and
1995. Beijing says this plan contradicts understandings reaching with London
on the transition to Chinese rule in 1997.
Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's chief negotiator, declined yesterday to provide
details about progress in the talks, but he did say: 'We have a lot of work
to do, and we have been getting on with it.'
