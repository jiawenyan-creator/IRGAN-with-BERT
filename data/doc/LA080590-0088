LITERARY HIT MEN 
Re book critics almost as reliable as the people who write the blurbs for film 
ads: 
Larry Ceplair's comments about Michael Herr's "Walter Winchell: A Novel" (May 
27) are a model of the nit-picking critique which makes so many of us 
(unfairly, perhaps) classify critics as literary "hit men" who dote on cutesy 
negativism. They too often get caught up in the cleverness of their put-downs 
and lose any sense of objectivity. 
I was asked by a local bookseller to read a pre-publication copy of "Walter 
Winchell" and advise her as to its worth. I read it . . . and found it 
interesting and great fun: not "great literature" but certainly entertaining 
reading. The unique format added to the enjoyment.
