FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Substantial losses at Finnish
oil group
NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, said yesterday
that adverse market conditions, heavy financing costs and exchange rate
losses lay behind a substantial loss before reserves and taxes in 1992.
The preliminary report did not quantify the size of the deficit, nor did it
indicate whether it had exceeded the FM914m (Dollars 172.6m) loss which the
group incurred in the first eight months. In 1991, the group made a FM478m
profit.
The slump in international refining margins was a significant factor in the
downturn, while prices for petrochemicals and plastics reached 'an
exceptionally depressed level.'
The group was also hit by the weak markka, following two devaluations within
12 months, and a worse performance from its shipping unit.
The operating margin declined to FM1.9bn from FM2.5bn in 1991, although the
group noted that 'compared with the early part of the year, operational
performance improved during the last four months, when nearly half the
operating margin was generated.'
Net sales were 5.5 per cent higher at FM55.9bn. Oil sales rose to FM45.5bn
from FM42.7bn, with chemical sales up to FM9.1bn from FM8.9bn.
