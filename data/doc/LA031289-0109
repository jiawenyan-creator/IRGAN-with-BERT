CITY LINES: COMFORT OF LOVE SEATS 
The so-called "decorative arts" -- everything from pottery to love seats -- 
often fall into the abyss between the "high" arts and commerce. Putting 
furniture in museums to be gazed upon as art objects is a relatively modern 
notion. 
The new Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San Juan Capistrano is the 
first of its kind on the West Coast. Situated in a delightful cluster of 
Mission-style buildings centered on a patio garden, the center opens its doors 
with an exhibition titled "California Style: Collectors and Collections." 
The exhibition features room settings composed of the furniture, ceramics, 
needlework, textiles and other decorative arts. 
"Because our homes and environments leave lasting impressions on our 
intellectual and spiritual growth, we are committed to (integrating) the 
history of furniture, architecture, decorations and gardens," said center 
director G.P. (Gep) Durenberger. 
The great social virtue of the decorative arts is the way they reassure us 
about the continuity of our culture. Unlike painting or sculpture, love seats 
comfort our bottoms rather than challenge our complacencies. Visitors to the 
center are certain to come away smiling with pleasure. LEON WHITESON
