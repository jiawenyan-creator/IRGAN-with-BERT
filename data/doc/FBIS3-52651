  [Text] An official Palestinian source denied the Israeli 
newspaper AL HAMISHMAR report in its issue today that brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] had agreed to Israel's demands 
concerning the crossing points in exchange for Rabin's approval 
to expand Jericho's territory. 
  The official Palestinian source stressed that what AL 
HAMISHMAR had reported today was totally void of truth and that 
no contact had been made between Brother President 'Abu-'Ammar 
and 'Abd al-Wahab Darawshah [Israeli Knesset member]. 
  In its issue today, the Israeli newspaper AL HAMISHMAR 
mentioned that 'Abu-'Ammar had contacted 'Abd al-Wahab Darawshah 
and had asked him to convey to Prime Minister Rabin that the 
crisis could be settled by negotiations with Rabin's approval to 
expand Jericho's territory in exchange for 'Arafat's approval of 
the Israeli demands concerning the crossing points. This was 
claimed by Israeli Knesset member 'Abd al-Wahab Darawshah, who 
said that he had conveyed this proposal to Prime Minister Rabin.
