 

Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).

The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.

Since the proposed rule also considers the needs of local commercial fishing vessels, the economic impact is expected
to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq

.).



Federalism Implications



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under paragraph 2.B.2. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated
under 

ADDRESSES.
