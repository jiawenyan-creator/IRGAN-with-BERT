 

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The interim rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.,

 because the rule waives the Buy American Act for certain Mexican and Canadian products. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration.
A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning
the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately
and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

 (FAR Case 93310), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96511) is deemed to apply because the new provision at 52.22520
requires offerors to list the line item number and country of origin for any end product other than a domestic end product.
Accordingly, a request for clearance of a new information collection requirement concerning the NAFTA Act is being
submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

 Public comments concerning this requirement are invited through an OMB clearance request appearing in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 68636, December 28, 1993.



D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule



A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense (DOD), the Administrator of General
Services (GSA), and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that compelling
reasons exist to promulgate this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. This action is necessary
because the NAFTA Implementation Act, signed into law on December 8, 1993, becomes effective on January 1, 1994. However,
pursuant to Public Law 98577 and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response
to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.
