FT  27 APR 93 / People: Finance post at Euro Disney
The advance of French executives at Euro Disney continues with the
appointment of Xavier de Mezerac as vice president, financial planning and
analysis. De Mezerac, 37, replaces American John MacLeod who is returning to
a US post with Walt Disney. De Mezerac was previously with the Corning
Group, most recently as European director of finance and business
development. At Euro Disney, he will report to John Forsgren, finance
director.
His appointment follows that of Philippe Bourguignon, who replaced Robert
Fitzpatrick as chairman of the Paris-based theme park last January.
After a slow start, Euro Disney decided late last year to embark on a drive
to persuade French visitors to visit the park. As a result, the group came
close to reaching its first year target of 11m visitors.
