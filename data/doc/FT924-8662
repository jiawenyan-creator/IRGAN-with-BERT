FT  10 NOV 92 / Observer: Food for thought
Guests at last night's 1992 Amex Bank Review Awards - at which the first
prize of Dollars 25,000 was awarded to Richard Rose of the University of
Strathclyde for his essay on 'Eastern Europe's need for a civil economy' -
were asked not to read anything personal into the seating plan.
With tables named after 'famous and infamous theories of economics',
according to Amex Bank chief economist Richard O'Brien, invitees could have
found themselves herded onto tables labelled anything from crawling peg, to
animal spirits, to marginal utility. 'We took care to make sure there
weren't any eastern Europeans seated at 'shock therapy',' O'Brien reveals.
