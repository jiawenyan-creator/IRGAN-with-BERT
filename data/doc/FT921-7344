FT  22 FEB 92 / Cost fears at UN as peace force is approved
THE United Nations Security Council last night unanimously approved plans to
send a peacekeeping force to Yugoslavia - but baulked at the cost.
Because of the unexpectedly high estimated cost of Dollars 633.5m, the
council did not recommend that all 14,000 troops be deployed at once.
Instead, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, was directed to
send an advance group that would develop plans for 'the earliest possible
full deployment of the force.' This would then be on the basis of a budget
that maximised the Yugoslav parties' own contributions to offset UN costs.
Before the vote, several members voiced concern at a number of budget items,
including Dollars 132.3m for 'premises' for the troops.
The US and UK delegates were among those who argued that Yugoslavia, with
many tourist hotels, could house the UN force - saving the UN the expense of
putting up prefabricated barracks.
Members also baulked at a Dollars 71.6m estimate for 'aircraft operations.'
Mr Boutros Ghali recommended that the force be deployed initially for 12
months so that no Yugoslav republic could remove it without formal UN
sanction.
This is the first UN peacekeeping force to go to continental Europe. It is
the biggest UN peace operation since the Congo in the 1960s, but is likely
to be surpassed by the proposed UN force for Cambodia, estimated to cost
nearly Dollars 2bn.
