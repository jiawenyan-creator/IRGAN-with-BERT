BRIEFLY 
Akzo NV became the first company from any nation to receive a U.S. patent in 
the field of high-temperature superconductivity. The Dutch chemical company 
upset a wide range of U.S., Japanese and European companies that have been 
working in the field. Superconductors carry electricity without any loss of 
energy and could someday be part of tiny computers that run at unprecedented 
speeds, batteries that last forever and other technological marvels. Although 
Akzo is based in Arnhem, Netherlands, it said its research was done at its 
laboratory in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., by Fawzy A. Sherif.
