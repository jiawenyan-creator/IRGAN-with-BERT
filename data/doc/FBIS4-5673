  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) on Friday [8 April] ordered the Yamanashi Prefectural 
Construction Industry Association to stop unfair practices, FTC 
officials said. 
  The FTC ruled that for 10 years member firms of the 
construction cartel repeatedly engaged in "dango" price fixing 
activities on public works projects. 
  The trade watchdog, however, held off on seeking a criminal 
indictment since it could not find one case of price-fixing to 
prosecute. 
  This follows a similar decision not to seek a criminal 
indictment against a contractor cartel in Saitama Prefecture, 
which had been linked to former Construction Minister Kishiro 
Nakamura, who was indicted last Friday on charges of receiving 
10 million yen from major contractor Kajima Corp. in bribes. 
  According to the FTC investigation, the eight branches of 
the 
association beginning around 1983 took orders for public works 
projects and decided which firms would be awarded the contracts 
as well as the price of the project. 
  The "dango" activities continued until last May when the FTC 
initiated its investigation into the association. 
  Suspicions concerning the association surfaced with 
disgraced 
kingpin Shin Kanemaru's tax evasion case when prosecutors 
questioned contracting firms over their huge cash political 
donations to Kanemaru. 
  Kanemaru, who had been elected from Yamanashi Prefecture, is 
facing tax evasion charges.
