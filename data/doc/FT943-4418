FT  09 SEP 94 / Renault stake for Elf Aquitaine
Elf Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil group, plans to become a
significant minority shareholder in Renault by investing up to FFr1bn
(Pounds 120m) in its eventual privatisation. Renault has already invested
FFr1bn in Elf, which was privatised earlier this year. Elf's reciprocal
investment will create one of the noyaux durs, or 'hard core' shareholding
agreements that have been a traditional tenet of French industry and are now
playing a prominent role in the centre-right government's privatisation
policy. The timing of the Renault share sale has not yet been fixed. The
government is conducting a valuation of Renault (estimated by analysts to be
worth around FFr40bn) as a precursor to selling part of its 80 per cent
stake. But Renault is vying for the next slot on the privatisation schedule
with the Assurances Generales de France (AGF) insurance group.
