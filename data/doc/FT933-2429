FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Moorgate changes Pep fees - At a
Glance
Moorgate Investment Management has altered its personal equity plan charging
structure from a percentage to a flat fee basis. Instead of a 2 per cent
initial and 1 per cent annual charge, the equivalent fees will be Pounds 35
plus VAT and Pounds 30 plus VAT. Those who invest the full annual allowance
of Pounds 6,000 should be better off as a result of the change. Moorgate
manages three investment trusts: General Consolidated, Moorgate and Moorgate
Smaller Companies.
