FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Southern Business shares fall after
provisions warning
SHARES in Southern Business Group fell by 19 per cent yesterday to 67p as
the the photocopier leasing company warned it would make provisions of
Pounds 3m in the second half to pay for a reorganisation of existing
contracts.
The company said it had decided to make fundamental changes to the way in
which its contracts were marketed and administered.
Customers would be sent bills showing the amount of copies actually made,
along with the volume agreed in the contracts. In many cases, because of the
effects of recession on smaller businesses, the actual number used would be
lower. Southern Business Group plans to bring its existing contracts in to
line with the actual number used.
'This policy will enhance the group's reputation for customer service,' said
Mr David McErlain, chairman. 'While it will inevitably lead to an ongoing
cost, the board believes the benefits . . . will significantly outweigh
these costs.'
The decision follows the group's revelation earlier this year that it had
uncovered 'improprieties' in its dealings with some customers. About 12
salesmen and one director subsequently left the company.
Southern issued the warning yesterday as it revealed virtually static
pre-tax profits for the first half of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 7.1m). Sales were
8 per cent ahead to Pounds 29.4m for the six months ended March 31.
Although Mr McErlain said market conditions remained difficult, the dividend
was raised by 10 per cent to 1.27p. Earnings were ahead from 4.93p to 4.99p.
The group also announced the appointment of Mr Roger Limpenny, previously
finance director, as joint managing director with Mr McErlain. Mr David
Holton, company secretary, was appointed finance director.
