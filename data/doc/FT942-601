FT  28 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold drops despite dollar's
weakness
Gold prices dropped sharply in London and New York yesterday. The precious
metal closed in London at USDollars 385.70 a troy ounce, down Dollars 6 from
Friday's close.
Dealers suggested that US investment funds started gold's slide by selling
on the New York Commodity Exchange because they were disappointed that it
had not reacted to a weakening dollar in the expected way - by rising
sharply.
The funds began their latest foray into the gold markets on June 17 on Comex
and their appearance in force lifted gold's price that day - and
subsequently in London on the following Monday - to the highest level in
three-months.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, said last night that
the funds had bought gold a week ago, betting that the price would go
higher, while at the same time some producers had started to sell in the
belief that the price had peaked.
It was also possible that the investment funds had been looking for
second-quarter profits in the small and malleable commodity markets to
offset first-quarter losses in bonds and currencies.
'The gold market is clearly at a turning point,' said Mr Smith. 'Only the
small matter of its direction is unclear.'
