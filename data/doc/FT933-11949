FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Heron sells property interest
HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, has sold a half
share of a property in Brussels for Pounds 32m.
The price is above the value put on the property in the group's business
plan, underlying its Pounds 1.4bn refinancing.
The refinancing has still to be approved by the UK courts. A hearing began
yesterday, as five creditors owed Dollars 42m (Pounds 28m) are opposing the
scheme. The hearing was adjourned and a decision is not expected until later
this week.
