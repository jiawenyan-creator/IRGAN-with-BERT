FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: LCH gets price tag of Pounds 140m - Four
more companies set their sights on a stock market quote
London Capital Holdings is emerging from the financial wreckage of the
former Randsworth Trust property company and will get a listing valuing it
at around Pounds 140m.
Randsworth was one of the most aggressive property companies of the 1980s,
but following its privatisation in 1989 it went into receivership and was
rescued by its bankers, Citibank.
Citibank is expected to sell 65-75 per cent of LCH through a placement and
public offer which will raise up to Pounds 100m. The bank said it would
retain its remaining shareholding of up to 35 per cent as a long-term
investment.
The flotation is scheduled for May.
The bank said it was selling down its shares in LCH to free the management
from financial restrictions imposed under US banking regulations while
Citibank retained control.
LCH retains much of Randsworth's portfolio. Its 14 properties, valued at
Pounds 227.6m in December, are almost entirely located in London's West End.
LCH is one of a growing list of property companies aiming for flotations in
the first half of 1994.
The company will be run by two joint managing directors, Mr Nigel Kempner
and Mr Stephen Musgrave, who joined Randsworth in 1987.
Mr David Newbigging - former chief executive, or taipan, at Hong Kong
trading group Jardine Matheson and the current chairman of Rentokil - is to
become chairman of LCH after the flotation.
Mr Kempner said West End property values offered substantial upside
potential because of the limited availability of new space and strong demand
for property in core locations.
The company plans to use the rental stream from its core portfolio,
estimated at Pounds 17.5m in 1993, to fund development of some of its
existing properties. It will also look for property purchases, or joint
venture projects.
