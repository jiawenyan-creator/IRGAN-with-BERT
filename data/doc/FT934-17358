FT  01 OCT 93 / Technology: You'll never be speechless again - Worth
watching
Most business people who give speeches know the chill of forgetting what the
next slide will be or of losing their notes. The VideoShow Presenter,
developed in Berkeley, California by General Parametrics, could solve the
problems.
The hand-held device combines the traditional remote control unit with a
four-inch colour screen. The screen can display the slide which is being
projected - so speakers do not have to turn their backs on the audience - or
preview the next slide. The speaker can also call up private notes on the
screen as a prompt.
The hand-held unit works directly with PCs or notebook computers and leading
Windows-based presentation programs. General Parametrics: US, 510 524 3950.
