FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Aeromexico acquires Aeroperu
stake
AEROVIAS de Mexico, Aeromexico, has acquired 70 per cent of the Peruvian
state airline Aeroperu for Dollars 54m.
The state is retaining a 20 per cent holding in the airline while the
remaining 10 per cent goes to the company's employees.
Saturdays's auction was the second attempt at selling the ailing flag
carrier, which has only five operational aircraft but attractive
international routes.
In mid-December, Aeromexico was outbid by Peruvian shipping company Naviera
Santa in association with domestic airline Faucett, with an apparently
winning offer of Dollars 41m.
However, the privatisa-tion committee later declared the airline's sale null
and void, finding fault with details of the banking guarantees supplied by
both bidders.
