FT  16 MAR 93 / Hunt for tourism chief is widened
THE GOVERNMENT has turned to headhunters Tyzack Accord to find a new
chairman of the British Tourist Authority after failing to attract a
suitable candidate to replace Mr William Davis, who will leave at the end of
this month.
Tourism industry managers fear a new chairman will not be in a position to
start immediately and that the authority might begin the run-up to the
summer tourist season with an interim head.
Tyzack has also been asked to find a new chief executive for the BTA to
replace Mr Michael Medlicott, who is to become European vice-president of
Delta Air Lines, the US carrier, next month.
One travel industry executive said Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage
secretary, should not have terminated Mr Davis's appointment without having
a replacement in mind. Mr Davis, a former editor of Punch, was told at the
end of January that he was unlikely to be reappointed when his three-year
term ended on March 31.
Potential candidates are believed to feel that two aspects of the Pounds
35,000 part-time post make it unattractive. The first is that the BTA head
will also chair the English Tourist Board, which is having its grant cut
from Pounds 15.6m last year to Pounds 9.1m in 1995.
One industry insider said: 'The BTA at least has the government's support
and commitment. The ETB has not got the government's support and its morale
is low. The BTA is an attractive job. The ETB is a poisoned chalice.'
The second drawback is that the post is for only two days a week. Mr John
Lee, a former tourism minister who lost his seat at the last general
election, said the post should be full-time.
