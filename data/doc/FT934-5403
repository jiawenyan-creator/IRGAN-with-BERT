FT  30 NOV 93 / Observer: Just too much
Another gem has been added to the annals of British Rail's list of
inexcusable excuses for a frequently poor service. While London Underground

commuter vainly waiting on a platform in Essex heard these immortal words:
'British Rail apologise for the late running of this service which is due to
an excess of passengers'.
