FT  18 JAN 93 / Letter: Pension surpluses treatment may give rise to costly
option
Sir, I was interested to read the account of Prof Roy Goode's comments on
pension fund surpluses ('Thorny questions for pension group', January 12).
Whether or not a corporate pension fund surplus should be regarded as 'akin
to the rise in the value of a house' depends, I think, on the nature of the
company's obligations in the event that the fund fails to generate a
sufficient return to cover contractual or advertised target pension
payments. If the company is obliged to underwrite the negative equity that
arises in such circumstances but cannot realise surpluses in the converse
situation, it is effectively being asked to write a put option on its
investment portfolio. The implication is that it will need either to follow
a very conservative investment policy or make an appropriate charge. While
no one will decline the free gift arising from unexpected surpluses, it is
not obvious that future pensioners would choose ex ante to purchase options
of this sort.
