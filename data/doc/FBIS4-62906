  [Text] Estonia Prime Minister Mart Laar has said he regrets 
Russia's refusal to take part in a round-table conference on 
stability in Europe to be held in Paris on May 26-27 together 
with the Baltic states. The reports on Russia's refusal were 
distributed by Reuters Tuesday with reference to Greek Minister 
for European Relations Theodoros Pangalos. 
  Laar told Interfax that Russia's step could be viewed as a 
diplomatic attack intended to obstruct Estonia's integration in 
such structures as the European Union, West European Union and 
NATO keeping it within the scope of its influence. Laar pointed 
to the support rendered by Western Europe to the Baltic States. 
France's proposal to discuss Baltic-Russian relations, in the 
first place border disputes and ethnic issues, and promote their 
rapid resolution at the Paris conference was another sign of 
this approach. 
  "Such a region-wide discussion could create a positive 
background for the resolution of such issues," Laar was quoted 
as saying. He hoped that Russia would change its position.
