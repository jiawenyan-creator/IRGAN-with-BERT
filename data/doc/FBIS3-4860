  [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- Japan's superconductivity 
research laboratory has developed a superconductor with the 
world's largest conductivity rate, laboratory officials said 
Wednesday [2 March]. 
  The superconductor has a current density of 15,000 amperes 
per square centimeter at 77 kelvin and 3 tesla. 
  The previous highest conductivity rate was at 5,000 amperes 
per square centimeter in superconductors made from yttrium, 
which was also developed by the laboratory. 
  The laboratory is affiliated with the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry and receives half of its funds 
from private firms. 
  Superconductivity occurs when electrical resistance in a 
metal completely disappears at temperatures near absolute zero. 
  The researchers found a new method of increasing the rate by 
controlling the oxygen around the substances when they are 
melted down for processing. 
  This method, dubbed the oxygen controlled melt growth 
process, gives birth to numerous pinning centers. Pinning 
centers have the effect of stabilizing magnetic flux, and the 
more that exist, the larger the current density. 
  The new superconductor can be applied for such uses as 
superconducting magnets that lift linear motor cars, and also 
for energy storage, the officials said. 
  There are two types of the new superconductor, one made from 
a blend of neodymium, copper oxide and barium, and the other 
from samarium, copper oxide and barium.
