  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher flies to Tokyo Wednesday [9 March] night for 
the first direct top-level contact between Japan and the U.S. 
since President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa met in Washington last month. 
  During his three-day visit, Christopher will meet Hosokawa 
and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Thursday for talks on 
bilateral economic problems. 
  Hata and Christopher will also hold "two-plus-two" 
ministerial security talks with Defense Agency chief Kazuo Aichi 
and U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner on Friday 
morning. 
  Bilateral relations took a turn for the worse last month 
when 
Clinton and Hosokawa announced the collapse of bilateral trade 
"framework" negotiations aimed at redressing Japan's more than 
60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States. 
  That prompted the U.S. Government to reinstate a trade law 
known as "Super 301" which gives it powers to impose sanctions 
against countries it holds guilty of unfair trade practices. 
The action is widely understood to be aimed at pressuring Japan 
into opening its market and reducing its trade surplus. 
  Foreign ministry sources said the failed talks are likely to 
be high on the agenda. 
  The Japanese are expected to explain their market-opening 
package and seek U.S. understanding, while expressing concern 
over the reinstatement of Super 301, according to the sources. 
  Hosokawa and Christopher are also likely to discuss China, 
since Christopher will fly to Beijing after leaving Tokyo on 
Friday and Hosokawa is scheduled to visit China from March 19 to 
21. 
  Christopher will also attend an international conference on 
aid to Cambodia in Tokyo on Thursday and deliver a speech to 
business leaders on Friday.
