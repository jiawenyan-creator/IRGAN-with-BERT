FT  24 MAR 93 / Civil servants face probe
SENIOR civil servants are facing an inquiry by MPs that could have
wide-ranging repercussions on their responsibilities.
The cross-party Treasury and Civil Service committee has decided in
principle to set up a subcommittee charged with examining the way senior
civil servants' jobs are defined. The terms of reference of the inquiry - to
be entitled The Future of the Higher Civil Service - are expected to be
decided at the first meeting of the subcommittee, set for next week.
