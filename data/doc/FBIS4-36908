  [Text] Today the foreign ministry of the recently declared 
republic in south Yemen called on the permanent members of the 
UN Security Council, as well as Arab League members, to work 
closely to ensure the formation of an acceptable team to monitor 
the cease-fire in Yemen. The team should be selected from Arab, 
African, and Asian countries and be supervised by the United 
Nations. 
  A memorandum submitted by Aden to UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, 
who is currently in Abu Dhabi, proposes that the team of 
observers be formed of officials from Algeria, Mali, Senegal, 
Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, and 
Syria. 
  Brahimi arrived in Doha tonight from Abu Dhabi, as part of 
his efforts to stop the war in Yemen.
