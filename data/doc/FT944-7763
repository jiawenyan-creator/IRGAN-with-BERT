FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hartons director agrees to resign and sell
shares
A non-executive director of Hartons Group yesterday resigned from the board
of the semi-finished plastics distributor, one day after the board called an
EGM to unseat her.
Mrs Monica Maimann agreed to step down and sell her family's holding of
24.3m shares, representing 33 per cent of ordinary shares.
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the company's financial adviser, said it would attempt
to place the shares at no less than 8p before December 22, when Mrs Maimann
would be free to sell her shares independently.
Two weeks ago, Hartons said negotiations between two main shareholders and a
third party could result in a full offer for the group. The deal was thought
to involve a price of 8p per ordinary share.
The ordinary shares closed unchanged at 7p yesterday.
Hartons, which has incurred losses for the last four years, reported a
Pounds 325,000 pre-tax deficit on Pounds 25.7m turnover in the six months to
June 30.
Two non-executive directors have been appointed: Mr Julian Bell,
non-executive director of Ipeco Holdings, and Mr Barry Skipper,
non-executive director of Warburtons.
