FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ex-SD members join Conservatives
Changing places: John Major (centre) and Chris Patten (left) yesterday
welcomed to the Conservative party 22 former members of the Social Democrat
party. With them is Mr Danny Finkelstein, one of the new Tory members. The
group - who announced their defection yesterday - said the Tories in the
1990s supported the SDP's ideas of the 1980s.
