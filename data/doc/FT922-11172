FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: Goodyear results beat forecast
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the sole surviving big US tyre-maker, has reported
strong first quarter results which exceed the company's earlier estimates.
Net income for the three months to March 31 was Dollars 66.3m, or 94 cents a
share, against a loss of Dollars 90.1m, or Dollars 1.54, a year earlier.
Last year's results included after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars
59.7m or Dollars 1.02 a share.
Sales for the quarter were Dollars 2.8bn compared with Dollars 2.5bn.
Earlier this month, Goodyear predicted first-quarter sales of about Dollars
2.7bn with net income reaching Dollars 60m to Dollars 65m.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, attributed the sales growth to increased
automotive industry production and higher sales of replacement tyres. He
said: 'Contributing to the continued earnings improvement were production
efficiencies resulting from higher utilisation of capacity and lower raw
material costs, both of which led to a decrease in the cost of goods sold as
a percentage of sales.'
Operating income from Goodyear's tyre business climbed to Dollars 186.6m
from Dollars 62.8m on sales that rose 11.6 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn. Unit
tyre sales rose 16 per cent in the quarter.
Goodyear's general products business had operating income of Dollars 52.9m,
up 60.3 per cent in the quarter, on sales that rose 5.9 per cent to Dollars
485.3m.
During the latest quarter, Goodyear narrowed its operating loss from its oil
transportation segment to Dollars 9.3m from Dollars 25.1m a year ago.
