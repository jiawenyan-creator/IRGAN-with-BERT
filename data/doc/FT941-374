FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pentos incurs Pounds 71m loss and makes
Pounds 45m rights
Pentos, the specialist retailing group which includes the Dillons bookshop,
Ryman stationers and Athena cards and poster chains, plans to raise Pounds
45m through a 4-for-3 rights issue at 25p.
At the same time Pentos announced a Pounds 70.6m pre-tax loss for 1993 after
taking significant write-downs and exceptional charges totalling Pounds
56.5m and passed the dividend.
Losses per share of 50.1p compared with earnings of 2.6p a year earlier when
dividends totalled 1.5p.
However, the rights issue and other restructuring moves - including new bank
facilities of up to Pounds 66.7m - were generally welcomed in the market and
the Pentos share price closed 1 1/2 p lower yesterday at 29p.
The proceeds from the 191.9m share issue, which has been fully underwritten
by Schroders, will mainly be used to reduce debt and shore up the group's
battered balance sheet, seriously weakened by the substantial trading losses
and exceptional items last year.
Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 79.3m at the end of 1992 to Pounds
21.5m at the end of last year while bank borrowings, which peaked at Pounds
87m during September, fell to a seasonal low of Pounds 69.3m at the end of
December. A year earlier the figure stood at Pounds 44.1m.
The group's auditors have qualified the 1993 accounts on a going concern
basis, subject to the outcome of the rights issue.
Sir Kit McMahon, who replaced Mr Terry Maher as Pentos' chairman late last
year, said yesterday that the rights issue 'would strengthen the group's
balance sheet and place the group in a better position to implement the
changes necessary to restore profitability.'
Mr Bill McGrath, chief executive since January 1, said the rights issue
would provide 'a firm footing for recovery' and unveiled details of a
two-year business plan designed to restore profitability and 'fulfil the
potential' of the core retail businesses.
The sales-led recovery plan follows a detailed strategic review of each
business conducted by Mr McGrath, formerly deputy chairman of Wickes, and is
designed to emphasis the group's strengths.
The need for a far-reaching rethink of the Pentos business strategy was
underlined yesterday by the group's 1993 results.
The near-Pounds 71m pre-tax loss, which compares with previous profits of
Pounds 4m, came on flat turnover of Pounds 240.7m (Pounds 236.4m) including
sales from continuing operations of Pounds 226.6m (Pounds 217m.)
Excluding exceptional items, Pentos incurred operating losses of Pounds
8.2m, compared with profits of Pounds 12.9m a year earlier.
As previously announced last year's results benefited from gross reverse
premiums of Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 6.3m).
Interest costs increased slightly to Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 5.4m) resulting in
losses before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 7.5m
profit).
The Pounds 56.5m (Pounds 3.5m) exceptional items included an Pounds 18.7m
provision for losses on the disposal of Ryman Computer Stores, of which
Pounds 14.3m represented the goodwill write-off previously deducted from
reserves.
