FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: N America restrains overseas growth for
Marks and Spencer
MARKS AND Spencer's international businesses recorded a mixed performance in
the year to March 31 with good growth from mainland Europe and south-east
Asia being offset by another weak performance from North America.
But the bulk of the group's business is still conducted in the UK where
sales suffered as a result of the recession, slipping by 0.6 per cent to
Pounds 4.92bn. Turnover from clothing and general sales fell 2.4 per cent to
Pounds 2.7bn with the food division rising 1.7 per cent to Pounds 2.22bn.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 603.1m to Pounds 638.7m.
The company provided further details of its retrenchment in Canada where it
was reducing its stores by 31 to 42 at an exceptional cost this time of
Pounds 30m.
Earlier this month, M and S announced it was in talks to dispose of its
Peoples Division. A Pounds 13.8m extraordinary provision was made on the
anticipated loss on the disposal, writing off a further Pounds 16m in
goodwill.
M and S had previously wrote off goodwill in its reserves. This year's
provision in its profit and loss account is to comply with new accounting
procedures. The company stressed this would have no additional impact on
cash flow or reserves.
The Brooks Brothers chain in the US and Japan, which has struggled in the
face of tough retail markets in North America, lifted profits from Dollars
11.1m to Dollars 18.2m (Pounds 10.2m).
Brooks spent Pounds 6m in capital expenditure and shut one store while
relocating two others. Another seven outlet stores will open by mid-year
although Brooks warned that its Japanese offshoots were beginning to detect
signs of a weakening economy.
The 17-store Kings Supermarkets chain in the US spent Pounds 7m in capital
expenditure but its sales and margins suffered from competitive discounting.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Things are
beginning to improve but there will not be any quick fix in America. It will
take between three and five years.'
The emphasis on overseas expansion is increasingly being directed at
mainland Europe, where the number of stores increased by five to 17 with
Nantes, Toulouse, Liege, Amsterdam and Seville being added to the list.
Yesterday the company opened another store in The Hague in the Netherlands.
Mr Keith Oates, finance director, said the company was continuing to see
productivity improvements in both stores and head office. 'We have not only
increased our profits but also our profitability,' he said.
The company spent Pounds 305m in capital expenditure last year of which
Pounds 227m was in the UK and the Irish Republic. About Pounds 41m was
applied to upgrading computer systems helping to improve stockturn and drive
down inventory costs.
The number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff in the UK and Irish Republic
fell from 38,970 to 35,850 as M and S flexed its cost base but productivity
per FTE grew strongly by 15 per cent to Pounds 17,800.
M and S added 535,000 sq ft of trading space during the period with four
edge-of-town stores, two town centre shops and five neighbourhood stores in
the UK.
The company had net borrowings of Pounds 261m at the year end representing
gearing of 9.7 per cent, down from 13.5 per cent a year before. Interest
income was Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 13.3m).
By region operating profits were UK and Irish Republic Pounds 638.7m (Pounds
603.1m); continental Europe (less opening costs) Pounds 23m (Pounds 20.4m);
US Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 10.3m); Canada Pounds 5.8m loss (Pounds 3.6m) and
Far East Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 3.3m).
The company's financial activities, including treasury, insurance and
financial services functions, contributed Pounds 23m (Pounds 20.1m) to
profits.
