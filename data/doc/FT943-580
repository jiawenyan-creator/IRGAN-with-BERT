FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Most bourses falter, short of
initiative
The lack of a decision on US interest rates during European market hours
left most bourses short of initiative, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM was on hold, the AEX index rising just 0.19 to 400.66 with shares
receiving a slight boost from gains in the Dutch bond market and in German
bunds.
Aegon was Fl 2.40 lower at Fl 99.40 after news that the company planned an
early redemption of a convertible bond which could inflate the number of
shares outstanding by as much as 8 per cent.
Heineken and Unilever put in firm performances as investors turned from
cyclical to defensive stocks. Each gained Fl 2.00, at Fl 238.30 and Fl
196.50 respectively.
Philips closed unchanged at Fl 54 after the Dutch goverment said it intended
to give the company a Fl 100m research grant for digital radio and
television, and the European Commission said it intended to take a
favourable view towards a joint venture being set up by Philips Lighting and
Osram, of Germany.
PARIS spent a day waiting, not very happily, for the FOMC and results from
its own corporate sector. The CAC 40 index fell 1.44 to 1,901.28 in turnover
of FFr2.49bn.
Its mood looked negative: Monday's forecast of a 'very, very sharp' 1994
recovery from Peugeot was greeted with a fall of FFr21 to FFr772; the Canal
Plus acquisition of 24.9 per cent in the German television channel Vox left
the French company's shares down FFr25 at FFr802.
The main results of the day fell after hours. Societe Generale, just after
the close, saw at least unchanged 1994 profits; the shares eased FFr1 to
FFr534. Credit Lyonnais, some minutes later, fell into the expected range
with a first-half net attributable loss of FFr4.5bn; here, the certificates
fell another FFr13 to FFr374.
On the plus side, Eurotunnel recovered 80 centimes to FFr21.90 after
Monday's salt water leak scare, and Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr6 to FFr560
although the industrial conglomerate is expected to report sharply lower
first-half net attributable profits this afternoon.
FRANKFURT caught up with Monday's post-bourse losses during the session, the
Dax index declining 9.96 to 2,058.73; but turnover stayed thin, investors
awaiting the Washington rates decision and thought unlikely to take firm
decisions on the market before the October 16 elections.
Attention focused again on Metallgesellschaft, down another DM14.70 to
DM118.50 after a low of DM100 in Ibis trading. The shares were quoted at
DM211 only four weeks ago, but the latest falls came in big turnover and
dealers yesterday thought it too early to call the turn in this downslide.
Turnover eased from DM5.3bn to DM5.0bn. After hours, Siemens showed a rise
on the day of DM5 to DM652.70 after weakness inspired by a magazine article
on Monday; the group said yesterday that it was considering spinning off
parts of its plant-technology division.
MILAN put in a strong performance on expectations that Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's government would finally unveil the 1995 budget last night,
with cuts of up to L48,000bn from public expenditure.
The Comit index rose 8.77 or 1.3 per cent to 680.91 as Mr Berlusconi also
held out hopes that the government might be about to publish a new calender
of privatisations, or revenue targets from disposals.
One Milan dealer commented that the market was prepared to overlook the
threat of a national strike by trade unions, which had earlier rejected
proposed reforms to cut the cost of of the country's pensions system. 'If
that is the price that we have to pay for a strong budget, then so be it.'
He added that the market was also supported by expectations of positive
six-month figures from the telecommunications companies and from Fiat.
Fiat led the market higher, picking up L101 to L6,793, while Telecom Italia
rose L109 or 2.5 per cent to L4,435 and Stet added L131 or 2.8 per cent to
L4,752.
ZURICH adopted a weaker bias, the SMI index slipping 5.1 to 2,581.0, with
investors unwilling to open new positions.
Registered shares in Sulzer, under pressure last week, picked up from early
lows to finish SFr1 easier at SFr923 after the group released lower than
expected first-half net profits. However, analysts commented that the
positive outlook for the full year and the perception that the first-half
figure, while low, was also influenced by seasonal factors, helped to
support the stock.
Ciba gave up SFr8 to SFr745, while BBC was one of a few blue chips to move
ahead, rising SFr6 to SFr1,171.
MADRID tried to go higher but ended flat, with the general index just 0.07
firmer at 297.24. Turnover amounted to Pta20.6bn, boosted on the day by
block trades arrranged by JP Morgan.
Strength in Repsol was the most consistent feature of the session, the
shares rising another Pta40 to Pta3,190, but in the banking sector Bankinter
and Popular came late with gains of Pta200 to Pta11,750, and Pta110 to
Pta15,310 respectively.
BRUSSELS ended mixed, with the Bel 20 index easing 0.86 to 1,384.95 in thin
turnover of BFr1bn.
The Luxembourg-based steelmaker Arbed stole the show with a rise of BFr270
to BFr4,770 after it said that a private offering of 1m shares had been
priced at BFr4,550, and oversubscribed.
WARSAW accelerated its recent declines in thin trading, the Wig index
falling 405.5 or 4.5 per cent to 8,705.2. Turnover shrank by 26.7 per cent
to 371.6bn zlotys.
