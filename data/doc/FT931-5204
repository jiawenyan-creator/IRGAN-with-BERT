FT  06 MAR 93 / Travel: An easy way to be a globetrotter - Practical
Traveller
ONE SUSPECTS that Ferdinand Magellan would have been the first to hand over
Pounds 693 for a round-the-world air ticket. The Portuguese explorer, whose
bold foresight led to the first circumnavigation of the globe in 1521, paid
a far higher price. Before he had completed his voyage, Magellan became
embroiled in a dispute with rowdy islanders who relieved him of his life.
Modern-day adventurers have it far easier. For a modest Pounds 693,
Trailfinders (tel: 071-938-3366) can send you circumnavigating via Hong
Kong, Bangkok, Sydney, San Francisco and New Orleans.
Flights depart from five UK airports. Tickets, which must be booked by May,
are open for one year.
According to STA (tel: 071-937-1733), there is no such thing as a standard
round-the-world itinerary. Many people fly to Australia via south-east Asia,
then across the Pacific to North America before returning to Europe. But one
need not be tethered to such norms.
One could follow a similar route in the opposite direction, or call in on
Africa or South America along the way. Travellers with time on their hands
may elect to intersperse flights with overland sections, say Bangkok to
Singapore or Perth to Sydney.
Here are two STA itineraries to give you some idea:
London-Rio-Auckland-Sydney-Singapore-London (Pounds 989); or
London-LA-Honolulu-Tonga-Samoa-Auckland -Sydney-Singapore-London (Pounds
836).
Even these are humdrum in the grand scheme of things. For little extra one
can add on destinations such as Vietnam, the Gallapagos islands or Beijing.
Even Mongolia and Madagascar are within reach.
Before booking, here are a few cautionary tips:
Decide how much time you have. Magellan's expedition took two years; yours
should last at least a month, although a colleague of mine compressed five
transglobal destinations into a confusing 11 days.
If your time is fairly limited, do not attempt too much. Your global
experience could end up a saga of airport lounges and hurried city tours.
Three or four days is a sensible minimum for each stop, enabling you to
adapt to time changes.
Plan ahead. If you are stopping in Delhi, ask yourself why. Can you see the
Taj Mahal in the 24 hours you have allotted for India? (You probably cannot,
and certainly should not try.) Is Tahiti fearfully expensive? Is Lima safe?
Can you find accommodation in Zanzibar? Is Easter Island nice at Easter?
Most people will find it best to book hotels in advance, avoiding the agony
of spending jet-lagged hours in search of accommodation. You may well be
able to arrange hotel discounts in conjunction with your ticket.
Multiple stopovers mean multiple visas and multiple headaches. Put in your
applications in good time. Some embassies and consulates insist on keeping
your passport for several days, though many now run an overnight service.
Most travel agents can help with visas, or contact Visa Service (tel:
071-833-2709).
Take out travel insurance. Without it, a lost ticket usually means buying
yourself a replacement. Watch out, too, that overzealous check-in staff do
not remove more than one ticket docket at a time. You could find yourself in
Guangzhou airport explaining that the ticket stub for your next leg is in a
dustbin at Singapore airport.
Other agencies you might try are: Bridge the World (tel: 071-911-0900);
Quest Worldwide (081-547-3322), and Travel Mood (071-258-0280). The latter
offers around-the-world business class fares at below Pounds 2,000.
