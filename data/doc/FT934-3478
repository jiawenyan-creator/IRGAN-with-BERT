FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (3): A change of strategy at
3i - Buy-ins have declined, but Bimbos continue to rise
Is the pure management buy-in becoming extinct? It has fallen out of favour
over the last couple of years, after research and performance reviews showed
that it tends to be outperformed by buy-in/management buy-outs (Bimbos).
A review of the performance of 154 buy-ins was conducted by 3i in early
1991. 'If the person buying in was involving the management, they were
usually better informed about the business,' says Mr Patrick Dunne, head of
3i's buy-in programme. 'They usually got on better, because they were
involving the management within in their plans,' he adds.
Buy-in strategy at 3i has altered accordingly. While still placing
substantial emphasis on buy-ins - it backed 15 of the 38 deals in this
year's first half - the focus has shifted. Two and a half years ago, around
20 per cent of the buy-ins it backed were Bimbos. The figure has since grown
to between 65 and 70 per cent.
Pure MBIs remain as a third of deals. According to Mr Dunne, they can be
lucrative. 'You still have situations where a talented md will go into a
business and move it forward, take a fresh view and re-energise it,' he
says. A common misconception is that most buy-ins are turn-arounds. 'They're
mostly people buying into companies which are doing all right, but could do
a lot better.'
In August, for example, a pure buy-in team acquired Unimerchants, a Pounds
16m-turnover importer and distributor of Mediterranean food. 'It was a
profitable business, but it was not as well managed as it would be, in our
view, by ourselves,' says Mr John Durban, leader of the three-man team. He
thinks that former parent Albert Fisher Group could not give it the
attention it needed. The team is concentrating on rapidly-growing niche
markets, notably high-quality imported pasta and olive oil products.
A strong record is usually needed to attract backing for an MBI. Mr Durban
has already run two sizeable food businesses: Procter &amp; Gamble's European
food processing, catering and bakery division, as well as Pounds 200m-plus
turnover edible oils company Acatos &amp; Hutcheson.
No equity was allocated to the incumbent management. Albert Fisher Group's
policy is not to encourage its managers to participate in buy-outs. Mr
Durban says equity participating might be possible for some of the incumbent
team later on.
Institutions and advisers can be more cautious when a team lacks hands-on
experience of the company. The Unimerchants MBI took almost a year to
arrange, and was probably more protracted than an equivalent MBO.
A classic problem with many buy-ins is the discovery after acquisition of
skeletons in the company closet. The Unimerchants team found dinosaurs.
'They seemed to think it would be a wonderful idea to introduce a pasta in
dinosaur shapes,' explains Mr Durban. Fortunately, the surplus stock does
not present a great problem.
The pace of buy-ins for much of this year has been slower than in 1992, with
only 38 deals in the first half, against 134 for the whole of last year,
according to Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Out Research
(CMBOR).
The value of deals struck appears to be holding up well, with transactions
worth Pounds 397m in the first half, against last year's final total of
Pounds 679m. However, when this year's monster Pounds 250m buy-in deal of BP
Nutrition's consumer products division (see below) is stripped out, the
adjusted first-half total of Pounds 147m is much less promising. According
to CMBOR, divestments declined to 19.5 per cent of deals in the first half,
while buy-ins from receiverships grew to 19.4 per cent of transactions.
Mr Dunne says a lack of confidence in the economy held bidders and vendors
back in the early part of the year; but now the situation is looking more
promising: he has noticed a pick up since September.
Family-owned businesses remain a key source of buy-in deals. Their
proportion of total deal value fluctuates from year to year, but, according
to CMBOR's statistics, they have yielded a steady 44 to 52 per cent of deals
over the 4 1/2 years to the end of June.
Buy-ins of family companies often arise due to succession problems. Mr Nick
Theakston, a partner in KPMG Corporate Finance, thinks a Bimbo bringing in
new top management to graft on to existing non-family senior management can
be a good solution. However, he highlights a difficulty with these deals:
'Family businesses have a huge amount of emotion involved in them.'
His latest big family deal came earlier this year, when he advised on a
Pounds 21m Bimbo of Maiden Outdoor Advertising. Mr Ian Maiden relinquished
his post as chairman of the Liverpool-based company after 39 years. The
buy-in team was assembled and led by Mr Ron Zeghibe, fresh from putting
together a turn-around of Dutch advertising company Mediamax.
The Bimbo involved four of the existing management as well as three
outsiders. Luckily, there was no family strife. 'Ian Maiden was extremely
level-headed and sensible about it,' says Mr Theakston.
Around 200 would-be buyers-in are registered on 3i's MBI programme, and
roughly half the deals it backs draw on the pool. Talent-spotting has been
easier recently. 'If you're running and performing well in a recession, then
you're probably going to do even better in a good time,' says Mr Dunne. As
well as training potential buyers-in, the programme helps 3i to get their
measure. 'We seem to do a lot better when we back people we know,' he says.
The Bimbo is no longer the leading-edge buy-in. According to Mr Dunne, 3i is
now placing a lot of emphasis on the 'Chimbo' - a variant of the Bimbo, in
which investing chairmen buy companies in tandem with the existing
management team. The chairmen bring the benefit of experience to bear, on a
part-tine basis.
As well as chairmen from its buy-in pool, 3i can draw on its tranche of 300
independent directors. 'Those people have been particularly powerful with
younger companies, and we see a future for the angel that not only adds some
money but also adds talent,' says Mr Dunne.
