P.M. BRIEFING; 
SALES OF CARS, LIGHT TRUCKS BY BIG 3 AUTO FIRMS DROP 8.5% IN EARLY MAY 
Sales of cars and light trucks by the nation's Big 3 auto makers fell 8.5% in 
early May compared to a year ago, when buyers flocked to showrooms to take 
advantage of expiring incentives. 
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said today that they 
sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 34,847 during the May 1-10 
period this year, compared to a rate of 38,089 during the same time last year. 
Car sales dropped 10.8%, and truck sales were off 4.5%. 
The May 1-10 period of 1988 was among the strongest during what resulted in the 
second-best selling year in auto industry history. 
Incentives were in effect during early May this year and last. But last year, 
many of the special discounts expired May 11, prompting a buying rush. Of the 
incentive packages in effect now, Ford's expires May 31, GM's ends June 5 and 
Chrysler's continues indefinitely.
