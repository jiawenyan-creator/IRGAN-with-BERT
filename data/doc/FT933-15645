FT  08 JUL 93 / Pay strike hits civil service
MORE THAN 50,000 Israeli civil servants began an open-ended strike
yesterday, demanding pay rises of 35 per cent spread over the next three to
four years.
The strike hit government offices, ports, state television, the rabbinical
courts and hospitals, although essential services were maintained.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said that, while he had some sympathy for the
lowest paid workers, the wage demands were too high to contemplate. His
finance minister Mr Abraham Shochat termed the strike 'unnecessary',
claiming that a solution could have been negotiated without such action.
But representatives of the four unions involved - which have agreed among
themselves not to return to work until their demands are met in full - said
that they had been trying to negotiate for the past six months, to no avail.
They noted teachers had won 30 per cent pay rises earlier this year after
resorting to strikes.
Mr Shochat said that to bow to the strikers' demands would inevitably push
up unemployment, which runs at 11 per cent.
