FT  01 AUG 92 / Delay over Maxwell ruling
A HIGH COURT judge has deferred until September his ruling on an application
by the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management for immediate
judgment in their Pounds 450m damages action against Mr Ian Maxwell, a son
of Robert Maxwell.
The liquidators, partners in Robson Rhodes, have argued that Mr Maxwell has
no defence to their allegations that he breached his fiduciary duty as a
director of BIM, from which hundreds of millions of pounds of Maxwell
companies' pension funds disappeared.
The hearing, originally expected to take two days, lasted 5 1/2 because of
Mr Maxwell's opposition to the liquidators' claim that the case should not
go to a full trial.
On July 20 the liquidators were given final judgment in their identical
action against Mr Maxwell's brother Kevin, who was ordered to make interim
payments totalling Pounds 406.8m pending assessment of his final liability.
He said afterwards that he had not defended the action because of lack of
money.
The liquidators have since started bankruptcy proceedings due to come before
the bankruptcy court on August 17. They have said they will take a similar
step against Mr Ian Maxwell if they succeed in winning final judgment
against him.
