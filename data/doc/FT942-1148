FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sherritt in Cuban mining joint
venture
Sherritt, the Canadian metals group, is to form a joint venture with Cuba's
Compania General de Niquel to mine, process and market nickel and cobalt.
The partnership is the latest move by Canadian mining and energy companies
to expand their presence in Cuba in the face of US economic sanctions.
Several European and Mexican industrial companies have gained a foothold in
Cuba as the climate towards foreign investors improves.
The joint venture will include a mine and ore-processing facilities at Moa
Bay in Cuba, as well Sherritt's refinery at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.
Sherritt buys a large portion of Moa Bay's output as feedstock for the
refinery.
The two companies said they planned to expand and modernise the Moa Bay
facilities, and would set up a joint marketing company.
