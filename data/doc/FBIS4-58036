al-Suhayl Murder"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A movement calling 
itself the "National Resistance" in Iraq has announced its 
intention to avenge the assassination of Iraqi oppositionist 
Talib al-Suhayl, who was killed by the Iraqi intelligence 
service in Beirut. In leaflets it distributed in a number of 
districts in the Iraqi capital the movement said that some 
people have named the main street leading to al-Shu'lah area in 
Baghdad "al-Suhayl Street." The movement said that the murdered 
oppositionist was "the toughest defender of freedoms and 
democracy for 30 years." 
  Arrivals from Iraq say that these leaflets were distributed 
at night in front of houses, shops, and schools. It is the 
first time this movement has distributed leaflets in Baghdad and 
a number of major cities. 
  Meanwhile, some leaders of the Iraqi Tamim tribes, one of 
whose senior leaders was al-Suhayl, have met to discuss steps to 
be taken to retaliate against the government, including pursuing 
those who planned and implemented the operation and all those 
who took part in watching and supplying information about 
al-Suhayl's movements from inside and outside Iraq. Arrivals 
from Baghdad say that security authorities have encircled a 
number of houses belonging to senior Tamim tribal chiefs in 
anticipation of violent incidents.
