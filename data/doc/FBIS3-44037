  [Text] Maseru Jan 24 SAPA -- Business returned to normal in 
Maseru on Monday, the day after artillery and mortar rounds 
rocked the Lesotho capital as two military factions clashed. 
Radio lesotho reported the CAF [Confederation of African 
Football] cup first leg preliminary round soccer match between 
Lesotho's Linare and Reunion's St Denis, cancelled earlier, 
would be played at the national stadium in the Mountain Kingdom 
capital at 7pm on Monday. 
  A SAPA correspondent said shops in downtown Maseru were 
open, 
and the nearby border post, which was closed on Sunday, was 
operating again and commercial traffic was flowing. 
  Supermarkets and cafes were closed on Sunday and no 
newspapers were available because of the closed border post. 
SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio said the 
Education Ministry had ordered schools, due to open for the 
first day of the year on Monday, to remain shut. 
  South African Foreign Affairs spokesman Awie Marais said 
Sunday's fighting ended with heavy overnight rain storms, adding 
the two factions were maintaining their positions. He described 
the Mountain Kingdom capital as tense. 
  But Maseru businesses were open in light drizzle on Monday, 
the SAPA correspondent said. 
  News reports said five soldiers were killed and at least 
four 
civilians injured in fighting which began about 10 days ago. 
  Government officials and diplomats have been unable to 
explain the cause of the dispute between the two military 
factions.
