  [Text] Cairo, 31 Jan (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
returned to Cairo this evening following a five-day visit to 
Switzerland during which he attended the World Economic Forum 
and held a number of meetings with several foreign ministers 
attending the forum. 
  Musa also met with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to discuss the 
possibility of overcoming the obstacles preventing the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  In response to a question at the airport regarding the 
'Arafat-Peres negotiations in Davos, Musa said that progress was 
made on several points, but no agreement was reached to begin 
implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles 
agreement.
