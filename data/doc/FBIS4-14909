  [Text] Moscow, 4 Apr -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
signed an edict today "On introducing a state of emergency on 
parts of the territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the 
Ingush Republic." The edict has been adopted in connection with 
the continuing tension in a number of rayons in both republics, 
terrorist and violent incidents that have taken place there, and 
a necessity to implement the presidential edict of 13 December 
1993 "On the procedure for the repatriation of forced migrants 
on the territory of North Ossetia and the Ingush Republic". 
  The decree is valid from the moment of signing. ITAR-TASS 
has learned about it from the press service of the Russian 
president.
