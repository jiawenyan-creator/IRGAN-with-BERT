FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: KPN floats into land of the
giants - The disposal of the Dutch telecoms group
With the third tranche of the privatisation of British Telecom completed,
the next event in the world calendar of telecommunications privatisations is
likely to be the flotation of Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN).
The sale of the Dutch PTT, widely expected to take place in the first half
of 1994, probably in the spring, is likely to produce firsts at home and
abroad.
The company, which analysts say is worth between Fl 16bn (Dollars 8.4bn) and
Fl 22bn, will be sold in stages, with next year's tranche likely to be the
Netherlands' biggest privatisation and the first of a household name. The
Dutch government has said that it is prepared to sell two-thirds of the
company.
The KPN flotation will mark the first time that a national government in
Europe has opened up its postal operations to outside investors. Fortunately
for the Dutch state, which is seeking the highest possible price for its
shares, KPN's postal subsidiary, PTT Post, is one of only two postal
services in Europe that make a profit. The other is the British Post Office.
Although the inclusion of the Netherlands' postal operations in the
flotation is unfamiliar to most investors it is not expected to drag down
the price at which KPN is floated. This is partly because PTT Post
contributes just under 20 per cent of profits compared with 80 per cent by
PTT Telecom, the telecommunications arm which is more directly comparable
with other privatised telecommunications companies such as British Telecom.
Mr Manus Fleskens, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Amsterdam, noted
that the Dutch postal service was highly-automated and well-managed and
produced a consistent record of profits. 'It has good prospects for the
future, both in expanding its size of operations and its profits generally.'
Although the Netherlands has a mature telecommunications market, KPN is
regarded as a solid player because its costs are low and because its home
market is internationally-orientated, generating lucrative international
telephone traffic. In a recent research report, Morgan Stanley described KPN
as being in the forefront of telecommunications and postal liberalisation in
Europe, while BZW rated it as potentially 'the most attractive of the
European quoted telephone companies'.
In 1992, KPN posted net profit of Fl 1.67bn on turnover of Fl 15.6bn, a rise
of 3.4 per cent on the year before.
Predictions for the value of KPN hinge not so much on investors' perceptions
of the postal activities as on the company's expected dividend policy. KPN
pays out 40 per cent of net profits to the Dutch state, and initial
indications are that this level will not be raised significantly in the
first few years after privatisation.
Partly balancing this, Dutch regulators are expected to adopt a relatively
benign attitude to post-privatisation pricing of postal and
telecommunication services, meaning that KPN will not face overly strict
constraints on either of its businesses.
So far, analysts have assigned a broad Fl 16bn-Fl 22bn range for the total
value of KPN, meaning that a first 30 per cent tranche could be worth more
than Fl 5bn. Much will depend on the climate of the Amsterdam bourse next
year; the details of the flotation legislation that is being examined by
parliament; and, to a lesser extent, whether the government will want to
build in incentives to entice private shareholders.
Last month, the Dutch state chose NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, the British
investment bank to advise on all aspects of the sale, including the
flotation price.
KPN has chosen another Anglo-Saxon investment house, Goldman Sachs, to act
on its behalf. Dutch banks, passed over in the Netherlands' most significant
privatisation since the flotation of DSM, the chemicals group, in the late
1980s, are expected to win prominent roles in the underwriting syndicate.
Unlike the British government, the Dutch government has never given any
priority to increasing the country's base of small shareholders through
privatisation. Incentives are therefore more doubtful, although not ruled
out.
Rather than pursuing ideological goals, the state's sell-off is designed to
bolster KPN's position in the fast-changing world of telecommunications and
postal services.
KPN is smaller than BT, AT&amp;T and other privatisation candidates such as
Deutsche Telekom of Germany, but it is determinedly trying to compete with
its bigger rivals in providing telecommunication services to multinational
companies.
Its vehicle for this competitive and expensive area of international
telecommunications is Unisource, a venture with Sweden's Televerket and
Swiss Telecom. This pits the Dutch company against BT's Syncordia and the
French-German joint venture Eunetcom as well as against AT&amp;T's Worldsource
partnership.
By buying shares in KPN, investors will not be gaining access to one of the
dominant companies of the industry. However, KPN's attraction lies in its
plucky and nimble efforts to hold its own and expand its influence in a
global sector where national barriers are swiftly being dismantled.
