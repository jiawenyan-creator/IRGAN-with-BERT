King and Tanner Crab Fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Commercial King and
Tanner Crab Fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI). This FMP amendment would establish the Norton
Sound Section of the Northern District of the king crab fishery as a superexclusive registration area. If this amendment
is approved, existing regulations, which supersede State of Alaska (State) regulations that establish Norton Sound
as a superexclusive registration area in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the BSAI, will be removed and reserved.
This action is necessary for the effective management of the fishery having the smallest biomass and guideline harvest
level (GHL) in the BSAI crab fisheries. This action is intended to promote management and conservation of crab and
other fishery resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner
Crab Fisheries of the BSAI.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires the Secretary
to publish regulations proposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time,
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has not determined that the amendment these rules would implement is consistent
with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The Secretary, in making
that determination, will take into account the information, views, and comments received during the comment period.




Background 



The commercial king and Tanner crab fisheries in the EEZ of the BSAI are managed under the FMP. This FMP was prepared
by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (Magnuson Act). It is a framework FMP that, with oversight by the Council and Secretary, defers management of the
crab resources in the BSAI to the State. The FMP was approved by the Secretary and implemented on June 2, 1989. At times,
regulations implementing the FMP must be amended to resolve problems pertaining to management of the BSAI crab fisheries.
