METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BEVERLY HILLS DROPS PLAN FOR GRANITE 
SIDEWALKS 
Deciding against costly opulence, Beverly Hills City Council members gave up 
the idea of installing granite sidewalks Tuesday, and went instead with a more 
modest plan to revamp the downtown business district. 
The modified program would reduce the number of streets in the city's sidewalk 
replacement program and replace existing walkways elsewhere with concrete 
sidewalks in a diagonal pattern.
