FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: An apt Twist in nickname
Sir, I agree entirely with Observer (June 9) that Kenneth Clarke should
henceforth by know as Chubby Exchequer. It is particularly appropriate when
one remembers that the original Chubby Checker's fame and fortune were
founded upon a series of dance records based on the Twist.
