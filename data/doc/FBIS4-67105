  [Text] Retired Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, 
minister of the interior, says the present government is 
determined to eliminate the drug menace from society. He said 
this while talking to reporters at Peshawar's airport upon his 
return from Tehran, where he signed a memorandum of 
understanding among Iran, Pakistan, and the United Nations 
Narcotics Control Program. He said the three sides will spend 
$31 million on narcotics control measures. The interior minister 
said narcotics are reaching Pakistan from Afghanistan because of 
the political instability there, while materials used to process 
heroin are being smuggled into Pakistan from India. 
  During his stay in Tehran, Nasirullah Khan Babar met Iranian 
President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani and conveyed messages of 
goodwill and good wishes to him from Pakistan's president and 
prime minister.
