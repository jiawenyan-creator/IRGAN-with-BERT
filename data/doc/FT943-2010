FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise in BNP profits
confirms trend in sector
Banque Nationale de Paris, a leading French banking group, yesterday
affirmed the upward trend in the domestic financial sector by announcing a
steep increase in net profits to FFr914m (Dollars 172m) for the first half
from FFr522m in the same period last year.
BNP's 75 per cent rise in interim profits reflects the continuing recovery
in the industry as France's banks, which have had a tough time over the past
two years, benefit from the general easing of economic conditions.
Banque Indosuez, the investment banking subsidiary of the Suez group, last
week announced an increase in first-half profits and other large banks are
expected to follow suit in the course of the current interim reporting
season, with the notable exception of Credit Lyonnais, the ailing
state-controlled bank.
Analysts are braced for another loss when Credit Lyonnais's interim figures
are published tomorrow.
One of the main factors behind the improvement in BNP's performance was a
reduction in provisioning, according to Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman.
BNP, like other French banks, was last year forced to make hefty write-downs
on poorly performing property investments and small company loans.
However, it managed to restrict net provisions to FFr4.02bn during the first
half, 22 per cent lower than in the 1993 interim period.
Canal-Plus, the French pay-TV group, yesterday disclosed a 25.6 per cent
fall in interim net profits to FFr503m for the first half of 1994 from
FFr676m in the same period last year due to losses on some associate
companies and the burden of FFr62m of financial costs against a FFr31m
credit for 1993.
