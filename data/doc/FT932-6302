FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gas in demand
British Gas was the most heavily traded stock on the London market as UK and
overseas funds switched out of BP and Shell. Turnover in Gas was, however,
inflated by a sizeable bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deal
Oil sector specialists said the oil majors had strongly outperformed Gas
since the start of the month as the market reacted sharply to worries about
regulatory intervention and about the outcome of the inquiry into Gas by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is due to report in July. Both BP
and Shell were helped by excellent quarterly results released earlier in the
month.
Gas edged up 4 to 294p, boosted by rumours emerging from the traded options
market that the MMC inquiry was turning in Gas's favour. BP eased a penny to
311p and Shell lost 2 1/2 to 611 1/2 p, sentiment unsettled by a profits
warning from Elf, the French-state owned oil company.
Recent buy notes from Kleinwort Benson and Salomon International continued
to support Lasmo, up 2 at 153p, while rumours of a gas discovery in the
North Sea and expected good news from two other wells helped Goal improve to
50p. Premier edged up to 28 1/4 p as the market looked forward to results
from the latest drilling operations off the Burmese coast.
