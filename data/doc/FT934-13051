FT  23 OCT 93 / Proposed Scottish councils 'too small'
THE government was warned yesterday that some of the new local authorities
it plans for Scotland are too small to be viable.
The claim will embarrass Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who is
now committed to a similar system of unitary authorities in England,
replacing the old two-tier structure of counties and districts,
Unitary authorities would lead to further centralisation, which would 'do a
disservice to democracy', according to Professor Arthur Midwinter, an expert
on local government at Strathclyde University, Glasgow.
Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission for England,
has said that he believes that many local people would prefer to retain the
status quo.
Prof Midwinter criticised the Scottish Office white paper which proposes
creating 28 unitary authorities to replace the two-tier system of nine
regions, three island councils and 53 districts. A bill is to be presented
in the new session of parliament.
He told a conference of local government officials that small authorities
would have difficulty providing all the services required, and bigger
neighbouring councils might be unwilling, for political reasons, to help
them out.
Prof Midwinter highlighted three proposed councils whose small size compared
with those of neighbouring areas has led to accusations that the
Conservative party is gerrymandering.
The three examples are Stirling, which would have 81,000 people compared
with the 195,000 people in adjoining Clackmannan and Falkirk; East
Renfrewshire, with 88,000 people compared with 265,000 in West Renfrewshire;
and Berwickshire and East Lothian, an area of 76,000 people to be carved out
of Lothian and Borders regions.
