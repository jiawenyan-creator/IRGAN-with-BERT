FT  15 SEP 92 / Travel agents form new company
A GROUP of 12 former managers and staff of Land Travel, which collapsed in
July, have set up a new holiday company selling coach trips on the
Continent, Michael Skapinker writes.
Tours Direct says it will be based on ethical principles and will apply for
membership of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). Land Travel
was not a member of Abta and had no bonding, which meant that more than
40,000 customers lost their money.
It is likely that the new company will have to demonstrate to Abta that its
managers were not directly involved in the events that led to Land Travel's
demise.
Two former senior Land Travel managers, Ms Elke Jantzen and Mrs Diana
Kenning, are joint senior managers of the new company. Mr David Kenning, a
Tours Direct non-executive director and Mrs Kenning's husband, said that
neither woman had been a director of Land Travel.
