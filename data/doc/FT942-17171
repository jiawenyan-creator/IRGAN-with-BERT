FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: French retailer's profits fall
14%
The pressures on the French retail sector last year took a toll on
Pinault-Printemps' performance with a 15 per cent reduction in net profits
to FFr511m (Dollars 86.6m) in 1993 from FFr586m in 1992.
However, Pinault-Printemps, which has expanded rapidly by acquisition from a
family-owned timber business into one of France's largest retail groups,
made progress in its debt-reduction programme. The group succeeded by
selling assets - including Prime Equipment, CICA and Discol - to cut its net
debt by more than FFr6bn to FFr12.1bn by the end of the year.
The assets sales triggered a reduction in turnover which fell by 11 per cent
to FFr63.3bn last year from FFr70.2bn in 1992.
Operating profits fell 20 per cent to FFr2.31bn from FFr2.79bn. Continuing
businesses did incur falls in both turnover and operating profits but at a
lower level.
Pinault-Printemps also announced that the board had endorsed its proposal to
take full control of La Redoute, the mail order group. The takeover will be
put to Pinault-Printemps' shareholders next month at an extraordinary
meeting.
