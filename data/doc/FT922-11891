FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Nedlloyd returns to profit
NEDLLOYD, the Dutch trans-port group, made a strong swing back into profit
in 1991, due to gains produced by a series of divestments and, to a lesser
extent, to an improvement in operating results.
Net profit totalled Fl 145m (Dollars 77.5m) last year, reversing the
previous year's net loss of Fl 148m. In spite of the turnround, Nedlloyd is
to omit its dividend for the second year in a row because of the
'composition' of its profit.
Mr Henk Rootliep, chairman, acknowledged that the strong improvement in
results reflected the company's divestment programme but added: 'I am happy
nevertheless that we have been able to report a substantial, positive
result.'
Nedlloyd's shipping business moved out of the red in 1991 to produce an
operating profit of Fl 44m against a loss of Fl 78m in 1990. The group's
second core business - land-based transport and distribution in Europe - cut
operating losses to Fl 8m from Fl 45m.
Total operating results rose to Fl 80m from Fl 25m in 1990. The operating
figure includes Fl 35m from the sale of fixed assets such as ships. The year
before, Nedlloyd had raised Fl 111m at the operating profit level by selling
a liquefied natural gas tanker, some property in Japan and other assets.
The net result was boosted by extraordinary items of Fl 141m, of which more
than a third was generated by the sale of the energy division to DSM, the
Dutch chemicals group. Sales of minority shareholdings yielded another Fl
76m in book profits.
Nedlloyd's divestment programme, which has concentrated on non-core
businesses such as energy, aviation and electronics, produced cash proceeds
of Fl 700m in 1991.
