OCC, EL CAMINO IN ORANGE COUNTY BOWL 
Orange Coast College and El Camino officially accepted bids to play in the 
Orange County Bowl, committee member Bill Otta said Sunday. 
El Camino (8-2) won the Northern Division and OCC (8-2) the Central Division of 
the Mission Conference. The game will be Dec. 1 at Orange Coast, but the time 
won't be decided until today. 
This is the first bowl appearance for OCC since 1975, when the Pirates defeated 
Rio Hondo in the Avocado Bowl. It will be the fourth consecutive bowl 
appearance for El Camino.
