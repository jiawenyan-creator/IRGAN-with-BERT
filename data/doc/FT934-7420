FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Accounting move lifts Volvo
VOLVO, the Swedish manufacturing group planning to merge its core car and
truck operations with France's Renault, yesterday reported a pre-tax profit
of SKr1.06bn (Dollars 128.8m) for the first nine months of 1993, surging
back to surplus from losses totalling SKr707m in the same period last year.
Virtually all of the profit was attributable to a SKr1.05bn bonus from a
change in accounting of tool costs made to bring Volvo into line with
international automotive industry practice.
But a halt to the trend of sliding car and truck sales, a boost from the
devaluation of the krona and efficiency gains helped produce a result ahead
of most analysts' forecasts.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said the full-year currency effect would be
about SKr1bn. He said the positive earnings trend was expected to continue
for the rest of 1993.
Group sales rose to SKr73.5bn from SKr58.8bn, while operating income swung
to a profit of SKr445 from a loss of SKr1.5bn.
This profit was inflated by SKr570m from the accounting change, but still
reflec-ted an improvement in operating income of SKr1.4bn.
Volvo said all divisions showed an operating profit. Car sales increased in
value by 25 per cent to SKr39.8bn, with unit sales increasing. The truck
division posted an operating profit of SKr183m, compared with a loss of
SKr586m last time, and increased unit sales by 2 per cent.
Volvo's share of Renault's income stemming from its cross-holdings in the
French group fell sharply to SKr321m from SKr1.02bn but its share of income
from Procordia, the pharmaceuticals and food group it jointly controls with
the Swedish government, grew to SKr1.52bn from SKr887m.
