  [Text] Renowned economist leader of the parliamentary 
faction "Yabloko" Grigoriy Yavlinskiy told Interfax today that 
"in fact, nothing has been altered, they only changed the 
posts," since Sergey Shakhray and Aleksandr Shokhin remained in 
the government. 
  Asked whether the new cabinet will change the course of 
reforms, Yavlinskiy pointed to the fact that the repetition of 
the words "course of reforms" had turned into a kind of prayer, 
"while it is impossible to talk of any course of reforms when 
inflation is back to 30% a month." 
  Leader of the Communist faction in the State Duma Gennadiy 
Zyuganov declined to comment on the decree on the government 
reshuffles. In an interview with Interfax, he pointed out that 
it was not the personal composition of the government that 
should be commented on, but rather its program of economic 
reforms which the deputies still did not know. 
  Zyuganov stressed that he insisted that Prime Minister 
Viktor 
Chernomyrdin should make a report in the parliament on his 
vision of the economic situation in the country and ways to 
surmount the crisis. 
  "Only after we see not only the actual composition of the 
government, but also hear its program, will it be possible to 
decide whether we support it or not," Zyuganov said. 
  So far, the government has been pursuing "the so-called 
Gaydar line which has gone complete bankrupt." Zyuganov pointed 
out that if the reshuffled government continued this line, "the 
economy would collapse in three or four months, and I have no 
doubts that it will be fraught with the most serious social 
turmoils."
