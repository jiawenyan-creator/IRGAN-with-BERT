FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Maintained market share aids Acatos &amp;
Hutcheson
Acatos &amp; Hutcheson, the edible oils and fats manufacturing group, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits up 30 per cent from Pounds 7.83m to Pounds 10.2m
for the 53 weeks ended October 3.
Turnover rose to Pounds 222.1m (Pounds 200.9m for 52 weeks).
Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, said that 'in spite of all our difficulties we
have succeeded in maintaining or improving our market shares in all
principal sectors.'
He expressed confidence in the company's medium to long-term future but said
that 'the threat of increased competition is always with us and this year
there have been some developments which cause me to be cautious in regard to
our likely results in the current year.'
Last month the company announced the closure of its Bootle factory with the
loss over the next 18 months of about 250 jobs. Provisions of Pounds 4.2m
would be 'adequate'.
The board proposed a final dividend of 5p to give a total of 8p (6.5p),
payable from earnings of 20.9p (16.2p).
Operating profits rose to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.1m). The company booked a
Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 1.49m) exceptional charge against rationalisation.
A&amp;H also booked a net Pounds 139,000 one-off charge against goodwill written
off on disposal of a Spanish subsidiary and the recovery of investment in
and loans to former Spanish operations.
This charge compares with last time's Pounds 274,000 gain after some earlier
provisions were released and on the recovery of funds that had been tied up
in former Spanish operations.
