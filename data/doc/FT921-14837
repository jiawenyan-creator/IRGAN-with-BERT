FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's lowers Finnish
foreign-currency debt rate ceiling
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US rating agency, yesterday lowered the
foreign-currency debt rating ceiling for Finland from AA1 to AA2, writes
Sara Webb. The rating agency said Finland's debt service capacity
deteriorated rapidly during 1991 as trade with the Soviet Union collapsed,
demand from western export markets dropped, and the decline in domestic
activity was greater than expected.
It added that demand for Finnish products was unlikely to recover quickly,
given the weak growth outlook for the international economy this year.
The downgrading affects about Dollars 17bn of Finnish debt, according to
Moody's.
In addition, Moody's said that it has lowered the long-term debt ratings for
Finnish Export Credit Corporation, Municipality Finance and Postipankki,
from AA1 to AA2.
