  [Text] The first British-made European Fighter Aircraft 
made its maiden flight today -- and with it went the hopes of 
thousands of British Aerospace workers. 
  Those who turned out to watch history in the making were not 
disappointed. The Eurofighter 2000 completed a perfect 
50-minute test flight in the sky above Lancashire. 
  Flown by British Aerospace Defence Limited Director of 
Flight 
Operations, Chris Yeo, the aircraft took off from BAE's Military 
Aircraft Division Flight Test Facility at Warton, near Preston. 
  Designed to meet the specifications of the four nations 
involved -- the UK, France, Spain and Germany -- each 
Eurofighter 2000 is valued at 20 million pounds. But to British 
Aerospace workforce the true value of the Eurofighter lies in 
the long-term job security it could provide for around 20,000 
workers. 
  After the maiden flight, Chris Yeo praised the performance 
of 
the plane saying: "The aircraft handled extremely well and gave 
a good indication of its performance potential." 
  The Eurofighter 2000 is described as a high-performance, 
agile combat aircraft which is optimised for the air superiority 
role in both beyond visual range and close combat situations. 
  John Weston, chairman and managing director of the British 
Aerospace Defence Limited, said: "We are delighted with the news 
of this important first flight. Like its German counterpart, 
the aircraft performed exactly as expected and we are now 
working closely with Germany to carry out early flight test 
tasks. The success of this programme is essential for the 
European high technology industrial base and for jobs across the 
European aerospace industry."
