FABARES TELLS OF MOTHER'S ALZHEIMER'S 
Television actress Shelley Fabares says Alzheimer's disease robbed her mother 
of the memory that she preferred suicide to suffering from the mind-killing 
affliction. 
Fabares, starring in the "Coach" series, said she learned of her mother's 
preoccupation with the disease after she had to take over her affairs. 
"In taking over her papers, I discovered that she'd been making donations to an 
Alzheimer's association for years," Fabares told an interviewer for Redbook 
magazine. 
"Mother once told my sister that if she ever found out she had Alzheimer's, she 
would kill herself," Fabares said. "Fortunately, by the time she was diagnosed, 
she was too far gone to remember what she'd said." 
Her mother had to be institutionalized in February, the actress said.
