Michigan running back Leroy Hoard, most valuable player of the 1989 Rose Bowl 
game, will forfeit his final year of eligibility and make himself eligible for 
the NFL draft. 
"A lot of my decision had nothing to do with money," Hoard said Thursday. "I 
always wanted a chance to play in the NFL." 
The NFL recently announced that it will accept juniors in the draft April 
22-23. 
Hoard gained 142 yards and scored two touchdowns as the Rose Bowl MVP in 1989 
when Michigan beat USC, 22-14. He gained 108 yards in last January's Rose Bowl 
game, which USC won, 17-10.
