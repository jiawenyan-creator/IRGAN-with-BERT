FT  23 MAR 93 / French Elections: Fall of Sapin, the PM's 'yes man'
FROM the moment that Mr Michel Sapin, the mild-mannered justice minister,
took over as France's finance minister when Mr Pierre Beregovoy assumed the
premiership last year, there was no doubt who was really in charge of the
French economy.
Mr Beregovoy, or Super-Bere as the French press called him in his days at
the Finance Ministry, made it clear from the beginning that he would
continue to control the economy from the prime minister's office in the
Hotel Matignon.
The unfortunate Mr Sapin, 40, had no choice but to spend his 10 months as
finance minister executing the instructions of his predecessor. As if to add
insult to injury, Mr Sapin on Sunday lost his parliamentary seat in the
Hauts-de-Seine district to the west of Paris. Mr Sapin, a career politician
who went into parliament in 1981 shortly after graduating from France's
elite Ecole Nationale de l'Administration, may be seen as a 'yes man', but
at least he is deemed to have played the part efficiently.
He has been as determined as Mr Beregovoy in his defence of the Socialists'
franc fort currency support policy. Indeed, Mr Sapin's only brush with
controversy was his verbal assault on the British and American speculators
who were attacking the franc.
