FT  23 SEP 94 / Australian growth forecasts revised downwards
Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's federal treasurer, yesterday revised downwards
the government's growth forecasts for this year, saying that gross domestic
product would rise by about 4.25 per cent, rather than the 4.5 per cent
predicted in the May budget, Nikki Tait writes.
The revision was triggered by the severe drought which is affecting
agricultural production in the key eastern states of New South Wales and
Queensland. However, Mr Willis suggested that the effect of the drought
would be partly offset by faster-than-expected upturn in international
economies.
