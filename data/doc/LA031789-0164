P.M. BRIEFING; 
DOLLAR RENT A CAR AGENCY EXPANDS 
Dollar Rent A Car Systems of Beverly Hills has joined with a major European 
auto rental firm in a deal that positions Dollar to become the world's largest 
privately held car rental firm, the company's president announced today. 
Although Dollar remains No. 4 behind publicly owned industry leaders Hertz, 
Avis and National, the deal with the former Swan National of Britain expands 
Dollar's international territories and substantially increases the size of its 
fleet. 
The deal also means a name change for Swan, which now is part of the Dollar 
Rent A Car company, Dollar President Henry J. Caruso said in announcing the 
company's expansion. "We are now the largest privately held car rental 
company," Caruso said.
