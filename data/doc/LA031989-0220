POOL COATINGS 
Your article Feb. 18 about pool paint fumes being inhaled in Yorba Linda made 
Poly Plus Pool coatings to be the bad guys. 
Our product is clearly marked. Your reporter should be aware that the problems 
that arose were caused by the following: 
* All solvents are heavier than air and when the air is cool and damp the 
solvents cannot escape from the pool. 
* Our label clearly states: "Danger, Vapor Harmful" along with other warnings. 
We supply a safety data sheet with every order in which it states: "Wear a 
Mask, Goggles, Gloves etc. See Safety Sheet enclosed." 
Last, but not least, it is the responsibility of the contractor to supply his 
people with the proper gear (air mask, etc.) as stated on the safety data 
sheet. This is one of the reasons this sheet is given to the user.
