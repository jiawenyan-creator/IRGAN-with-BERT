FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sony ends word processing
SONY, the Japanese electronics company, is pulling out of word processor
manufacturing in a move that reflects its falling fortunes in the
highly-competitive market.
The company will cut production gradually of its PJ700 word processor and
not develop a successor. The decision reflects a growing trend within the
Japanese industry to withdraw from unprofitable products.
