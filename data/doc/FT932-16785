FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: 'Laser card' fraud crackdown - At a
Glance
National &amp; Provincial has launched a credit card with a laser-engraved
photograph and signature. Its 300,000 Visa card customers will be offered
the new card at the end of April in an attempt to counter rising credit card
fraud, which cost the society Pounds 1m last year. The loss for the industry
was Pounds 165m.
By using a laser, the photograph and signature are burnt through the
laminated surface of the card and into its plastic core, making them
difficult to tamper with.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been using photographs on 31,000 high
value cheque guarantee cards as part of a pilot study, says that none had
been fraudulently misused even after reported lost or stolen.
