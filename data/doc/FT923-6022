FT  27 AUG 92 / Pounds 20,000 fine imposed after roof fall death
LEICESTER magistrates yesterday imposed a record fine of Pounds 20,000 plus
costs on a company which broke health and safety rules. The offences came to
light after an employee died when he fell through a roof.
The Alexandra Stone Company was fined Pounds 18,000 after pleading guilty to
failing to display a warning notice on the roof and a further Pounds 2,000
because other safety precautions had not been taken.
The fine was the highest since higher limits for fines by magistrates were
introduced earlier this year. Under the Offshore Safety Act 1992, certain
health and safety offences committed on or after March 6 became subject to
maximum fines of Pounds 20,000. The previous limit had been Pounds 2,000.
The new maximum also applies to Sheriffs' courts in Scotland.
Alexandra Stone is based in Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire, and produces
paving slabs and kerbstones.
The man who died was Mr Amrik Singh, 56, a production foreman who had worked
for the company for more than 30 years. He fell through the asbestos cement
roof while walking along a valley gutter.
