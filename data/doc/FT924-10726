FT  29 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sun sells L &amp; M holding
LIFE assurance group London &amp; Manchester (L &amp; M) was the market's heaviest
traded stock after Sun Alliance, the big composite insurance company, sold
most of its long-standing near 9 per cent stake in the life group.
The deal was executed via a 'bought deal' carried out jointly by Cazenove
and SG Warburg Securities. Cazenove/Warburg paid 252p a share for the 9.5m L
&amp; M shares and placed them with institutions at 255p a share, indicating a
profit of Pounds 285,000 for the two brokers. L &amp; M eased 6 to 264p as news
of the placing circulated. Turnover reached 23m shares.
The Cazenove/Warburg Securities alliance has been very active in most recent
insurance sector deals. The two broking firms jointly carried out the
placing of 60m shares in Commercial Union for Sun Alliance in September,
also via a bought deal, while Cazenove singly placed a Canadian Refuge's 10
per cent stake in Refuge Assurance earlier this month. In another joint
bought deal this month the pair netted a profit of more than Pounds 1.3m by
buying and selling a 9 per cent stake in Anglian Water previously held by
Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Sun Alliance has held the L &amp; M stake in its non-life fund since 1965 and is
thought to have retained a block of about 1m shares in L &amp; M shares in its
life assurance fund. Sun Alliance shares edged up to 317p on turnover of
1.6m.
Marks disappoints
A sense of disappointment pervaded the market as it assessed interim results
from Marks and Spencer and marked the shares back in heavy trading of 11m.
While the high street retailer turned in commendable figures largely in line
with market expectations, it was the continued gloomy outlook for consumer
spending that depressed many analysts. This is likely to pin back the
group's prospects significantly, as its margin increase shows signs of
decline and sales growth is pushed to the fore.
There was also a view that the shares were on too high a rating, having run
ahead in recent weeks ahead of yesterday's results. This, together with the
market's cautious view on Marks' sales prospects, left the shares adrift 15
1/2 at 327 1/2 p, amid a flurry of downgrades and, in some cases, a change
of sentiment. Among these, Nomura, moving from a hold to a sell, chopped its
full-year forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 735m, while Smith New Court
slashed it by Pounds 20m to Pounds 710m.
Pearson setback
Publishing and leisure conglomerate Pearson suffered a double hit yesterday
as two influential securities houses pre-empted visits to the company and
voiced concern over trading prospects. Agency broker James Capel cut
forecasts while Smith New Court reinforced its sell stance.
When the shares began to fall in the morning there was speculation that
Pearson's broker, Cazenove, was behind the weakness. Cazenove never comments
publicly on market rumour.
However, James Capel cut its 1992 forecast by Pounds 14m to Pounds 144m, not
the bottom of the range but well below the consensus. Capel says the group's
oil services division continues to suffer, and that it expects no good news
from the regional newspaper arm which it will visit today. Meanwhile, Smith
said it was reviewing its estimate and suggested it would be coming down to
between Pounds 140m and Pounds 145m. Pearson shares fell 31 to 342p with
1.8m traded.
A volatile day's trading saw British Aerospace shares close steady at 138p
as contrary rumours buffeted the embattled electronics to engineering group.
The shares were off 11 in early trading as fresh doubts were reported via
the Continental press concerning the future of the European Fighter Aircraft
project. They then recovered on reports that an official Saudi Arabian news
agency quoted a government source as being positive about the future of the
lucrative Al-Yamamah contract.
Turnover was a chunky 11m, with most of this accounted for by two large
trades of 4.3m shares each, one at 133p a share and the other at 134p.
Food equipment manufacturer APV was the subject of downgrades from two
brokers and the shares retreated 5 1/2 to 78p. Delta too was hit by a
revision, this time by Kleinwort Benson. The shares fell 24 to 389p.
HSBC were extremely active again in the banking sector, closing a net 4 off
at 500p, on turnover of 8.6m that included a trade of 3m shares at 500p.
A recent broker's buy recommendation continued to drive the insurance
broking sector higher. Lloyd Thompson was the star performer in the sector,
adding 15 more to 238p while Lowndes Lambert rose 6 to 277p.
The water/electricity utilities continued to move up strongly, responding
still to the positive note issued by County NatWest and belief that these
sectors were oversold during last week's surge of demand towards the
cyclical stocks.
County said it expected the water sector to outperform the electricity
stocks because of the more attractive interim/final dividend split and the
fact that the water companies' interim season starts next week, before an
electricity sector that is still facing scrutiny from the industry
regulator.
Thames, biggest of the water companies by market capitalisation, jumped 13
to 480p on 1.4m traded, Anglian 10 to 449p on 1m, and Severn Trent 9 to
433p. Southern Electric, the only regional electricity stock in the Footsie
100, put on 9 to 396p on turnover of 1.9m.
British Airways fell 14 1/2 to 281p as Kleinworth Benson chopped its
forecast combined with worries over the possibility of a rights issue to
fund the Dan-Air takeover.
BT 'old' shares slipped 4 more to 364 1/2 p on 4.5m traded and the 'new' 3
down at 260 1/2 p, on 3.8m, still unsettled by worries that the UK
Government may move to sell its remaining 21 per cent stake in the company
next year.
A good set of figures from Wellcome was not enough to lift the share price,
which fell 15 to 985p. The full-year profit was in the middle of the range
of forecasts.
Glaxo experienced very heavy turnover boosted by the arrival of one investor
offloading 2.8m shares at 776 1/2 p, well below the market price. The shares
closed 4 off at 799p on total turnover of 12m.
Pharmaceuticals and chemicals company ICI shed 23 at 1050p as County NatWest
reinforced pessimism over prospects ahead of third-quarter results due
today. County expects ICI profits to drop by nearly a half to Pounds 105m
and those for the year so far to be down by 25 per cent at Pounds 525m.
Chemicals group BOC fell 9 to 694p as Credit Lyonnais Laing issued a sell
recommendation and shaved its 1993 profit forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds
385m.
Specialist chemicals group Croda put on 7 at 217p. Analysts said the company
had been seeing shareholders.
In the drinks sector, Guinness tumbled 16 to 533p on weak third-quarter
figures from French group LVMH, which has a 24 per cent cross-holding.
Reuters Holdings lost 22 at 1198p as BZW dropped its profit forecast for
next year by Pounds 15m to Pounds 440m.
Analyst Mr Paul Norris said revenue growth would be flat at 5 per cent and
the group would be affected by continuing weakness in Japan and the UK. He
added that although Reuters was still in good shape, the shares were not
worth buying until they fell to 1150p.
Bank note printer De La Rue fell 23 to 636p on low turnover as at least one
big securities house advised clients that the shares had moved up too far.
