FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Disney boosted by film and
consumer product arms
STRONG gains from Walt Disney's film and consumer product divisions
propelled the company's third-quarter net earnings 33 per cent higher on
revenues which grew 23 per cent.
For the three months to end-June, Disney posted net income of Dollars
220.8m, or 41 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.85bn. The results
compared with earnings of Dollars 165.5m, or 31 cents, in the second quarter
of last year, on revenues of Dollars 1.51bn.
The strongest boost to Disney's earnings came from its film division, where
operating income jumped 70 per cent to Dollars 134.3m, against Dollars 79.1m
a year earlier. The increase came on the back of a 21 per cent improvement
in revenues to Dollars 723.8m, against Dollars 597.1m.
The company's theme park division saw a 10 per cent improvement in operating
income to Dollars 194.3m from Dollars 176.5m, on revenues which rose 17 per
cent to Dollars 890.5m, against Dollars 759m.
The theme park results benefited from the Easter holiday falling in this
year's third quarter. A year earlier, only part of the Easter period was in
the third quarter. Investment in Euro Disney cut into the strong results
from domestic theme parks and resorts.
Disney's consumer products business posted a 31 per cent increase in
operating income to Dollars 60.8m, on revenues which climbed 54 per cent to
Dollars 239.2m.
For the first nine months, the company had net income of Dollars 593m, or
Dollars 1.11 a share, against Dollars 462.6m, or 87 cents, in the
year-earlier period. Revenues were 23 per cent higher at Dollars 5.45bn.
