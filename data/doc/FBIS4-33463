  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
confirmed at noon on 4 June that Eduardo Duhalde will be his 
running mate on the 1995 presidential ticket if the latter is 
prevented from seeking his reelection as Buenos Aires Province 
governor. Duhalde publicly confirmed that this is indeed the 
case. 
  Speaking during a news conference he held at noon at 
Duhalde's Don Tomas villa in San Vicente, Menem also forecast 
that the PJ [Justicialist Party] will win next year's 
presidential elections "by obtaining 45 percent of the votes, 
and will beat the second largest vote-getter by more than 10 
percent." 
  Before the new conference, the chief executive dedicated 250 
new housing units in San Vicente's Eva Peron neighborhood. 
During this ceremony Menem said he was convinced that Duhalde 
will be given a chance to seek his reelection "provided the 
people of Buenos Aires start pushing for it." 
  Menem currently is playing a soccer match at the Don Tomas 
villa. He then will join Duhalde for a barbecue and watch the 
soccer match between Argentina and Croatia. Menem forecast that 
"the Argentine team will win 3-1" [Argentina and Croatia tied 
0-0].
