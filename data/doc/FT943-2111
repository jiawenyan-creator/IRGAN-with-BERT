FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Security industry curbs
demanded
Delegates approved a resolution calling for a statutory licensing system for
the private security industry.
Mr David Heath, chairman of the Avon and Somerset police authority, led
complaints about the ease with which 'cowboy' operators were able to set up
businesses.
At the moment, he said, a man could walk out of Wormwood Scrubs prison,
equip himself with a peaked cap and an alsatian dog and call himself a
private security controller.
Mr Alan Beith, party spokesman on home affairs in the Commons, attacked Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, for transferring his department's
traditional responsibilities to the private sector.
He endorsed warnings by other constituency delegates that permitting private
security companies to mount street patrols could lead to vigilantes taking
the law into their own hands.
Mr Beith said: 'Privatisation of the work of the police is a particularly
dangerous trend.'
