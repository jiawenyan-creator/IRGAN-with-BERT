FT  01 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Brewery work for Galliford Midlands
GALLIFORD MIDLANDS, the Wolvey-based construction company, has won a series
of orders with a total value in excess of Pounds 9.5m for brewing giant
Bass.
At Burton on Trent, Galliford is already well into the construction of a
Pounds 1.5m technical centre for research and development, which is due for
completion in March 1993.
The bulk of the work, over Pounds 8m, will be carried out at the Cape Hill
Brewery in Birmingham. Gallifords' work includes a Pounds 4.9m packaging
hall and warehouse, a Pounds 1.6m filter room and bright beer tanks with
bridge link and a Pounds 1.5m extension to the brewhouse.
The projects are part of the 'Cape 94' scheme, which is a Pounds 53m
investment being undertaken by Bass to meet the needs of Bass Export and the
domestic specialist bottled beer market.
All the work at Cape Hill will be completed by November 1993, with the plant
being fully operational by the spring of 1994.
