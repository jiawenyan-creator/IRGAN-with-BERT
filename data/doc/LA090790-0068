WESTERN BANKS OUTPERFORM OTHERS IN U.S. 
The nation's banking system slid further downhill during the second quarter, 
but Western states, bucking the broader trend, enjoyed relatively stable 
profits and a declining number of delinquent real estate loans, federal 
officials reported Thursday. 
Commercial banks nationwide suffered a steep 24% profit decline during April, 
May and June as they set aside large sums to cover expected losses on real 
estate and loans to developing countries, according to a new study by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
The deepening recession in New England, accompanied by growing delinquencies in 
real estate lending in the region, was responsible for much of the $2 billion 
put in reserve for future losses for banks nationwide. 
In sharp contrast, "California continues to show good results -- at this time, 
the West is clearly looking strong," FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said at a 
news conference. 
The Western region, dominated by California, reported increased profits for the 
quarter. California banks substantially increased real estate lending, but it 
was primarily residential mortgages, the "safest kind of lending," Seidman 
said. 
The nationwide results are "clearly a mixed bag," he said. The kind of real 
estate woes afflicting New England are now being duplicated in less severe 
fashion in the middle Atlantic states and the Southeast, according to the FDIC. 
The number of delinquent loans -- those overdue 90 days or more -- is growing 
steadily throughout the East, the agency said. 
The nation's 12,500 commercial banks recorded profits of $5.3 billion during 
the second quarter, down from $7 billion earned in the same period a year ago. 
Profits plunged 63% in the Northeast region. "The credit quality problems of 
banks in the Northeast were not limited to real estate assets," the FDIC said 
in a quarterly bank profile issued Thursday. "Commercial credits, loans to 
developing countries and consumer loans all showed weakness, reflecting the 
increasing difficulties facing many large regional and money-center 
institutions." 
The real estate slump in New England has spread to Eastern and Southeastern 
states, dragging down bank earnings. Profits also fell in the central region of 
the country, the agency reported. 
By contrast, profits rose 4% in the West, climbing to $1.27 billion from $1.22 
billion a year earlier. The region includes California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, 
Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii. 
California generated most of the earnings, with second-quarter profits of $906 
million, down 7% from $977 million in the year-ago period. 
Across the country, the banking system has continued to shift significantly 
into real estate lending, the FDIC said. "This is not an adverse factor if done 
on a sound basis," Seidman said. "Clearly banks are picking up some of the 
business S&amp;Ls used to do." 
Overall, banks increased their real estate lending by 11%, while in California 
the increase was a hefty 30%. Home mortgages increased more than $5 billion, an 
11% rise, while home equity loans rose $1.1 billion, or 13%, in the quarter. 
"California indicators are showing very favorably," said Ross Waldrop, 
financial analyst in the FDIC's research division. "The growth in assets is 
well above the national average. Banks are making more loans, and we have yet 
to see signs of problems surfacing." 
Only 1.44% of real estate loans in California were listed as noncurrent on 
payments, compared to a national figure of 3.45%. 
Significantly, the delinquent share of real estate loans held by California 
banks fell by about 1%, while the bad portfolio nationally rose 14.2%. 
Nevertheless, federal officials see potential weaknesses for California in the 
high vacancy rates reported in some areas for office and commercial buildings. 
"We are watching it carefully," Seidman said. "The ability to absorb (the empty 
floor space) depends on the strength of the economy." 
California's bullish statistics were tempered by a warning that the state may 
not be immune from the problems affecting other regions. 
"Experience in the Southwest and New England shows that problems can continue 
to appear long after the growth stops," the FDIC report said. "Consequently, we 
are not abandoning our concerns about the impact of slower markets on the 
health of the Western banks." 
The Persian Gulf crisis should help the oil-producing states in the Southwest, 
where increased revenues from higher petroleum prices will boost local 
economies, generating new bank loans and helping depressed real estate prices, 
according to FDIC officials. 
New England, already staggering under the biggest concentrations of problem 
loans, will be hurt even more by higher costs for heating oil and other fuels 
during the coming winter season, the report warned.
