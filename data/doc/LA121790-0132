BROWNS PROVIDE LESSONS IN LOYALTY; 
FOOTBALL: TEACHERS SAY STUDENTS PROFIT FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE CLEVELAND TEAM 
AS IT ENDS ITS LOSING STREAK. 
The beleaguered Cleveland Browns are providing the inspiration for young 
students at a Summit County school where lessons in loyalty are being taught. 
Teachers at Cathedral Christian School say it is important to show children 
that sometimes loyalty means sticking around during a losing streak. 
And what better example to stand beside than the Browns, who improved to 3-11 
and ended an eight-game skid with Sunday's 13-10 win over Atlanta? 
"It's part of a series of teachings about being faithful and fickle," said 
Melanie Kemp, administrator of the nondenominational school. "Being faithful as 
a fan is one of the little things of life. But being faithful as a fan teaches 
you how you can be faithful in relationships, faithful in keeping your word and 
faithful in carrying out your responsibilities." 
Pupils at Cathedral, pre-kindergarten through the seventh grade, have been 
sporting Browns duds -- hats, T-shirts and fake dog ears -- even through the 
team's lopsided losses. 
About 115 of them barked and cheered their way through a pep rally for the 
Browns on Friday. The barking was higher-pitched than the woofs emanating from 
the Cleveland Stadium's rowdy "Dawg Pound" bleacher section, but the little 
fans' fervor was there. 
"Our philosophy here is that a kid remembers 10% of what he hears, 50% of what 
he sees and 80% of what he does," said Kemp, who also teaches history. "We 
think it's very important to involve the kids and let them learn." 
Browns prizes were awarded to pupils for creating the best posters. Caps, 
sweatbands and field towels were handed out, and one student got a pair of 
tickets for Sunday's game.
