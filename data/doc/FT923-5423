FT  01 SEP 92 / UK Company News: IoM Steam drops 56%
IN THE first half of 1992, pre-tax profits of Isle of Man Steam Packet fell
56 per cent, from Pounds 821,000 to Pounds 360,000. Turnover rose 3 per cent
to 11.3m.
Passenger traffic declined by some 5-6 per cent, said Mr David Dixon,
managing director. However, the freight business held steady.
Although fares increased in line with inflation, the decline in passenger
traffic held back the advance in sales.
Profits were depressed by a series of one-off factors, including Pounds
145,000 in redundancies and Pounds 265,000 in overhaul costs. Last year,
those costs had been taken in the second half.
Earnings per share were halved to 2.5p (4.9p). The interim dividend is again
3p.
Mr Norman Corlett, the chairman who led the fight against a hostile bid from
the Bermuda-based Sea Containers, is retiring because of family illness. An
announcement on his successor is expected shortly.
Mr Dixon said the situation remained uncertain with Sea Containers, which
launched and then postponed a hostile Pounds 17.5m bid in 1990. 'We think
(they) are being jolly rotten in not saying anything. It has been very
unsettling for management and staff.' Sea Containers holds 41 per cent of
Steam Packet.
