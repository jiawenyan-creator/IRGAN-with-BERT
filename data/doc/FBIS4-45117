  [Text] A news conference held in Usti nad Orlici today was 
dedicated to the alleged production of virological and 
bacteriological weapons in Techonin, East Bohemian region. Our 
correspondent Zdena Cela filed this telephone dispatch: 
  [Cela] The military Immunology and Bacteriology Research 
Institute in Techonin in Usti nad Orlici district has never 
produced, developed, or stored military bacteriological weapons. 
This is what Dr. Jiri Beran, dean of the Hradec Kralove-based 
Military Medical Academy who is in charge of scientific work, 
told the news conference today. Development of a combat 
biological agent is above all a matter for top scientists in the 
sphere of gene handling and genetic engineering, Beran went on 
to say. The point is that all the agents have been identified 
[zmapovat] and if one wants to develop a new agent, a new part 
of a genetic information [carrier] would have to be inserted [in 
the already identified agents]. No work has ever been done on 
this subject at the Military Medical Academy. 
  Dr. Beran explained the attacks waged by CESKY DENIK in 
March 
this year by saying that editors have little knowledge of the 
subject and are unwilling to look deeper into the problem. 
  The matter is being investigated by the Defense Ministry 
inspection team and by an interministerial commission.
