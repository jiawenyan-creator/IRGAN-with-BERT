FT  16 APR 92 / People: From a Duke to a Prince
Jimmy James, a veteran of the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate, and a
director of the Royal Bank of Scotland, is to take over the management of
the Duchy of Cornwall for the Prince of Wales from July next year. He
succeeds David Landale, who retires then.
Officially entitled 'Secretary and Keeper of the Records of the Duchy',
James will be familiar with the Prince of Wales's philosophy in forming
policy for the management of the land, residential and commercial property
because he has been on the Prince's Council, the Duchy's governing body,
since 1984.
Whatever he may think about such challenges as Poundbury, the model country
town Britain's future king wants to build in one corner of his land, James
comes to the Duchy at 57 as a hard-nosed real estate manager who is credited
with helping to bring Grosvenor into the modern world. A chartered surveyor
by training, he joined the Grosvenor Estate in 1961, and, since 1971, has
been executive trustee for the Estate's interests in Britain and overseas.
