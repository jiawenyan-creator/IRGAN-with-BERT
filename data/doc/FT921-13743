FT  20 JAN 92 / Peter Parker is chairman of Mirror MBO team
SIR Peter Parker, former chairman of British Rail, was yesterday named as
chairman of the management consortium hoping to buy Mirror Group Newspapers.
The appointment of a senior businessman such as Sir Peter, who until
recently was chairman of the Rockware Group, could add weight to the buy-out
team led by Mr Richard Stott, Daily Mirror editor.
'It is an utterly worthwhile thing and I have the time and space to do it,'
said Sir Peter yesterday. He is also chairman of Evered Bardon the quarry
and building products group, Whitehead Mann the London-based headhunters,
Mitsubishi Electric UK and of the governors of the London School of
Economics. Sir Peter, 67, is ideologically compatible with the
left-of-centre MGN group. He stood, unsuccessfully, as Labour candidate for
Bedford in 1951, although now he is a Liberal Democrat.
Like other potential bidders for MGN, the management buy-out team cannot
make a firm offer for the company until details of its assets and
liabilities are available, following the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
Large sums are missing from both MGN and its pension fund. The Maxwell
private interests which hold 51 per cent of MGN's shares are in
administration.
The options for financing the buy-out, which is being backed by Electra, the
venture group, include issuing a convertible bond and a straight cash
purchase.
Apart from the management team, Hambros Bank has said it is looking at the
possibility of putting a consortium together.
