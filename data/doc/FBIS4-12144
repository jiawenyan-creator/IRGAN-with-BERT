  [Text] President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has pleaded for a high 
degree of restraint and patience in the Cameroonian and Nigerian 
border dispute in bringing a lasting settlement between the two 
countries. 
  Speaking to a special envoy of President Paul Biya of 
Cameroon, who called on him this afternoon at the State House in 
Dar es Salaam, President Mwinyi said that there was a need for 
every effort to be employed in order to avoid further turmoil. 
The president said Tanzania would encourage the OAU to use its 
good offices to prove to the world its capability and resolve to 
settle African issues amicably. 
  President Mwinyi was pleased to learn that the necessary 
contacts had already been made with the UN Security Council and 
the International Court of Justice in order to resolve the 
border issue between the two countries.
