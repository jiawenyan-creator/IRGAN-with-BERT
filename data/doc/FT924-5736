FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sims Food shares fall as profits decline
26% to Pounds 2.48m
SHARES IN Sims Food Group shed 16p to 205p as the meat processor and
supplier revealed a 26 per cent decline, from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 2.48m,
in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30.
In July, when the company revealed a 13 per cent advance to Pounds 9.31m for
the year to March 31, Mr John Stone, chairman, warned that 'a disappointing
trend' that had begun at the beginning of 1992 would continue through the
period under review.
Mr David Brady, finance director, explained yesterday that Sims had seen
nine months when there had been 'a unique combination' of a shortage of
supply (especially in beef, but also in lamb), coupled with a slight drop in
demand. Further, there was abattoir over-capacity, which chased livestock
prices up.
However, he added that the company had increased its market share in all its
divisions, although at reduced margins. Group turnover rose 23 per cent to
Pounds 144.2m.
Debt is traditionally high in the build-up to Christmas and was Pounds 19m
at the period-end, giving gearing of 54 per cent. This should reduce to
Pounds 15m and about 35 per cent by the year-end. Earnings shrank to 5.3p
(8.7p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 3p.
