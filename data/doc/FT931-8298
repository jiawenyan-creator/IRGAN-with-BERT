FT  19 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong rises 1.6% as
Tokyo shows modest loss
TECHNICAL trading dominated activity as most investors remained on the
sidelines to observe movements on the currency and bond markets after
President Bill Clinton's economic statement in the US, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average declined 27.49 to 16,982.14, having moved between
17,156.72 in the morning session and 16,974.62 in late trading.
Volume rose to 250m shares but from Wednesday's meagre 207m, as gainers led
losers by 547 to 395, with 182 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks lost 0.15 to 1,293.12, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index edged up 0.79 to 1,037.59.
Buying by public funds was countered by selling by investment trusts, while
short-term traders and dealers sought large-capital steels and other theme
stocks.
Mr Bill Clinton's policy announcement, presented during the lunch hour in
Tokyo, had little effect on prices. Mr Yuichi Kohashi, analyst at Daiwa
Securities, said: 'The tax hikes had little news value for the market, and
we would have to wait for the long-term impact on the foreign exchange and
interest rates.'
Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, firmed Y1 to Y295 after reporting
a better than expected dividend yield of some 2 per cent, against estimates
of 0.9 per cent. Other large-capital issues attracting interest included
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Y1 harder at Y507.
Nagase, a trading house specialising in chemical products, forged ahead Y32
to Y906 on the Aids theme - the company's subsidiary is currently developing
an anti-Aids drug. Kanematsu, a medium-sized trading house, moved ahead Y4
to Y416 on the same theme.
High-technology shares continued to weaken on worries over the high yen and
faltering demand. Hitachi dipped Y2 to Y676 and Fujitsu finished Y4 cheaper
at Y525.
TDK, the tape manufacturer, declined Y50 to Y3,340 on reports that it would
post a 26 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y9bn, sharply
lower than previous estimates of Y36bn.
Housing issues were stronger on hopes of a recovery in demand. Haseko gained
Y8 at Y610 and Shokusan Jutaku Sogo closed Y12 to the good at Y515. However,
Daikyo, the leading condominium builder, softened Y2 to Y882 on
profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 87.17 to 18,419.81 in volume of 79.1m
shares.
Roundup
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's economic statement received mixed reactions from
the region's markets yesterday.
HONG KONG, encouraged by reports that China had freed a political dissident
and on optimism that UK-Sino tensions were easing, saw the Hang Seng index
rise 99.48, or 1.6 per cent, to 6,186.94. Turnover was good at HKDollars
3.7bn following Wednesday's HKDollars 3.2bn.

the day's most active issues, climbing HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars 50.50.
MANILA advanced some 3.5 per cent on hopes that a new oil field will provide
most of the country's needs. The composite index put on 49.15 at 1,458.26 in
turnover of some 255m pesos.
Investors were also encouraged by a good overnight performance in the US
from Philippine Long Distance Tele-phone, which appreciated 25 pesos to 910
pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR retreated slightly in spite of an easing in interest rates. The
composite index slipped 2.70 to 623.11 in turnover of MDollars 591m.

buying. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 15.57 ahead at 1,632.13 in
turnover of SDollars 166m.
AUSTRALIA retained early gains and banks continued to be supported by hopes
that a change in government after next month's elections would lead to
mergers in the sector. The All Ordinaries index closed 6 higher at 1,607.3.
ANZ, favoured as a merger candidate, added 2 cents at ADollars 3.40 in
volume of some 3.8m shares. Among other banks, Commonwealth gained 2 cents
at ADollars 6.62 but Westpac surrendered 4 cents to ADollars 3.23.

Investment, which has been forced to defer repaying matured deposits. The
SET index lost 11.81 to 961.43 in low turnover of Bt6.75bn.
NEW ZEALAND followed Wednesday's weakness with another setback of 9.78 in
the NZSE-40 index to 1,590.93, with Telecom declining 8 cents to NZDollars
2.67.
