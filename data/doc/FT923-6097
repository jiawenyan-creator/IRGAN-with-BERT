FT  26 AUG 92 / Malaysia makes plea over Malacca Strait
MALAYSIA has appealed for financial help from countries using the Strait of
Malacca in order to purchase navigation and monitoring equipment.
The appeal comes after a cruise liner carrying more than 530 passengers and
crew sank in the Strait following a collision early on Sunday morning with a
fishing vessel. At least two people were killed and up to 11 others are
missing, believed dead.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, said it was only fair that
those using the Strait should pay for its upkeep. .
He said the Strait, through which up to 2,000 vessels pass every 24 hours,
should be treated in a similar way to the Suez or Panama canals. In the past
Malaysia has suggested that a levy be imposed on countries or ships using
the Strait, a move firmly opposed by shipping companies.
Naval vessels with divers were trying to find the wreck of the Royal
Pacific, which was on a trip advertised as a 'Cruise to Nowhere'.
Most of the survivors were picked up by passing ships and brought to
Singapore, where the cruise started on Friday.
Three naval vessels are searching for the eight missing people - five
Singaporeans, one American, one Burmese and one Indonesian.
