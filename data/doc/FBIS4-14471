  [Text] The North Ossetia Federal Assembly has extended for 
two months, starting at 1400 today, the state of emergency on a 
part of the territory of Mozdok, Pravoberezhnyy, and Prigorodnyy 
rayons, and also at Vladikavkaz Airport. 
  North Ossetian deputies have addressed a message to the 
leadership of the Russian Federation. They refer to the 
continuing tense situation in those North Ossetian rayons 
neighboring with Ingushetia as a reason why it has become 
necessary to extend the state of emergency.
