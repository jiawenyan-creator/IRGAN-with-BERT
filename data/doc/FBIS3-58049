  [Excerpts] Bonn/Tehran (DPA) -- The Federal Government 
trusts that the death sentence confirmed by the Supreme Court in 
Tehran against German engineer Helmut Szimkus will not be 
carried out. "The assurance given on this by the Iranian 
Government still applies," Minister of State Bernd Schmidbauer 
(Christian Democratic Union) told BILD newspaper today. 
  Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said the government will 
also bring public pressure to bear in order to obtain a pardon 
for the German, who was convicted of spying for Iraq. It will 
be made clear to the Iranian Government that it is in its own 
interests to grant the appeal for a pardon, Vogel said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Vogel pointed out that carrying out the death sentence could 
have an unfavorable effect on German public opinion. Attitudes 
could worsen to Iran's detriment. In any case, the Federal 
Government regards the accused as "basically innocent." [passage
