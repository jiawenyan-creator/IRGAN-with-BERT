FT  13 AUG 93 / Technology: Testing time for expectant mothers - Worth
Watching
A simple blood test, which could definitively inform expectant mothers
whether their child has genetic abnormalities, is being developed by the
Applied Imaging Corporation of Santa Clara, and the UK's Medical Research
Council.
The only method of prenatal genetic screening in widespread use today is
amniocentesis, an invasive procedure involving the removal of some of the
amniotic fluid surrounding the foetus.
Recently it has become apparent that small numbers of the unborn child's
cells enter the mother's bloodstream. The test being developed extracts
these cells for genetic analysis. Researchers believe it will prove a less
expensive and risky alternative to the amniocentesis test. Applied Imaging
