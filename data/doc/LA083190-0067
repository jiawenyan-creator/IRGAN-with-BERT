VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
COUNCIL TO CONSIDER HOME LOAN BONDS 
The Thousand Oaks City Council will discuss Tuesday night whether to issue 
tax-exempt municipal bonds to provide low-interest loans to first-time home 
buyers. 
Under the plan, buyers would be able to borrow up to $175,000 to purchase 
houses and condominiums in the city. 
If the council approves the loans, Thousand Oaks would issue $31.5 million in 
tax-exempt municipal bonds to cover 200 loans at 3%-under-market interest 
rates. 
To qualify for the loans, buyers must have annual incomes lower than $51,200, 
he said. TINA DAUNT
