FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: McLeod Russell takes control at
UCI
McLeod Russell, part of the Khaitan group tea plantation group, yesterday
completed its purchase of a controlling interest of Union Carbide India
(UCI) when it paid Rs2.9bn (Dollars 92.45m) for the 50.9 per cent holding
held by Union Carbide Corporation of the US, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta.
The payment was received by Sir Ian Percival, trustee of the Bhopal Hospital
Trust to which Union Carbide had entrusted the controlling block of UCI. Sir
Ian said: 'The Trust will now get down to building a Rs1.2bn hospital for
the victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.'
McLeod Russell will now be making an offer to buy the shares of UCI from the
minority shareholders at Rs175 a share, the price it paid for the Union
Carbide holding.
