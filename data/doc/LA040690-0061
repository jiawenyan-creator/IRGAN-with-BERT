STAGE REVIEW; 
'CIRQUE DU SUNDAY' RECOVERS WELL 
Despite a rocky start, "Cirque du Sunday," the latest show from the Groundlings 
second-stringers, isn't far behind the current efforts of the first-stringers. 
An ineffective one-joke take-off on Cirque du Soleil opened the show Sunday. 
Though it was followed by a quartet of sensitive wranglers singing a clever rap 
ditty, the next few sketches were uninspired. A nerd's tour of his home was the 
show's nadir -- the one sketch where you could really tell the difference 
between first-string and second-string work. 
Yet the next sketch, about a couple of complainers at a deli, bristled with the 
energy of a raucous cartoon; credit writers/performers Corky Omine and Billy 
Wright. 
Audrey Rapoport followed with a surprisingly subtle examination of an Orange 
County Republican activist handling an awkward moment at a lecture, and she and 
Mary Scheer were hilarious as two smiling drill team members in a halftime 
show. Scheer changed course radically to become a voice-ravaged habitue of the 
"Ashtray Inn." 
A whodunit sketch that opened the second act was forgettable, but affectionate 
portraits of goofily enthusiastic teachers, by Sean Whalen and John Cervenka, 
were memorable. 
Cathy Shambley directed this "Cirque," including the fairly sharp improvisatory 
set at the end. 
At 7307 Melrose Ave., Sundays at 7:30 p.m., indefinitely. $9.50; (213) 
934-9700.
