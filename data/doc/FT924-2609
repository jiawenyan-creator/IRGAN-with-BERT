FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Dunkeld takes the plunge into financial
restructure
DUNKELD GROUP, the small shirt manufacturer that has mustered the support of
the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board and the Bank of England in
its struggle for survival, yesterday announced a further restructuring and
two acquisitions, writes Richard Gourlay.
The Northern Ireland and London-based Dunkeld has convinced its bankers,
Hill Samuel, to convert Pounds 5.9m of debt into equity.
Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance, Dunkeld's advisers, is also raising
Pounds 1.7m in a share placing which will be at a price equivalent to 35p
after a share consolidation.
The reorganisation means that one year after Dunkeld nearly slipped into
bankruptcy, the Pounds 8.1m deficit on revenue reserves before yesterday's
deal is to be eliminated allowing the company to resume paying a dividend.
In parallel with the reorganisation of the balance sheet, Dunkeld is beefing
up its operations.
The group is paying Pounds 1.05m, mostly in cash, to Celestion Industries
for its Slix ladies swimwear business.
The company is also buying Tern Consulate, a private company that designs
and supplies branded shirts and is under license to Dunkeld. Tern belongs to
Mr Richard Lawson, a Dunkeld director, who is taking mostly shares in
consideration for his interests.
The IDB, which supports employment creation in the province, is also
converting Pounds 876,000 of preference shares into new equity, taking the
its stake to 4.2 per cent.
Dunkeld, formerly Aitch and before that Munton Group, also forecast pre-tax
profits of not less than Pounds 325,000 for the year to November 30 and not
less than Pounds 2.4m after extraordinary items.
Following the capital reorganisation Dunkeld will have a market
capitalisation of over Pounds 10.6m. Dunkeld's debt will fall from Pounds
13.1 m to Pounds 6.7m.
