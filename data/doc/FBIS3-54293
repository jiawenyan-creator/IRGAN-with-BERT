  [Excerpt] Sanaa--The preparations for a meeting of the 
leaders of Yemen's ruling coalition parties to sign the document 
of pledge and accord are facing numerous difficulties, the most 
significant being disagreement over the venue. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from highly placed political 
sources in the government coalition that the committee charged 
with making the arrangements for the meeting continued its 
deliberations in Sanaa yesterday under the chairmanship of 
Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib. 
It held its first meeting the day before yesterday but failed 
to reach agreement because of the vast difference between the 
proposals submitted by the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] and 
the General People's Congress [GPC]. 
  The sources confirmed that the YSP suggested holding the 
meeting for signing the document in the Jordanian capital Amman 
under Arab and international sponsorship to guarantee 
implementation of the agreement as the basis for building the 
Yemeni state. The GPC, however, initially rejected that 
proposal and insisted that the signing should take place in any 
Yemeni city. 
  A high-ranking GPC source has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih expressed willingness to sign the 
agreement with his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Sanaa, Aden, or 
any other Yemeni city, but he does not want to go abroad because 
he does not want the issue to assume an international dimension. 
Political sources close to the coalition leadership, however, 
have stated that the GPC agreed late yesterday to the meeting 
being held in Amman provided that the president and Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid return to Aden, after which the 
president would return to Sanaa. 
  Asked why al-Bid insists on remaining in Aden even after the 
signing, YSP officials told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the mere 
signing of the agreement would not eliminate the reasons which 
led the YSP leaders to leave Sanaa, especially the security 
reasons. They emphasized that the implementation of the 
provisions of the agreement should be the grounds for their 
return. [passage omitted]
