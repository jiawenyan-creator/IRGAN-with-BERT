FT  16 AUG 94 / MMM chief on tax charge
The man at the centre of Russia's biggest investment scandal since the
country began to lurch towards a free market economy was charged yesterday
with tax evasion, the Itar-Tass news agency said. Mr Sergei Mavrodi, who
headed the MMM investment fund that lured millions of Russians into buying
its shares with promises of high returns, had been charged as general
director of Invest Consulting, part of his corporate empire. Mr Mavrodi, 39,
who was arrested on August 4, has also been charged with obstructing an
investigation. He could face a jail term of up to five years if convicted on
the tax evasion charge.
