GARLIC STANDS GUARD 
I noticed the long article (April 19) about aphids devouring everything in the 
wake of malathion spraying. 
Unless these aphids are a special breed, there is an easy and inexpensive way 
to rid one's gardens, roses and vegetables alike, of them. Simply plant a row 
of garlic alongside or ring the patch of ground with garlic and you'll get rid 
of the aphids. 
I lost a crop of broccoli to aphids, but the next season I put a ring of garlic 
around the garden and didn't have an aphid, but plenty of broccoli to eat.
