FT  07 JAN 92 / Appointments: MD for Provident
Winterthur, the Swiss insurance giant, is introducing a new managing
director at its UK life insurance subsidiary, PROVIDENT LIFE. John Finan,
now 53, is to take over as managing director from Peter Vogel, who has been
in charge for the past year and will return to head office to help plan
Winterthur's drive into other international life insurance markets.
The Basingstoke-based Provident, which was taken over by Winterthur in 1980,
sells its products via independent financial advisers and 600 tied estate
agents. Finan has a long involvement in the life industry. He was with Pearl
UK's home service operation before becoming chief executive of NEL
Britannia.
