FT  30 SEP 92 / Belgian coalition survives
BELGIUM'S six-month-old centre-left coalition yesterday fended off collapse
with an 11th-hour compromise on its 1993 budget amendments and
constitutional reform.
The main challenge for the four coalition partners now is to find an ally to
help push through the reforms in parliament.
The constitutional changes require a two-thirds parliamentary majority which
the socialist/Christian Democrat coalition does not possess.
The leaders of the four parties agreed to raise another BFr21.8bn (Pounds
413m) through savings, including BFr5.2bn of cuts in social security, to
make up a shortfall in the 1993 budget.
The agreement on constitutional reform is supposed to pave the way for
Belgium to become a federal state, with more power devolved to
French-speaking Wallonia and to Flemish-speaking Flanders.
