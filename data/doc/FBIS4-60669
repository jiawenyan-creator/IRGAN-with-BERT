  [Excerpt] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has begun to 
provide meals-ready-to-eat to the Palestinian police force in 
the Gaza Strip. 
  The move is being taken after it was learned that the 
Palestinians have no means of their own and no funds for food. 
  The problem is that contrary to the situation in Jericho, 
Gaza Strip residents are incapable of donating food and other 
products to the Palestinian police force, especially since it is 
2,400-strong. [passage omitted]
