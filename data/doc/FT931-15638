FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Decision today on cash gift to
Lamont
MR NORMAN Lamont, the Chancellor, is expected to escape direct criticism
when the Commons' members interests committee agrees a report today on a
Pounds 18,000 donation he received from an unnamed donor, Ralph Atkins
writes.
However the committee is expected to call on MPs to in future resist
accepting anonymous donations or, if they are accepted, to declare them in
the register of members' interests.
Mr Lamont's entry in the register published yesterday reads 'nil'.
The committee also believes ministers cannot expect different treatment from
backbenchers. A draft report by Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Tory chairman,
makes no explicit reference to the help Mr Lamont received towards the legal
costs of evicting an unwanted tenant and which provoked a political row last
year. But it says that a loophole in rules on registering interests has
emerged.
No clear guidelines have been set down before for anonymous gifts and the
committee's draft report is believed to say that no exception should be made
for donations to MPs from central party funds. But there may be more of a
case for an MP accepting help from a constituency party.
Meanwhile, the Commons public accounts committee will meet tomorrow to
consider a National Audit Office report on the Pounds 4,700 contributed by
the Treasury towards Mr Lamont's fees. Mr Robert Sheldon, PAC chairman, is
to make a statement afterwards.
