An accident involving two cars and a tractor-trailer truck closed the 
southbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway during the morning rush hour today as 
one of two victims with major injuries was airlifted to a hospital. 
California Highway Patrol officers said they were investigating the cause of 
the 7:45 a.m. accident north of the Harbor Boulevard off-ramp that snarled 
traffic for more than an hour. An investigating officer said he was trying to 
sort out conflicting accounts of the cause, including one report that the 
incident began when one of the cars attempted to change lanes. 
Two unidentified women in one of the cars were injured. The driver was taken by 
helicopter to UCI Medical Center while a passenger was taken by ambulance to 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.
