  [Text] Another politician who seems to have disappeared is 
the former governor of Ogun State, Chief Segun Osoba. Chief 
Osoba, also a pro-democracy campaigner, was arrested just about 
a week ago and was released on bail on Friday [10 June] and was 
in fact interviewed on this program on the very day. Well, 
since then, nothing has been heard of Chief Osoba. This 
afternoon, Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka called us up from Lagos 
to express concern about Chief Osoba's whereabouts. Alice 
Martin asked him what he had to say. 
  [Begin recording] [Soyinka] (?In fact,) I am speaking right 
from the sitting room of Chief Osoba's house in Lagos. I came 
down from Abeokuta just to discuss with him the latest 
developments, you know, Abiola's long expected announcement, and 
found the whole house in total chaos. The security people and, 
you know, police and soldiers, came in at 4 AM [0300 GMT] this 
morning demanding from Mrs. Osoba the whereabouts of her 
husband. And, she was forced to come down in her nightgown 
and.... [pauses] They searched everywhere -- toilets and so on 
-- this place is in total confusion. I have spoken to the wife 
and she said she has not even seen him since Friday. The long 
and short of it is, we are not even sure it is not a sinister 
game being played pretending not to know his whereabouts and 
just using that opportunity to harass the family. 
  [Martin] Where could he be? 
  [Soyinka] Well, we just don't know. You see, the problem now 
is that virtually we have various arms of security and military 
operating, you know, in total blind relation to one another, and 
it is quite possible that one of these [word indistinct] may 
have abducted him while the others are looking for him. We just 
don't know, the wife doesn't know. 
  [Martin] At the point that Chief Osoba was supposed to have 
disappeared, who was with him? 
  [Soyinka] Well, he left... [pauses] Well, let me try and get 
you a direct answer to that. Excuse me, Madam, Madam, when 
Segun disappeared, who was with him? Did he leave with his 
driver or was.... [pauses] Well, the wife wasn't in. He just 
went out and he hasn't been back since. She doesn't know. 
  [Martin] What is behind this? 
  [Soyinka] Well, I believe that it has to do with the fact 
that he was granted bail. I think what the military wanted was 
that they could hold all these people -- Ebute and the others -- 
in prolonged detention. But, in the case of Osoba, I also have 
a feeling that it has to do with the fact the legislators in 
Ogun took the lead among all the states in actually giving a 
quick notice to the military administrator. So, Osoba, sort of, 
has come in the frontline of the attention of the military and I 
think that is why he has been singled out for this persecution.
