"What He Seeks in Distant Parts"] 
  [Text] According to the data of the Kirghiz [Kyrgyzstan] 
Committee for Statistics, approximately 144,000 people left the 
Republic last year. This was 60 percent more than the previous 
year. 
  More than 70 percent of those who left chose Russia as their 
permanent place of residence, while others emigrated to Ukraine, 
Belorusia [Belarus], Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Almost all the 
Germans left for Germany. 
  Today economic difficulties have been added to the problem 
of 
ignorance of the state language, which previously was the chief 
reason for migrating. The sharp drop in the volume of 
industrial production gives rise equally quickly to a reduction 
in staff. As is known, the Russian-speaking part of the 
population forms up to 90 percent of working people in the 
Republic's industry. 
  The average wage in Russia, to where inhabitants of 
Kirghizia 
[kirgizy] mainly head, is four or five times higher than in the 
Republic. Let us add that the minimum consumer budget of one 
inhabitant of Russia amounts to one-third of the wages of the 
inhabitant of Kirghizia.... 
  As a result of the activation of migration processes, the 
size of the Republic's population has fallen for the first time 
since the war....
