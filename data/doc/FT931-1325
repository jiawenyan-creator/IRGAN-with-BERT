FT  25 MAR 93 / Tube probe may lead to charges
THE Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to bring criminal
charges in connection with allegations of fraud at London Underground.
The CPS said yesterday it had received a report from the British Transport
Police into allegations of fraud involving London Underground fire-alarm
contracts.
According to transport police sources, the report was the result of an
18-month inquiry during which three individuals were arrested and then
released on bail. They have not been charged.
The CPS said it would have to decide whether there was sufficient evidence
for a prosecution and whether it was in the public interest to prosecute. It
would make no further comment on the case.
The fire-alarm contracts were awarded as part of a safety programme
implemented in the aftermath of the King's Cross underground station fire in
November 1987, in which 31 people died.
In his report on the fire, Mr Desmond Fennell QC, chairman of the inquiry,
criticised the lack of attention paid at the highest level to safety in
London Underground.
The programme followed the recommendations of the Fennell report and the
introduction of new statutory fire regulations throughout the London
Underground system.
It is understood that police have looked into allegations of bribes in the
award of multi-million pound contracts. London Underground has spent Pounds
200m in new fire safety installations since 1989. London Underground would
not comment yesterday on the police report.
