  [Text] Prague, May 13 (CTK) -- Guidelines for the money 
laundering bill will be presented for discussion within a 
fortnight, Justice Minister Jiri Novak told reporters today 
after his meeting with Swiss Justice and Police Minister Arnold 
Koller. 
  Novak said Koller told him about the Swiss legislation on 
the 
matter and offered help in drawing up the bill. 
  Koller said the extension of Swiss legislation includes a 
definition of organized crime and streamlining the confiscation 
of the organized gang members' property. Banks are allowed to 
alert the state attorney or the police when spotting suspect 
banking operations. 
  Koller, who designed the Swiss money laundering law, also 
said that the worldwide yearly return on drug trafficking 
amounted to $120 million, which he said was a reason for 
democratic countries to join in the fight against money 
laundering. 
  The law has not been late in coming, Novak said. The 
developed European countries have only introduced it recently 
and among the post-communist countries only Hungary has a 
similar law, he said. 
  The Swiss have launched a limited project enabling 50 drug 
addicts to have controlled access to free drugs, Koller said. 
  If former deputy chairman of the bankrupt Czech bank Banka 
Bohemia Jiri Cadek, now on the run and reputedly considering 
seeking asylum in Switzerland, is detained by the Swiss police, 
he will be extradited to the Czech Republic, Koller said.
