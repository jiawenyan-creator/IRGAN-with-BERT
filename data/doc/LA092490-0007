CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR JUDGE SOUTER 
Like most Americans, I had never heard of Judge David Souter before his 
nomination and, like most, I am concerned about issues which are likely to come 
before the Supreme Court. But as I read of spokespersons from all sides of 
those issues imploring the Judiciary Committee to reject the nominee for the 
express reasons that he claims to have an open mind rather than a bias, I'm 
concerned with the Senate's spending time listening to people who don't know 
what a judge does for a living.
