SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

History


On Tuesday, November 30, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71)
to accommodate a new Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) runway 13 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) to Appleton
Municipal Airport, Appleton, MN (58 FR 63127). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending from 700 feet
to 1200 feet AGL to contain Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations in controlled airspace during portions of the
terminal operation and while transiting between the enroute and terminal environments. Interested parties were
invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No
comments objecting to the proposal were received.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Appleton, MN, to accommodate
a new Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) runway 13 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) to Appleton Municipal
Airport, Appleton, MN. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing
the approach.
Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
