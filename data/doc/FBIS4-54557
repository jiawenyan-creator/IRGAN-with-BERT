  [Text] Eleven U.S. War College officers visited the 
Croatian Ministry of Defense, where they were received by Corps 
General Anton Tus, Tudjman's adviser for military affairs. After 
the talks Gen. Tus and Dave Servinsky, head of the U.S. study 
group, commented: 
  [Begin recording] [Gen. Tus] We are very pleased to be 
visited by study groups of top U.S. Army officers and that 
Croatia is included in their European tour. We are open; we wish 
to show where we stand, what we are like, what our further 
aspirations are, how to achieve the end of the war in this area, 
and how we are going to develop within security, political, and 
economic integrations in Europe. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Did you discuss the Partnership for 
Peace program? 
  [Gen. Tus] Yes, of course, that was one of our interests. 
  [Servinsky, in English with superimposed translation into 
Croatian] We talked to Gen. Tus about security issues in this 
area. We also talked about changes that have taken place in the 
former USSR and Eastern Europe and security issues in other 
parts of Europe. 
  [Reporter, in English] Anything more? 
  [Servinsky, in English with superimposed translation into 
Croatian] We talked about the role of the United Nations, NATO, 
and the United States in providing aid for the resolution of 
certain problems in this region. [end recording]
