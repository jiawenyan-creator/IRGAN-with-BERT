<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F>
staff, by army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] 
  Menashe: Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, you have just 
returned from a tour of Judaea and Samaria, of Qalqilyah. Is 
the closure being enforced? 
  Baraq: As far as possible. I met with reserve 
soldiers from a very fine northern Infantry brigade, and I saw 
that they were very well briefed on the need to conduct tighter 
checks of both documents and the license plates on Israeli 
vehicles leaving the territories. In addition, they are properly 
inspecting the trunks of the vehicles and checking under the 
seats. Secondary roads are being cut off, and patrols are 
deploying between the roads and inside the terrain itself. All 
these actions hinder the infiltration of people and warfare 
means into Israel, but we must admit with all honesty that they 
do not eliminate the danger entirely. 
  Menashe: Has the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
begun implementing the order from the prime minister and defense 
minister to move troops from the territories to the 
Israel-territories divide, the Green Line? 
  Baraq: Yes. Immediately after receiving this 
order over 24 hours ago, we started to considerably increase our 
deployment along the divide at the expense of our presence both 
in Judaea and Samaria and in Israel. This is part of some 
recent changes resulting from new emphases in response to the 
changing situation. We are no less responsible for the security 
of Israelis in Judaea and Samaria today than we were yesterday, 
but the recent events -- most notably the events in Hadera and 
'Afula -- revealed that the emphasis of the other side's 
operational activity has shifted to the divide; therefore, it is 
vital that we shift our own activity to that place. [passage
