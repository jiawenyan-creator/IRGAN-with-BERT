FT  18 SEP 92 / Council tax information fails to reveal size of bills
A COUNCIL tax information campaign was launched by the government yesterday,
but it will steer studiously clear of giving any guideline figures on the
level of the tax.
Leaflets explaining the tax will be sent to 20m households next week at a
cost of Pounds 3m.
The leaflets will explain how properties are valued, how discounts and
exemptions will apply, and transitional reductions that will be made
available.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said: 'We are on time and on
target despite mischievous speculation.'
The council tax will replace the poll tax next April. Householders will be
allocated to one of eight charging bands according to the value of their
property, with 25 per cent discounts for one-person households and 50 per
cent discounts for empty properties.
Estimates from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy
suggest that the average council tax bill will be about Pounds 540 a year.
Those in the lowest band stand to pay about Pounds 350, and those in the top
band over Pounds 1,000. Precise figures will depend upon next year's grant
settlement, to be announced in the autumn.
A telephone inquiry service has been launched to provide information about
the council tax. Councils that subscribe to Capita Managed Services
GuideLine will be able to give payers of the tax a local telephone number
for information about how the tax works, payment procedures and how to
appeal against valuations.
Calls will be rerouted to Capita's Reading centre, where an automated
switchboard will allow the caller to select pre-recorded messages tailored
to each council's needs.
