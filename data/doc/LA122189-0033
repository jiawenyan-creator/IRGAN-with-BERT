COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
GILL SCORES 27 AS ILLINOIS DEFEATS MISSOURI 
Kendall Gill made sure Illinois retained its stranglehold over Missouri 
Wednesday night at the St. Louis Arena, but he refused to exercise the Fighting 
Illini's bragging rights. 
"This is the best team we've faced," Gill said after scoring 27 points to lead 
fifth-ranked Illinois (7-0) over No. 4 Missouri, 101-93. "It takes a little 
luck and a lot of hard work." 
Gill, who has shaken off a mild early-season shooting slump, helped Illinois 
beat Missouri for the seventh consecutive time. The Illini lead the series, 
8-1. 
Missouri (9-1) got no closer than seven points the rest of the way despite a 
closing flurry by Anthony Peeler, who finished with 20 points. 
No. 3 Georgetown 97, Virginia Tech 64 -- Despite being unbeaten through eight 
games with an 37-point average margin of victory, Georgetown Coach John 
Thompson isn't ready to concede his Hoyas are a "good team." 
At least not by his standards. 
"We could be a good team, but we're not right now," he said after the easy win 
over Virginia Tech (4-3) at Landover, Md., "but it's better for my health if we 
win by 30 or 40 points." 
Mark Tillmon scored 29 points and Alonzo Mourning added 27 to lead the Hoyas to 
their 25th consecutive victory at home. 
No. 8 Louisiana St. 73, NW Louisiana 63 -- Wayne Sims scored 16 points and 
Louisiana State struggled to a 10-point victory on its home court in a game in 
which the Tigers were booed as they left the court at halftime. 
Northwestern Louisiana (1-7) had taken a three-point lead on Gregg Hardin's 
shot at the buzzer, and the frustrated Tigers, plagued by foul trouble, headed 
for the locker room to a chorus of boos. 
Coach Dale Brown opted for a full-court press and man-to-man defense in the 
second half, and the Tigers (5-1) responded by starting the final 20 minutes 
with a 25-6 run. 
High-scoring Chris Jackson had just 13 points on three-of-16 shooting. 
No. 17 Memphis St. 59, New Orleans 55 -- Elliot Perry scored 25 points to lead 
the Tigers at Memphis. 
Perry was nine for 15 from the field and made seven of eight free throws as 
Memphis State (5-1) broke from a 50-50 tie. 
No. 25 Michigan State 80, Evansville 66 -- Ken Redfield scored 20 points and 
Kirk Mannis added 14 for the Spartans (8-2) as they recovered from poor 
first-half shooting to win at Evansville, Ind. 
Scott Shreffler scored 27 points and Dan Godfread had 15 points and 14 rebounds 
for the Purple Aces (4-6). 
Dayton 84, DePaul 73 -- Negele Knight scored 22 points and Anthony Corbitt and 
Noland Robinson added 16 each for the Flyers (5-2) at Rosemont, Ill. 
The Blue Demons (3-7) dropped their fifth in a row, despite 16 second-half 
points -- including four straight three-pointers -- from Terry Davis. David 
Booth led the Blue Demons with 17, and Melvon Foster added 16. 
Virginia 63, Va. Commonwealth 46 -- John Crotty scored 20 points and Bryant 
Stith added 16 as the Cavaliers took the lead for good early in the game and 
rolled to an easy win over the Rams (4-4) in the opening round of the 
Times-Dispatch Invitational Tournament. 
Virginia (7-1) will meet Richmond, a 69-62 winner over Old Dominion, in the 
championship game tonight. 
Tennessee 92, Western Carolina 66 -- Ronnie Reese scored 17 points and Greg 
Bell added 16 to lead the Volunteers (5-3) at Knoxville. 
The Volunteers added to a 36-23 halftime lead with a flurry of three-point 
shots early in the second half. 
Minnesota 77, Washington 60 -- Melvin Newbern scored a season-high 23 points 
and led a ball-hawking defense as the Gophers won at Minneapolis. 
The victory was the sixth sin a row for Minnesota (6-1), which recorded 14 
steals and held Washington (4-3) to just 10 second-half field goals. 
Purdue 60, California 55 -- Tony Jones and Stephen Scheffler each scored 13 
points and the Boilermakers (6-1) held the Bears (6-2) scoreless in the final 
3:15 for the victory in West Lafayette, Ind.
