FT  22 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Green shopper guide
Have high unemployment and the recession turned green consumers monochrome
as black and white pricing issues have replaced environmental concerns on
their shopping list?
Suggestions that environmental awareness has declined have prompted some UK
retailers to withdraw green products, introduced during the environmental
boom of the early 1990s. Others have claimed that recession-hit shoppers'
preoccupation with saving money has dented their willingness to pay a bit
extra for 'greener' products.
However, a new study* by Mintel, the UK market research group, shows that
environmental issues remain high on consumers' agendas in spite of the
recession and unemployment. In poll data released last week, the number of
those who said they are either unaware of or unconcerned about green issues
was 8 percentage points below the figure in the previous survey in 1990.
The evidence also points to a continuing, if muted, rise in willingness to
buy environmentally-friendly goods among shoppers already sensitive to green
issues. Meanwhile, the number of 'armchair' greens - who say they care about
environmental issues but have not changed their spending habits - grew by 5
percentage points.
Rather than being concentrated among relatively young, wealthy and educated
shoppers, environmentally- conscious consumption is now much more evenly
spread in terms of income and age nationwide.
Moreover, the indications are that consumers will increasingly expect more
information about a product's history and a company's business background
before parting with their
cash.
