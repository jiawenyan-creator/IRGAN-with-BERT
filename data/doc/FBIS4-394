BFN 

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Rwanda Patriotic Front 
[RPF] rejected the new government immediately after the 
announcement of its formation on 8 April. Political analysts in 
Kigali are discussing how the RPF dares reject a government that 
is coming to fill the constitutional vacuum left by the almost 
simultaneous tragic loss of the head of state and the prime 
minister and other leading figures of the country. For them, 
this attitude means the RPF does not want any interlocutor, but 
that it alone wants power and that it wants to take it by force. 
  This attitude is also seen as destined to mark the beginning 
of ethnic struggles within the RPF where General Paul Kagame, 
the head of the movement's army, which is mainly Tutsi, is 
reported by Kigali private Radio Television Libre des Milles 
Collines to have carried out a coup d'etat in which the 
president of the RPF, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, and many other 
Hutu officials have been killed. The RPF has not denied the 
information.
