FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: FT Election Share Index
SHARES that might gain from a Conservative win again dropped sharply
yesterday, while Labour gainers dropped by less than the market as a whole.
Conservative gainers - the shares of companies that might suffer from Labour
party policies - are now 6 percentage points below their announcement-day
level. Some have dropped much more: BET, the conglomerate, has fallen by 18
per cent since March 11, and National Power, the recently-privatised
generator, by 12 per cent.
