FT  18 SEP 93 / Boundary changes could hit Tories
PROPOSED constituency boundary changes could damage the prospects of the
Conservative party in next year's European elections and further undermine
the efforts of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to strengthen his hold on
10 Downing Street.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats seem likely to be the principal
beneficiaries of an initial re-drawing of the English section of the
European political map to accommodate five additional members of the
European parliament.
In accordance with the agreement reached at last year's EC summit in
Edinburgh, the number of English MEPs elected next June will be increased to
71.
The proposals, which are still subject to change, involve boundary changes
affecting all but 12 of the existing 66 constituencies.
Under the proposals, the Liberal Democrats would have high hopes of winning
in a newly created Somerset constituency, which would be their first success
since the introduction of direct elections for the European Parliament.
The party would also hope for a victory in the Plymouth and Cornwall seat
where they came second in 1989.
Details of the proposed changes will be officially announced on Wednesday.
Political parties and other interests have until October 22 to submit
counter-proposals. The committee will make its final recommendations to Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, before Christmas.
Controversy has already flared over proposals to increase the number of
Welsh Euro constituencies from four to five.
The suggestion that two new constituencies should be created through merging
Gwynedd and Dyfed and Powys and Clwyd has been attacked by Mr Alex Carlile,
Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery.
