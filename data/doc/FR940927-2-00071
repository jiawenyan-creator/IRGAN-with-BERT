 

The Health Care Portfolio consists of securities of 22 health care companies that have significantly different levels
of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately $28.0 billion (Bristol Meyers Squibb Co.) to a low
of approximately $311 million (Living Centers of America, Inc.).
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Nineteen of the securities in the Health Care Portfolio are traded on the NYSE and the remainder are National Market
securities traded through NASDAQ. The average daily trading volume for the components of the Health Care Portfolio
for the period from November 5, 1992, through March 7, 1994, ranged from a high of approximately 1.03 million shares
(Abbott Laboratories), to a low of approximately 20,335 shares (Living Centers of America, Inc.).

At the outset, each of the securities in the Health Care Portfolio will have equal representation. Specifically,
each security included in the portfolio will be assigned a multiplier on the date of issuance so that the security represents
an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on the date of issuance. The multiplier indicates the number
of shares (or fraction of one share) of a security, given its market price on an exchange or through NASDAQ, to be included
in the calculation of the portfolio. Accordingly, each of the 22 companies included in the Health Care Portfolio will
represent approximately 4.54 percent of the total portfolio at the time of issuance.

The multiplier for each security in the Health Care Portfolio will generally remain unchanged except for limited
adjustments that may be necessary as a result of stock splits or stock dividends.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 There will be no adjustments to the multipliers to reflect cash dividends paid with respect to a portfolio security.
In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require
a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect.





<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will adjust the multiplier of any portfolio security if the security is subject to a stock split or reverse
split to equal the product of the number of shares issued with respect to one share of the portfolio security and the
prior multiplier. In the case of a stock dividend, the multiplier will be adjusted so that the new multiplier will equal
the former multiplier plus the product of the number of shares of such portfolio security issued with respect to one
share of the portfolio security and the prior multiplier.




</FOOTNOTE>


If the issuer of a security included in the Health Care Portfolio no longer exists, whether for reason of a merger, acquisition
or similar type of corporate control transaction, then Merrill Lynch will assign to that security a value equal to
the security's final value for the purposes of calculating portfolio values. For example, if a company included in
the portfolio is acquired by another company, Merrill Lynch shall thereafter assign a value to the shares of the acquired
company's securities equal to the value per share at which time the acquisition takes place.


If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, insolvency,
or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the Health Care Portfolio so long as a
market price on an exchange or through NASDAQ for such security is available. If such a market price is no longer available
for a portfolio security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar
proceeding, then the value of the portfolio security will be assigned a value of zero in connection with calculating
the daily portfolio value and the closing portfolio value of the Health Care Portfolio, for so long as no such market
price exists for that security.

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will not attempt to find a replacement stock or to compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy
or a similar event.

</FOOTNOTE>


The value of the Health Care Portfolio will be calculated by an independent third party and will be disseminated through
OPRA at least one each minute throughout the trading day.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 The portfolio value will equal the sum of the products of the most recently available market prices and the applicable
multipliers for the portfolio securities.

Like other issues of MITTS listed on the NYSE, Health Care Portfolio MITTS may not be redeemed prior to maturity and
are not callable by the issuer. Holders of Health Care Portfolio MITTS will be able to cash-out of their investment
by selling the security on the NYSE. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security in this secondary
trading market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the Health Care Portfolio and also
on such other factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Health Care Portfolio, the time
remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the credit worthiness of the issuer, Merrill Lynch.

</FOOTNAME>
Merrill Lynch will deposit registered securities representing Health Care Portfolio MITTS with its depository,
the Depository Trust Company (``DTC''), so as to permit book-entry settlement of transactions by participants in
DTC.
