WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; 
LONG BEACH AND USC RENEW RIVALRY 
The rivalry between the USC and Cal State Long Beach women's basketball 
programs continues tonight, revitalized now that the Trojans have freshman 
standout Lisa Leslie in their lineup. 
USC won the recruiting battle for Leslie, who was considering Long Beach, and 
the Trojans -- 12-16 last season -- became the only losing team to make the 
preseason national rankings. 
The Trojans (3-2) dropped out of the top 25 for the first time this season 
after losing at the University of San Francisco on Friday, 90-77. Long Beach is 
ranked 11th. 
USC has not defeated the 49ers since 1986 and enters tonight's game -- at 7:30 
at the Sports Arena -- behind, 23-12, in a series that started in 1974. 
Leslie, at 6 feet 5, averages a team-high 21.8 points and 14.2 rebounds. 
Long Beach (4-1) will rely on the quickness of its guards, who will probably 
try to lure Leslie into foul trouble. 
Guard Trise Jackson leads four 49ers in double figures in scoring with a 16.6 
average. Center Kari Parriott, 6-2, will play opposite Leslie. She is averaging 
14.2 points and 12.4 rebounds. PETE THOMAS
