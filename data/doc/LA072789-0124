Working mothers spent $14 billion in 1986 on care for children younger than 15, 
with poor women paying disproportionately high percentages of their family 
income, the U.S. Census Bureau reported. In the most detailed survey of working 
women's child care arrangements yet conducted, the bureau spotlighted 
disparities that are fueling a drive on Capitol Hill toward child care help for 
poor families. About a third of the 18.2 million working mothers with children 
under 15 made cash payments for child care, paying on average $45 a week, or 6% 
of their monthly family income, the survey found. But women in poverty who paid 
for child care devoted 22% of their income -- about $32 a week -- to it. More 
than 29 million children -- 9 million of them younger than five -- had mothers 
who worked full or part time in 1986, said Martin O'Connell, chief of the 
Census' fertility statistics branch.
