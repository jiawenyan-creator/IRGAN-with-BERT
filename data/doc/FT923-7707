FT  15 AUG 92 / UN to pressurise Libya
The UN will make a further attempt next week to persuade Libya to surrender
to a Scottish court the two agents accused of the Lockerbie bombing, writes
Michael Littlejohns in New York.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, is sending a personal
letter to Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, following the Security
Council's recent decision to keep sanctions against the Tripoli government
in place.
The UN announced last night that Vladimir Petrovsky, a former Soviet deputy
foreign minster now running the council's secretariat, would go to Libya on
Monday to deliver the message and hold talks with the authorities there.
