  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The gloomy economy in Japan 
has cut into both the number of travelers going abroad and those 
acquiring passports, a Foreign Ministry report released Thursday 
[3 February] said. The number of ordinary passports issued in 
1993 was 4,663,372, down from 4,677,020 from the previous year, 
the report said. 
  January and February marked the largest drop in passports 
issued in 1993, each slipping 13 percent compared with the same 
months in 1992, the report said. It attributed the decreases to 
the sluggish economy. 
  But the high yen and low-priced travel packages offered by 
travel agencies to boost overseas trips pushed up slightly the 
number of document issued in the latter half of the year, it 
said. 
  Of the total, men accounted for 51 percent and women 49 
percent, the report said. 
  The number of women obtaining passports continued to rise, 
up 
60,000 from the previous year, while the figure for men fell by 
70,000, it said. 
  Women aged 19 or younger and those in their 20s also 
outnumbered men, while women in their 70s and 80s receiving 
passports marked a record high at 46 percent, it said. 
  The report also found that the number of Japanese who lost 
or 
had their passports stolen in and out of Japan increased to a 
total 31,308. 
  Although the number of instances in which diplomatic offices 
abroad had to issue new passports decreased by 5 percent to 
4,154 cases, there were 27,154 cases requiring Japan to reissue 
the document, it said.
