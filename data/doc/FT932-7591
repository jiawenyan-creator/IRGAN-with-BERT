FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Property cash calls rumoured
A SPATE of rights issues in the property sector was being predicted
following Brixton Estates successful Pounds 100.7m cash call yesterday.
Analysts said the renewed appetite for the sector was likely to encourage
other property groups to come to the market. Hammerson in particular, and
MEPC, were widely tipped to follow suit within the next two weeks. They
would be likely to seek combined funds in the region of Pounds 500m, and
smaller property companies are also likely to join the fray.
Rights issues are seen as important for those companies needing to buy good
quality properties to ensure healthy cash flow. Meanwhile, with property
shares again racing forward yesterday, some property specialists underlined
their caution over embracing the whole sector. Mr Marc Gilbard at NatWest
Securities said: 'We prefer to be more selective. While institutional
appetite is high at the moment and supporting both issues and share rises,
when it runs out the quality differentiation will return.'
A more bullish Mr Andrew Causer at James Capel said: 'The sector has gone
ballistic. Investors should be buying across the board for a significant
recovery in the direct market in 1994 and 1995.'
Among the leaders, Land Securities jumped 9 to 574p, British Land 12 to 314p
and MEPC 7 to 437p. Brixton's rise of 11 to 207p seemed to support criticism
from some analysts that the rights issue discount was too large. The cash
call talk around Hammerson pulled the 'A' shares back to close 2 down at
337p.
