Penn State officially became the 11th school in the Big Ten, but it doesn't 
mean the conference will change its name. 
"Right now, the Big Ten still sounds right even though it may very well be the 
Big Ten with an asterisk," said Stanley Ikenberry, president of the University 
of Illinois. 
Because of scheduling obligations, Penn State is not likely to play a Big Ten 
football schedule until the mid-1990s. Other sports should be able to 
participate sooner, some as soon as the 1990-91 school year.
