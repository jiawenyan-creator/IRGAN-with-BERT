FT  03 DEC 94 / Lebanese PM offers to resign
Mr Rafik Hariri, chief architect of Lebanon's multi-billion-dollar
rebuilding project, yesterday tendered his resignation as prime minister to
President Elias Hrawi. Mr Hariri's office said his decision was linked to a
'misleading media and political campaign' against him. The move follows
weeks of disagreement between Mr Hariri and other senior figures in
Lebanon's fractious cabinet and a spate of allegations of corruption and
drugs-dealing from outspoken members of parliament touching both the
presidency and Solidere, the property development company designed by Mr
Hariri to rebuild central Beirut.
Mr Hariri's departure would be a severe blow to local and international
confidence in Lebanon and place a serious question mark over the future of
the Dollars 11bn (Pounds 6.7bn) rebuilding effort now under way. But
political observers in Beirut said the move might be a gambit to force
greater co-operation from the cabinet, and particularly Mr Nabih Berri, the
powerful speaker of the assembly, with whom Hariri aides spoke of
'irreconcilable differences'.
