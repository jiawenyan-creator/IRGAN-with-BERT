FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Polly Pocket and Mighty Max lift Bluebird
Toys
A NEAR doubling of foreign sales helped Bluebird Toys lift pre-tax profits
from Pounds 234,000 to Pounds 1.99m in the six months to June 30.
The strong performance abroad reflected the ongoing success of its 'Polly
Pocket' range of miniature dolls, now in its fourth year, and the successful
launch of 'Mighty Max' which has been very well received in all markets,
said Mr Torquil Norman, Bluebird's chairman.
The depreciation of sterling against the US and Hong Kong dollars also
contributed to the increase. Conditions in the home markets remained
subdued.
'We have made an excellent start to the year and we look forward to
continued growth in the second half as well as a good result for 1993 as a
whole,' he said.
Mr Norman said the higher volume of overseas sales would change the seasonal
distribution of profits, tending to reduce the traditional bias towards the
second half.
Turnover rose to Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 17.4m) with overseas sales increasing
to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 8.68m). The company said a broader spectrum of
international markets gave it a measure of stability while consulting
distributors on design had helped secure orders.
Inventories are down to Pounds 4.97m (Pounds 6.91m) Bluebird expects to
exceed last year's Pounds 6.39m cash balance at December 31. Net interest
charges fell to Pounds 591,000 (Pounds 962,000).
The company does not pay an interim dividend and earnings per share climbed
to 14.7p (4.2p).
