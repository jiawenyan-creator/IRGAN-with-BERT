  [Text] Sevastopol, 21 Apr -- Russian-Ukrainian talks on 
coordinating matters related to the implementation of the 
Agreement on the Black Sea Fleet, signed on 15 April in Moscow 
by Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, are continuing. After 
private talks between Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministers 
Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy, the Russian and Ukrainian 
delegations have began more general talks at the fleet's 
headquarters. 
  Vitaliy Radetskyy said to journalists after his personal 
meeting with the Russian minister that "the dialogue is 
progressing in a constructive manner." He also said that the 
Ukrainian Navy base must be stationed in Sevastopol. At the 
same time he did not rule out that Sevastopol may become the 
location for the deployment of both the main base of the Russian 
Black Sea Fleet, and the Ukrainian Navy. 
  The agreement, signed by the presidents of the two 
countries, 
mentions a separate deployment of the Black Sea Fleet and the 
Ukrainian Navy.
