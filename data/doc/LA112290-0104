PERFORMANCES AN OPINIONATED GUIDE 
THURSDAY 
* Mojo Hand (Hungry Hunter, 487 N. Moorpark Road, Thousand Oaks, 497-3925) 
Industrial strength blues comes to the east county. Also Friday and Saturday. 
FRIDAY 
* "Beatlemania" (Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St., 648-1888) This is a copy 
of something original. But it is probably about as good as it gets since the 
remaining three Beatles seem in no danger of reuniting. 
SATURDAY 
* John Mayall &amp; The Bluesbreakers, Mama Roo (Ventura Theatre) Back in the 
mid-'60s, it seemed every British band was some sort of blues band -- Mayall 
still has the blues. Mama Roo is this week's disco queen, making for a really 
weird double bill. 
SUNDAY 
* Jawge &amp; The Unknown Band (Eric Ericcson's, Seaward Avenue and the blue 
Pacific, Ventura, 643-4783) Reggae on the beach makes for the happening Sunday 
party. 
MONDAY 
* Matt Schulte and Bill Coffey (Charlie's, 362 California St., Ventura, 
648-6688) These two folk singers, who use absolutely no electricity, do the 
Everly Brothers thing for Happy Hour, and also a bunch of memorable originals. 
* Dan Pollock Band (Alexander's, 1050 Schooner Drive, Ventura, 658-2000) This 
week's Blue Monday presentation and also the antidote for the Bills and the 
Oilers. 
TUESDAY 
* The Beautiful (Carnaval Club, 634 State St., Santa Barbara, 965-8422) This 
week's new and improved, happening, under-appreciated guitar band that you've 
never heard of. 
* Joseppi's Wedding Band, Joseppi's (434 State St., Santa Barbara, 962-5516) 
There's at least eight people in the band; the tiny bar is packed with party 
animals. The band takes requests, and they know just about everything. It's a 
serious party, and Santa Barbara's Tuesday night best. 
WEDNESDAY 
* Rob Wasserman and Bob Weir (Ventura Theatre) Wasserman is the bass player 
with a Grammy and Weir is the guitarist from the Grateful Dead. What a long 
strange trip it still is . . . BILL LOCEY
