  [Text] Yesterday Education Minister Cecilia Gallardo de 
Cano announced that the government intends to create peace 
policies through cultural and education projects financed by the 
United Nations. Their content and implementation will be 
decided on by the nation's economic, political, and social 
sectors. 
  Since the end of armed conflict, society has demanded that 
violence be put behind us and that an irreversible procession 
toward peace and national reconstruction be enjoined, she noted. 
  The official explained that the Education Ministry, in 
conjunction with UNESCO, will consult with government and 
nonofficial institutions to assess Salvadoran reality. 
  That document would justify the financing offered by UNESCO 
-- that totals approximately $32.7 million -- to implement 
specific projects in education, cultural, and communications 
sectors, the education minister commented. 
  The economic cooperation is conceived within the Peace 
Culture Program in El Salvador fostered by the international 
organization to erase the experiences lived during the 12-year 
war and to define a strategy for peace. 
  Gallardo Cano said: "The idea is to permanently sustain the 
peace process and to reinforce the reintegration of former 
fighters into productive life, with the help of these same 
participants." 
  The education minister explained that the ministry will 
design projects to strengthen democracy and to teach respect for 
diverse ideological tendencies and human rights. 
  The official disclosed the details of the Peace Culture 
Program to productive sectors, nongovernment institutions, 
cooperatives, and intellectual and artistic associations during 
a meeting at the Planning Ministry's auditorium. 
  The program will be initiated with the First International 
Forum on the Culture of Peace to be held from 16 to 18 February 
in a capital city hotel.
