  [Abstract] The technology and characteristics of glass 
diagnostic targets with a Eu admixture are described. The 
superiority of Eu for this purpose over other alternatives is 
discussed. The targets are intended for the calibration of a 
collector in measurements of the product of the density of a 
compressed target and its radius in experiments with 
laser-driven fusion. The apparatus and procedures for preparing 
the glass microspheres used in this work are examined and the 
necessary qualities of these microspheres are defined. A 
combination of Eu in the forms Eu[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] or 
Eu(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/] with citric acid was selected 
for the production of microspheres 100-250 m in diameter 
with 
a wall thickness 0.5-2 m. The parameters and procedures for 
microsphere irradiation are given. The necessity for a 
uniformity of Eu distribution in the glass of each microsphere 
is stressed. It was found that the introduction of Eu into a 
solution of liquid glass in the form of a citrate complex makes 
it possible to fabricate microtargets from glass with acceptable 
geometric parameters. Adequate concentrations of Eu and the 
uniformity of its distributions make these targets suitable for 
use for diagnostic purposes in experiments with laser-driven 
fusion. Figures 2; references 7: 4 Russian, 3 Western.
