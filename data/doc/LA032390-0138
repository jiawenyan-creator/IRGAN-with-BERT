A Texas district judge awarded $1.6 million and a condominium to the common-law 
wife of New York Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield, who also was ordered to pay 
$3,500 monthly for child support. 
In June, a jury found that Winfield's relationship with flight attendant Sandra 
Renfro from 1982 to 1985 constituted a common-law marriage. Winfield said he 
never intended to marry Renfro and will appeal. 
Winfield married Tonya Turner in a legal ceremony two years ago. Renfro sought 
about $2.5 million from Winfield in child support for their 7-year-old 
daughter, Lauren Shanel.
