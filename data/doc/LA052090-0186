GARDENER'S CHECKLIST: FOR DEDICATED GARDENERS, HERE ARE SUGGESTIONS FROM THE 
CALIFORNIA ASSN. OF NURSERYMEN ON WHAT TO DO IN THE GARDEN THIS WEEK: 
Divide crowded clumps of bearded iris after the bloom is finished. 
This should be done every third year or so. 
If you have bedding plants waiting to be transplanted into the garden, remember 
to keep them watered. 
Garden-fresh herbs can add more flavor to your outdoor barbecuing. Plant them 
in pots near the barbecue area to have them close at hand while cooking. 
Shallow-rooted plants like camellias, rhododendrons, azaleas and fuchsias will 
benefit from a thick application of mulch to conserve moisture and keep roots 
cool.
