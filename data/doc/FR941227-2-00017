SUMMARY:

 In 1990 Congress enacted statutory amendments which increased the maximum civil penalty amounts that could be imposed
under the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and the Flammable Fabrics Act. The amendments
also provided for periodic adjustments to those maximum amounts. As calculated in accordance with the amendments,
the new amounts are $6,000 for each violation, with a maximum of $1,500,000 for any related series of violations.

<DATE>
DATES:

 The new maximum amounts will become effective on January 26, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990 (Improvement Act), Public Law 101608, 104 Stat. 3110 (November
16, 1990) amended provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA)
and the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA). The Improvement Act added civil penalty authority to the FHSA and FFA, which had
previously only contained criminal penalties. 15 U.S.C. 1264(c) and 1194(e). The Improvement Act
also increased the maximum civil penalty amounts that would apply to civil penalties under the CPSA: $5000 per violation
and $1,250,000 for any related series of violations. These same maximum penalty amounts applied to the newly-created
civil penalties under the FHSA and FFA. 


The Improvement Act further directed that the maximum civil penalty amounts be adjusted periodically for inflation.
The CPSA, FHSA and FFA were amended to state: 




(A) The maximum penalty amounts authorized in paragraph (1) [the provision that sets the current maximum amounts
of $5,000 and $1,250,000] shall be adjusted for inflation as provided in this paragraph. 
(B) Not later than December 1, 1994, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe
and publish in the 

Federal Register

 a schedule of maximum authorized penalties that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of the year immediately
following such publication. 
(C) The schedule of maximum authorized penalties shall be prescribed by increasing each of the amounts referred to
in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years. Any increase determined under the
preceding sentence shall be rounded to_ 
(i) in the case of penaties greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000, the nearest multiple of $1,000; 
(ii) in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 but less than or equal to $100,000, the nearest multiple of $5,000;

(iii) in the case of penalties greater than $100,000 but less than or equal to $200,000, the nearest multiple of $10,000;
and 
(iv) in the case of penalties greater than $200,000, the nearest multiple of $25,000. 
(D) For purposes of this subsection: 
(i) The term ``Consumer Price Index'' means the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department
of Labor. 
(ii) The term ``cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years'' means the percentage by which_ 
(I) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment; exceeds 
(II) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June preceding the date on which the maximum authorized penalty was last
adjusted. 




15 U.S.C. 2069(a)(3), 1264(c)(6) and 1194(e)(5). 


The Commission's Directorate for Economics has calculated that the cost-of-living adjustment increases the maximum
civil penalty amounts to $5,962.93 for each violation and to $1,490,733.28 for any related series of violations.
(The back-up information on these calculations is available from the Office of the Secretary.) Rounding off these
numbers in accordance with the statutory directions, the adjusted maximum amounts are $6,000 for each violation
and $1,500,000 for any related series of violations. These adjusted amounts substitute for the previous amounts
contained in the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2069(a)(1); in the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1264(c)(1); and in the FFA, 15 U.S.C.
1194(e)(1). 
This 

Federal Register

 notice was not published before December 1, 1994. Therefore, the Commission has decided that the new maximum penalty
amounts should apply to violations that occur after January 26, 1995, rather than violations that occur after January
1, 1995. This provides a 30-day effective date; the Improvement Act anticipated that the adjusted penalties would
apply no earlier than one month after public notice in the 

Federal Register

.
