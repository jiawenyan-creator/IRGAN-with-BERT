OUTTAKES: ROSSINI ROCKS 
Maverick film maker Robert Altman will go to Italy this fall to shoot his next 
project, a biography of 19th-Century Italian composer Gioacchino Rossini, whom 
Altman calls "the Mick Jagger of his day." 
"He was enormously successful, popular and sexy," Altman told us. "Yet, in his 
mid-30s, he decided to stop writing music and travel and experience life." 
Altman will focus his English-language film on that period, he said. 
Enrico Roseo is producing, and "there's not one penny of American money in it," 
Altman added. Leonard Klady
