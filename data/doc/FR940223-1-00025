 

(e) Subtract not less than 4 cents per hundredweight nor more than 5 cents per hundredweight. The result shall be the
weighted average differential price. 

18. Section 1124.62 is redesignated as 1124.63 and revised to read as follows: 



1124.63 

Announcement of the weighted average differential price, the producer nonfat milk solids price, and an estimated
uniform price. 



The market administrator shall announce on or before the 14th day after the end of each month, the following prices
for such month: 

(a) The weighted average differential price; 

(b) The producer nonfat milk solids price; and 

(c) An 

estimated uniform price

 per hundredweight of milk which is computed by adding the weighted average differential price to the basic formula
price. 

19. A new 1124.62 is added to read as follows:

Computation of producer nonfat milk solids price. 



The 

producer nonfat milk solids price

 shall be computed by the market administrator each month as follows: 

(a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to 1124.60 (d) and (e) for all handlers who filed reports
pursuant to 1124.30 and who made payments pursuant to 1124.71 for the preceding month; 

(b) Divide the resulting amount by the total pounds of nonfat milk solids in producer milk; and 

(c) Round to the nearest whole cent. 

20. Section 1124.70 is revised to read as follows: 



1124.70 

Producer-settlement fund. 



The market administrator shall establish and maintain a separate fund known as the ``producer-settlement'' fund
into which shall be deposited all payments made by handlers pursuant to 
1124.71 and 1124.75 and out of which shall be made all payments to handlers pursuant to 1124.72.
Payments due a handler from the fund shall be offset against payments due from such handler. 

21. Section 1124.71 is revised to read as follows: 



1124.71 

Payments to the producer-settlement fund. 



On or before the 16th day after the end of the month, each handler shall pay to the market administrator the amount, if
any, which results from subtracting the sum computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section from the sum computed
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section: 

(a) The sum of: 

(1) The total obligation of the handler for such month as determined pursuant to 1124.60; and 

(2) For a cooperative association handler, the amount due from other handlers pursuant to 1124.73(d); 

(b) The sum of: 

(1) The value of milk received by the handler from producers at the applicable prices pursuant to 1124.73(a)(2)
(i), (ii), and (iii); 

(2) The amount to be paid by the handler to cooperative associations pursuant to 1124.73(d); and 

(3) The value at the weighted average differential price adjusted for the location of the plant(s) at which received
(not to be less than zero) with respect to the total hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat in other source milk for
which a value was computed for such handler pursuant to 1124.60(j); and 

(c) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month, each handler operating a plant specified in 1124.7(d)
(2) and (3), if such plant is subject to the classification and pricing provisions of another order which provides
for individual handler pooling, shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund an amount
computed as follows:

(1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk disposed of as route disposition in the marketing
area which was allocated to Class I at such other order plant. If reconstituted skim milk in filled milk is disposed
of from such plant as route disposition in the marketing areas regulated by two or more market pool orders, the reconstituted
skim milk assigned to Class I shall be prorated according to such disposition in each area.

(2) Compute the value of the quantity assigned in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to Class I disposition in this area,
at the Class I price under this part applicable at the location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class
III price) and subtract its value at the Class III price.

22. Section 1124.72 is revised to read as follows: 



1124.72 

Payments from the producer-settlement fund. 



On or before the 18th day after the end of the month, the market administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if
any, by which the amount computed pursuant to 1124.71(b) exceeds the amount computed pursuant to 1124.71(a),
less any unpaid obligations of such handler to the market administrator pursuant to 1124.71, 1124.75,
1124.85, and 1124.86. However, if the balance in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments
pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments and shall complete such
payments as soon as the necessary funds are available.
