FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Headway interim deficit reduced
Headway, the consumer and industrial goods specialist, reduced pre-tax
losses from a restated Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 883,000 in the six months to
December 31.
The company, however, budgets for a first-half loss as sales by its dominant
garden furniture subsidiary, Aronstead, are heavily biased towards the final
quarter.
Losses this time were struck after costs of Pounds 103,000 for the major
reorganisation of Aronstead.
Turnover for the period was Pounds 10.05m (Pounds 11.11m) and losses per
share were halved at 3.7p. The results have been prepared in accordance with
FRS 3.
