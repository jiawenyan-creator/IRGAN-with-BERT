FT  15 APR 92 / Israel favours local polls in occupied areas
ISRAEL'S defence minister, Mr Moshe Arens, told a parliamentary committee
yesterday that the government was in favour of holding municipal elections
in the occupied territories for the first time in 16 years, Reuter reports
officials as saying in Jerusalem.
They said he told the foreign affairs and defence committee that the
government wanted to appoint municipal committees in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to prepare for elections.
Palestinian peace negotiators oppose the idea, first raised publicly during
a visit by a senior defence ministry official to the West Bank city of
Hebron last week. Ghassan al-Khatib said that raising the elections idea
pre-empted Palestinian demands for general elections for a legislative
council in the West Bank and Gaza.
The last municipal elections in the West Bank were in 1976. Israel has since
refused Palestinian demands for elections and has appointed local officials
to run the municipalities.
