SHOAL CREEK BIDS TO BE HOST OF OPEN 
Shoal Creek, at the center of the racial controversary that led to a change in 
the way future tournament sites will be selected, has bid to be the host of the 
1996 U.S. Open. 
"They're not the only club that's asked for that year," Robert T. Sommers, U.S. 
Golf Assn. official, said Sunday, but did not reveal the other clubs. 
The Shoal Creek controversy, before the PGA Championship, was ignited by Hall 
Thompson's statement that the club he founded would not be pressured into 
accepting black members. 
Shoal Creek awarded an honorary membership to Louis Willie, a black Birmingham 
executive, and derailed plans of demonstrations. 
Sommers said the controversy would not affect the decision. 
The PGA Tour announced this week that clubs selected as future sites for 
tournaments must have open membership practices. U.S. Open sites have been 
selected through 1995.
