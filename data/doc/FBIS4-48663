  [Text] Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] Secretary General 
Theogene Rudasingwa today in Nairobi pledged that his guerrillas 
would hold fire as much as possible to allow the current 
temporary truce in the Rwandan civil war to hold until tomorrow 
when it expires. He pledged that his forces will fight on until 
those responsible for the massacres of an estimated half a 
million Rwandans are brought to justice. 
  Rudasingwa confirmed that his movement had captured Kigali 
airport and an army barracks in the latest fighting. 
  He said his movement was still committed to the goal of the 
Arusha peace process. This includes a power-sharing 
administration, the formation of the national army, the rule of 
law, and the return of about 2 million Rwandans displaced from 
their homes by civil war. 
  Rudasingwa reiterated his reservations over a proposal to 
send 5,500 additional UN peacekeepers to boost the 400-strong UN 
force already in Rwanda. He said the United Nations' role in 
Rwanda should only be humanitarian. 
  The truce was agreed by the warring sides to allow a UN 
special envoy to discuss the deployment of UN troops. Our 
latest reports say the envoy has called off the discussions 
after failing to get the guarantee of his safety from the 
warring sides.
