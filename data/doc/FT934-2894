FT  11 DEC 93 / Shokhin denies rumours on western bank curbs
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister responsible for
economic negotiations with the EU, yesterday denied reports that Moscow
would scrap curbs on western banks earlier than planned, writes Leyla
Boulton. He said that remarks attributed to President Boris Yeltsin during
his visit to Brussels had been misunderstood. He said that an offshore
regime for banks after they had received full banking licences would remain
in force.
