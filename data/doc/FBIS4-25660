  [Text] Seoul, June 13 (XINHUA) -- Former President of the 
United States Jimmy Carter arrived here Monday [13 June] in a 
prelude to his visit to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK), with the possibility of his mediation in 
Pyongyang's nuclear issue gaining widespread attention. 
  Carter, who is visiting the Korean peninsula as head of his 
private peace center, will meet South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu before passing 
through the heavily-fortified truce village of Panmunjom into 
the DPRK Wednesday. 
  He is expected to meet the DPRK's leader Kim Il-song who is 
reportedly waiting for Carter to deliver a message to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton on his proposal for solving the nuclear 
problem. 
  The former U.S. President will return to Seoul on June 18 
via 
Panmunjom and meet again with South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam before heading back to Washington. 
  Carter came at a time when the U.S., South Korea and Japan 
are seeking United Nations sanctions against the DPRK since 
Pyongyang reportedly banned inspectors of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from testing samples of nuclear fuel 
to determine whether it has been diverted secretly to make 
atomic weapons. 
  The DPRK has repeatedly stated that its nuclear program is 
peaceful and warned that imposition of sanctions would be an act 
of war. 
  Carter said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula 
would be private one. "My hope is to discuss some of the 
important issues of the day with leaders of the area," he added. 
  The former president has been active in resolving conflicts 
in Panama, Nicaragua and Sudan, among others.
