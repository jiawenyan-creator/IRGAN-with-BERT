FT  11 NOV 93 / Gota Bank posts modest improvement
GOTA Bank, the state-owned Swedish bank due to be privatised by the end of
this year, yesterday reported an operating loss of SKr8.48bn (Dollars
1.05bn) for the first nine months of 1993, a modest improvement on the
SKr9.43bn loss sustained in the same period last year.
The bank said its credit losses had shrunk to SKr7.8bn in the nine months
from SKr9.39bn.
Gota's operating loss after the inclusion of financial insurance and
SKr7.61bn in drawn-down state guarantees was SKr785m, compared with a loss
of SKr1.56bn the year before.
Gota said it had by September utilised SKr13.8bn in state guarantees out of
a total of SKr15bn pledged by the government to rescue the bank from the
loan loss crisis which crippled the Swedish banking sector last year.
The government, which was forced to take over Gota during the crisis, is to
strip out SKr43bn of the bank's bad assets into a so-called bad bank, called
Retriva, which will stay in state hands when Gota is sold.
The state is considering bids from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken,
Handelsbanken and Nordbanken of Sweden. The single foreign bidder is
understood to be General Electric of the US.
