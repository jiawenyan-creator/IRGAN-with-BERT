PLEA FOR BUILDERS TO AVOID WHITTIER 
I hope Jeanne Muhlestein is right when she says that responsible developers 
have become wary of bringing their business to Whittier ("Projects Exempted 
from Whittier's Building Freeze." The Times, July 1). We can only hope that all 
the other developers will follow their lead.
