LOCAL; 
2 KILLED AFTER MATTRESS FIRE SETS PALMDALE BOARDING HOUSE ABLAZE 
A mattress fire set a boarding house in Palmdale ablaze early today, killing 
two men who lived there, investigators said. 
Los Angeles County Fire Investigator David Westfield said officials believe 
that the blaze was accidental. The names of the victims, ages 57 and 78, were 
withheld pending notification of relatives. The victims were roommates who were 
overcome by smoke and died at the scene, Westfield said. 
One of the eight other residents suffered a seizure and was treated at Palmdale 
Hospital Medical Center and released, officials said. 
The fire was reported about 3:31 a.m. by a passing motorist who was flagged 
down by a resident, Westfield said. He said the occupants first tried to call 
the Fire Department with a phone in the burning building, but the fire 
apparently interfered with the phone lines. That delay may have led to the 
deaths of the victims, one of whom was an amputee with a prosthetic leg, he 
said. 
It took 17 firefighters to extinguish the blaze. Neighbors and officials said 
many of the residents of the boarding house in a desert area on the edge of 
Palmdale were low-income or elderly. 
Joseph Harris, a cook and caretaker at the home, said he was awakened by 
another resident yelling that a mattress was on fire. He said the smoke was so 
thick that he was forced to climb out a back window. 
Officials said their initial investigation indicated that the building had 
properly functioning smoke detectors.
