  [Excerpt] Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
have reached an agreement in Hebron. This is reportedly a 
gentlemen's agreement, without any written documentation to 
attest it. According to the understanding reached, Hamas will 
not act against Fatah or against the potential benefits of the 
peace process. Both sides prefer the wording here to be 
intentionally vague. This is how Husayn al-Shaykh, one of the 
prominent Fatah leaders in the West Bank and an adviser to the 
Palestinian peace delegation, defines the situation: 
  [Begin al-Shaykh recording] There is no war between us and 
Hamas; therefore, no agreement is required. I am sure that 
Hamas knows its limits and our red line very well and that in 
the future, it will share power with us. [end recording] 
  The understandings were reached recently, following a series 
of secret meetings between some seven to 10 people from both 
organizations. The gist of the Hebron agreement is that Hamas 
accepts Fatah as the leader in the political process, even if it 
does not agree with it. It should be emphasized that 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm, does not recognize 
and is not bound by these understandings. [passage omitted]
