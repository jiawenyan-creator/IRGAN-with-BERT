New loans by the World Bank will reach a record $21 billion in the year ending 
June 30, up from $19.2 billion a year ago, bank officials predicted. The bank 
said $16 billion would go to the somewhat more prosperous countries that still 
need easy loans to raise their living standards. They pay interest at a 
variable rate, now 7.65% a year. More than $5.5 billion will go to the poorest 
countries from the bank's International Development Assn. It makes loans at 
less than 1% interest.
