FT  12 MAY 93 / Thai toy factory fire toll rises above 200
MORE THAN 200 workers, most of them women, were killed by a fire in a toy
factory on the outskirts of Bangkok on Monday night in one of the world's
worst industrial accidents.
Thai officials said hundreds more were injured and taken to hospital
suffering from burns, smoke inhalation and limbs broken from jumping from
the building's upper floors.
Many of the dead were found piled up at ground-floor exits or crushed under
a collapsed staircase.
Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the Thai interior minister, said yesterday as more
bodies were unearthed from the wreckage that he was establishing a committee
to investigate the cause of the fire, the state of the factory buildings and
its manufacturing processes.
The factory was operated by Kader Industrial (Thailand), a subsidiary of
Hong Kong's Kader Holdings.
It produced stuffed and plastic toys, including Babar the Elephant and
characters from the Muppets television show.
No outside fire escapes were visible in the wreckage of the three buildings
which were destroyed, or on a surviving four-storey building where the toys
were stuffed with foam.
Workers who escaped the blaze said there had been earlier fires at the
factory. They also said supervisors told them to stay at their posts when
Monday's fire was first noticed.
The tragedy has reminded Thais of the price they sometimes pay for an
'economic miracle' based on export industries and cheap labour. Hundreds of
thousands of Thais have flocked to the Bangkok metropolis from poor rural
areas to work as labourers, maids or prostitutes.
Corruption is widespread among low-paid government officials, and
environmental and safety standards are often poorly enforced.
