IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION 
DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
Harness-Racing Drivers Lose Against Los Alamitos: A U.S. District Court judge 
in Los Angeles rejected a request by licensed harness-racing drivers to block 
Los Alamitos race track from limiting the number of drivers it will allow to 
race during its five-month meet. 
Attorneys for the drivers argue that the Los Alamitos Racing Assn. is 
effectively revoking their licenses by only allowing "popular" drivers with 
winning records to work at the track. Attorneys for Los Alamitos could not be 
reached for comment. (Filed Jan. 24, 1990. Case No. CV9000357JGD)
