Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan named Dr. James O. Mason, 
assistant secretary for health, as acting surgeon general to replace the 
departing Dr. C. Everett Koop. Mason, formerly director of the Atlanta-based 
federal Centers for Disease Control, will serve in both capacities until Koop's 
term formally expires in October. Sullivan is expected to name a permanent 
surgeon general at that time.
