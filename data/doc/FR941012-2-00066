 Notice of final decision on exemption reissuance.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that a request for reissuance of an exemption to the land disposal restrictions under the 1984
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act has been granted to Albemarle
Corporation, for the Class I injection wells located at Magnolia, Arkansas. As required by 40 CFR part 148, the company
has adequately demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Environmental Protection Agency by petition and supporting
documentation that, to a reasonable degree of certainty, there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from
the injection zone for as long as the waste remains hazardous. This final decision allows the underground injection
by Albemarle Corporation of the specific restricted hazardous waste identified in the reissued petition, into the
Class I hazardous waste injection wells at the Magnolia, Arkansas facility specifically identified in the petition
for as long as the basis for granting an approval of this petition remains valid, under provisions of 40 CFR 148.24.
As required by 40 CFR 124.10, a public notice was issued on July 22, 1994. The public comment period ended on September
6, 1994. EPA received no comments. This decision constitutes final Agency action and there is no Administrative appeal.
