SALES HOT IN 'BIG CHILL' 
I am an active, professional real estate broker and work hard to meet my 
clients' needs and provide accurate information on the marketplace. Your 
reporting in "The Big Chill" (Jan. 14) by David W. Myers has erroneously 
created a perception that we are not selling homes. 
According to you, if homes do sell, they sell for $100,000 less than asking 
price, and every seller has to give a trip to Tahiti to get the home sold. This 
is not correct. In our board in Glendale we had more sales in the last quarter 
of 1989 than we had in the same quarter in prior years. 
The main difference today is that we now have twice the number of homes for 
sale. This is truly an advantage for the buyer, who has twice the selection of 
properties. In addition, sellers may carry financing, pay closing costs or 
negotiate their prices now where they would not have previously. 
A buyer today is missing an excellent opportunity to purchase a home on his 
terms. This may not be the case in a few months during our peak selling period. 
There will be even more buyers, again increasing the demand and reducing the 
supply. 
In addition, it is apparent that columnist Robert J. Bruss has not worked with 
a professional realtor recently, nor has he listed or sold a property with one 
in many years. His recommendations regarding disclosures have some of my 
clients so frightened they are reluctant to sell. 
His advice to list only for 30 days with a broker is also not the way to 
effectively market a property. None of the successful, knowledgeable agents I 
know would work under those conditions. Would Mr. Bruss? Isn't he allowed to 
handle a lawsuit through to successful close? 
A realtor is being hired for his/her expertise, including the time it will take 
to sell a property. In most cases this is controlled by the sellers' asking 
price.
