Wait for the Book: The commander of the battleship Iowa is retiring from the 
Navy and someday may write about the turret explosion last April that killed 47 
sailors. "Down the road, I might have a lot to say. But I've decided to save 
all that," Capt. Fred P. Moosally said Wednesday in Norfolk, Va. A Navy report 
said the explosion probably was caused by sabotage by a disgruntled gunner's 
mate who died in the explosion. That conclusion has been challenged by some of 
the victims' families and members of Congress. 
Run Aground: Polish-born heiress Barbara Piasecka Johnson, one of America's 
richest women, dismissed suggestions through a spokesman in New York Thursday 
that her plan to save a Polish shipyard was falling through. News reports from 
Poland said Johnson's proposal to pump $100 million into the ailing Lenin 
Shipyard in Gdansk, where Lech Walesa founded the Solidarity movement, was 
failing because she had demanded that workers be paid lower wages and stage no 
strikes for five years. "We don't agree that the deal's unraveling," said John 
Peach, a Johnson aide. 
A Royal Wish: Princess Anne says she wishes her children had better role 
models. "I look around and wonder what sort of examples they have to look up to 
now," the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II said in London this week. "You find if 
you go to any number of countries where the small rural communities have very 
strict codes of behavior, you don't find much thieving and pilfering, and 
murder is almost unheard of," the princess said. 
For Sale, One Mansion: A 68-year-old mansion in Dallas' fashionable Highland 
Park area has been listed for sale by Caroline and Nelson Bunker Hunt, who 
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings earlier this month. The asking 
price on the six-bedroom, six-bath mansion is $2.8 million. The house has 
marble fireplaces and a garden room with an Italian tile floor. Nelson Hunt had 
made millions in silver speculation.
