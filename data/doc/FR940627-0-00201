79.56 

Fuel and fuel additive grouping system. 



(a) Manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives are allowed to 
satisfy the testing requirements in 79.52, 79.53, and 79.54 
and the associated reporting requirements in 79.59 on an 
individual or group basis, provided that such products meet the 
criteria in this section for enrollment in the same fuel/additive 
group. However, each manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive 
must individually comply with the notification requirements of 
79.59(b). Further, if a manufacturer elects to comply by 
participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be 
individually subject to the information requirements of this 
subpart. 

(1) The use of the grouping provision to comply with Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 testing requirements is voluntary. No manufacturer is 
prohibited from testing and submitting its own data for its own 
product registration, despite its qualification for membership in 
a particular group.
