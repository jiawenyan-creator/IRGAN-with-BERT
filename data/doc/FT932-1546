FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Germany
The Frankfurt stock market seems undaunted by the deepening recession and
the reluctance of the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. The DAX index is
again pushing up towards 1,700 despite a forward multiple, based on DB
Research projections, of 20 times next year's earnings. Part of the impetus
has come from foreign investors who have been trying to correct underweight
positions in German equities. Such a technical motivation, though, still
requires a belief that the market has further to go
There is a general expectation that a large swing in earnings could occur
between this year and next if only because restructuring provisions will
drop away. Judging by its cash-flow multiple, which excludes the effect of
such provisions, the market does not look so expensive.
But that argument holds good only if recovery is fairly quick and sustained.
The trouble is that German companies cannot have their Kuchen and eat it.
The weaker the currency - and the more there is talk of Germany losing its
anchor status in the ERM - the less the Bundesbank will feel inclined to
implement the monetary relaxation needed to pull the economy out of
recession.
