OUTTAKES: CAREER SPARK 
After months of speculation, the plum role of stripper Blaze Starr has been 
cast. 
Starring opposite Paul Newman -- who will play Louisiana Gov. Earl Long -- in 
A&amp;M/Touchstone's "Blaze," will be a virtual unknown. She's Lolita 
Davidovich, a Toronto-based actress of limited film experience. 
Davidovich snared the role after the film's producers read and tested hundreds 
of actresses -- known and unknown. (For awhile, it was widely talked that 
Melanie Griffith would portray the voluptuous Blaze.) 
Davidovich, until recently known professionally as Lolita David, has had small 
roles in Columbia's "Big Town" and Paramount's "A New Life." Her most 
significant film part to date: The third lead in a Canadian thriller called 
"Blindside," starring Harvey Keitel. 
"Blaze" chronicles the real-life tempestuous relationship between Starr, and 
the Louisiana politician, which began in 1959 and ended when he died the 
following year. Despite scandalous national headlines, Long rebuffed political 
pressure to end the affair. 
Ron Shelton wrote the script and will direct when "Blaze" begins filming next 
month in Baton Rouge under producers Gil Friesen and Dale Pollack. Leonard
