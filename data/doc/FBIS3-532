  [Text] Pretoria March 8 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive 
Council [TEC] moved on Tuesday to compel the holding of free and 
fair elections in Bophuthatswana. South African Communist Party 
Chairman Joe Slovo said the government of President Lucas 
Mangope had clearly indicated that it would not join the 
electoral process. 
  However, people in the homeland had indicated that they 
wanted to take part in the election, he said. 
  The TEC called on Mr Mangope not to resist the progress 
towards a new dispensation and to commence co-operation with the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. 
  The TEC recommended that if Mr Mangope did not comply with 
its directives, measures should be implemented including 
terminating diplomatic representation, terminating special 
financial arrangements that benefitted the government of 
Bophuthatswana, controlling the movement of Bophuthatswana 
government personnel in South Africa and securing the IEC in the 
execution of its duties. 
  The TEC said it would initiate direct contact with civil 
servants and security force members to plan for their 
integration and the implementation of the new constitution if 
its directives were ignored.
