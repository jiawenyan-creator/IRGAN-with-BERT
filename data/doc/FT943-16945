0.52m
Aberdeen Steak Houses Group, the USM-quoted restaurant operator, yesterday
announced a return to profit with a pre-tax figure of Pounds 520,000 for
1993 compared with a loss of Pounds 185,000 previously.
This followed a cut in first half losses from Pounds 381,000 to Pounds
197,000.
Turnover was up from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 14.7m and the profit was struck
after an exceptional item of Pounds 177,000 (Pounds 300,000) - a 'prudent'
provision for permanent diminution in value of certain fixed assets.
Earnings per share were 1.7p (1.2p losses). There is again no dividend.
Shareholders' funds showed an increase from Pounds 236,000 to Pounds 434,000
while bank borrowings dropped from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 824,000.
