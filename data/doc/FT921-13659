FT  21 JAN 92 / Voucher setback for Prague sell-off
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S voucher privatisation programme, which aims to distribute
state-owned enterprises to the population, has been disrupted by the
activities of investment funds believed to be hoarding voucher books.
For a small fee, all Czechoslovak citizens over 18 can participate in the
mass privatisation programme by buying vouchers, which will become shares in
the new private enterprises once the programme is completed.
Since the scheme was launched, more than 300 private investments funds have
mushroomed across the country offering to invest the vouchers of citizens  -
often overwhelmed by the process and lacking basic information on the
enterprises.
Nearly 3m citizens have registered so far to take part in the voucher
programme ahead of a January 31 deadline. But recent participants have come
up against a lack of voucher books, which have seemingly disappeared
although 8m were printed.
Mr Tomas Jezek, privatisation minister for the Czech republic, recently
accused investment funds of buying up the books to entice would-be
participants to become customers.
These funds will hold the vouchers for customers and take investment
decisions for them. The greater the number of customers, the larger the
profit from customer fees.
All big banks have set up investment funds in Czechoslovakia, alongside
managers and individuals able to raise Kcs1m (Dollars 300,000).
To tackle the problem of missing voucher books, Mr Vaclav Klaus, federal
finance minister, announced that registration cards would be issued until
books were either brought back into circulation or reprinted.
But the hoarding has highlighted the lack of regulation in the process and
investment scandals could take their toll on the government as next June's
elections approach.
