  [Text] The government will not release Wilma Tiamzon 
despite a threat from the Communist Party of the Philippines-New 
People's Army-National Democratic Front to pull out of the peace 
talks. According to Malacanang [presidential office], there were 
legal grounds for Tiamzon's arrest and the law must be followed. 
Malacanang reiterated that it will not be blackmailed; it will 
not release Tiamzon just because the rebels threaten to pull out 
of the peace talks. 
  Alexander Aguirre, acting secretary of the Department of 
Interior and Local Government, said there are two arrest 
warrants for Tiamzon involving kidnapping cases:

kidnapping with serious illegal detention. So certainly we are 
abiding with due process. We are also seeing to it that she is 
given all the human rights. She is... [pauses] We are 
respecting the rights of the persons. She is now being attended 
to by a doctor -- she is in the hospital -- and if there is a 
need for lawyers to see her and also the others, then we'll see 
to it that these rights are given. [end recording]
