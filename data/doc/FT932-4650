FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Government cuts hurt profits at
Tata steel unit
TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), the flagship company within India's giant Tata
group, reports a 40 per cent drop in net profits, to Rs1.27bn (Dollars
40.7m) for the year ended March, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Tisco said margins had been pressured throughout the year by recessionary
conditions. It is cutting the dividend from Rs3.5 to Rs2.5 a share.
Mr Ratan Tata, chairman, said prospects would pick up this year as the
economy revived, and if government spending on construction projects rose.
He hoped to maintain this year's dividend.
He expected sales to increase by 10 per cent in the current year, but
declined to give a forecast for profits.
Mr Tata said India's steel industry slipped into recession last year after
being hit hard by government spending cuts.
He was optimistic about a revival in the current year. The company expects
strong export sales to Asian markets, particularly China.
Sales of products and services last year rose Rs5.65bn to Rs33.52bn. Volume
in steel products rose 138,000 tonnes to 1.87m tonnes. Steel production, at
2.08m tonnes, was 106,000 tonnes higher.
However, gross profit declined to Rs4.81bn from Rs5.59bn because of lower
margins, the company said.
Tisco said phase three of the company's modernisation programme had made
good progress during the year, adding that a new blast furnace was now in
full operation.
It said its hot strip mill was undergoing trials and would soon be fully
operational. Other units of the modernisation programme, as well as a new
cement plant, would be completed in the current 12 months.
