FT  14 FEB 92 / World Bank names treasurer
MRS Jessica Einhorn, 44, was yesterday appointed treasurer of the World Bank
in succession to Mr Donald Roth, who is leaving for the private sector,
writes Michael Prowse.
As senior financial officer, Mrs Einhorn will be one of 16 vice-presidents,
the top tier of management below the office of Mr Lewis Preston, the
president.
She is the first woman to achieve this rank through internal promotion. The
only previous female vice-president was Dr Anne Krueger, an academic who
served as chief economist in the early 1980s.
