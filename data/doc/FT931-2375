FT  20 MAR 93 / Power licence for Marc Rich
THE MARC Rich commodities trading organisation, which is based in
Switzerland, has become the first foreign company to be awarded a licence to
supply electricity in England and Wales.
Rich claims to be second only to Cargill, the US group, among the world's
diversified trading houses, concentrating particularly on oil and aluminium.
It publishes no accounts but Mr Marc Rich, who has built up the group since
1974, says turnover is about Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21bn) a year while the net
worth is about Dollars 1bn.
Mr Rich is a controversial figure because since 1984 he has been wanted by
the US authorities for tax evasion and on charges that he illegally traded
with Iran during the hostage crisis. He never visits the UK, which has
extradition arrangements with the US.
The Office of Electricity Regulation yesterday granted the Rich organisation
a second-tier licence with permission to supply electricity to very large
industrial customers, each with demand for at least 1 megawatt.
Rich will buy its electricity from the 'pool' or the wholesale market formed
after privatisation of the industry.
So far Ofer has issued 28 second-tier supply licences for England and Wales
and 17 for Scotland.
