FT  30 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee at fresh high as cartel
talks begin
LONDON ROBUSTA coffee prices touched six months highs yesterday as Latin
American producers met to thrash out the details of their planned cartel.
The two-day meeting of representatives from Brazil, Colombia and Guatemala
kicked off yesterday in Rio de Janeiro with talks on the formation of an
Association of Coffee Producing Countries. Today the talks switch to the
plan to keep 20 per cent of eight member countries' exports off the world
market.
The coffee retention plan has been well-timed, according to the latest
coffee report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. 'Producer stocks are
low and exportable production is around or below annual international
demand, which we estimate at some 74m bags.'
Man believes that any increase in producer stocks should be matched by a
fall in consumer stocks of a similar or greater magnitude. The US Department
of Agriculture estimates producer stocks at 35m bags - lower than at any
time in recent history.
The key negative factor that the scheme needs to counter is the high level
of consumer stocks. Man estimates that a fall from 20m bags to between 15m
and 16m bags in consumer stocks would result in a the International Coffee
Organisation indicator price rising to between 70 and 80 cents a lb.
While this would require a fall in 1993-94 world exports to about 69m bags,
producers' earnings would increase by about Dollars 1.3bn to Dollars 6.8bn.
The ICO indicator price has averaged only 54 cents a lb in the last 12
months. A move to between 70 and 80 cents would be equivalent to the New
York arabica market reaching 90 cents a lb and the London robusta market
Dollars 1,300 a tonne.
Last night September robusta closed at Dollars 1,013 a tonne after touching
a six-month high of Dollars 1,021 a tonne in early trading. The nearby New
York arabica contract was at 74 cents a lb in late trading.
The International Cocoa Organisation yesterday revised its 1992-93 figure
for the world cocoa deficit upwards by 31,000 tonnes to 133,000 tonnes. This
is in sharp contrast to the downward revision by ED &amp; F. Man earlier this
month to its estimate for 1992-93, from 124,000 tonnes to 96,000 tonnes.
