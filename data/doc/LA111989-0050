MENSCH BEFORE MOGUL 
Perhaps Steven Zipperstein and I did not read the same book (Neal Gabler's "An 
Empire of Their Own," Book Review, Nov. 5), but when he singles out Jack Warner 
as a humanitarian and leaves out Carl Laemmle, not only does he misread Gabler, 
but the facts as well. 
Yes, Warner was a movie mogul, but "Uncle Carl" was a warm Jewish mensch first. 
Leaving Carl Laemmle out of any discussion of Hollywood, "Where were you while 
the Holocaust was going on" is a travesty of omission.
