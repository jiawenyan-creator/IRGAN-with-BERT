FT  06 JAN 93 / Currency dealers happy to bide their time
FRANCE'S DECISION to raise its short-term interest rates yesterday provided
some relief for the French franc, which moved away from its floor of 3.4305
to the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
But foreign exchange dealers believed the Bank of France had only postponed
another speculative attack. 'We are still prepared to test the currency's
strength over the next few weeks,' said Mr David Cocker, chief economist at
Chemical Bank in London.
Some analysts continue to believe the franc can avoid a devaluation against
the D-Mark, an event that would effectively mean the end of the ERM.
Mr Brian Hilliard, chief economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull,
believes the franc is underpinned by the fundamental strength of the
economy, with French inflation now lower than Germany's.
He also noted that France's 5-10 days lending rate had been raised to 13 per
cent in the September crisis, higher than yesterday's overnight rate of 12
per cent. 'There is still plenty of ammunition in the Bank of France's
locker,' he said.
However, yesterday's rate rise failed to impress the senior currency dealer
at a large investment fund based in London. He said that he had already sold
in excess of FFr1bn into the market in the past week, and that he had no
French franc currency holdings left.
The fund manager said that France could not sustain high money market rates
for long because it would exacerbate the country's economic difficulties in
the run-up to parliamentary elections in March.
'The longer France keeps rates at these high levels, the more certain it is
the franc will be pushed out of the ERM,' he said.
Dealers continue to think the franc's future will be determined by decisions
made inside the Bundesbank rather than the Bank of France.
