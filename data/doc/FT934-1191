FT  21 DEC 93 / Gummer snubbed on reform of councils
The Local Government Commission has backtracked on its proposals to abolish
Gloucestershire county council and to replace the present two-tier council
structure with unitary authorities. Instead, it is 'with regret'
recommending the status quo.
The proposal comes after Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said
that he wanted to see unitary authorities replacing the two-tier system even
if this involved extra costs. It seems almost certain to provoke further
conflict between the commission and the government.
Sir John Banham, commission chairman, said Mr Gummer would be 'extremely
unwise' to ask the commission to reconsider before he had studied its
report.
He said: 'Our job is not to serve up something we know the secretary of
state will accept but to discharge our responsibilities.'
The commission did confirm its proposals to abolish Avon and Somerset county
councils in its final recommendations, published yesterday.
It rejects the case for a greater Bristol, which the business community and
city council have been pressing for. It proposes the city should become a
unitary authority in its existing boundaries.
Sir John said there was 'an astonishing level of support for reform' in Avon
and Somerset. But in Gloucestershire there was more support for retaining
the two-tier structure than for any other option.
Originally the commission proposed three unitary authorities to replace
Gloucestershire county council and the six district councils, but Sir John
said these had been unable to agree on a viable structure. He said the
commission regretted its failure to recommend unitary councils but it would
be irresponsible to propose change unless there was support by 'local
champions' for a new structure.
Mr Doug Henderson, Labour's local government spokesman, described the
proposals as a 'dog's breakfast'. He said: 'Of the first six areas covered,
five different solutions have been proposed, and the secretary of state has
rejected one of them.'
Gloucestershire county council welcomed the recommendation. Mr Michael
Honey, chief executive, said: 'The public want local authorities to continue
providing services - not having costly change forced upon them.'
Mr John Cripps, chief executive of Gloucestershire chamber of commerce and
industry, said: 'The status quo is the most acceptable of unacceptable
options at present. The whole thing has been a muddle from start to finish.'
For Somerset, the commission has changed its original proposals to create a
single authority covering most of the county. It now suggests three unitary
authorities after a MORI poll showed strong support for this.
The commissioners said there was very little public support for the
retention of Avon county, and it proposes four unitary authorities instead.
Mr Chris Curtis, the south-west regional director for the Confederation of
British Industry, said: 'We think in the very short term the decision not to
expand Bristol will be seen as a serious setback for trade and business, not
just in Bristol but in the area generally.' The decision on Gloucestershire
was 'quite incomprehensible'.
Mr John Savage, chief executive of Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative, said: 'There is absolutely no sign that the commission has
listened to the voice of the informed business community, despite all the
research we have carried out into the need for larger boundaries to make
Bristol the hub of a progressive economic region.'
