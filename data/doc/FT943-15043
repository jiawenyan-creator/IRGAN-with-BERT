FT  12 JUL 94 / Nationwide cuts rate on overdrafts
Nationwide, the second-largest building society, is to offer its
mortgage-holders the cheapest high-street authorised overdraft.
It is to tempt its 1.2m mortgage holders to open a Flex-Account current
account by cutting its equivalent annual rate on authorised overdrafts from
18.1 per cent to 8.74 per cent from August 1.
Nationwide's other current-account customers will see their equivalent
annual rate fall to 11.5 per cent from August 1, the society said yesterday.
Nationwide is the latest savings institution to enter the price battle for
new current-account business.
Abbey National, the building-society-turned-bank, and Woolwich, the
third-largest building society, recently halved the cost of their authorised
overdraft rates.
Nationwide's equivalent annual rates, which, unlike annual percentage rates,
do not include fees, undercut Abbey National's APR of 9.9 per cent and
Woolwich's 9.8 per cent APR. Mr Dennis Brockwell, director of marketing,
said: 'Nationwide is determined to remain competitive.'
When Abbey National halved its overdraft rate a fortnight ago, unleashing
market fears of a price war between banks and building societies for
current-account customers, it said that its main target was its
mortgage-holders with whom it already has a lending relationship.
Nationwide's move underlines a similar strategy even more explicitly.
Nationwide's unauthorised overdraft rate remains unchanged at 28.3 per cent
EAR.
