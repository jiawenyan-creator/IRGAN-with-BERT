NAVY, GREENPEACE 
The article "Navy Foils Greenpeace Ship to Fire Trident 2" (Part A, Dec. 5) 
seems to mark a new era in the U.S. military. Since the Soviets are no longer 
"the enemy" and the armed forces are no longer sure whom they are training to 
fight, a new enemy must quickly appear. 
But your article scarcely mentioned why Greenpeace confronted the Navy 
submarine. Why indeed is the Defense Department committing scarce tax dollars 
to the Trident missile system, when the overwhelming majority of the American 
people do not support such pork-barrel waste of our resources? 
I commend the courage of the staff of Greenpeace for bringing to the attention 
of the American people that we must shift our understanding of military 
balance. As I see it, "the enemy" is now our own dangerously wasteful weapons 
programs and the excessive pollution and destruction of land and sea caused by 
the testing and deployment of unneeded nuclear and other weapons systems.
