FT  09 AUG 94 / People: Philip Wroughton: hotly tipped
Old Etonian Philip Wroughton, a former High Sheriff of Berkshire, is having
a rather good August. Last week he was elected vice chairman of Marsh &amp;
McLennan Companies, the biggest and most respected of the world's insurance
brokers, and a day later his new racehorse, Landlord, won its first race at
London's Kempton Park.
It may be the last race that Wroughton watches for some time. As chairman of
CT Bowring and a member of the Council of Lloyd's, he will be required to
divide most of his time between New York and London in his new job as de
facto number two to Ian Smith, 60, who took over as Marsh &amp; McLennan's
chairman just over two years ago.
Wroughton, 61, who joined Bowring in 1961, has stepped down as chairman of
Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc, parent of the group's worldwide insurance broking
operations, and will be responsible for developing and pursuing new growth
opportunities in insurance and reinsurance broking businesses.
He will work closely with the heads of Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc, Guy Carpenter,
Seabury &amp; Smith and Frizell Financial Services.
Although there is a reasonably strict separation between insurance and
reinsurance operations in the US, it is not as delineated in other markets
around the world. There are 'significant opportunities for working more
closely together', says Wroughton, who will be Smith's senior adviser on
insurance matters.
Wroughton's promotion helps fill a gap which has existed since earlier this
year when Robert Clements, 61, stepped down as the group's president in
order to concentrate on running Marsh &amp; McLennan Risk Capital Corporation
which was set up in 1992 to help alleviate shortages in insurance
underwriting capacity.
Clements had been vice chairman for a brief period before becoming president
in 1992.
