FT  17 JUN 92 / Power cuts hit Manila growth aims
A SERIOUS shortage of electric power in the Philippines is expected to
reduce economic growth this year, according to businessmen and economists.
Mr Jose Pardo, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(PCCI), told the Financial Times that growth this year, earlier estimated at
about 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent, could now be 'at the most 2 per cent'
because of the power shortage. 'The 3 per cent growth is definitely out,' Mr
Pardo said.
The policy-making National Economic and Development Authority last week also
cut the top range of its growth target this year from 3 per cent to 2.5 per
cent, because of power disruptions.
The state-owned National Power Corporation (Napocor) has over the past four
months been unable to meet demand for electricity in the main island of
Luzon, including metropolitan Manila. Since October last year, Napocor has
had to ration electricity to users in Mindanao island.
Napocor's plants are mostly old and prone to break down when operating at
peak periods. Most of its hydrothermal plants, furthermore, are out of
commission because of widespread drought.
Intermittent power cuts lasted for 10 to 12 hours at their worst levels last
month. This led to disruptions throughout industry with many factories in
metropolitan Manila asking workers to report in the evenings when industrial
areas get their electricity 'rations'.
