P.M. BRIEFING; 
WANG REPORTED SET TO IDLE 2,500 
Wang Laboratories Inc., which recently ousted the founder's son as the 
company's president, plans to lay off another 2,500 employees, or 10% of the 
work force, a published report said today. 
The Boston Globe, citing a source close to the computer manufacturer, said the 
cuts, which Wang plans to announce next week, are part of a restructuring under 
new President Richard W. Miller. 
A spokesman for Wang, which had losses of nearly $425 million in the fiscal 
year that ended June 30, declined to confirm or deny the reported layoffs. 
Miller came to Wang in August, replacing former President Frederick Wang, the 
son of company founder and Chairman An Wang.
