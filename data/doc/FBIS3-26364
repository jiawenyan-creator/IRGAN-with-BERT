  [Text] Hefei, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in east 
China's Anhui Province are paying more attention to nourishing 
food with the improvement of their livelihoods, according to a 
provincial survey team. 
  Instead of eating sweet potatoes, a high-yield, low-value 
crop, all the year round, farmers now take rice and wheat flour 
as their staple food. Per capita consumption of rice and wheat 
reached 284 kg in 1992. 
  According to statistics, farmers' annual consumption of 
meat, 
eggs and milk has gone up from 7.3 kg to 13 kg per capita and 
edible oil from 2.5 kg to 5.9 kg per capita between 1978 and 
1992. 
  In addition, farmers spend more on cigarettes, liquor, sugar 
and tea.
