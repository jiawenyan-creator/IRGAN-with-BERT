FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Thai Agriculture Ministry seeks
approval for special rubber budget
THAILAND'S Agriculture Ministry will seek cabinet approval this month for a
special 500m baht (Pounds 13m) budget to be allocated to finance a
government effort to shore up weak rubber prices, reports Reuter from
Bangkok.
Mr Sanit Samosorn, director of the Rubber Research Institute, said the
budget, together with similar previous allocations, will enable the
government to buy 30,000 to 40,000 tonnes of unprocessed rubber.
He said the government fund was aimed at keeping the price of domestic
unsmoked sheets USS-3 at B17 a kilogram, compared with the present market
price of B15.50-16.00.
He said that the ministry would also ask the central bank to extend
short-term soft loans to private and state-owned agricultural co-operatives
to help them stock more rubber.
The concessionary loans will carry a 5 per cent annual interest rate,
compared with the 15 per cent commercial banks charge small borrowers.
