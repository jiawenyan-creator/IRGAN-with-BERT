  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- Ukrainian agreement to 
dismantle and store nuclear warheads from SS-24 missiles within 
ten months is one of the few results of the 
Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. negotiations, President of the National 
Security and International Relations Center Sergey Rogov told a 
briefing here today. 
  Rogov criticized the agreement, saying "commentaries 
claiming 
the tripartite statement on nuclear arms removes all problems 
related to nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory are 
too hasty". 
  In his words, the major drawback of the document is that it 
is not concrete. It carries no schedule of nuclear arms 
withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. If there is no withdrawal 
before the conference on non-proliferation of nuclear arms due 
to be held in 1995, the international community will face 
serious problems in discussion of the Non-Proliferation Treaty's 
future and a possibility of its joining by China, Israel and 
North Korea, stressed Rogov. 
  Even if Ukraine withdraws 176 intercontinental ballistic 
missiles and 1,500 warheads declared in the statement, it will 
not be able to sign the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear 
arms. In the words of Rogov, Ukraine has another 670 nuclear 
warheads from air-based missiles and gravity bombs.
