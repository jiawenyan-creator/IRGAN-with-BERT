Alabama Power Company; Availability of Environmental Assessment



 May 23, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has revised
the application for Martin Dam Project, located on the Tallapoosa River, in Elmore, Coosa, and Tallapoosa Counties,
Alabama, and has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposed revised recreation plan. The Commission
staff concluded that approval of the application for the revised recreation plan, would not constitute a major Federal
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20426. 

Please submit any comments within 30 days from the date of this notice. Any comments, conclusions, or recommendations
that draw upon studies, reports, or other working papers of substance should be supported by appropriate documentation.

Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix Project No. 349029 to all comments. For further information,
please contact Dan Hayes at (202) 2192660.
