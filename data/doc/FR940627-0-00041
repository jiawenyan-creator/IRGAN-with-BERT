 

B. Relation of the Marketing Affiliate Regulations of This Rule to Tariff Requirements Addressing Similar Problems



El Paso requests clarification that the Commission's Order No. 497 regulations, as codified in Part 161 and 250.16
of the regulations, constitute the exclusive requirements relating to marketing affiliates superseding any specific
tariff provisions related to affiliate transactions. It asserts that the Commission has in the past imposed tariff
requirements for certain transactions (such as gas inventory charges or interruptible sales) that were meant to
address problems similar to those addressed in the affiliate provisions. It maintains that these tariff provisions
should be considered inoperative so all pipelines will be treated equally.

The Commission cannot make a universal determination of the applicability of all outstanding tariff provisions.
The Commission, however, will carefully review pipeline filings to eliminate any such provisions the pipelines
believe are superfluous in light of the marketing affiliate requirements.



C. Applicability of the Marketing Affiliate Regulations of This Rule to Permanent Releases of Capacity



AER/MRT request clarification of whether a permanent release of capacity will trigger the reporting and maintenance
requirements of the rule. They point to the Commission's finding that the Order No. 497 reporting requirements do
not apply to temporary capacity releases,

69

 and contend the same treatment should apply to permanent releases, since permanent releases, like temporary releases,
are controlled not by the pipeline, but by the firm shipper holding capacity.

 Northwest Pipeline Corporation, 65 FERC  61,007 (1993).

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission does not agree that permanent releases are identical to temporary releases. In a temporary capacity
release, the releasing shipper is still obligated to the pipeline under its initial contract. Thus, even if the releasing
shipper agrees to accept a discounted rate, the pipeline has not agreed to the discount because the releasing shipper
will owe the maximum rate under its contract.

70

 In a permanent capacity release, however, the releasing shipper's contractual obligations end, and the replacement
shipper enters into a new contract with the pipeline. Thus, if the pipeline offers a discount to its affiliate it must
post that discount on its EBB under Standard H and it must maintain the required discount information under 250.16.

The releasing shipper is entitled to a credit to reflect the amount bid by the replacement shipper. Of course, if the
releasing shipper's contract with the pipeline involved a discount, that fact would be disclosed when the contract
was consummated.

D. EBB Posting of Information Constitutes a Filing



Hadson requests clarification that, as stated in Order No. 497E, the posting of Order No. 497 information on
a pipeline's EBB constitutes a filing with the Commission for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001, which provides
criminal penalties for a knowing and willful misrepresentation to the government.

71

 The Commission reaffirms its position in Order No. 497E that posting of the affiliate information is deemed
to be a filing for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001.

E. Posting of Pipeline Tariffs



Indicated Parties contend that the pipelines should be required to post their tariffs. They assert such posting would
save shippers as well as the pipelines considerable time and money as compared with the current requirement that pipelines
make their tariffs available for public inspection and send copies to shippers. The issue of posting pipeline tariffs
is unrelated to the affiliate regulations and is not appropriately considered in this proceeding. The issue has been
discussed at some of the conferences in Docket No. RM934000 relating to standards for EBBs, and that
would be a more appropriate forum to consider this issue.



F. Relationship to the Commission's EBB Standards Proceeding



The National Registry contends that the issues of affiliate disclosure are related to issues involved in the Commission's
ongoing proceeding, in Docket No. RM934000, to develop standards for electronic dissemination of
information about firm and interruptible capacity. In particular, the National Registry is concerned about the
disclosure of information relating to the firm and interruptible capacity rights of shippers, and suggests that
the Commission hold a technical conference to determine how best to provide disclosure of capacity rights information.

The Commission finds that the issue of disclosure of capacity rights is properly considered only in the Docket No.
RM934000 proceeding. As stated earlier, in Order No. 563A, the Commission found merit in the
development of an index of capacity rights and directed the industry to develop a final proposal by September 30, 1994.



XI. Environmental Analysis



The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action
that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.

72

 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.

73

 The action taken here falls within the categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations.

74

 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking.
