TRUSTEES TO RETHINK DEMISE OF READING PROGRAM 
The future of an experimental remedial reading program for seventh-graders in 
San Diego city schools will be discussed once again by the district board of 
trustees after it learned Tuesday that many educators disagree with a negative 
evaluation on which the board relied to kill the project. 
A Times article Tuesday detailed the objections raised by teachers and 
principals at the four schools that piloted the special one-semester program to 
a report issued by the district's evaluation department. 
The educators believe the 3-year-old program both improved skills and boosted 
the desire to read among low-achieving seventh-graders. 
Although the schools did not receive copies of the report until Tuesday -- 
after the newspaper article noted that its contents had not been given to 
principals or teachers -- they strongly criticized it after learning of the 
contents from a reporter -- for its methodology and several statements of fact 
concerning the training of teachers and the nature of books and materials used, 
as well as for its conclusions. 
Trustee Jim Roache, supported by colleagues Kay Davis and Ann Armstrong, asked 
Supt. Tom Payzant to bring the program back before the board in two weeks so 
issues raised by the piloting schools can be fully discussed. Armstrong asked 
also to have the teachers from the schools participate in the discussion. 
Roache said that, although he would not vote to continue the program based on 
teachers saying that "they believe" it works, he wants to take a second look at 
it because several points raised about the evaluation involve whether all 
aspects of the pilot were fully explored. 
Several teachers raised questions about whether the evaluation fairly measured 
changes in attitudes among low-achieving seventh-graders, whether it fairly 
compared students who took the course to those who did not in terms of reading 
performance, and whether any shortcomings are attributable more to the limited 
nature of the remedial class rather than to flaws in teaching or materials.
