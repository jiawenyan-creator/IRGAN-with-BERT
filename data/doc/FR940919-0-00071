6. Universal Treatment Standards for Cyanide Wastes 


For the nonwastewater forms of cyanide wastes, EPA is promulgating the UTS as proposed: 590 mg/kg (total cyanide)
and 30 mg/kg (amenable cyanide). For wastewaters, EPA is promulgating the UTS: 1.2 mg/l (total cyanide) and 0.86 mg/l
(amenable cyanide). These wastewater standards differ from those that were proposed (see section b of the cyanide
UTS discussion below). The cyanide wastewater and nonwastewater UTS are based on the treatment of wastewaters via
alkaline chlorination.
EPA is also codifying in 40 CFR 268.40 that compliance with the cyanide nonwastewater UTS requires the use of EPA SW846,
Test Methods 9010 and 9012, along with a specified sample size of 10 grams, and a distillation time of 75 minutes. Most
commenters, in particular those from the hazardous waste treatment industry, welcomed and supported this part of
EPA's proposal. These kind of provisions eliminate variabilities that can result from the analyses of different
sample sizes and distillation times. A detailed discussion of these treatment standards follows. 


a. Cyanide Nonwastewaters 


EPA proposed three options for cyanide in nonwastewater forms (a standard based on total and amenable cyanide concentrations,
a standard based on TCLP concentrations, and a standard that specifies treatment methods) at 58 FR 48104. EPA is promulgating
the first option.
