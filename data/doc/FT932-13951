FT  21 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
March's record public sector borrowing - Pounds 11bn excluding privatisation
receipts - is a truly heroic effort. A decade ago, such a total for the year
as a whole would have been a disaster. Yesterday the gilt market barely
blinked. Such insouciance will only be justified if March turns out to be a
one-off. Cash limits encourage departments to spend unused cash before the
financial year-end. In 1992-93, buying from outside contractors may have
proved more cost-effective than expected, leaving more cash looking for a
home. But if so, why did the chancellor have no inkling of it when he
delivered a much lower estimate in the Budget five weeks ago?
Until now, the markets have assumed that the chancellor's prediction of a
Pounds 50bn budget deficit for 1993-94 was deliberately pessimistic. That
may prove a false expectation. The overshoot last year also means that the
Treasury has pre-funded less of this year's borrowings than first thought.
While the government will doubtless get the debt away, it cannot afford
attacks of nerves if it is to sell gilts at current yields. Its prospects
are not improved by the Bank of England opportunistically auctioning stock
at any maturity. Issues aimed at the banks, and a tough spending round, will
be more persuasive.
