FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Weak oil price cuts Clyde Petroleum to
Pounds 3.04m
CLYDE Petroleum reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits last year because
of the weak oil price. However, the independent oil and gas exploration and
production company still intends to pursue an expansive exploration policy.
Profits were Pounds 3.04m for 1991, down from Pounds 9.98m last time,
equivalent to earnings of 2p (2.9p) per share. The fall came despite a sharp
increase in daily production, from the equivalent of 19,000 barrels of oil a
day to 24,000 b/d. But the realised UK price amounted to Pounds 11.37 per
barrel, compared to Pounds 13.42.
The company's proven and probable reserves amounted to 195,774m barrels of
oil equivalent, down from 197,289m. Dr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the
company continued to seek new oil sources, mainly in regions outside its
traditional North Sea area of operation.
There had been particularly encouraging results from a well off the east
coast of the Malaysian peninsula. It was still being tested but appeared to
contain several reservoirs of high quality oil
The group is maintaining its final dividend at 0.75p leaving the total for
the year unchanged at 1.25p. It said, however, that there was inevitably a
conflict between the need to fund exploration and the requirement to pay
dividends.
Because of expanded international activity and the weak oil price, directors
said they would review future dividend policy.
