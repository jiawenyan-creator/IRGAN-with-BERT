  [Text] Police Commissioner Rafi Peled says the increased 
police deployment introduced following the Hebron massacre will 
continue for the time being. Touring the south, the 
commissioner said the closure on the Gaza Strip and the 
territories in general will continue until the tension, which 
arose in the wake of the massacre, dissipates. 
  [Begin Peled recording] Right now the thing to do is to calm 
the situation. People in charge should have an opportunity to 
organize and calm flaring tempers. I think, therefore, that the 
closure is the right answer at this time. The beefed-up police 
deployment will also continue as long as necessary. [end
