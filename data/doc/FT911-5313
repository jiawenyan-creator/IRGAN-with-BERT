FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: MGN float finalised this week
MR ROBERT Maxwell, the publisher, will this week decide the final details of
the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers. The float is expected to value the
group at between Pounds 500m and Pounds 700m.
Mr Maxwell is at the New York Daily News, a recent loss-making acquisition
which will not be included in the float. He will return to London to take
the decision probably by Wednesday.
Between 40 per cent and 49 per cent of the company which Mr Maxwell bought
from Reed International in 1984 for Pounds 113m is expected to be floated.
The main newspapers are the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, The People, and the
Daily Record and Sunday Mail in Scotland.
Minority stakes in two Canadian companies, a commercial printer and a
newsprint group will also be included but not The European newspaper.
The Stock Exchange blocked plans to offer shares to Daily Mirror readers.
At the moment the intention is to split the offer equally between small
investors in the UK, institutions and overseas investors.
A larger proportion might be made available to American investors because of
Mr Maxwell's higher profile in the US following the Daily News purchase.
