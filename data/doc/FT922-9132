FT  09 MAY 92 / Mexican inflation falls
Mexico's inflation rate in April fell to 0.9 per cent, bringing the
cumulative rate for the first four months of the year to 5 per cent, reports
Damian Fraser from Mexico City. While inflation is now at its lowest since
1975, the government target of single digit inflation appears out of reach.
