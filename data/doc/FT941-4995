FT  09 MAR 94 / Czechs delay EU application
President Vaclav Havel said yesterday the Czech Republic would delay its
application to join the European Union, foregoing a joint approach with
Poland and Hungary. The Czech Republic wanted to join the EU as soon as
possible, he said, but needed more time. Meanwhile, Mr Andrzej Olechowski,
the Polish foreign minister, said it was not realistic for Poland to become
a full EU member in the near future, because of the costs of extending the
CAP and regional aid to his country.
