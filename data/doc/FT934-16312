FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Thatcher joins in
spending wrangle
LADY Thatcher, the former prime minister, arrived in Blackpool last night
and immediately joined the mounting controversy over public spending.
After arriving to a media reception at the seafront Imperial Hotel more than
twice the size of the one which greeted the prime minister earlier in the
week, she appeared later at a Young Conservatives fringe meeting.
In a brief private speech, she argued against further cuts in defence
expenditure, saying it was vital for Britain to maintain a strong defence.
Lady Thatcher told the fringe meeting, according to members of her audience:
'The country needs a strong defence and needs to be prepared for
eventualities.
'There are always threats. It is quite difficult to know where there are
problems, so we have to be strong and resolute to face them.
'We have got to watch out for trouble spots such as Bosnia.'
Lady Thatcher's comments came after Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, warned on Tuesday that more cost-cutting reductions in the armed
forces would leave Britain a 'paper tiger', unable to fight another
Falklands war.
As she left the meeting at the conference centre, journalists outside the
gathering could hear Young Conservatives chanting 'Maggie, Maggie, Maggie -
in, in, in.'
Lady Thatcher will sit on the conference platform today as Mr Clarke winds
up the key debate on the economy.
The government is to introduce legislation to speed up its market testing
initiative designed to open government services to bids from the private
sector.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, said the legislation would
end anomalies that have prevented market testing from being applied to a
wider range of services.
The government is expected to include the proposals in the deregulation bill
it is planning for the next parliamentary session beginning in November.
