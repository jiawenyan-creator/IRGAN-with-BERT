FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: German regional bank continues
buoyant trend
OPERATING profits at Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German regional public
sector bank, climbed by 'more than 50 per cent' in the first three months of
the current year against the comparable period for last year, the bank's
chief executive said yesterday.
Mr Friedel Neuber said that the good performance to date would put the bank
on course for total operating profits of about DM1bn (Dollars 600m) for the
year, up from DM970m for 1991.
He cautioned that first-quarter operating profits were inflated by the
inclusion of a contribution from the housebuilding promotion facility of the
state of Westphalia for the first time. Stripping this out, profits would
have risen by 30 per cent in the first quarter.
The figures confirm that the German banking sector is still enjoying
excellent lending conditions in the wake of a vintage year last year.
Last month, Commerzbank reported total operating profits up by 75 per cent
in the first two months of the current year.
Spelling out some details of last year's results, WestLB said that group net
profits rose from DM56m in 1990 to DM224.64m last year, while group
operating earnings for last year more than doubled from DM340m to DM714m.
