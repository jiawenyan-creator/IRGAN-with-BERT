FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Investcorp expands into music
with Camelot deal
INVESTCORP, the Arab-led investment consortium, plans to expand its
retailing operations into the music sector through the acquisition of
Camelot Music, the third-biggest US music retailer.
Investcorp is believed to be paying more than Dollars 350m for the
privately-held Camelot, which had revenues of Dollars 421m in fiscal 1993.
Neither company would reveal the terms of the deal, which is expected to be
complete by the year-end.
Mr Paul Soldatos, a member of Investcorp's management committee, said
Camelot had 'significant growth potential'. Investcorp is expected to expand
Camelot's foothold in the music retailing business through other
acquisitions.
Investcorp has a significant presence in the US retail world through its
ownership of Saks Fifth Avenue, the upmarket department store group which it
bought in 1990 for Dollars 1.6bn from the UK's BAT group. Its North American
interests also include the Tiffany jewellery chain, Peebles Department
Stores and the Circle K convenience store chain.
Earlier this year Investcorp gained control of Gucci, the luxury goods
group. In the UK, it bought Thorn EMI's Lighting division for Dollars 162m
in what was effectively a management buy-out. According to US trade
publications, Investcorp bid against HMV of the UK for Camelot.
Camelot, which has 365 stores in 34 states, was founded by Mr Paul David in
1956. Most of its stores are in shopping malls. They sell compact discs and
cassettes in addition to video-cassettes and other home entertainment
products.
Mr David is expected to retire as Camelot's chairman, president and chief
executive. Mr James Bonk, 45, will take on the positions of president and
chief executive.
