  [Text] Istanbul, June 3 (A.A.) -- Israeli Economics and 
Planning Minister Shim'on Shetrit said on Thursday [2 June] that 
Turkey had a great potential and was capable of easily 
overcoming its current economic bottleneck. 
  In an arrival statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, 
Shetrit, on an official visit to Turkey, said that his country 
faced certain economic hardships in the eighties, with an 
inflation rate skyrocketing to 300-500 percent annually. 
  He added that the current inflation rate in his country was 
around 10 percent and to achieve this, a consensus was necessary 
among the government, businessmen, and trade unions. 
  He said that the current trade volume between the two 
countries was not sufficient. 
  The visiting minister will hold contacts with officials in 
Istanbul and Ankara.
