FT  19 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Atkins' shares decline 11% following
profits warning
Shares in Atkins Group fell 11 per cent to 139p yesterday as the hosiery
manufacturer warned that net profits would be substantially lower this year
because of a sharp slowdown in trading during the final quarter.
Mr Andrew Freeman, chief executive, said Atkins had been enjoying 'a
rip-roaring nine months' and had increased operating costs to meet the
increased demand.
However, sales had slowed dramatically since the new year holiday.
Although turnover was still ahead of last year, it was substantially below
the 15 per cent increase experienced in the first half.
Mr Freeman said the slowdown had been due to weakening consumer demand and
retailer confidence.
Profits would also be hit by difficulties in the garments business. The
withdrawal from fabric dyeing, announced last year, had caused disruption
and loss of profitability in this division.
Mr Freeman stressed that the difficulties were 'not terminal. We are still
enthusiastic and encouraged about our prospects.'
During the year Atkins had increased its share of the depressed hosiery
market, he said, and now claimed a 7.5 per cent share in the UK. About 60
per cent of Atkins' sales are in hosiery.
In 1993 the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 448,000 for the year to
April 3, against a loss of Pounds 227,000 in 1992.
Gearing at the year end was expected to rise from an exceptionally low 17
per cent to 40 per cent. Last year the group benefited from asset disposals
and low stock levels.
