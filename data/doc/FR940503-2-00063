Mr. Cyrus Nasseri,


Assistant Secretary, Conservation, and Renewable Energy, United States Department of Energy, 1000 Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.



Dear Mr. Nasseri: This is a petition for waiver and application for interim waiver submitted pursuant to title 10 CFR
430.27. Waiver is requested from the furnace test procedure as prescribed in appendix N to Subpart B of Part 430. The
test procedure requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner and blower start-up. Rheem is requesting authorization
to use a 20 second delay instead of 1.5 minutes for our series (^)GDG upflow, (^)GLH downflow, (^)GVH horizontal, and
(^)GPH upflow/horizontal residential gas-fired furnaces.
Rheem will be manufacturing these appliances with an electronic device that controls the blower operation on a timing
sequence as opposed to temperature.
Improved energy efficiency is achieved by reducing on cycle losses. Under the Appendix N procedures, the stack temperature
is allowed to climb at a faster rate than it would with a 20 second blower on time, allowing energy to be lost out of the
vent system. This waste of energy would not occur in actual operation. If this petition is granted, the true blower
on time delay would be used in the calculations.
The current test procedures do not give Rheem credit for the energy savings which averages approximately 2%. This
improvement is an average reduction of 20% of the normal on cycle energy losses. Rheem is of the opinion that a 20% reduction
is a worthwhile energy savings.
Rheem has been granted previous waivers regarding blower on time to be used in the efficiency calculations for our
(^)GEB and (^)GKA series condensing furnaces and/or (^)GDE, (^)GLE, (^)GDG, (^)GLG and (^)GVG series furnaces.
Several other manufacturers of gas furnaces have also been granted a waiver to permit calculations based on timed
blower operation. Also, ASHRAE Standard 1031993, paragraph 9.5.1.2.2 specifically addresses the use of
timed blower operation.
Confidential and comparative test data is available to you upon your request, confirming the above energy savings.
Manufacturers that domestically market similar products are being sent a copy of this petition for waiver and petition
for interim waiver.



Sincerely,
