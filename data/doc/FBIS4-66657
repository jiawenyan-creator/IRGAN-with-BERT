<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Djaffar El-Afghani Group: Five </F>
of Its Nine Lieutenants Not Yet Identified"] 
  [Text] When the security forces broke up the Djaffar 
El-Afghani group in Bouzareah, in an area overlooking Algiers, 
nine terrorists including Djaffar El-Afghani were killed. This 
group, we would remind [readers], was preparing to commit crimes 
and set fire to businesses throughout the entire month of 
Ramadan. 
  It was a diabolical operation that was halted by security 
forces. 
  Now if Djaffar El-Afghani, the presumed head of the GIA 
[Armed Islamic Group], and five of his other lieutenants have 
been identified, the others have not, it has been learned from a 
well-informed source. 
  The same source said that their identification is under way. 
Let us observe that terrorist groups, to prevent any 
identification of their members struck down by security forces, 
use a method that consists of burning or mutilating the bodies.
