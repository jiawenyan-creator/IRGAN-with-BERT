  [Text] On the threshold of the election to the City 
Assembly, the number of public committees has increased by one 
more. The committee is called "Voter-94" and sets as its goal 
the helping of all of us not to make a mistake when forming the 
city's representative authority. 
  And, as becomes obvious from a committee message to St. 
Petersburgers which was received at the editorial office, it is 
easy to make a mistake. Because of the large number of mandates, 
the committee warns that competent people may be overlooked, and 
the persons who will get through to the City Assembly will be 
either less effective or more affluent contenders. 
  In order to prevent this from happening, the committee 
intends, first of all, to strive for a two-round voting system, 
which will reduce the probability of distorting the will of the 
voters, and, secondly, to propose and to make known to the city 
dwellers the criteria that enable them to evaluate a candidate's 
readiness to work in the city's legislative body. The committee 
calls upon specialists and representatives of all the interested 
public organizations and movements to cooperate in this work.
