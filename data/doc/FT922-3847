FT  09 JUN 92 / Panamanian protesters await visit by Bush
PANAMANIANS from jobless slum dwellers to wealthy businessmen plan to make
their grievances known to US president George Bush when he visits on
Thursday for the first time since he ordered an invasion of their country,
Reuter reports from Panama City.
All of them accuse the White House of doing too little to resolve lingering
problems caused by the December 1989 military strike that toppled strongman
General Manuel Noriega and killed at least 520 Panamanians.
'There are a lot of people in Panama who feel that the US should continue
giving to this country, that the aid hasn't been sufficient,' said a senior
Latin American diplomat.
'They'll take advantage of Bush's visit to ask for more.'
On the surface, Panama's post-invasion recovery looks sound. But prosperity
over the past 2 1/2 years has failed to reach much of the population.
Unemployment in the port city of Colon has climbed to 50 per cent by some
estimates. In Panama City, where drug abuse has soared since the invasion,
police are battling a crime wave that appears unlikely to go away soon.
And the country's image is tainted by incessant reports that money
laundering has fuelled its booming construction and banking industries.
