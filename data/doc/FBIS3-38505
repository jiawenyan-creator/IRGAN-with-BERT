  [Text] Zurich, 27 Jan (ATSA) -- Federal Council member 
Flavio Cotti and Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen 
held a two-hour discussion on international issues on Thursday 
afternoon [27 January] in Zurich. At the news conference 
afterward at Zurich-Kloten Airport, Mr. Cotti declared that 
Denmark had assured Switzerland of its support in the bilateral 
negotiations with the European Union [EU]. Mr. Petersen has 
welcomed the Swiss strategic goal of joining the EU. 
  The Danish foreign minister believes this will facilitate 
bilateral negotiations. Denmark and other countries will be 
pleased to see Switzerland join the EU, the Danish minister 
said. He feels the Danish experience proves that small 
countries have at their disposal important possibilities to act 
within the EU.
