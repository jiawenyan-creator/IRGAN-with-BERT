FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: John Tams moves ahead to Pounds 379,000
John Tams, the USM-quoted earthenware and bone china company, returned
profits of Pounds 379,000 pre-tax for the half year ended September 30, an
improvement of 4.7 per cent over last time's Pounds 362,000.
A rise in turnover to Pounds 9.93m (Pounds 8.5m) in part reflected the
purchase in March of RGC. Trading profits rose by 6 per cent to Pounds
606,000 but interest charges took Pounds 18,000 more at Pounds 227,000.
Earnings edged ahead to 1.25p (1.05p) and the interim dividend is maintained
at 1.59p. Mr Gerald Tams, chairman, is waiving his entitlement to the
distribution, resulting in a saving to the company of Pounds 236,174.
