FT  13 AUG 93 / Slovakian language bar angers Hungary
THE DISPUTE on the use of the Hungarian language in southern Slovakia has
flared again and threatens to damage further already troubled relations
between Bratislava and Budapest.
The latest row centres on a recent Slovak government order to remove all
Hungarian-Slovak bilingual road signs in a region which is home to the bulk
of a 600,000 strong ethnic Hungarian minority.
The decision follows an about-turn last month on a package of laws designed
to protect the language rights of the country's Hungarian minority. Voting
on the laws was postponed until after Slovakia's admission to the Council of
Europe was secured at the end of June. The Slovak parliament approved the
laws in mid-July but they were rejected by the government a week later.
The latest move has brought protests from local politicians and newspapers,
and the mayor of Marcelova in the Komarno district, announced he would
impose a blockade of all the roads into his municipality until the
government withdraws the order and bilingual signs are returned.
A government spokesman said yesterday the road block was illegal, and that
the order applied to all regions.
