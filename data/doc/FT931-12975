FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Mortgage lending rise signals housing upturn
FURTHER SIGNS of a slight upturn in the housing market emerged yesterday in
figures from the Building Societies Association showing a rise in the number
of people committing themselves to taking out mortgages in December.
The number of net new commitments - when a borrower accepts an offer of a
mortgage advance - rose to Pounds 1.987bn in December from Pounds 1.849bn in
November. Gross mortgage lending increased to Pounds 2.242bn for the month,
up from Pounds 2.087bn in November.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, said it was likely that
the fourth quarter had marked a 'watershed' for the housing market as the
impact of lower interest rates started to affect the confidence of
housebuyers.
But Mr Boleat said the weak state of the housing market last year was
reflected by the fact that gross mortgage advances for the year of Pounds
33.585bn were 20 per cent down on the figure of Pounds 42.024bn for 1991.
Separately, societies managed to stem the outflow of retail funds following
cuts in base rates during the last quarter of the year. The net retail
inflow was Pounds 117m in December, against a net outflow of Pounds 184m in
November.
Although societies managed to avoid a net outflow of retail funds for 1992,
the net receipts for the year were only Pounds 295m, the lowest figure since
1961. Savings balances rose by Pounds 12bn, however, as interest earned
remained in accounts.
Mr Boleat said the rise in net new commitment during December was 'an
encouraging sign'. It was against the seasonal norm of a fall in buying in
December, and so supported evidence of a recovery in activity, he said.
