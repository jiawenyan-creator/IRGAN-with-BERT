FT  04 JAN 93 / Joblessness set to surge in Germany
GERMAN unemployment is likely to surge by at least 400,000 this year,
according to Mr Heinrich Franke, president of the federal labour office.
The increase will be even higher if the government carries out its threat to
cut subsidies which currently support up to 800,000 jobs in the east, he
warned in a radio interview.
The number of people without jobs in the west, now approaching 2m, will
increase by 300,000, he said. Unemployment in the east, currently just over
1m, will go up by 100,000.
Mr Franke, who retires at the end of this month, claimed his office's DM88bn
(Pounds 36.2bn) budget for 1993 was far from sufficient. Bonn, which is
struggling to contain public spending, would have to find an extra DM10bn to
top up contributory schemes.
Although official figures put the jobless at 3m, there are a further 2.3m
'hidden' unemployed - 1.8m in the east and 500,000 in the west - who are not
registered. These include people in re-training, job creation and
educational schemes, for whom prospects look grim.
According to Mr Klaus Murmann, head of the BVA federal employers'
association, 5.5m people will be without a 'proper' job at the end of 1993.
The proportion of westerners currently unemployed is around 6 per cent, but
absolute numbers are threatening to reach records levels.
In the east, where full employment was the rule until unification, numbers
employed have fallen from 9.8m to 6.2m. According to Mr Franke, given
'normal economic development' and the injection over 10 years of DM1,300bn
in private and public investment, this should level off at around 7m.
