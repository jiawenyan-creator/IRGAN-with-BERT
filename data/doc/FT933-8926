FT  12 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
THE futures market powered to a new high yesterday as buyers broke cover on
the back of renewed hopes for European interest rate cuts and growing
confidence in the UK economy, writes Christopher Price.
Within an hour of opening the September contract was beginning its surge
forward, finding resistance levels at 3,006 and 3,010 against any attempt at
profit-taking.
It was familiar sentiment driving September on. Further trimming of French
rates, with rumours of a full one-point cut today were being heard. News of
a positive Bank of England report on inflation also heightened speculation
of a UK rate cut, which added further spice to the very firm gilts market.
Dealers said that the pace of the rally prompted large-scale arbitraging
between the future and cash markets which mopped up excess stock and
squeezed the equity side higher. But there were genuine buyers too, as
yesterday's turnover of over 10,000 contracts showed.
September eventually closed at 3,019, a 39-point rise on the day and a
10-point premium to its fair value level of about three.
Turnover in traded options also reflected the day's excitement, with 46,500
contracts dealt.
British Gas was the leading stock option, with 5,857 contracts traded,
followed by BT on 3,264. FT-SE volume was 13,037 contracts.
