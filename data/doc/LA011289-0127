METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
FUNDS FOR CARE OF ECCLESIA YOUTHS OKD 
An Oregon legislative subcommittee has agreed to appropriate $500,000 to pay 
the state's cost of caring for the 53 children removed from the Watts-based 
Ecclesia Athletic Assn. camp in October. 
The subcommittee of the Legislative Emergency Board made the recommendation 
after being told by the state Department of Justice that there was little 
chance of getting the money from the children's families. 
The 53 children have been in state custody since Oct. 14 after the death of 
Dayna Broussard, 8, the daughter of Ecclesia founder Eldridge Broussard Jr. The 
children have been kept at the Hillcrest School for Girls, the MacLaren School 
for Boys and with foster families.
