FT  10 SEP 92 / Letter: Lending institutions and planners can stimulate
rented housing sector
Sir, John Willman sets out all the main reasons why the private rented
sector needs to be revitalised ('A welcome mat for rental markets',
September 8). But while there have indeed been recent signs that the
government agrees there is a housing crisis in Britain because we have huge
owner-occupation and social housing sectors, with nothing in between, much
needs to be done.
Private renting has in the past been a significant source of low-cost
housing and, with the large amount of empty property in London and the
country as a whole, it needs to be encouraged. Not only do private landlords
need a level playing field in which to operate - which means an end to the
current tax discrimination and the introduction of worthwhile financial
incentives - but they also need to know that the political support is there.
In the past the lack of all-party political support has tended to discourage
potential new landlords from entering the market. Further efforts to
encourage them may well result in banks, building societies and other
institutions taking on the role of landlords.
Mention must be made of equity-sharing, which has largely been ignored by
the big lenders as a means of helping hard-pressed borrowers to stay in
their homes. The LBA has urged the government to encourage lenders to take
the option more seriously. Meanwhile, perhaps lenders will consider leasing
repossessed homes to local authorities and housing associations so that they
can be put to a useful purpose. Simon Randall,
