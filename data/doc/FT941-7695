FT  23 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and Singapore
stage rebound
Tokyo
Share prices fluctuated on arbitrage trading, the Nikkei 225 average finally
closing moderately lower on small-lot selling, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The index lost 51.31 at 19,342.63 after setting a day's low of 19,327.13,
and a high of 19,561.56. The Topix index of all first section stocks
finished 2.21 up at 1,572.17.
The Nikkei 225 rallied at the end of the morning on reports that Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, a representative of the Japan Renewal party, had said that he was in
favour of numerical targets to measure progress in opening Japan's markets.
Prospects of a compromise between the US and Japan over trade encouraged
stock and currency market dealers, pushing up the Nikkei briefly and
supporting the dollar against the yen.
Volume came to 310m shares, against 234m. Rises led falls by 614 to 388,
with 174 issues unchanged. The Nikkei 300 was 0.08 firmer at 290.59, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead 0.37 to 1,304.42.
Steel issues were lower on profit-taking. Nippon Steel receded Y3 to Y337
and Kobe Steel Y7 to Y260. Selling also hit some banks, with Industrial Bank
of Japan down Y10 to Y3,190 and Sumitomo Bank slipping Y20 to Y2,120.
Brokers, however, were higher on institutional buying. Nomura Securities
gained Y10 at Y2,240.
Telecommunications and high-technology stocks were firm on the multimedia
theme. Toshiba, the day's most active issue, rose Y9 to Y726 and Hitachi Y8
to Y900. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y20,000 to Y934,000.
But profit-taking depressed Matsushita Electric Industrial by Y30 to Y1,690,
while TDK relinquished Y50 at Y6,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 123.45 to 21,387.85 in volume of 109.6m
shares. Roundup
Rebounds were seen in some Pacific Rim markets after Monday's weakness.
HONG KONG was sharply higher on active bargain hunting and futures-linked
buying. The Hang Seng index closed near the day's high, up 217.56, or 2.1
per cent, at 10,674.01, having picked up from a 151-point deficit after some
early profit-taking. Preliminary volume was low at HKDollars 5.1bn but above
Monday's HKDollars 4.26bn.
February and March index futures surged forward 390 and 395 points
respectively to 10,850 and 10,860, leaving premiums of about 180 points to
the cash market.
Blue chips in the property sector, which suffered most losses in the recent
bear run, became targets of the late buying. Sun Hung Kai Properties jumped
HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 61 and Henderson Land HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars
47.50.
SINGAPORE advanced 2.1 per cent on strong institutional and retail buying
which took the market back to levels last seen in late December. The Straits
Times Industrial index added 49.49 at 2,400.36, underpinned by expectations
of good corporate results, and a positive government budget announcement
today.
AUSTRALIA recouped half of Monday's loss, helped by futures trading, but
investors remained hesitant ahead of last night's speech by Mr Alan
Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve Board chairman. The All Ordinaries index
ended 24 ahead at 2,202.5.
NEW ZEALAND finished weaker after a roller-coaster day's trading that saw
the NZSE-40 capital index lose 30 points, recover to 4 points above the
opening mark, and collapse again at the close.
The early drop was attributed to worries about weakness in the US and
European markets, before investors were heartened by news that Moody's, the
US ratings agency, was considering a possible upgrade of New Zealand's
sovereign debt. But the higher trend could not be maintained and the index
fell back to finish 23.76 down at 2,217.64.
TAIWAN closed lower for the fourth straight session and turnover continued
to shrink, although some late buying in selected financials was viewed as a
positive sign.
The weighted index quickly gave up an early gain to finish a net 49.98 off
at 5,733.91, in turnover that fell to TDollars 41.53bn, its lowest this
year, compared with Monday's TDollars 42.2bn.
SEOUL closed higher amid demand for blue chips, although some selling
pressure knocked prices off an early peak. The composite index gained 7.22
at 953.22, having touched 959.11 in the morning. Volume was a moderate 33m
shares.
JAKARTA rebounded on local support in slow trading, and the JKSE index
improved 9.09 to 552.85.
BOMBAY ended softer on mild profit-taking and lack of buying support at
levels which market players considered high after Monday's 5.5 per cent
advance. The BSE 30-share index retreated 44.63 to 4,084.89.
KARACHI felt the benefit of a fresh inflow of foreign funds to the chemical
and energy sectors which took the KSE index 32.17 higher to 2,407.58.
