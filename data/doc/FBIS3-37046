"Reformers, Unite! Yegor Gaydar Appeals to Leaders of Reformist 
and Democratic Organizations"] 
  [Text] The elections for the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly, the appeal says, have shown convincingly that a 
weighty reason for the extreme reactionary political forces' 
relative success was the inability or unwillingness of various 
democratic blocs and parties to agree on genuine coordination of 
their actions. Sergey Baburin, Yuriy Vlasov, Aleksandr Nevzorov, 
and many others of their ilk broke into the State Duma because 
of a lack of coordination in our activity. The cost of what 
might be a "genetic" whim of Russian democrats is the 
considerable worsening of political and economic instability and 
uncertainty in the country. 
  Have we drawn lessons from what has happened? 
  The experience of the very first regional elections shows 
that we have not. Again, one "revenge-seeking" candidate is 
opposed by at least three or four democratic ones, clinched in 
much more heated polemics with each other than with him. Unless 
we break this tradition, local elections may bring about the 
recreation of the old Soviet power under new names. 
  Yegor Gaydar proposed that a joint election campaign 
strategy 
be worked out as early as the next two or three weeks. The 
experience of the December elections has shown that relying on 
the withdrawal of the already nominated candidates would be 
utopian. This is why the following principle should be agreed 
upon: one candidate from all the democratic and reformist 
forces for one mandate. 
  To implement this principle, they may reach agreement on 
regional quotas for each organization. Comparative results of 
the electoral support enjoyed by the associations in specific 
regions could also serve as indicators.
