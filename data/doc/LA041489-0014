MILKEN, MINKOW 
Congratulations to Kim Murphy on a mesmerizing article on Minkow. It was novel 
quality! 
This article should serve to caution ZZZZ Best investors: Don't throw in the 
towel just yet! While Barry's bubble may have burst, there are potential 
globules of gas rising from the saga of Tom and Debbie, aided by Mark Morze, 
the Amazing Mathematician, and the good services of the butler brothers, Jack 
and Jerry Polevoi. Now those are the big, unbreakable, bankable bubbles of a 
successful daytime soap! 
Again, my compliments.
