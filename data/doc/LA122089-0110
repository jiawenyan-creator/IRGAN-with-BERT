El Salvador's leftist guerrillas have admitted for the first time that hundreds 
of their number have been killed in their five-week-old offensive. Radio 
Venceremos, the guerrillas' mouthpiece, said 401 fighters of the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front have been killed, among them a high-ranking 
officer named Dimas Rodriguez. The government estimates that up to half of the 
6,000 to 10,000 rebels have been killed or wounded.
