FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Brit Land signs Soros link
A BINDING agreement to set up a property partnership between British Land
and the Quantum Fund, headed by Mr George Soros, has been signed 10 weeks
after it was first announced, writes Vanessa Houlder.
The delay in finalising stemmed partly from the complexity of the tax and
legal arrangements, complicated by Quantum's move from the Netherlands
Antilles to the Cayman Islands.
The final agreement has given British Land the right to to buy Quantum's
interest, once the investing phase of the partnership, which is expected to
have funds of at least Pounds 1bn, is complete. If British Land decides not
to buy out its partner, Quantum may do so.
British Land said that the importance of the new clause was that it allowed
it to plan its finances ahead for the exit. In its preliminary form, the
partnership was expected to be ended through the liquidation of the
property.
