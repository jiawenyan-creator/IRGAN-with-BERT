  [Text] Moscow February 21 TASS -- Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Panov expressed surprise at Saturday's 
publication by the Japanese newspaper MAINICHI SHIMBUN claiming 
that Japan and the United States have been trying out secret 
scenarios of invasion of Russia's maritime territory during 
their joint war games since 1985. 
  "It is hard to say anything about the trustworthiness of the 
Japanese publication," Panov told ITAR-TASS on Monday. He 
believes the situation could be cleared out by Japanese Foreign 
Ministry experts who are participating in the Russian-Japanese 
talks at the level of deputy foreign ministers in Moscow. 
  "In any event, the report confirms the correctness of the 
Russian position that the time has long been ripe for the 
Russian and the Japanese military to meet, exchange information 
and discuss the existing problems," Panov said. 
  Japanese Ambassador to Russia Kozo Watanabe who is also 
attending the talks said that he had not read the article 
carried by MAINICHI SHIMBUN and thus cannot comment on it. As 
for Japanese-American joint military manoeuvres, they are of a 
purely defensive nature and do not go beyond the concept of 
defence sufficiency, he said.
