FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: First-half reverse at
Trans-Natal
Trans-Natal, South Africa's biggest coal exporter, suffered a 28 per cent
slide in pre-tax profit to R68m (Dollars 19.8m) in the half-year to
end-December from R94.2m a year earlier. Continued productivity gains at the
Gencor-owned company's collieries were outweighed by lower export and inland
coal prices.
Mr David Murray, managing director, warned that although the interim
dividend was held at 23 cents, the final payout was likely to be reduced.
This was because earnings would fall by the year-end after the 10 per cent
cut in 1994 export contract prices the group had so far negotiated with its
customers.
Overall sales tonnage rose to 13.8m tonnes from 13.6m tonnes but revenue
fell to R820.5m from R826.6m.
Mr Murray said a near 1 per cent fall in unit production costs was 'a rare
achievement,' cushioning the fall in operating income to R109m from R119m. A
reduced tax liability left after-tax income only 22 per cent down at R43.1m
compared with R55.5m.
Distributable profit improved to R43.1m from R34.5m, flattered by the R22m
provision made in 1992 in writing off some coal-mining assets.
Earnings rose to 54.1 cents from 43.3 cents per share.
