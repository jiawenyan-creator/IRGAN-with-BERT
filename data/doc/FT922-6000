FT  27 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Jump in consumer confidence index upsets
Treasuries
LONGER-DATED US Treasuries tumbled yesterday in response to reports that
crude oil prices might climb as much as Dollars 3-a-barrel this year. The
market was also shaken by signs of an improving economic climate from a
surprisingly large increase in the May consumer confidence survey.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down  15/16 at
101, yielding 7.906 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities fared better, with
the two-year note losing a more moderate  5/32 to yield 5.326 per cent.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange two-day system
repurchase agreements when Fed Funds were trading at 3 15/16 per cent. The
adding operation was widely expected and was seen as a technical move to
meet requirements.
Traders started liquidating positions in longer-dated bonds late last week,
on reports that Federal Reserve policy-makers had decided not to take
immediate steps to cut short-term interest rates.
The selling accelerated yesterday following the release of the consumer
confidence index for May, which rose to 71.6 per cent from a revised 65.1
per cent in April. Players had been looking for a May reading of around 68
per cent. The April index was previously reported as 64.8 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds fell by over a quarter of a percentage point
yesterday as Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, dashed hopes of a cut in
interest rates.
Mr Sapin suggested that a cut in French interest rates would have to be part
of a co-ordinated move. The comments were taken to mean that France would
not act unless the Bundesbank cuts German interest rates - a scenario which
few traders expect to see in the short term.
A strong first quarter GDP figure, showing growth of 1.1 per cent, also
reinforced the view that France is unlikely to cut rates soon, traders said.
The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond - the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 -
moved from the opening level of 8.49 per cent to 8.56 per cent by late
afternoon. The Matif futures contract fell from 108.88 to 108.56.
Elsewhere in Europe, the government bond markets drifted lower in dull
trading. German bond futures fell from the opening of 87.89 to end at around
87.73, wiping out early gains.
Bunds rose briefly early in the day, following the release of
better-than-expected inflation data for the western German state of Hesse.
Consumer prices in Hesse rose 0.3 per cent in the month to mid-May, and by
4.1 per cent on the previous year.
THE UK government bond market dropped due to the combination of
disappointing trade figures and worries about supply.
A worse-than-expected current account deficit in April of Pounds 1.06bn,
compared with Pounds 591m in March, pushed down gilt prices, with
longer-dated issues falling between a quarter and a half of a percentage
point. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 118 17/32 to
118 1/16 .
JAPANESE government bonds slipped in late trading, following the initial
fall in US Treasury bonds and ahead of the monthly government bond auction.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of 10-year
bonds, probably today. Traders said the June issue was expected to carry a
slightly lower coupon of 5.6 per cent, compared with 5.7 per cent in last
month's auction. 'A 5.6 per cent coupon isn't exactly bad news, but it might
dampen retail interest,' said one dealer.
The yield on the benchmark government bond - the No 129 - opened at 5.495
per cent and closed in Tokyo at 5.515 per cent. However, it then moved to
5.54 per cent in London, trading as the US Treasury bond market fell.
Traders report a shift out of short-dated bonds into the long end of the
market recently, and expect this trend to continue over the next couple of
days.
News that the long-term prime rate would be raised by 0.3 percentage points
to 6.3 per cent, with effect from June 1, had little impact on the bond
market, dealers said. The key September futures ended at 101.68, down from
101.80 on Monday, on a volume of 29,382 contracts.
