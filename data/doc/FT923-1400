FT  23 SEP 92 / Congress to start October 12
The ruling politburo of China's Communist party has set October 12 as the
starting date for the 14th party congress, which will determine policy for
the next five years, Xinhua news agency said, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The last congress was held in 1987.
Analysts say the congress is expected to endorse the economic reform
programme of Deng Xiaoping and let the 88-year-old paramount leader
establish his political legacy.
Xinhua predicted a younger look for China's leadership. 'The congress will
elect new central leading organs and a number of vigorous, outstanding
middle-aged and young cadres who have both ability and political integrity
are expected to be elected into the new CPC Central Committee,' it said.
The Central Committee sets out the party's course between congresses. The
congress is the broadest-based policymaking body.
