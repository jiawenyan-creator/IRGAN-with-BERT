IN BRIEF; 
ORIOLES SIGN THURMOND FOR 1 YEAR 
Baltimore Orioles pitcher Mark Thurmond agreed to a one-year contract today, 
the team announced. 
Terms of the contract were not announced. Thurmond had filed for arbitration 
Monday and was the only Oriole to file. The left-handed reliever was acquired 
by the Orioles during last year's spring training from the Detroit Tigers in 
exchange for third baseman Ray Knight. 
Thurmond, 30, was 1-8 with a 4.58 earned run average in 43 games for the 
Orioles last season. His 2.97 ERA after the All-Star break was the Orioles' 
best. Thurmond's signing means the Orioles have avoided arbitration for the 
10th consecutive season. The last Oriole to complete the arbitration process 
was infielder Billy Smith in 1979.
