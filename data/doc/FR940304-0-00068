 



Cyanea shipmanii

 of the bellflower family is an unbranched or few-branched shrub 8 to 13 ft (2.5 to 4 m) tall with small sharp projections,
especially in young plants. The alternate, stalked leaves are 6.7 to 12 in (17 to 30 cm) long, 2.8 to 5.5 in (7 to 14 cm)
wide, and deeply cut into 20 to 30 lobes per leaf. Flowers are covered with fine hairs and are clustered in groups of 10
to 15, the main stalk 0.4 to 1.2 in (1 to 3 cm) long and each flower stalk 0.4 to 0.6 in (1 to 1.5 cm) long. The hypanthium is
topped with five small calyx lobes. The pale greenish-white petals, 1.2 to 1.4 in (3 to 3.6 cm) long, are fused into a
curved five-lobed tube 0.1 to 0.2 in (3 to 4 mm) wide. The fruit is an ellipsoid berry. This species differs from others
in the genus by its slender stems; stalked, pinnately lobed leaves; and smaller flowers (Lammers 1990). 



Cyanea shipmanii 

has been known from only one population, located on the island of Hawaii on the eastern slope of Mauna Kea on privately
owned land. When originally discovered, only 1 mature plant was found, with a total population size of fewer than 50
individuals (HHP 1991h). This species typically grows in koa- and 'ohi'a-dominated Montane Mesic Forests at elevations
between 5,400 and 6,200 ft (1,650 and 1,900 m) (HHP 1991h, Lammers 1990). Associated species include kawa'u and kolea
(HHP 1991h). The major threat to 

Cyanea shipmanii

 is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single existing population and the small number
of known individuals. 

Based on a specimen he collected in 1912 on Mauna Loa, island of Hawaii, Rock (1913) described 

Cyanea stictophylla,

 choosing the specific epithet to refer to the long and narrow leaves. Other names by which the taxon has been known include:


Cyanea palakea

 (Forbes 1916), 

C. quercifolia

 var. 

atropurpurea

 (Wimmer 1953), 

C. stictophylla

 var. 

inermis

 (Rock 1957), and 

C. nelsonii

 (St. John 1976). St. John (St. John and Takeuchi 1987), believing there to be no generic distinction between 

Cyanea

 and 

Delissea,

 transferred the species to the genus 

Delissea,

 the older of the two generic names, creating 

D. nelsonii

, 

D. palakea

, 

D. quercifolia

 var. 

atropurpurea

, 


D. stictophylla

, and 

D. stictophylla

 var. 

inermis

 (St. John 1987b). The separation of the two genera is maintained in the current 
treatment of the family (Lammers 1990), and all the above listed taxa are considered to fall within the range of variation
of 

C. stictophylla.

 



Cyanea stictophylla

 of the bellflower family is a shrub or tree 2 to 20 ft (0.6 to 6 m) tall, sometimes covered with small, sharp projections.
The alternate, stalked, oblong, shallowly lobed, toothed leaves are 7.8 to 15 in (20 to 38 cm) long and 1.6 to 3.1 in (4
to 8 cm) wide. Clusters of five or six flowers have main flowering stalks 0.4 to 1.6 in (1 to 4 cm) long; each flower has
a stalk 0.3 to 0.9 in (0.7 to 2.2 cm) long. The hypanthium is topped 
with five calyx lobes 0.1 to 0.2 in (2 to 4 mm) long and 0.04 to 0.1 in (1 to 2 mm) wide. The yellowish-white or purple petals,
1.4 to 2 in (3.5 to 5 cm) long, are fused into an arched, five-lobed tube about 0.2 in (5 to 6 mm) wide. The spherical berries
are orange. This species differs from others in the genus by its lobed, toothed leaves and its larger flowers with small
calyx lobes and deeply lobed corollas (Lammers 1990). 

Historically, 

Cyanea stictophylla

 was known only from the island of Hawaii on the western, southern, southeastern, and eastern slopes of Mauna Loa. Today,
the species is known to be extant near Keauhou and in South Kona on privately owned land. The 3 known populations, which
extend over a distance of about 38 by 10 mi (61 by 16 km), contain a total of approximately 15 individuals (HHP 1991i1
to 1991i3). This species, sometimes growing epiphytically, is found in koaand 'ohi'a-dominated Lowland Mesic and
Wet Forests at elevations between 3,500 and 6,400 ft (1,070 and 1,950 m) (HHP 1991i1 to 1991i3, Lammers 1990). Associated
species include tree ferns, 

Melicope volcanica

 (alani), and 

Urera glabra

 (opuhe) (HHP 1991i1 to 1991i3). The major threat to 

Cyanea stictophylla

 is grazing and trampling by feral cattle as well as stochastic extinction and/or reduced 
reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (F. Duvall, pers. comm., 1992).




Cyrtandra giffardii

 was first collected in 1911 on the island of 
Hawaii by Rock, who named the species to honor Walter M. Giffard, who 
collected a flowering specimen in 1918 (Rock 1919a).
