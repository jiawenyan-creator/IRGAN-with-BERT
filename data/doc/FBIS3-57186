  [Text] Warsaw, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Russian ultranationalist 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has delayed his trip here this week 
by three days in order to visit Belgrade, Janucz Bryczowski, the 
Polish industrialist who invited Zhirinovskiy said Tuesday [25 
January]. 
  Bryczowski, who heads the National Self-Defense front, a 
small extremist party, said that instead of arriving Thursday, 
Zhirinovskiy would be in Poland on Sunday. 
  He said Zhirinovskiy told him by telephone Monday evening 
that he was concerned for his security while in Poland. 
  Polish interior ministry spokesman Piotr Szczypinski said 
Polish authorities could not guarantee the safety of private 
citizens visiting the country and that there had not been any 
contact with Moscow officials concerning security arrangements 
for the trip. 
  "Poland is a country where foreign nationals are safe," he 
said. 
  Walesa told reporters Monday that he had no intention of 
meeting with Zhirinovskiy. None of the political leaders here 
have expressed any interest in seeing him either. 
  The center-left opposition Democratic Union meanwhile 
announced that it would hold a demonstration in Krakow, along 
the road leading to Auschwitz, to protest the visit. 
  According to Bryczowski, the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic 
Party, is planning meetings with important politicians and press 
conferences during his stay. He will also make trips to Krakow, 
in the south, and the Auschwitz death camp and spend some time 
relaxing in the ski resort of Zakopane in the Tatra mountains.
