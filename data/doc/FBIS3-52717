  [Text] Sanaa, Jan 7 (AFP)--Yemeni tribesmen have kidnapped 
a Canadian, Briton and four Yemenis working for the US firm Hunt 
Oil, company engineers said Friday. 
  A group from the Daham tribe prevented the six from taking 
off in their helicopter Tuesday after they inspected a pumping 
station in the Ma'rib region 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of 
here. 
  The Yemeni authorities were trying to negotiate the release 
of the helicopter pilot and five engineers, informed sources 
said in Sanaa.
