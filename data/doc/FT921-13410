FT  22 JAN 92 / Soviet archives coup for UK
THE task of microfilming and publishing the archives of the Communist party
of the Soviet Union is to be started by a British company, it was announced
yesterday.
Sir Charles Chadwyck-Healey, head of Chadwyck-Healey, the Cambridge academic
publishers, said hundreds of millions of documents, letters, tapes and books
had been locked away in the CPSU headquarters in Moscow, 'either top secret
or forgotten' until the party was banned last August.
Records date from before the revolution up until last year. The documents
then passed into the control of the Russian government's council for
archives, which has granted access to only a handful of historians.
Chadwyck-Healey paid a fee of 'several thousand pounds' to the council for
archives to receive a first batch of negatives of documents being
microfilmed by Russian experts. It has exclusive rights to make copies and
market these in the west.
'These archives are perhaps the most important single untapped resource for
understanding the history of the 20th century,' according to Mr James
Billington, the US librarian of congress, one of the few westerners who has
seen them.
The company is beginning with the personal and official papers of nine
revolutionaries and early Soviet politicians including Trotsky, Kirov,
Molotov, Zhdanov and Kalinin.
'These files are of extraordinary interest,' Sir Charles said. 'They are
full of not only official documents but personal letters to family and
friends which show what the individuals were thinking at the time and will
provide insights never before available to historians.'
A set of the first batch of documents is expected to sell for around Pounds
5,000, and 25 per cent royalties will be paid to the Russian government.
Chadwyck-Healey expects to sell several hundred copies to academic libraries
and historians.
If the first project is a success, the company plans to publish many more
documents.
