BRIEFLY 
Exchanges Discuss Merger: The Philadelphia and American stock exchanges are 
discussing either a full or partial merger, the New York Times reported in 
today's editions. Under the plans, which are in the preliminary stages, either 
the exchanges would be combined outright or they would merge their 
options-trading operations, the newspaper reported, quoting unidentified 
sources. The merger discussions are fueled by a recent rule adopted by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the trading of equity options, the 
sources said. Under the rule, which will be phased in over the next few years, 
multiple exchanges would be able to trade an equity option, unlike the current 
system in which each option is allotted exclusively to an exchange.
