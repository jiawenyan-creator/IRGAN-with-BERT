  [Text] Deputy Guido Camacho, chairman of the Drug 
Trafficking Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, said yesterday 
the government is "openly biased" toward U.S. interests over the 
drug enforcement policy. He demanded a new bilateral agreement 
to preserve the interests of coca farmers. 
  Camacho said it is the duty of the executive branch to 
maintain an atmosphere of peace and to meet the needs of all 
social classes of the country. 
  "I see the government is currently openly biased toward U.S. 
Government interests, thus forgetting its duty to solve the 
problems of coca farmers," Camacho said. 
  Camacho replied thus when asked about future negotiations 
between the Bolivian Government and the U.S. Embassy on drug 
enforcement once the agreement signed during the administration 
of former President Jaime Paz Zamora expires. 
  He said he believes the elimination of excess coca crops in 
the Chapare region is more of a priority for the United States 
than for Bolivia. 
  "Eradication must consider not only the exchange of money 
for 
each hectare of illegal coca. We need comprehensive solutions 
to the social problems of thousands of families in coca 
producing areas." 
  He said coca eradication must not create social or economic 
problems for large sectors of the Bolivian population. This 
depends on the government's ability to negotiate a new agreement 
for the eradication of illegal coca crops.
