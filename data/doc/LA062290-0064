METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS APPROVE CANYON DEVELOPMENT 
The County Board of Supervisors Thursday approved a 69-home development in 
Malibu's scenic Encinal Canyon after the developer abandoned plans to include 
an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts and restaurant. 
Opponents of the project were relieved that the developer, Anden-VMS Ranch 
Malibu Venture, scaled down the development, but they argued that the 1.9 cubic 
yards of grading needed to build the homes will alter the fragile character of 
the area. 
"Sixty-nine homes is the absolute maximum the zoning will allow if it were a 
perfect situation, but this is not a perfect situation," Sally Womack, a member 
of the West Malibu Community Council, told the supervisors.
