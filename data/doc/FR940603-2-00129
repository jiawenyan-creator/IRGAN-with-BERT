</FOOTNAME>
In a related proceeding (see File No. 708173), Southern proposes to restate the operational and financing
authority of The Southern Development and Investment Group, Inc. (``Development''), also a wholly owned nonutility
subsidiary of Southern. It is proposed that Development will succeed to certain of SEI's consulting activities (generally,
consulting activities that are not related to domestic power generation or foreign generation, transmission, or
distribution), and to SEI's licensing of intellectual property, among other business activities. 

 </FOOTNOTE>


As a part of a plan to reorganize various non-utility businesses of Southern and its subsidiaries along functional
lines, Southern and SEI propose in this application-declaration to amend and restate SEI's existing financing and
operational authority, SEI, SCS and the Operating Companies also propose to enter into intrasystem service agreements
pursuant to which such companies may render services and sell goods to ``exempt wholesale generators,'' or ``EWGs,''
as defined in Section 32 of the Act, and ``foreign utility companies,'' or ``FUCOs,'' as defined in Section 33, as well
as to associate companies that own qualifying facilities (``QFs'') as defined under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978, as amended (``PURPA''), or other facilities that SEI may hereafter be authorized to acquire.


 Southern and SEI have adopted a plan of reorganization pursuant to which SEI proposes to organize and acquire all of
the stock of a newly organized Delaware corporation (``Newco'') in exchange for certain assets of SEI consisting
primarily of rights under certain existing consulting agreements with third parties and accounts receivable associated
therewith, which will be assigned to Newco; computers; office equipment and furniture; and interests in certain
software programs and other proprietary technology. Newco will also assume certain liabilities of SEI including
accounts payable, accrued pension and retirement costs associated with employees to be transferred to Newco, and
certain loss reserves under existing contracts. Immediately thereafter, the shares of Newco will be distributed
to Southern as a dividend distribution, and Newco and Development will be merged pursuant to a plan adopted under applicable
state law. 

 SEI and Southern propose to relinquish the authority granted by the Commission in the Original Orders and the 1987
Order upon the effective date of the Commission's order relating to this application-declaration and to the application
of Southern and Development, except with respect to any contracts and investments that are entered into or made by
SEI prior to the effective date of such orders in reliance upon and in accordance with the Original Orders or the 1987
Order.
