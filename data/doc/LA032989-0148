P.M. BRIEFING; 
TEST FINDS APPLE PRODUCTS ALAR-FREE 
Makers of apple sauces and juices presented test results today showing the 
products to be virtually free of Alar, a chemical that environmentalists say 
heightens the risk of cancer in children. 
The Processed Apple Institute, which represents most of the producers of apple 
sauces and juices, said today tests covering 4,623 samples and a cross section 
of brand names revealed only eight cases in which detectable levels of Alar 
were found in the product.
