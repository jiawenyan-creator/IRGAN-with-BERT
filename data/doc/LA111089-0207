MARATHON NBA GAME EVEN POOPED OUT THE COMPUTER 
Just last month, the Milwaukee Bucks' statistical crew asked the NBA what to do 
if a game went beyond three overtimes, exceeding the limits of the league's new 
computerized statistics system. 
"Based on their research, they said they believed there was no need to go 
beyond three overtimes," Bob Wanek, the Bucks' officials scorer, said. 
The need came Thursday night when the Bucks took five overtimes to beat the 
Seattle SuperSonics 155-154. (Story, C1) 
"Imagine that," said Wanek, who was forced to override the computer for the 
final two overtimes. "You don't expect that to happen right away when you have 
a new computer system." 
The game was a nightmare for scorekeepers and coaches. It lasted 257 minutes, 
and six players fouled out. 
"You wondered if the game was ever going to end," Bucks forward Ben Coleman 
said. "But I kept feeling like we were going to win. We played too good not to 
win." 
Milwaukee's Tony Brown sank a three-point shot with 1:10 left in the fifth 
overtime to put the Bucks ahead to stay. 
"The game leaves me speechless," Milwaukee Coach Del Harris said. 
" . . . This game demands some kind of clever statement from the coach. But I 
don't have anything. I'm drained out. I'm just proud of my players and their 
effort." 
"Milwaukee made some great plays when they had to make them, and we made some 
when we had to make them," Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said. "They earned 
the win, but it's too bad someone had to lose." 
It was the first time an NBA game went five overtimes since the advent of the 
24-second clock in 1954.
