Bingo! It's Newton: Entertainer Wayne Newton's organization has signed a 
two-year contract to manage a $1.4-million Indian bingo hall that's been closed 
for six months. 
Wayne Newton Gaming Inc. has agreed to manage a bingo hall operated by the 
Seneca-Cayuga tribe in northeastern Oklahoma, said Sandra Hoy, Newton's 
director of marketing. The games will begin Nov. 16, but a grand opening 
ceremony, at which Newton will appear, is scheduled for January. Newton already 
operates a bingo hall in Santa Ynez. CLAUDIA PUIG
