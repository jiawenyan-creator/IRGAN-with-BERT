An attorney for National League umpire Bob Engel refused to accept a plea 
bargain to charges that Engel stole baseball cards from two stores in 
Bakersfield. 
Engel has pleaded not guilty to shoplifting seven boxes containing 4,180 
baseball cards from a Target store April 21 and trying to steal 50 packs of 
baseball cards from Costco in January. The complaint lists the total value in 
both counts at less than $200.
