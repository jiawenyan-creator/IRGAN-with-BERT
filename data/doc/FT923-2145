FT  18 SEP 92 / Observer: Stress relief
Remember the Natural Law Party? That's the organisation preaching
transcendental meditation as a means to a better world, which however failed
to win a single seat in the April general election.
Even so, the party is still alive and kicking, or perhaps even bouncing  -
one of its party election broadcasts showed a team of meditators bumping
along the ground on their backsides.
Indeed, one of its executive committee members, David Lucas, took the
trouble of telephoning yesterday to explain why all the other politicians
are unable to get Britain out of its economic mess.
'There will be a continual decay in this country as politicians of the other
parties do not have the means to control the situation,' he said. 'The
bottom line is how people feel. We need to change the consciousness of the
country, give it some brightness.'
The way to do that, apparently, is to get a critical mass of people - a
minimum of the square root of 1 per cent of the population - permanently
engaged in the Sidhi programme of advanced transcendental meditation, which
'would neutralise the stress of the country'.
Alas, as that would mean about 750 full-time meditators for the UK, it would
cost a good deal of money. But perhaps public-spirited citizens might chip
in enough to send at least the Cabinet along.
