WHAT IS THIS GUY, SOME KIND OF JOKER? 
Could you tell me why Jack Nicholson needs binoculars at Laker games. 
He sits in the front row, next to the opposing team's coach. Half the time he 
has a better seat than Magic. Hey, Jack, I love you. I root for you every time 
I see "The Shining," but could you please pass those suckers up to the top, 
where someone with bad eyes can see the game?
