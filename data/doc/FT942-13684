FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: UAP seeks FFr3bn new capital
Union des Assurances de Paris, the French insurance group which is in the
process of being privatised, is to raise about FFr3bn (Dollars 508m) in new
capital, the French eco-
nomics ministry said yesterday,
The capital increase, which could take place at the same time as the group's
privatisation, is expected to take the form of an issue of equity with
warrants.
Mr Jacques Friedmann, the chairman of the insurance group, has previously
said he was seeking to raise new capital to help finance investment plans
and to compensate for recent deals, such as last year's purchase of the
international interests of Victoire, the French insurer.
The pre-placement phase of the privatisation of UAP was launched earlier
this month. During this period, investors can make non-binding reservations
for sale in the company.
Shares worth SKr2.6bn (Dollars 329.1m) in Skanska, Scandinavia's biggest
construction group, have been placed with Swedish and international
institutional investors by Protorp, a Swedish investment company, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
