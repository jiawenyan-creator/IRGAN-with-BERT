  [Text] Ankara, Jan 9 (AA) -- Official talks between Turkey 
and Iraq which were sponsored by Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Ozdem Sanberk and his Iraqi counterpart Riyad al-Qaysi 
ended on Sunday [9 January]. 
  Sanberk told at a press conference that during the talks 
they 
reviewed the possibilities to drain the oil remaining in the 
Turkish-Iraqi pipeline which was shut-off during the Gulf war. 
  Sanberk said that the pipeline between Karkuk and Yumurtalik 
was an important investment for both countries and "we have been 
reviewing the issue of draining the pipeline, for a while. The 
objective is to eliminate the problems arising from the 
three-year- long idleness of the pipeline and to prepare the 
system to function again when the (international) embargo is 
removed." 
  The delegations looked for solutions to the problem under 
the 
UN Security Council decisions, in the talks. 
  Al-Qaysi said the talks were very positive and fruitful. 
  The guest under secretary will depart Turkey on Sunday after 
completing his official contacts.
