FT  25 MAY 94 / Inflation rate edges down in W Germany
The immediate outlook for inflation in west Germany has improved further
this month, although long-term prospects are still clouded by rapid
expansion in money supply.
Consumer prices in North-Rhine Westphalia, the region's most populous state,
rose at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in the month to mid-May, down from 3
per cent in April, according to new figures. Inflation in Baden-Wurttemberg
was unchanged at 3.1 per cent.
The figures supported economists' forecasts of an annual rate for the whole
of west Germany of 3 per cent at most, after 3.1 per cent in April.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's favoured indicator for potential inflation, the
M3 measure of money supply, continued to exceed forecasts and the bank's 4-6
per cent target range for growth with a 15.8 per cent annualised increase
during April. Markets had been given clear advance warnings of another
inflated figure.
The Bundesbank said part of the reason was its handing over to the
government of DM18.3bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in 1993 profits. It also singled out
private sector lending as another contributory factor. Borrowing had
expanded at an annual rate of 9.5 per cent in the six months to the end of
April.
The bank once again blamed 'special factors', evident since January.
Investment uncertainties had drawn large volumes of funds into short-term
deposits (within the scope of M3) rather than long-term instruments.
Long-term investment grew DM10.3bn in April, compared with DM5.4bn a month
earlier, but, as the bank pointed out, monetary capital formation had risen
at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of only 4 per cent in the first four
months.
