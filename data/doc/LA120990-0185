JIMMY CARTER ON GULF AND ENERGY 
There has never been any doubt in my mind as to President Carter's good 
intentions. 
He is a pleasure to relate to. 
However, when he writes about the need to preserve our wonderful wide open 
spaces and in the same article plugs solar electricity, does he not know that a 
solar America would mean covering an area the size of Alaska with mirrors? 
Furthermore if he consults with any electrical engineer, he will be told that 
the electricity used to build these monstrous machines will never be replaced 
or renewed by these machines! 
Solar electricity has many good uses, but never as a major prime energy source.
