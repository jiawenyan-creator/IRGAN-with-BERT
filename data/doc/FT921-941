FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Candidates put hats in the ring
NOMINATIONS for election candidates closed yesterday with the Conservative
and Labour parties fielding candidates in all 634 seats in Great Britain.
The Liberal Democrats are fighting all of the seats apart from two where
Social Democrats are standing: Greenwich and Woolwich.
In Scotland, the Scottish National party is fighting all 72 seats and in
Wales Plaid Cymru is putting up candidates in 35 out of 38 seats, with joint
campaigns being run with the Green party in the remaining seats. The
Conservatives are also fighting some Ulster constituencies.
The Greens will not be contesting every seat as they had initially hoped.
Other groups standing include the Liberals, the National Front and the
Anti-Federalist League.
In the UK as a whole, there are 651 constituencies, one more than in the
last parliament - an extra seat has been awarded to Milton Keynes.
