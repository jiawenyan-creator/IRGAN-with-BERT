<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Regional and Land Affairs Minister </F>
Andre Fourie, by South African Broadcasting Corporation 
presenters Eon de Vos and David Hall-Green, on the "Good Morning 
South Africa" program; passages in slantlines in English -- live] 
  [Text] [De Vos] Good morning and welcome to Good Morning 
South Africa. It is just after the news at eight [0600 GMT]. 
Earlier this morning we gave our viewers the opportunity of 
phoning in to discuss the purchase of a jet by the KwaZulu 
government. The amount mentioned is R[Rand]33 million. We have 
had several interesting opinions aired by viewers and in the 
meanwhile we have received a telephone call from Minister Andre 
Fourie, the Minister of Regional and Land Affairs, and he will 
also comment on this issue, concerning the jet purchased by 
KwaZulu. Good morning Minister Fourie. 
  [Fourie] Good morning. 
  [De Vos] Thank you for telephoning us. Firstly, what is the 
South African Government's view? 
  [Fourie] Well, let me first put the matter in perspective 
and 
I am thankful for this opportunity. You must understand that 
all the self-governing territories, including KwaZulu, are 
autonomous regional governments in terms of Act 21 of 71. They 
were on their way to independence in terms of the policy of the 
former government, so they have the full right and the full 
power to make any such decision. If there have been any misuse 
of funds, then there are several monitoring mechanisms to deal 
with this. They have their own Legislative Assembly to monitor 
spending. They have their own public accounting committee. The 
auditor general of South Africa can monitor spending and if 
funds are misused, then a report can be tabled in parliament. 
So there are several monitoring mechanisms. I really think this 
is a storm in a teacup, because in my opinion this is an asset 
and this asset will be handed over to a possible future 
Natal-KwaZulu regional authority or the South African 
Government. So this is not a loss for the taxpayer, it is 
actually a very good investment. 
  [De Vos] You talk about a storm in a teacup, a small amount, 
but Sunday papers mention a debt of more than R600 million. You 
mentioned that it is within their budget. What are we talking 
about? 
  [Fourie] Yes, you see this is typical of the SUNDAY TIMES 
and 
the ANC [African National Congress] trying to score by 
politicizing the issue. That 645 million rand debt is from 
loans to self-governing states through the Development Bank of 
Southern Africa. These are all capital expenditures -- for 
water and electricity supplies, all capital expenditure -- and 
they work on long-term loans and these loans are financed 
through their budgets. So this issue is totally out of 
perspective. 
  [De Vos] What about the view that they rushed to secure the 
deal before April, before things change? 
  [Fourie] Well I cannot comment on this because I don't know 
when the decision was made. I don't know when the order was 
placed, but as far as I am concerned the KwaZulu Legislative 
Assembly and the KwaZulu government will stay in power until the 
27 April, until the new constitution comes into effect. 
  [De Vos] Concerning the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] 
-- there is talk that the ANC will apply to the TEC to have the 
jet impounded. Now is the TEC empowered to do this? 
  [Fourie] I think this is absolutely laughable. I don't think 
they can impound the jet. They could inquire about this and 
then enter into discussion with the self-governing territory of 
KwaZulu, but I think for Gill Marcus and, especially Matthew 
Phosa ... [changes thought] It really surprises me, you know, 
that they can actually make such statements. Can I just give 
another perspective -- when I had to act against Lebowa, where 
they had an overdraft of R60 million and their budget deficit 
this year is expected to be over R400 million, then the ANC was 
dead quiet and did not say anything about this. But because this 
concerns Chief Minister Buthelezi and they want some sort of 
political gain, now they are fighting with him over R33 million. 
A R60 million overdraft -- that is debt. That is weak 
administration, money that cannot be recovered. This is an 
aircraft that has been bought. It is an asset and that asset 
remains in the government's possession or in the possession of a 
future regional government. I really think they are trying to 
score political points. 
  [De Vos] //A question from you, David.// 
  [Hall-Green] //Good morning Mr. Minister.// 
  [Fourie] //How are you David?// 
  [Hall-Green] //I am very well thank you and a happy New Year 
to you.// 
  [Fourie] //Same to you//. 
  [Hall-Green] //When the status of KwaZulu is changed, after 
the election in April, what is going to happen to this debt of 
roughly R650 million?// 
  [Fourie] //Yes, as I explained the R645 million debt, so 
called debt -- it is in long term loans which has been incurred 
through the Development Bank of Southern Africa, and obviously 
the new regional government for KwaZulu-Natal will take 
responsibility for that and a new government in that territory 
will have to make arrangements in terms of their budgets in the 
future, to pay those loans back to the Development Bank.// 
  [Hall-Green] //One of the callers who phoned in from 
Suurbekom this morning was very upset about this expenditure, 
saying that if you go through KwaZulu today and you look at the 
way the people live -- the lack of drinkable water, access to 
water and this kind of thing. Is this not an inflammatory thing 
to have done at this time?// 
  [Fourie] //Well that is a political question I think that 
Chief Minister Buthelezi and his cabinet will have to answer to. 
I can't reply to that. For them, they must make that political 
decision and they will have to explain that, both to their 
Legislative Assembly, and if necessary, also if the auditor 
general would like to investigate the matter, that's fine. Then 
they will be answerable to them. So I can't give you an answer 
in that regard. But as far as I am concerned it is not R33 
million down the drain, it is R33 million rand spent on an asset 
which any future government can dispose of, or use it in a 
proper manner in future.// 
  [Hall-Green] //Mr. Minister, thank you very much for phoning 
us this morning and putting your side of the story.// 
  [Fourie] //Thank you very much indeed.//
