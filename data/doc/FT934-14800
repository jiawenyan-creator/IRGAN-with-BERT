FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
DISAPPOINTING UK economic data accelerated the slide of Footsie futures
yesterday while index options were once again brisk, writes Christine
Buckley.
After a shaky opening, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 mustered a
small rise ahead of publication of figures for retail prices inflation and
manufacturing output for August. But the statistics put the contract on a
skid from 3,120 to 3,110 where it managed to find some support.
However, that support was not to prove durable and the contract fell below
the important psychological level of 3,100 to touch a 3,088 low. Sellers
were evident for most of the morning's trading.
The afternoon was more positive after a bounce in short sterling kicked some
confidence back to the ailing contract. Short sterling, as in the previous
day's trading, had been bolstered by persistent hopes of an interest rate
cut.
December finished the day at 3,102 - only fractionally ahead of the fair
value premium to the cash market, which stands at about 21 points. Volume
was at its highest level for many sessions at 13,021 contracts.
Index options were healthy, forming the bulk of the traded options activity.
Of the total options volume of 35,315 lots, 23,028 were in the FT-SE 100
option and 2,989 in the Euro FT-SE. Many traders were said to be buying both
calls and putsfor maximum hedging.
