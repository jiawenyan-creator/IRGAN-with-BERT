SEX; 
BEWARE THOSE LITTLE WHITE LIES 
Here's an insight that may fail to shock dedicated students of the mating game: 
People often tell lies in order to have sex. 
Two California researchers reached that conclusion about dating behavior after 
taking a survey of college students. 
They say it's a point worth keeping in mind when trying to decide whether 
potential sexual partners have ever done anything to put themselves at risk of 
AIDS. 
In the survey, 34% of male respondents and 10% of women admitted they had "told 
a lie in order to have sex." Even more said they would lie if a situation arose 
where it would be to their advantage. 
"The implications of our findings are clear," the researchers wrote in 
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. "Patients should be cautioned that 
safe-sex strategies are always advisable, despite arguments to the contrary 
from partners." The survey was conducted by Drs. Susan D. Cochran of California 
State University, Northridge, and Vickie M. Mays of UCLA.
