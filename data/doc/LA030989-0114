METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
YOUTH CHARGED IN TEACHER'S STABBING 
A ninth-grader accused of stabbing his English teacher at a Sylmar junior high 
school was charged Wednesday with assault with a deadly weapon on a school 
employee, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said. 
The 15-year-old Pacoima youth, who was not identified, is scheduled to be 
arraigned today in Sylmar Juvenile Court, said Deputy District Atty. Michelle 
Rosenblatt. 
The suspect is accused of stabbing Cynthia Edwards, 37, in front of a classroom 
full of students Monday at Olive Vista Junior High School. Edwards, of 
Palmdale, suffered a three-inch-deep wound in her back and was recovering at 
Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
Los Angeles police arrested the youth, who had a history of minor disciplinary 
problems at school, on suspicion of attempted murder. Citing juvenile privacy 
laws, Rosenblatt said she could not disclose details about the case that led to 
the filing of a lesser charge.
