THE CONTROVERSY OVER IRVINE RIGHTS ORDINANCE 
Regarding the fight of four lawmakers against the Irvine ordinance on gay 
rights: Gay people do not choose their sexual orientation any more than 
heterosexuals choose theirs; it just develops. The only thing they can choose 
is to be honest and open about it, which takes great courage in our society. If 
the lawmakers' constituents understood that, perhaps some of them would not 
vote for such loudmouth, un-Christian bigot-demagogues as Reps. Dannemeyer and 
Dornan and such gutless, me-too political mediocrities as Assemblymen Ferguson 
and Frizzelle.
