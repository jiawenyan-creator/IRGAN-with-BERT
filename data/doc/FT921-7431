FT  22 FEB 92 / International Company News: Low prices hit Saga Petroleum
SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, yesterday reported
a slide in 1991 net profit to NKr777m (Dollars 120m) before extraordinary
items. Despite record sales of North Sea oil, the group was hit by lower
crude prices and a write-down of its shares in Elkem, the metals group.
The previous year Saga recorded profits of NKr1.11bn.
The decline was due to lower average crude oil prices - which fell by NKr10
a barrel to NKr133 - and a NKr335m charge for an unrealised loss on the
value of its 12.4 per cent stake in Elkem, the troubled Norwegian light
metals producer. Saga had previously valued its Elkem stake at NKr469m. It
has written down Elkem's share price to NKr75.
'The financial result was negative by NKr588m after being weighed down by an
unrealised loss on the value of the shareholding in Elkem,' Saga explained.
In the previous year financial costs were just NKr154m.
Elkem closed NKr0.50 down at NKr60 on the Oslo bourse on Friday, while Saga
finished NKr0.50 higher at NKr74.
Saga's operating profit last year improved by NKr103m to NKr1.37bn.
Group revenue rose by NKr722m in 1991 to NKr4.59bn, while operating costs
increased by NKr619m to NKr3.22bn.
Sales of petroleum products rose by NKr495m to NKr3.41bn, which included the
sale of 20.5m barrels of oil, up from 17m in 1990. Gas sales rose by 116m
cubic metres to 350m cubic metres.
Saga said crude oil production rose to a record 23.3m barrels, of which 2.9m
barrels was royalty paid in kind to the state.
The company expects to boost crude oil production by 10 per cent in 1992,
helped by the Snorre oil field coming on stream in September and reaching a
peak output capacity of 160,000 barrels a day.
Investments in oil and gas developments rose by NKr71m to NKr1.59bn in 1991.
Saga said it had restructured its debt to improve liquidity and meet
long-term needs. It also made a NKr826m unrealised foreign exchange gain.
