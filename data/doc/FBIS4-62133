  [Text] Magadan Oblast gold, coal, power, and transport 
industry leaders made an effort to reach agreement among 
themselves. They have signed an economic agreement freezing 
prices on the goods and services that each produces. It is 
presumed that this measure will enable them to hold down the 
growth of expenditures on Magadan Oblast's basic end product -- 
gold. 
  Kolyma gold may have become the most expensive in the world, 
and that means, not competitive. The governor of Magadan Oblast 
is convinced that other Far East territories, whose products 
cannot find a market either in Russia or abroad due to pricing 
distortions, should take similar steps. It is difficult to 
forecast the effectiveness of the Magadan agreement, because it 
is doubtful that order can be restored in one isolated oblast at 
a time of general economic anarchy and helplessness.
