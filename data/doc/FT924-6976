FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps ICI Australia increase
33%
ICI AUSTRALIA, which is 63 per cent-owned by the UK chemicals group,
announced a 33 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 91m (Pounds
41.5m) for the year to end-September. Revenue dipped 2.4 per cent to
ADollars 2.7bn.
The group said the improvement reflected cost cutting and efficiency
improvements following completion of a series of plant level agreements with
trade unions.
The result also benefited from a 38 per cent reduction in interest costs to
ADollars 26m following falling interest rates and lower debt. Directors said
the result was achieved in spite of 'a difficult recession year'.
Profit fell by 32 per cent to ADollars 85m after abnormal items, mainly
because the 1990-91 result included an abnormal profit of ADollars 58m
resulting from the disposal of ICI's interest in Catoleum, an Australian
petroleum company.
The board said the continuing impact of increased operating efficiency
should lead to a further increase in profits in the current year.
However underlying trading conditions in main overseas markets showed few
signs of increased activity and a recovery in petrochemical prices was
unlikely because of continuing overcapacity.
The final dividend is 13 cents, making a total of 18 cents (15 cents).
