FT  20 NOV 93 / P&amp;G hopes to clean up in Russian market
THE battle by foreign consumer products companies for the loyalty of Russian
consumers was stepped up yesterday as Procter &amp; Gamble, the US giant,
announced plans to take a controlling stake in a manufacturing plant near
Moscow.
The deal, worth more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m), marks an expansion of
the US group's latest foray into eastern Europe, and signals its intention
of selling a broader range of products to Russian consumers.
At present P&amp;G makes two detergents in Russia: Ariel, the world's
biggest-selling brand and Tix, a local brand. Once it takes control of the
plant in Novomosovsk, 130 miles from Moscow, the company says it will expand
its range of detergents and cleaning products made in the country.
'We see great promise in this (Russian) market,' said P&amp;G. The company has
already built or is building plants in Hungary, Poland and the Czech
republic.
'Right now it's in the laundry business, but it could be other products in
future.'
Leyla Boulton adds from Moscow: The acquisition is the latest of a series of
purchases by foreign buyers belatedly taking part in the mass Russian
privatisation programme.
The sell-off of large numbers of Russian factories is designed to improve
their performance and attract badly-needed foreign investment.
