  [Text] From 4 April this year, the U.S. State Department 
will remove Latvia from the list of countries to which it is 
forbidden to export arms. The Latvian Foreign Ministry reports 
that the United States has officially announced that Latvia, 
Albania, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Estonia, and Romania are no longer 
to be included in the list of countries to which, observing the 
rules of international arms trade, the U.S. forbids the export 
of arms and defense equipment. This means that in future the 
United States will not require a licence for the export or 
import of defense material and defence services to Latvia.
