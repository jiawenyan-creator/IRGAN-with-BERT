FT  31 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television
Of all the culture tour guides we have had on television, Jonathan Meades
has proved himself to be one of the most entertaining. He is exactly the
right person to investigate 'the unholy relics of Nazi Germany', including a
holiday camp called Prora, built for 20,000 members of the master race.
In Jerrybuilding, Meades claims it is the prototype of the 'slummy hutches'
provided today by the package tour industry (9.00 BBC2). That is part of a
sequence of programmes called Tales From Berlin which continues at 11.15
with The Country That Vanished. This comes to us asserting that for more
than 40 years East Germany 'defined itself through its writers, theatres,
architecture and visual arts'. That may be a necessary claim to justify a
Late Show special, but for most people East Germany was defined by its
sporting prowess.
White Heat, BBC2's outstanding series about technology, ends with a
programme which considers two common attitudes: techno fear and techno
fantasy - one seeing technology as the death of us and the other seeing it
as our salvation (8.00 BBC2).
