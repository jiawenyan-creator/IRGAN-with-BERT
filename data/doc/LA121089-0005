The new shows that CBS, NBC and CBS have brought to us are terrible. The 
sitcoms are not funny and the dramas are boring. The only network that has come 
up with good new shows this season is Fox. So far it has given us "Booker," 
"Open House" and "Alien Nation," each of which is entertaining. When you add 
those to shows such as "America's Most Wanted," "Married . . . With Children," 
"Tracey Ullman" and "21 Jump Street," you get many hours of entertaining 
programming.
