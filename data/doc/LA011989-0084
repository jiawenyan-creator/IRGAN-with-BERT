TALKS ON L.B. FREEWAY ROUTE HELD 
South Pasadena officials and Caltrans representatives have met to discuss 
alternatives to a state plan to complete the Long Beach Freeway through the 
middle of the city, but no agreements have been reached, participants said this 
week. 
Both sides dismissed reports that Caltrans had agreed to a city-proposed 
compromise route that would bypass downtown, cut to the west and follow the 
city's western boundary line to the Arroyo Seco, the dry riverbed south of the 
Rose Bowl. Such a route is specifically prohibited by a 1975 act of the 
Legislature. 
"We have opened lines of communication," said City Manager John Bernardi. "We 
have ended the 'Cold War,' if you will, but certainly no decisions have been 
reached." 
Support From Torres 
Bernardi added that the proposal for a westerly route has the support of state 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). Torres will introduce legislation to permit 
construction of the freeway in the Arroyo Seco, Bernardi said. 
A Caltrans spokesman confirmed that agency officials from Sacramento were 
participating in the talks with South Pasadena Mayor James Woollacott, 
Councilman Sam Knowles and Bernardi. The spokesman said various westerly routes 
have been addressed in the state's environmental impact statement on the 
project, now being reviewed by the Federal Highway Administration. 
The city's latest proposal, however, was not addressed in the report. "It's 
kind of a brand-new thing," said senior environmental planner Cleave Govan.
