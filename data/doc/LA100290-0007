GAY'S SUIT AGAINST BOY SCOUTS 
Timothy Curran's suit against the Boy Scouts for denying him the opportunity to 
serve as a Scout leader is a prime example of the pernicious discriminantion 
lesbians and gays suffer daily. The leadership of Mount Diablo's Boy Scouts has 
proved itself to be bigoted against Curran, by basing its assessment of his 
suitability to lead on a vicious stereotype rather than on his spotless record 
of achievement. 
The big lie here is that gay men seduce young boys. It is a stereotype 
well-known to legitimate sex researchers to be completely baseless. People who 
seduce children are pederasts, a distinct psychological designation for those 
individuals who are attracted to children. It has nothing to do with being gay 
or lesbian or heterosexual. Those who insist on perpetuating this lie are 
themselves unfit role models for the young.
