FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television
ON its first night BBC1's new soap, Eldorado (7.00) had to face a double
episode of Coronation Street (7.30 ITV) which must have had some effect on
its pulling power, and anyway a first week must inevitably be
unrepresentative. Now, with its fifth episode tonight, it is beginning to
operate under conditions which will become the norm. Channel 4 screens the
news against it and BBC2 a yoof programme which should not cause too much
worry. But what about the greybeard game show Take Your Pick (7.00) on ITV?
Doubtless the soap will prevail in the long term, but for a while ITV may
have success fighting soap with game. BBC2's 'Screenplay', Bad Girl (9.00)
is a first drama by George Case, previously a documentary director. The
story is about a young single mother whose son is taken into care after he
is injured. It is claimed 'her predicament has echoes of a 'Cathy Come Home'
for the 90s'. Among the rock and roll greats, Chuck Berry has the sort of
reputation Tommy Cooper had among leading comedians: the greatest natural
talent of them all. Berry is the subject of Mojo Working (11.05 C4).
