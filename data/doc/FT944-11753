FT  04 NOV 94 / Observer: Biffed
Who once said of Baroness Thatcher's government that it was a 'sort of
Stalinist regime', and that her press aide Bernard Ingham was 'some sort of
rough-spoken, Yorkshire Rasputin who is manipulating government and
corroding public morality'?
John Biffen, step forward. At 64, the former Tory cabinet minister has
decided he has had enough and will not stand in the next election - making
him fully, as opposed to semi-detached, as Ingham once called him.
