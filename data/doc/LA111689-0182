BRIEFLY 
Great American May Violate Capital Rules: San Diego-based Great American Bank, 
the nation's eighth-largest thrift, said it will be unable to meet certain new 
federal capital requirements by a Dec. 7 deadline. The thrift said it expected 
to continue operating under normal conditions but would have to apply for 
regulatory approval if its board decided to declare a regular quarterly 
dividend in January. Great American said it currently meets the tangible 
capital requirement of 1.5% of assets and is "just a hair shy" of the core 
capital requirement of 3% of assets.
