FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAA strong
Airports operator BAA cheered the market with better than expected traffic
figures for the month of June.
The shares jumped 20 to 948p, on trade of 1.7m after the figures revealed a
9.1 per cent year-on-year increase in passengers handled. UBS reiterated its
buy recommendation on the stock boosting sentiment further. The shares have
been a strong performer since last week's favourable figures from British
Airways.
The news from BAA also encouraged buying of British Airways and the shares
finished 10 ahead at 426p, with volume reaching 3.3m by the close.
Oil shares continued to make good progress as prices responded to the recent
upsurge in crude oil prices as a result of the Nigerian oil workers strike.
BP was the favourite stock of mant institutional fund managers to
participate in the oil price rise, with dealers pointing to the stock's high
gearing to rising prices. At the close BP shares were 11 better at 395 1/2 p
after relatively heavy turnover of 12m. And there was evidence that some US
fund managers had moved to buy back some stock after the recent surge of
selling from across the Atlantic.
Shell, on the other hand, underformed BP as some institutions remained
concerned about the group's sizeable interests in Nigeria. Shell shares
settled 6 1/2 firmer at 701p.
Exploration and production stocks, which have tended to lag the majors, made
rapid progress led by Enterprise which put on 11 to 421p and Lasmo 4 better
at 140p.
Better than anticipated figures from tour operator Owners Abroad and an
upbeat results statement helped the shares gain 6 to 99p. The group reported
a loss of Pounds 13.8m, against a loss of Pounds 17.4m a year earlier and
better than the market's worst fears. Sentiment in Owners spread to
Airtours, where the shares hardened 2 to 462p. Solid demand for Rank
Organisation ahead of today's interim figures saw the shares appreciate 14
1/2 to 391 1/2 p. Speculation that Thorn EMI may make an announcement on its
demerger plans at tomorrow's annual meeting was heard in the market. The
shares gained 12 to 1074p.
Insurance and tobacco conglomerate BAT Industries jumped 15 to 425p in
response to positive figures from US rival Philip Morris. Also, the group's
proposed acquisition of the American Tobacco Company division of American
Brands was cleared by the UK Trade and Industry Secretary.
Food and detergent group Unilever was one of the few fallers in the market
as what one trader described as a 'technical situation' overhung the stock.
The shares were also suffering from a recent sector review by Smith New
Court which restated the analysts' bearish view on the stock. They closed 3
down at 990p.
Great Universal Stores added a further 13 at 587p as share buy back
speculation reached fever pitch ahead of the figures today. Last year the
company announced that its was enfranchising its shares and investors are
increasingly hungry for good news this year. The market expects a full-year
profit of Pounds 517m against Pounds 475m last year.
SmithKline Beecham recovered 10 to 398p in the 'A's as the recent 9m share
bought deal was finally said to have been carried out. Dealers said Smith
New Court had taken the stock on at 397p and placed it at 398p. Smith was
also said to have been actively on the bid in the pharmaceutical sector and
SmithKline rival Wellcome rallied from early pre-results weakness to close 4
up at 604p after being 6 lower,while Zeneca lifted 6 1/2 to 746 1/2 p.
Recent weakness in the dollar plus the sale of a 2 per cent block of Willis
Corroon and a broker downgrade in Sedgwick continued to drive the insurance
brokers lower. Willis settled 3 off at 134p and Sedgwick 7 lower at 157p.
The regional electricity stocks shrugged aside press criticism and made good
progress as income funds moved in to buy the sector.
Eastern was one of the sector's best performers climbing 19 to 616p, as was
East Midlands, up 23 at 605p. Southern jumped 17 to 601p.
Bank shares mirrored the market's surge with HSBC, also stimulated by a
strong rise by the Hong Kong market, jumping 21 to 687p. NatWest, now very
much in favour with a number of influential UK funds, moved up 11 to 445p.
Royal Bank of Scotland remained a poor performer after the recent stake
sale, the shares easing 2 to 402p.
