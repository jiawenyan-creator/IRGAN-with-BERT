  [Abstract] Organic lightsensitive material GFPM-633, 
designed for recording phase holograms in a real time mode by 
He- Ne laser radiation (_l_=632.8nm) with diffraction 
efficiency 
upto 90% has been developed. Results are provided on 
reconstruction experience of phase holograms using this 
material. It is pointed out that it has a 20mJ/cm[.sup]2[/] 
sensitivity, for 50% diffraction efficiency and the 
features of 
the recording mechanism are examined. It is determined that the 
material does not provide a high diffraction efficiency of the 
recorded holograms for a long time. The feasibility is 
demonstrated of recording on this material Fourier holograms of 
test images with a diffraction efficiency 9-15% and 50:1 
average contrast of the image and also with 10 superimposed 
holograms. One possible application area of the examined 
photopolymer materials (PPM) lies in producing phase copies of 
amplitude templets of synthesized holographic elements. 
Experience of working with the PPM demonstrated the feasibility 
of efficient application of theses materials for model 
experiments on holographic interferometry and for optical 
information processing. Figures 6, references 14: 7 Russian, 7
