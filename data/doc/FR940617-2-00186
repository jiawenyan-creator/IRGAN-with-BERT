SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Reference Branch.




Applicant's Representations




1. Applicant, a Massachusetts business trust, registered as an open-end, diversified management investment company
on August 12, 1981, by filing a notification of registration on Form N8A pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act.
On the same date, applicant filed a registration statement on Form N1A under the Securities Act of 1933 and pursuant
to section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement was declared effective on March 12, 1982. Applicant's public
offering commenced soon thereafter.

2. On January 19, 1994, the board of trustees of applicant, including a majority of trustees who were not interested
persons of applicant, approved a plan of reorganization (the ``Plan''). The Plan provided that applicant would transfer
all its assets and stated liabilities to the Wright Managed U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (``Treasury Fund''),
a series of The Wright Managed Income Trust (a Massachusetts business trust), in exchange for shares of Treasury Fund.
Pursuant to rule 17a8, applicant's trustees determined that the sale of applicant's assets to Treasury Fund
was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would
not be diluted as a result.

</FOOTNAME>
Applicant and Treasury Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment
adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the
Act, rule 17a8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated
persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers.


</FOOTNOTE>


3. Preliminary copies of proxy materials to solicit shareholder approval of the reorganization were filed with the
SEC on January 28, 1994. Definitive proxy materials were distributed to applicant's shareholders of record as of
February 28, 1994, and filed with the SEC on March 10, 1994. At a meeting of shareholders of applicant held on March 28,
1994, applicant's shareholders approved the Plan.

4. On March 31, 1994, the reorganization was consummated. Applicant transferred all its assets to Treasury Fund in
exchange for shares of beneficial interest in Treasury Fund and the assumption by Treasury Fund of the stated liabilities
of applicant. The exchanges were made at net asset value determined as of the close of business on March 30, 1994. As
of such date, applicant had an aggregate net asset value of $16,978,270.79. Each of applicant's shareholders received
shares of Treasury Fund that represented the same aggregate net asset value as the shares of applicant owned by such
shareholder immediately before the reorganization.



5. Applicant and Treasury Fund assumed their own expenses in connection with the reorganization. Applicant incurred
legal, accounting, and printing and mailing expenses in the approximate amounts of $12,200, $2,500, and $1,300,
respectively. Treasury Fund incurred reorganization expenses for legal and accounting services of $12,200 and
$2,500, respectively.

6. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

7. Applicant was terminated as a business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as of May 20, 1994.
