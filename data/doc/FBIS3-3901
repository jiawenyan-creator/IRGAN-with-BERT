  [Text] This morning, Zou Jiahua, Central Committee 
Political Bureau member and concurrently State Council vice 
premier, and Ni Zhifu, National People's Congress vice chairman, 
arrived at Beijing's Laudong Building, where the Hubei 
delegation to the NPC was stationed, to discuss Premier Li 
Peng's government work report together with the deputies from 
Hubei. 
  It was noon when the meeting ended, and Jia Zhijie, head of 
Hubei delegation, invited the two leading members to have lunch 
with the delegation. Vice Premier Zou and Vice Chairman Ni 
accepted the invitation with pleasure. 
  Hearing that the two leading members were to stay for lunch, 
Laudong Building's manager got really busy and urged service 
workers to make preparations for a special meal for the two 
leading members alone as a token of respect. 
  When the two leading members heard this, they expressed 
their 
thanks but said no, they would rather have buffet together with 
the deputies. 
  At 1230 lunch began, and Vice Premier Zou first took a close 
look at every dish, nodding with praise. Then he quietly took a 
seat by a dining table and waited for the deputies to take their 
turns. Ten minutes passed, and Vice Premier Zou and Vice 
Chairman Ni quietly went to the end of the queue and waited 
their turn. The deputies, and employees of the building as 
well, on several occasions tried to get two plates of food for 
the leading members, but Vice Premier Zou turned down the offer 
with thanks.
