FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse move
SIEMENS, the German high technology group, has waived its right to buy
Westinghouse Electric's distribution and control business, clearing the way
for the US company to sell the division to Eaton Corp for Dollars 1.1bn,
writes Martin Dickson in New York.
Eaton, which is based in Cleveland, Ohio, agreed to buy the division on
August 11 but the sale was subject to Siemens' right of first refusal, which
the German company gained under a 1989 contract. Disposal of the unit is
part of a restructuring plan to cut Westinghouse's debt.
