WHINING AND WINNING: DOES IT REALLY MATTER? 
I don't know Bret Johnson. I do know quarterbacks and kids. 
Sure, Johnson may have made a bum call in walking out on UCLA after he got 
demoted from the starting QB job. But what is the kid -- 19? 
This isn't Saddam Hussein invading Kuwait. Or Nixon justifying Watergate. This 
isn't even a big-bucks pro quarterback who presumably has some maturity and 
accountability. 
Is this reason enough for Mike Downey to vilify the young man? 
Wonder why L.A. is the quarterback controversy capital of the Western world?
