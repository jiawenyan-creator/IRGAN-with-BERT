  [Text] Tokyo, June 21 (KNS-KCNA) -- The overseas 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) issued a statement June 20 denouncing 
the Japanese police's criminal search of the Osaka and Kyoto 
prefectural organisations of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) as an intolerable insult to and 
an unpardonable provocation against the 70 million Koreans. 
  The statement warned that if the Japanese Government 
authorities, far from showing a sincere repentance and making 
compensation for the past war of aggression and colonial rule, 
continue suppressing Korean nationals, they will face a stern 
judgement by the 70 million Koreans in the North and South and 
overseas. 
  The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon denounces the 
high-handed suppression by the Japanese Government authorities 
and demands a proper apology and compensation, the statement 
stressed.
