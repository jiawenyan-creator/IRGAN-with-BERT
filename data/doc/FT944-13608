FT  27 OCT 94 / Builder plans to replace bridge
Dong-Ah Construction, the builder of the Seoul bridge that collapsed last
Friday, plans to construct a replacement at its own expense. The offer of a
new bridge, which will cost Dollars 190m (Pounds 117m), is meant as a public
apology for the accident that killed 32 persons, according to Mr Choi
Won-suk, chairman of Dong-ah, South Korea's third biggest construction
company. Dong-ah, which had net profits of Won20bn (Pounds 15.4m) on sales
of Won1,531bn in 1993, also plans to donate Won10bn to Seoul to maintain
existing bridges in the city.
