ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 
CITY MAY BUY GROVES TO PRESERVE THEM 
The city may buy orange groves worth about $4 million in an area slated for 
development as a way to preserve open space and keep a link to Irvine's 
agricultural past, officials said. 
The 16-acre, L-shaped area along Jeffrey Road south of the Santa Ana Freeway 
could be leased to a farmer to pay for its upkeep and perhaps become part of a 
park as "a reminder of Irvine past," said Robert C. Johnson, the city's 
director of community development. 
The plan to buy the orange trees from the Irvine Co. has been discussed for 
about a year. The company's orange groves are in an area slated for future 
industrial and commercial development. 
In November, 1989, the City Council asked its planning staff to talk with the 
Irvine Co. about buying a portion of the orange groves along Jeffrey Road and 
adjacent to the freeway. The city would purchase them using $4 million 
allocated to Irvine by a recent state ballot proposition to preserve open 
space. 
Within the next few months, the city and Irvine Co. will jointly hire an 
appraiser to place a value on the land, Johnson said. 
The Irvine Co. hasn't committed to selling the land but is willing to talk with 
the city in order to see orange trees preserved, company spokeswoman Dawn 
McCormick said Friday. TOM McQUEENEY
