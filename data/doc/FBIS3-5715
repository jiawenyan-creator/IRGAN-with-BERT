  [Text] Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- Gabonese President El 
Hadj Omar Bongo donated a stone of superior quality to the Tower 
of the Chuche Idea in Pyongyang. 
  He decided to present a light grey colour rare marble, which 
was polished like mirror and engraved with his name, to 
President Kim Il-song as a gift, and let the Gabonese ambassador 
to the DPRK convey it. 
  The director of Naomi Trading Company in Hong Kong surveyed 
famous stone production centres to pick a rare natural stone and 
processed and engraved it with the letters reading "Kim Il-song, 
Kim Chong-il, Long Live the Great Chuche Idea!" and sent it to 
the Tower of the Chuche Idea. 
  More than 600 stones of good quality have been presented to 
the tower by party, state and government leaders, political 
parties, public organizations and groups for the study of the 
chuche idea of over 90 countries, international organizations 
and public figures since the construction of the tower (1982).
