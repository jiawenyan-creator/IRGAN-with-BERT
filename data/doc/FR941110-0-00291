 

On Molokai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 was known historically from Mahana on Mauna Loa, in the vicinity of the coast near Waiahewahewa Gulch, and on Molokai's
west coast at Laau and Ilio Points (HHP 1992j16, 1992j18, 1992j23, 1992j26, 1992j37). On Oahu, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 was known historically from eastern Oahu at Ulupau Crater, and on the islets of Kaohikaipu and Mokulua (HHP 1992j3,
1992j6, 1992j34). This taxon was also known historically from western Oahu at an unspecified location along the Waianae
coast (HHP 1992j10). On Lanai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 was known historically from scattered locations on the south half of the island and on the east slope of the island at
Kahinahina (HHP 1992j5, 1992j19 to 1992j22, 1992j42). 

Sesbania tomentosa

 was also known historically from an unspecified location on Kahoolawe (HHP 1992j24). 

Currently, there are two populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (HHP 1992j35, 1992j36). One population is on the island of Nihoa, which comprises
0.8 sq km (0.3 sq mi) and is under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service management (Depart. of Geography 1983, HHP 1992j35).
The Nihoa plants have been described as relatively common in some areas, with several thousand individuals known
(HHP 1992j35). Another population is known from Necker Island, which is only 0.2 sq km (0.1 sq mi) in area, and like Nihoa
is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (HHP 1992j36). Although there are no population estimates for Necker
Island, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is known to occur from 45 m (150 ft) elevation to the summit, growing on the tops of all hills of the main island with a few
individuals found on the Northwest Cape (HHP 1992j36). On the privately owned island of Niihau, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is known from the south tip of the island at the headland west of Kaumuhonu Bay. The size of this population has not been
determined; in 1947 at least one collection was made at an elevation of 50 m (160 ft) (HHP 1992j14). 

On Kauai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is found between Mana town and Mana Point and at Polihale State Park (HHP 1992j15, 1992j33; HPCC 1991L). The population
on State-owned land at Polihale State Park consists of about 30 individuals growing in a lithified dune area at approximately
12 m (40 ft) elevation in an area of approximately 10 to 50 sq m (110 to 540 sq ft) (HHP 1992j33). The second population
is approximately 6 km (4 mi) southwest of the Polihale State Park population, growing alongside a pond owned by the
State (HHP 1992j15). The size of the population has not been determined. On Oahu, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is currently known from 1 population of 50 to 100 individuals on State-owned land at Kaena Point (HHP 1992j1, 1992j2).
This population is primarily within the Kaena Point NAR, growing in sand dunes in a Naupaka kahakai Mixed Coastal Dry
Shrubland (HHP 1992j1, 1992j2; HPCC 1990o). However, scattered individuals are also located to the east for about
3.5 km (2.25 mi) along the north coast (HHP 1992j1, 1992j2; Woodward 

et al

. 1991). 

On Molokai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is known from the south slopes of central Molokai from Kamiloloa to Makolelau and along Molokai's northwest coast
from Moomomi to east of Hinanaulua. The 4 populations on private and State-owned land from Kamiloloa to Makolelau
total fewer than 2,000 individuals and grow in a 7 by 3 km (4.5 by 2 mi) area (HHP 1992j11, 1992j13, 1992j25, 1992j27;
HPCC 1990m, 1990n). The 3 populations from Moomomi to east of Hinanaulua consist of about 100 to 150 plants growing
on State and private land from sea level to 60 m (200 ft) elevation in a 5 by 1 km (3 by 0.5 mi) area (HHP 1992j12, 1992j28,
1992j49; HPCC 1990L). On Lanai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is now restricted to the northern slopes of the island. This cluster of 3 populations between Paomai and Maunalei is
on privately owned land and includes at least 12 individuals growing on arid slopes (HHP 1992j17, 1992j38, 1992j39).


On Maui, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is only known from two areas on West Maui and two areas on East Maui. On West Maui, one plant is on State-owned land below
Lihau Peak (HHP 1992j30). 

Sesbania tomentosa

 also occurs on a 6 km (4 mi) stretch of the northeast coast of West Maui, from the lighthouse near Nakalele Point to Puu
Kahulianapa (HHP 1992j31, 1992j32, 1992j43, 1992j48; HPCC 1991m). This cluster of 4 populations contains an estimated
50 to 75 individuals on land owned by the State, the County of Maui, and private individuals (HHP 1992j31, 1992j32,
1992j43, 1992j48; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). On East Maui, two trees exist on privately owned land in Kamaole, but
they appear to have been planted (Winona Char, Char  Associates, 

in litt

., 1993). 

Sesbania tomentosa

 also occurs on the southeastern slopes of Pimoe cinder cone between 450 and 500 m (1480 to 1640 ft) elevation. This population
consists of 13 plants located on the Hawaii National Guard Kanaio Training Area (Sam Gon, The Nature Conservancy,


in litt

., 1993). Off the south central coast of Kahoolawe, approximately 25 to 30 individuals of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 are found on the sparsely vegetated islet of Puu Koae, which is a State-owned seabird sanctuary (HHP 1992j29).
