  [Text] [Segenreich] Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, who is 
currently visiting Israel, held talks today with Palestinian 
representatives. Aid projects for the future autonomous areas, 
among other things, were discussed. The Orient House is the 
headquarters of the PLO in East Jerusalem. Here, Erhard Busek 
started the third day of his visit to Israel. His Palestinian 
interlocutors were headed by Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO leader 
in the West Bank. He expressed both concerns and wishes. There 
are still numerous difficulties concerning the implementation of 
the autonomy, Al-Husayni pointed out. The Palestinians need 
political, financial, and technical support from Europe and 
Austria, he stressed. Money for the salaries of Palestinian 
officials is particularly urgently required. 
  The meeting with State President Ezer Weizman, one of the 
most brilliant figures in Israeli politics, was a highlight of 
Busek's visit. 
  Mr. Busek, the most important meetings of your visit to 
Israel have already taken place. What is your balance sheet so 
far? 
  [Busek] The balance is very positive for Austria. I believe 
that the relationship between Israel and Austria is excellent. 
After a difficult period in the past, good contacts and close 
friendship and cooperation have developed within a short period. 
  [Segenreich] A visit to several museums along with former 
Mayor Teddy Kollek was part of the relaxing part of the program. 
At Tel Aviv University, the vice chancellor delivered a major 
speech on the topic "Policy for Europe." He particularly 
stressed the Jewish contribution to European culture.
