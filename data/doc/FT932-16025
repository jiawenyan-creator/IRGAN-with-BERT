FT  08 APR 93 / UN to admit Macedonia
THE UN Security Council yesterday ended weeks of argument over Macedonia's
application for UN membership, agreeing without a vote to recommend
admission. The General Assembly is due to approve a formal resolution today.
The new member will be known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC mediators, will try to resolve
continuing differences between Greece and the new member.
