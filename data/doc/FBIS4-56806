  [Text] Mexico City, May 6 (AFP) -- The Mexican Government 
has resigned its membership in the Group of 77 (G-77), which 
unites all developing countries, as a result of having recently 
joined the OECD, a Foreign Secretariat spokesman said. Mexican 
Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello sent a letter to G-77 President 
Mohamed Salah Dembri informing him that Mexico will no longer 
participate in those mechanisms in which developing countries 
define their position vis-a-vis the industrialized nations, the 
source added. 
  In his letter, Tello emphasized that Mexico's entry into the 
OECD, known as the rich countries' club, "does not mean we will 
dissociate ourselves from the problems of the developing world" 
and will continue to work to increase "the advantageous, frank, 
and meaningful relations of cooperation among this group of 
nations." 
  The same source said the letter was sent "three weeks ago" 
but was only revealed today, after EXCELSIOR published its 
contents. Mexico was admitted into the OECD in April and became 
the first Latin American country to join that organization.
