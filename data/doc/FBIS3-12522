  [Excerpts] Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert this morning told 
the Presidents Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations 
that Israel should not stall the political process, but neither 
should it offer political concessions to renew the talks that 
are beyond the scope of what the government planned. Such 
concessions would mean a sellout of the vital interests of the 
State of Israel. 
  Referring to the possibility that Yasir 'Arafat would be 
allowed to pray at the Temple Mount in the presence of 250,000 
Muslims during Friday prayers, Olmert had this to say: 
  [Begin Olmert recording] Bringing 'Arafat into the Temple 
Mount on Friday afternoon is the upset of every balance that 
exists in Jerusalem, and it may end up with a greater massacre. 
Remember my words! Because then someone will ask how dumb they 
were not to understand it. So I am warning in advance: It will 
end up with a greater massacre, no matter why, no matter how. 
At the end of the day, there will be greater number of 
casualties than in the massacre in Hebron, and everyone will 
come and say: How dumb we were not to understand it in advance. 
[end recording] 
  Olmert also said he would work to equalize the rights of 
Jews 
and Arabs in the municipal plane, and he was appointing an East 
Jerusalem headmaster to act as head of the Arab school education 
in that part of the city.
