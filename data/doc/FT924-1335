FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Overseas boost for Learmonth Burchett
A buoyant performance overseas and steady results from the UK, enabled
Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems to report pre-tax profits of Pounds
753,000 for the six months to October 31, compared with losses of Pounds
281,000.
The USM-quoted supplier of information technology services also announced
that it was raising a net Pounds 3.8m by a 1-for-4 rights issue of 3.47m
shares and a subscription for 585,000 shares. Both offers are at 100p a
share. The shares gained 10p to close at 129p.
The proceeds would be used to redeem the cumulative convertible redeemable
preferred ordinary shares and the cumulative redeemable preference shares
and to eliminate most of the group's borrowings.
Turnover in the period under review rose 6 per cent to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds
10.1m) of which the overseas contribution increased from 30 per cent to 40
per cent. US sales advanced by 30 per cent.
Earnings per share were 3.1p (losses 1.7p). The company said it was not in a
position to pay an interim dividend, but if the expectations for the full
year were realised it would be able to recommend a payment at the year end.
