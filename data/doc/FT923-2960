FT  15 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK equities
Yesterday's 51-point rise in the London market looks odd if it is true that
sterling is not yet out of the woods. The FT-SE obviously derives benefit
from the presence of some large overseas-earners which are basking in the
disappearance of the two-dollar pound. Curiously, the All-Share index forged
a gain of 1.9 per cent, nearly as strong as that recorded by the FT-SE. So
yesterday's advance was pretty broadly based. Moreover there were some
impressive gains in interest rate sensitive stocks, like RMC, and cyclical
issues like British Steel, both of which gained over 5 per cent.
The market may also have been reluctant to ignore the positive signals from
both continental markets and from Wall Street. To be sure, thinnish trading
volume suggests the higher prices lack conviction. But the implication is
that equities are discounting a Yes vote in the French referendum. Price
movements such as these hardly make sense while there is still a risk of a
different outcome, and when some pretty grim domestic economic news looms
later in the week.
