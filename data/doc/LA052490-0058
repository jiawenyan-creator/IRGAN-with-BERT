READER CITES EVIL OF MILLS COLLEGE PROBLEMS 
Observing the behavior of Mills College students ("Quiet Riot," May 16) fills 
me with despair and disgust. Despair when I think of those thousands of brave 
and caring women around the world who regularly put their lives on the line in 
the battle for freedom and also who regularly fight against overwhelming odds 
such cruel social ills as rampant hunger, lack of medical care, and 
overwhelming poverty. 
The real evil here is the scandalous cost of higher education in the United 
States -- $21,000 a year for tuition, board, and room is too high to pay to any 
institution. If we really cared about young people in this country, college and 
university educations would be wholly subsidized and made available to women 
and men on the basis of merit.
