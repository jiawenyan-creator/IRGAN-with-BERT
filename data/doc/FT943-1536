FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Midland Assets reverse takeover
Midland Assets, which was created in May to acquire four nursing homes from
Northern Leisure, is expected to announce today a reverse takeover by a
bigger healthcare company in the Midlands.
The deal is likely to leave Midland, whose shares closed last night
unchanged at 19p, with approaching 20 healthcare premises.
Midland initially raised Pounds 2.4m via an intermediaries offer of ordinary
shares and paid Pounds 1.9m cash for RealCare nursing homes.
