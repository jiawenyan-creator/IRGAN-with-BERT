PYLON SPELLS RELIEF TO POST-MODERNISTS 
They used to call it post-punk. Now they call it post-modern. Call it post 
office for all that matters. It's a sound both minimal and danceable, often 
with surfy, scratchy guitar lines, funkified dance rhythms and personalized 
vocal approaches. 
These cerebral garage bands, like Britain's Gang of Four and New York's Bush 
Tetras, seem to have had their day -- but save the last dance for Pylon. The 
Athens, Ga., band, which re-formed last year after a few years off, played Club 
Lingerie on Sunday, bringing the clean, clear sound of relief to ears clouded 
with today's overblown murk and thud. 
Singer Vanessa Hay's guttural screams, soothing coos and Road Runner sound 
effects bring back the genuinely human, uncalculated eccentricity missing in 
today's pop women -- the wan folk singers, the blow-dried rock vixens, the 
aerobicized, lobotomized disco dollies. This larger-than-life Southern belle is 
as original as the band's musical geometry. 
With its steely guitars traveling at oblique angles through scenarios like 
"Crazy" and "M-Train," Pylon proved itself not another retro-art college cult 
group, but simply an unpretentious combo hooked into a primal thrill-ride pulse 
that makes this one of America's great past, present and future rock bands. 
Let's not lose them again. CRAIG LEE
