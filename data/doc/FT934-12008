FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Payout and profit rise at First
National
SUCCESSFUL bad debt management and gains in market share helped First
National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third largest bank, lift pre-tax
earnings by 19.4 per cent to R906.3m (Dollars 269m) in the year to September
from R759.2m 12 months ago.
Favourable adjustments from a reduction in the corporate tax rate helped
boost attributable income by 43.7 per cent to R688.1m from R478.9m. Ignoring
this, earnings rose by 17.1 per cent to 716 cents per share from 611 cents,
and the dividend was raised 17.5 per cent to 235 cents from 200 cents.
Mr Barry Swart, managing director, forecast another difficult year ahead,
but said earnings per share should show real growth. He said the economy
looked to be at the bottom of the cycle and predicted lower interest margins
and lower bad debts.
Mr Swart said the past year had been more difficult than anticipated, with
the economy in worse shape than predicted, industry advances growing by 8
per cent against a projected 13 per cent, and inflation also down. He said
FNB's response had been to take market share with domestic advances growing
by 16 per cent, double the rate of growth in the market.
Overall advances grew by 22.4 per cent to R40.7bn (R33.2bn). Mr Swart said
most of the growth had come in home loans, where FNB's book grew by 33 per
cent, and in instalment credit where advances grew by 21 per cent.
The group also profited from its early warning system on the credit risk
side. As a result provisions for bad debts actually fell by 1 per cent to
R344m (R347m).
Banks continue to benefit from generous interest margins and FNB's net
interest income rose by 16.6 per cent to R2.28bn from R1.95bn. Other
operating income rose by 18.5 per cent to R1.54bn from R1.30bn. Other
operating expenditure rose by 19.7 per cent to R2.6bn from R2.1bn.
