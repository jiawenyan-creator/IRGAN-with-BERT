this progress is as grand and as swift as possible. As far as 
the peace agreement is concerned, he informed those present that 
the security situation here in western Slavonia will be one of 
the points on the agenda at the session of the republic of

minister, accompanied by his ministers, went on to visit Pakrac, 
where he talked to businessmen and the inhabitants of this 
northernmost part of the republic of Serbian Krajina.
