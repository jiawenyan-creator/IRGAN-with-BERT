COMMUNITY DIGEST: ARTESIA; 
COUNCIL ASKED TO SPEED UP SEARCH FOR NEW MANAGER 
Interim City Manager Jerry Shuster has asked officials to speed up their search 
for a permanent chief administrator because he is ready to leave Artesia after 
four months in the position. 
Shuster, who is a retired finance director of Arcadia, has been interim city 
manager of Artesia since October. 
He replaced Lois O'Sullivan, who resigned. Shuster, 59, said he took the job 
with the understanding he would not be there long. "I did not retire to go back 
to work full time," Shuster said. 
He said he told the City Council two weeks ago to start a more vigorous search 
because he was leaving in 30 days. But Mayor Dennis Fellows said Shuster was 
persuaded to remain at least another 60 days, until someone is hired. 
Fellows said the council has received one applicant for the job. He said the 
council expects to start advertising in newspapers and government publications. 
Shuster is paid $40 an hour, but the salary for a permanent administrator is 
negotiable and depends on the person's experience.
