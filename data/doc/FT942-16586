FT  09 APR 94 / Indicator rises
The longer leading indicator of the UK economy rose in February, the Central
Statistical Office said. The indicator predicts trends 13 months ahead, and
is based on an analysis of five separate economic statistics.
One of the main reasons for the increase was a rise in the slope of the
yield curve, which compares short-term with long-term interest rates.
