Drafting Information

and C.G. Green, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.



Regulatory History



On June 20, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Documentation of Vessels''
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 31580). The Coast Guard received one letter commenting on the proposal. No public hearing was requested, and
none was held.



Background and Purpose



On November 15, 1993, the Coast Guard published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60256) which revised 46 CFR Part 67 to implement a number of statutory initiatives to simplify and streamline
the documentation process, to implement user fees for vessel documentation services, and to clarify the regulations
and present them in a more orderly fashion. The final rule was the subject of two correction documents which appeared
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 13, 1993, at 58 FR 65130 and 58 FR 65243. That final rule became effective on January 1, 1994. The present
rulemaking, among other things, corrects certain errors and omissions in the 1993 final rule. It also clarifies the
citizenship requirements for a trust arrangement as a vessel-owning entity, and states the endorsements required
for dredges and towing vessels.

On June 7, 1988, Congress amended 46 U.S.C. app. 316 (Pub. L. 100329) to require towing vessels to be documented
with a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement, as appropriate. On November 4, 1992, Congress amended 46 U.S.C. app.
292 (Pub. L. 102587) to require vessels of at least five net tons engaged in dredging in the navigable
waters of the United States to be documented with a coastwise endorsement. Neither of these statutory requirements
were included in the revision of Part 67. In order to state those requirements and to clarify the endorsement requirements
for vessels employed in towing or dredging, the regulations need to be amended. This rule accomplishes that amendment.
