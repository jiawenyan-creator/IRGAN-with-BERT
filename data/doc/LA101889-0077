NATION IN BRIEF; 
WASHINGTON STATE; 
NUCLEAR FACILITY BLAST DANGER PROBED 
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) said he wants a new Energy Department safety oversight 
board to review the possibility that tanks holding radioactive and chemical 
waste at the Hanford nuclear reservation could explode. A 1984 report concluded 
the tanks at the reservation in south-central Washington state could explode 
and scatter radioactivity. A follow-up report, however, essentially dismissed 
the danger of explosion, according to the lab that prepared both reports.
