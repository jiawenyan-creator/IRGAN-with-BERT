  [Text] Pyongyang, February 10 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam and "chairman" of the "Democratic Liberal Party (DLP)" 
Kim Chong-pil recently contented that re-negotiation on the 
matter of rice market opening is impossible and the struggle of 
peasants and other people against the opening of the rice market 
is an act "of those ignorant of the world". Commenting on this 
NODONG SINMUN today says: This indicates that the most 
despicable traitors are racing headlong along the road of 
treacheries after committing a heinous crime never to be 
condoned. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam promised the opening of the rice 
market in exchange for "an international cooperation system" 
directed against the North. This is an unpardonable treachery 
to strangle the South Korean peasants inside and slay the fellow 
countrymen in the North with the sword of foreign forces 
outside. The peasants and other people of South Korea have 
been driven to the wall where they must decide whether to calmly 
wait for death by allowing the influx of foreign farm products 
or to survive by rising up in a fight against it. 
  If the rice, the blood and flesh of the fellow countrymen, 
is 
to be defended, the Kim Yong-sam treacherous regime which has 
flung open the gate of the rice market must be overthrown. The 
South Korean people of all strata who value the existence of the 
nation and want to live with patriotic minds should unite and 
form one front, intensify the struggle to topple the Kim 
Yong-sam traitor clique and completely remove the cursed fascist 
treacherous regime. 
  A stick is fit for a mad dog. A sledge hammer must be 
brought down on the head of the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is 
steeped in treacheries and fascist repression.
