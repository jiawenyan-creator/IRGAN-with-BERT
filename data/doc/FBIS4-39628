To Cooperate"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- A cooperation treaty was signed during 
the recent meeting in Bonn between leaders of the European 
Association of Military Trade Unions (Euromil unites 20 military 
trade unions, and its 12 European countries are collective 
members of the European Parliament and have observer status in 
NATO and the CSCE) and independent Russian servicemen's trade 
unions. It was signed by President John Rodbol [surname as 
transliterated] on behalf of Euromil and by Mikhail Kolchev on 
behalf of Russia. A long-term cooperation program aimed at 
providing social protection for the Russian Federation 
servicemen being withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic region 
was determined. The question of admitting Russian military 
trade unions to Euromil was discussed during the meeting. The 
admission ceremony will take place in Lisbon this September.
