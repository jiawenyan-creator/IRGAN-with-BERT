  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) announced Tuesday [10 May] that it will 
send inspectors "in the next few days" to North Korea to 
complete monitoring activities begun in March. 
  Dispatch of the inspectors is conditioned on North Korea 
delaying the removal of fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor, 
according to a letter from IAEA Director-General Hans Blix 
addressed to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. 
  The agency invited North Korea to send a delegation of 
experts to Vienna to discuss the inspection timetable. 
  Blix said he hopes the IAEA and the delegation can negotiate 
the necessary inspection process for the changing of the fuel 
rods. 
  The director-general emphasized in the letter that the rods 
must remain closed under IAEA seals after they are randomly 
selected, and various measurements of the rods should be 
conducted late this year, officials said. 
  The letter offers hope of a breakthrough in the nuclear 
impasse since the IAEA proposal, although it carries a 
condition, leaves aside for now the biggest stumbling block to 
an inspection agreement.
