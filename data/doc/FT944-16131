FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Agencies differ on Mitsubishi
Bank outlook
The leading credit rating agencies differed yesterday on the implications
for Mitsubishi Bank's long-term creditworthiness of its purchase of a
majority stake in the troubled Nippon Trust Bank.
While Moody's immediately confirmed its long- and short-term ratings of Aa3
and Prime-1 respectively, Standard &amp; Poor's and IBCA, the European rating
agency, said they were reviewing the bank's long-term ratings in the light
of Wednesday's merger announcement.
S&amp;P and IBCA said they would look at the implications for Mitsubishi's asset
quality. Nippon Trust has a high proportion of non-performing loans and the
takeover comes on top of large scale write-offs by Mitsubishi of bad debts
on behalf of two other affiliates.
Moody's said it did not expect the merger to have a material impact on
Mitsubishi's capital levels.
S&amp;P said it was placing its AA-minus long-term senior debt rating and
A-1-plus short-term ratings under credit watch with negative implications.
IBCA placed its AA rating of the bank's long-term debt under rating watch,
but left its A1 plus short-term rating unchanged.
