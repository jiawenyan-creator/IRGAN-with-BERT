FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Peek falls 37% to Pounds 6.1m and sells
loss-making Greenpar
PEEK, the traffic control and field data systems group, saw pre-tax profit
fall by 37 per cent, from Pounds 9.66m to Pounds 6.06m, last year.
The group is selling its loss-making Greenpar connectors business to M/A-COM
of the US.
The Pounds 2m payment, plus the relief of Pounds 5m debt, is expected to
leave Peek with net cash of up to Pounds 9m by the end of this month. The
business has been up for sale for three years.
Mr Ken Maud, chairman, said the money would be spent on acquisitions to
build up the core businesses, which include Husky portable computers and the
monitoring of water and gas.
The group had already made one acquisition this year and was looking to
build up turnover to Pounds 100m.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 84.2m (Pounds 70.7m), with traffic and field
data contributing about 41 per cent each and the rest coming from
connectors. Operating profit fell 29 per cent to Pounds 6.13m (Pounds
8.59m), with field data contributing more than traffic.
The figures included a Pounds 500,000 loss from connectors, compared with
Pounds 500,000 profit in 1990.
Apart from shedding Greenpar, Peek has also withdrawn from leisure marine
equipment and a health and fitness side-line of its Computer Instruments
subsidiary in the US. Extraordinary costs totalled Pounds 3.3m.
Year-end cash slipped from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 4.7m, and a small amount of
interest was paid compared with about Pounds 1m received. Mr Maud said this
was affected by acquisitions from Ferranti and Philips, and by the placing
of a payment on deposit, with the interest to be taken later.
Earnings per share fell to 3.6p (6.4p). Mr Maud said the group was
maintaining its barely covered dividend of 3.4p, after a 2.35p final,
because of confidence in the future and strong liquidity.
Peek's share price gained 3p to close at 62p.
