  [Text] Elections in Ukraine were held in an atmosphere of 
democracy and law. Insignificant violations recorded in a 
number of constituencies did not influence the general situation 
during the elections. These conclusions of international 
observers were presented today at a briefing with Ukraine's 
Foreign Ministry. 
  The briefing also informed of the stance of Ukraine's 
Foreign 
Ministry regarding NATO air attacks on Serbian positions. 
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry expresses its regret that the 
developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina have led to the use of 
force. Political regulations has proved unsuccesful in this 
case. UN peacekeeping forces, including the Ukrainian 
battalion, have been put in jeopardy. The Ukrainian side 
understands the situation which developed in connection with 
this, but is displeased with the fact that necessary 
consultations were not held with Ukraine. Ukraine hopes for a 
peaceful resolution of the conflict in the Balkans through 
political means.
