FT  25 OCT 94 / Observer: Snap
Be sure to keep your eyes peeled next time you visit the Lord Mayor of
London's residence. When property tycoon Lord (Harold) Samuel died in 1987,
his widow offered the City of London his remarkable collection of Dutch 17th
century masters, some 80 plus paintings which now hang together in the
Mansion House. During the two-year refurbishment of the Lord Mayor's
residence, however, they were returned to Lady Samuel, who became so
attached to four of them that she became disinclined to return them on its
completion.
Which is why sharp-eyed guests of the Lord Mayor will find, in the less
well-lit corners of the now avocado and lime green walls, four
expertly-framed photographs in place of the originals.
