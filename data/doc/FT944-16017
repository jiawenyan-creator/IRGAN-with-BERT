FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not really independent
Sir, In their article, 'Labour party in Blackpool: Portillo disdains minimum
wage' (October 3), Philip Stephens and Robert Taylor wrote on a minimum
wage, saying Michael Portillo '. . . anticipated today's Labour conference
debate on the issue by releasing a long dossier of independent analyses
which he said reinforced the Tories' case that a minimum wage destroys
jobs'.
I have reviewed the 16-page 'dossier' and found it to contain mainly: 1) The
'independent opinions' of four City economists, his own Department of
Employment, and those of the Economist, OECD, and London Economics; and 2)
'Business opinions' that include three surveys of business executives, and
two representatives of small business organisations.
Remarkably, only three of the 15 'opinions' are from 1994, with 11 from 1992
and earlier, and one wholly undated. Three of the four City opinions are
from 1991]
While the minimum wage is an issue for the political agenda, independent
work from either party should include some academic content. The Portillo
dossier reflects the (dated) opinions of a few; it does not contain
independent analyses of an academic nature. R Hawkins,
