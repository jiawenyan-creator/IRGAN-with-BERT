  [Text] Zagreb, 23 June (TANJUG) -- Milan Djukic, chairman 
of the Serb National Party [SNS] in Zagreb, today sent an open 
letter to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, warning him that 
his speech in Pazin [Istria] yesterday, on the occasion of 
antifascist struggle day, was "fraught with insults to the 
Serbian people in Croatia." 
  "Your speech will hardly contribute to the return of the 
Croatian Serbs' confidence in the Croatian authorities," Djukic 
said. "You have hurt the Serb people in Croatia, who will not 
forgive you or endorse parts of your Pazin speech as the truth," 
Djukic stressed in his letter, telling Tudjman that he indeed 
was a historian, "but not as authoritative as to be in a 
position to change the history of these parts." Historians have 
been at odds as to where the first shots of resistance were 
fired in Croatia, but 27 July 1941 certainly cannot be described 
as "the date when chetniks from Knin and Bosnia rose in 
rebellion," Djukic wrote in his letter.
