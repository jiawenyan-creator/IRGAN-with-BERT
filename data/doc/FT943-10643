FT  04 AUG 94 / Bosnian Serbs reject plan
The Bosnian Serbs' self-declared assembly voted yesterday to reject the
latest international peace plan for Bosnia and to invite their people to
back the decision in a referendum, to be held on August 27-28. Deputies said
the referendum on the territorial division of Bosnia between the Serbs and
the Moslem-Croat federation was expected to confirm the leadership's
rejection of the peace plan. The 'contact group' of countries which drafted
the plan - the US, Russia, Germany, France and Britain - have called for
stiffer sanctions against Serbian-led Yugoslavia if the Serbs in
neighbouring Bosnia reject the peace plan. They say a referendum is a
time-wasting measure. Serbia, itself, has threatened to cut off links with
the Bosnian Serbs if they persist in rejecting the plan.
Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic said the period leading up to the
referendum could provide an opportunity for the maps defining the
territorial split to be adjusted in the Serbs' favour by the contact group.
Addressing the assembly, he said Bosnia's Serbs would have move to a full
war footing and prepare for closed borders with Serbia. 'Probably we shall
have to declare a (full) state of war, full mobilisation and rationed
supplies.' Yesterday's announcement coincided with increased fighting around
Sarajevo.
