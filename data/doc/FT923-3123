FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: EIT seeks Pounds 1.9m and agrees
2 purchases
EIT, the USM-quoted information technology group formerly known as
Maxiprint, is to raise Pounds 1.9m via a rights issue and is acquiring
Second City Systems, one of the largest Apple computer dealers in the UK.
The rights issue is on a 2-for-5 basis underwritten at 17p. The proceeds
will be used to develop the company and reduce group borrowings.
Seven warrants will be issued for every 10 rights shares taken up.
Each warrant will carry the right to subscribe for one new ordinary share at
17p, exercisable between January 1 1993 and December 31 1993. Full
subscription would raise an additional Pounds 1.5m.
Second City is to be acquired for a maximum of Pounds 650,000, satisfied by
the issue of new EIT ordinary shares.
Of the total consider-ation Pounds 400,000 will be paid on completion, with
the balance - up to a maximum of Pounds 250,000 - dependent upon profits for
the year to April 30 1993.
EIT has also reached agreement in principle to acquire, for no initial cost,
the UK maintenance and support contracts of Sequence Support Systems
International, a US supplier of network and support systems.
In addition, the group proposes to sell its 70 per cent interest in
Decisionaire Systems to its management for Pounds 200,000 cash.
