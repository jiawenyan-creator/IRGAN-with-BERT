  [Excerpts] Mannheim (DDP/ADN) -- The Alliance 90/Greens has 
opened its Bundestag election campaign with strong attacks 
against the SPD [Social Democratic Party], but at the same time 
indicating its willingness to cooperate [with the Social 
Democrats]. 
  Party executive spokesman Ludger Volmer [speaking at the 
party conference in Mannheim today] accused the SPD of wanting 
to move "toward the Right voluntarily." [passage omitted] 
  The SPD must no longer present itself as a "softie version" 
of the current government's policy. This would make it 
difficult for a red-green alliance to take power in Bonn. 
[passage omitted] 
  Volmer stressed that the Greens wanted to become the third 
strongest force, replace Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and end the 
CDU/CSU government. The Greens needed to make it clear that 
environmental reform policy cannot be made without them. The 
program for the Alliance 90/Greens election campaign focuses on 
economic environmental and social policy. [passage omitted]
