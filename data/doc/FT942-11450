FT  05 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Profit-taking trims base metal
gains at the LME - Market Report
Base metal succumbed to profit-taking in late trading at the London Metal
Exchange, but most still finished up on balance after impressive morning
advances.
COPPER was the exception, closing lower after running into heavy overhead
sales near the Dollars 1,980 a tonne upside target for three months metal.
Stop-loss selling stops orders below Dollars 1,970 hastened the retreat,
which left the three months price at Dollars 1,963 a tonne, down Dollars 5
from Tuesday's after-hours 'kerb' close.
'It looked a bit tired around the highs, and there have been two straight
days of gains. There could be a retracement back to Dollars 1,950, but it
still looks good for Dollars 1,980 and above,' one dealer said.
ALUMINIUM's pattern was similar, the market gradually easing back from
mid-afternoon highs after hitting strong selling above the Dollars
1,330-a-tonne level for three months delivery. It closed at Dollars 1,329,
up Dollars 1.
In contrast, ZINC largely absorbed the inevitable profit-taking, with prices
running up close to earlier three-week highs during the kerb on renewed
speculative buying. Final business for three months metal was at Dollars 970
a tonne, up Dollars 17.
At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures traded erratically as
technical factors dominated a market bereft of fresh fundamental news. The
July position ended Pounds 4 down at Pounds 881 a tonne, having fluctuated
between Pounds 875 and Pounds 890.
