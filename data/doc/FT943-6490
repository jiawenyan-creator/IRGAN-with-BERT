FT  29 AUG 94 / Housebuilders set for profits surge
Pre-tax profits of UK housebuilders could rise by more than three-quarters
this year and by almost another half in 1995 even though recovery in the
housing market is likely to remain slow according to a study by Credit
Lyonnais Laing.
The broker says margins will improve because housebuilders are selling more
homes on the same overheads, have used up much of the expensive land bought
in the late 1980s and early 1990s and have been able to remove many of the
sales incentives used in the recession.
Longer term, the brokers are concerned about land prices which have risen by
an average of 35 per cent across the country, according to a survey by
Savills estate agents.
Credit Lyonnais says that housebuilders may have to accept reduced returns
on capital if low inflation continues.
This follows warnings from Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,
who says that industry and commerce risk missing profitable investment
opportunities if they continue to expect high returns.
Land prices started to rise as companies restocked after the recession.
These acquisitions have been financed by large share issues from
construction companies, which since February 1993 have raised more than
Pounds 2bn of which Pounds 650m has been directly identified for
housebuilding.
This is sufficient to build an extra 15,000 homes a year, about 10 per cent
of the annual new build programme, says Credit Lyonnais.
