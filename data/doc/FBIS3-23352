  [Text] Lima, 18 Mar (EFE) -- The Peruvian Government has 
extended the state of emergency in Lima and its port of El 
Callao for another 60 days because "continued terrorist actions 
force this measure." 
  Lima and El Callao houses more than one third of Peru's 
total 
population of 22 million inhabitants. 
  The measure suspends personal guarantees contained in the 
Constitution and delegates political and military control to the 
Armed Forces. 
  The measure was published today in the official newspaper EL 
PERUANO. The newspaper also publishes another measure that 
extends the state of emergency for 60 days in the provinces of 
Yungay, Carhuaz, and Recuay in the northern Andes department of 
Ancash. 
  On 16 March, the Defense Ministry extended for 60 days the 
state of emergency in four jungle provinces in the northern part 
of the country.
