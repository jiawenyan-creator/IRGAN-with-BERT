FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Unclear outlook after Bass's seasonal cheer
BASS, the UK's leading brewer, recorded a general improvement in its beer
and pubs businesses during the Christmas trading period, Mr Ian Prosser,
chairman, said yesterday.
'It is not yet clear whether this improvement will persist through January
and beyond', he told shareholders at the annual meeting.
Over Christmas, Bass recovered most of the beer volume decline of the first
two months. Free trade sales volume was running nearly 5 per cent above the
same period last year and total volumes were only 0.5 per cent lower.
Mr Prosser, who led a Brewers Society delegation to the Treasury earlier
this week to demand a cut in beer duty, again expressed concern about the
possible impact of increased cross-Channel imports if the government did not
make some move towards duty harmonisation.
A new system of duty collection to be introduced in June would cost the
company Pounds 10m in a full year, he said.
