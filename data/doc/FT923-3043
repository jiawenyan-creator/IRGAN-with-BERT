FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Relief at Italy's financial markets
ITALY'S financial markets yesterday reacted with relief, but hardly
euphoria, to Sunday's devaluation of the lira, amid a mixed reception from
business and union leaders, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Mr Bruno Trentin,
general secretary of the CGIL union federation, said the devaluation 'is a
defeat, and one should have the courage to admit it'.
After a sharp rise at the opening, share prices in Milan moderated their
climb later in the day, with the Comit equity index closing up 3.26 per cent
at 379.04.
