MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
Glasnost Comrades: A reporter and camera operator from an Atlanta television 
station are involved in an unusual job-swapping deal in which they'll spend six 
weeks in the Soviet Union, and then a Soviet reporter will spend six weeks at 
their station. WXIA-TV reporter Simeon Smith, who is fluent in Russian, and 
cameraman Richard Crabbe left Tuesday for Tbilisi, Atlanta's sister city in the 
Soviet Republic of Georgia. There they will work for Gostelradio, the 
government organization that runs Soviet television. Smith said most of his 
work in Tbilisi will be relatively apolitical, "but if they have a hot story, 
like an earthquake, I'm part of the team." When they return, they'll be 
accompanied by Nugzar Ruhadze, an English-speaking Soviet newsman who will 
report to Atlanta viewers. ALEENE MacMINN
