DOG PEDIGREE PAPERS ARE LABELED 'A JOKE' 
The American Kennel Club has certified thousands of dogs across the country 
that investigators contend were fraudulently registered and others whose 
pedigrees are uncertain, according to a newspaper report. "The breeders and the 
pet stores all know the AKC papers are a joke, but they make their livelihood 
on it," Robert Baker, a veteran investigator with the Humane Society of the 
United States, told the San Jose Mercury News. 
Club officials said the organization routinely accepts a dog owner's word that 
an animal is a purebred and does little to verify the applications for the 1.3 
million dogs it registers each year. "Basically, the whole system is based on 
trust; let's face it," said AKC President Kenneth Marden. The AKC has never 
said registering a dog guarantees its breeding, he said, although the public 
generally believes that to be true.
