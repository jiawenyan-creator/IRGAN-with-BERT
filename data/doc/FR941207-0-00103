 

On May 9, 1994, we issued interim CARP regulations. At that time we noted that the Performing Rights Organizations'
comment serving as a petition to reopen was actually a petition for reconsideration of a pending CRT matter and that
we would consider it in a separate rulemaking proceeding. 59 FR 23964, 23966 (May 9, 1994). We are now addressing that
matter, and the Copyright Office requests comments on the issue of whether Performing Rights Organizations need
separate, specific, and written authorization to represent members and affiliates in collecting DART musical works
royalties. Any party who has already filed comments on this issue with the former CRT may simply incorporate those
comments by reference. 
Because we are reconsidering the rule, we are waiving the rule adopted at 37 CFR 259.2, and inferring an agency relationship
between the Performing Rights Organizations and their members for the 1993 and 1994 DART royalty distribution. This
rebuttable inference will be utilized solely for the purpose of filing claims for, and distribution of, 1993 and 1994
DART royalties payments. We include 1994 in the waiver of our rules because the parties have already sought and been
granted consolidation of 1993 and 1994 DART royalties. Therefore, it would be cumbersome to have different rules
for the consolidated proceeding. If a member files an individual claim or grants express authority to another agent,
such action will rebut the implied agency relationship. This action is without precedential value and shall not prejudice
the Copyright Office's ultimate determination of the issue.
