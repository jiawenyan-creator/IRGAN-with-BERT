FT  13 OCT 94 / Imminent loyalist ceasefire hinted at
Sources close to the loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland
indicated yesterday that the announcement of a ceasefire was imminent.
The Combined Loyalist Military Command - the umbrella group for the Ulster
Defence Association, which has subsumed the Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the
separate Ulster Volunteer Force - is understood to be finalising details of
an announcement after reaching agreement in principle to call a halt.
The announcement could come by the weekend, when the Ulster Unionist party
meets for its conference - or even today, as the Conservative party
conference debates Northern Ireland.
The process speeded up when the government gave loyalist leaders special
permission to go into the Maze Prison on Monday to discuss the issue in
separate meetings with UDA and UVF inmates.
The CLMC is reported to be considering linking their ceasefire with a demand
for talks between their political representatives and the government, and to
saying their ceasefire will be as 'permanent' as the IRA's.
In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph, Ulster Unionist party leader
James Molyneaux offered to meet loyalist paramilitary leaders if they needed
reassurance about Northern Ireland's constitutional position.
The three Northern Ireland MEPs - Mr John Hume, the leader of the
nationalist SDLP, Mr John Nicholson of the Ulster Unionist party and the Rev
Ian Paisley of the hardline Democratic Unionist party - are to meet EU
Commission president Jacques Delors today.
The meeting in Brussels follows Commission pledges of economic aid in
response to the IRA ceasefire - a loyalist ceasefire is likely to boost the
prospects of assistance.
