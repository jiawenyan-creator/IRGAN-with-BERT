  [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- The State Duma Council did not see 
that there were any grounds for thinking that, by issuing the 
anmesty resolution, the State Duma had exceeded its powers and 
violated the law and the Constitution. That was the conclusion 
to which the participants of today's session of the chamber's 
council came. 
  The council discussed the situation that had emerged in 
connection with the anmesty decision and the negative reaction 
to it from the president's administration. 
  It is expected that the Duma Council will issue a special 
statement concerning that matter.
