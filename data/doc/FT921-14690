FT  15 JAN 92 / Japan takes first step in restoring Vietnamese aid
A JAPANESE delegation arrived in Hanoi yesterday as a preliminary step
towards resuming official aid to Vietnam, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
Mr Takao Kawakami, director-general of the economic co-operation bureau of
Japan's Foreign Affairs Ministry, met Mr Vu Khoan, Vietnamese deputy foreign
minister, ahead of talks on settling Vietnam's debt to Japan, necessary
before aid can be resumed.
Japan suspended assistance after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and has
since followed a US-led embargo on aid and official investment, despite
being Vietnam's biggest trading partner.
Tokyo is seeking a key role in rebuilding the region after a Cambodian peace
agreement was signed last October. Diplomats expect Japan to resume official
aid to Vietnam in the second half of the year.
Separately, a German delegation arrived in Hanoi to try to reach agreement
with Vietnam on the repatriation of thousands of Vietnamese asylum-seekers.
More than 20,000 Vietnamese contract workers have come home from former East
Germany since 1989, but thousands of others crossed into former West Germany
following unification.
Between 20,000 and 30,000 workers there have already or are expected to
apply for asylum, but are not considered political refugees by the Bonn
government.
The German delegation is expected to sign an agreement today providing DM10m
(Pounds 3.5m) for job training and soft loans to help resettle returning
Vietnamese workers.
Germany says it wants to help resettle the workers at home, but needs a
guarantee from the Vietnamese government that it will not punish them for
seeking asylum.
