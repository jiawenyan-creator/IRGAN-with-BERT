THE SIDELINES; 
DOCTOR TESTIFIES IN PERRY RAPE CASE 
Witnesses at the sexual assault trial of Denver Bronco Gerald Perry say the 
woman who accused the lineman of raping her refused to go to the hospital for 
an examination when police first contacted her. 
Dr. Clarence Blea, who examined the woman when she went to the University of 
Colorado Health Sciences Center about 18 hours after the alleged assault, said 
he found no visible signs of trauma or anything else to indicate that she had 
been raped. 
Blea told the court, however, that the absence of bruises and trauma, as well 
as a pelvic examination showing no tearing or other signs of rape, doesn't mean 
that the 26-year-old woman wasn't raped. 
Blea was the first witness during the second day of the trial. 
Defense attorneys Gene Ciancio and Tom Tasker contend that the woman was a 
willing sex partner, and prosecutors Bruce Levin and Joe Pacyga say she was 
raped at gunpoint.
