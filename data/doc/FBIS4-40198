  [Text] Blagoveshchensk June 15 TASS -- A concrete mechanism 
of bankruptcy indicating bankrupt enterprises every month will 
be put into effect in the near future in accordance with the 
Russian president's decree. This was announced by Boris Yeltsin 
at a meeting with managers of enterprises of the Amur region on 
Wednesday. 
  President Yeltsin, currently on a working visit to the city 
of Blagoveshchensk and the republic of Tuva, believes that "the 
current task is to transfer reforms from a macro to a micro 
level, to the level of enterprises," which should more actively 
attract investments to boost production and resolve social tasks. 
  "The times when enterprises and whole regions lived at the 
expense of the state budget are over. It is necessary to find 
one's own resources to survive since living on subsidies under 
market conditions is a shame," Yeltsin said. 
  He recommended to regional heads to make use of the 
president's recent decree on the expansion of the activities of 
foreign banks on the territory of the Russian Federation and 
attract major Korean or Japanese capital into the region.
