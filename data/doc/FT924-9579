FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Malaysian electricity utility
doubles profits to MDollars 1.4bn
TENAGA Nasional, Malaysia's partially-privatised electricity utility, has
announced a doubling in taxable profits to MDollars 1.41bn (Dollars 561m)
for the 12 months ending August 1992. This compares with MDollars 702m the
year before.
Turnover rose 16 per cent to MDollars 4.28bn from MDollars 3.70bn. The group
said the increase in turnover was mainly due to a big growth in demand for
electricity from the industrial sector.
Malaysia's economy grew by 8.7 per cent last year and is forecast to grow by
8.5 per cent this year.
Tenaga said the results also reflected the gains made by a shift to
lower-cost gas fuel from coal and oil.
The group had also been helped by the strengthening of the Malaysian dollar.
Tenaga was partially privatised in May and is now the biggest company on the
Kuala Lumpur stock ex-change.
The group said it expected to maintain turnover and profit levels for the
remainder of the present financial year.
