  [Text] Major General Ilan Biran, commander of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, says that during the 
Yasir 'Arafat's stay in Jericho, Israeli citizens will not be 
allowed to enter the city. Maj. Gen. Biran added that it is 
clear that many residents of the territories will want to enter 
Jericho during this period and the IDF will not prevent them 
from doing so. It must be realized, however, that the small 
Jericho area cannot contain hundreds of thousands of people. 
Maj. Gen. Biran spoke in a briefing to foreign correspondents. 
Qol Yisra'el English Department correspondent Dick Winter 
reports that according to Maj. Gen. Biran, the Cave of the 
Patriarchs will be reopened in five to six weeks at the earliest.
