FT  21 DEC 94 / White House shooting
A man was shot by security guards outside the White House yesterday, after
he was seen waving a knife, witnesses said.
The US Secret Service confirmed that a US Park policeman shot a man after he
had threatened the officer with a knife on the pavement in front of the
north side of the White House, on Pennsylvania Avenue. Secret Service
spokesman Carl Meyers described the man's condition as 'real bad.'
This was the third shooting incident near the executive mansion in less than
two months. In late October, a Colorado man sprayed the front of the White
House with semi-automatic gunfire and was later charged with attempting to
assassinate the president.
