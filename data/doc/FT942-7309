FT  26 MAY 94 / George praises publication of minutes
Publication of the minutes of the monthly monetary meetings between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England
governor, should over time contribute to financial market stability, Mr
George said yesterday.
In evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, the
governor said the minutes would show the markets that the discussions were
based on monetary economics and that it would not be possible for a
chancellor to override such considerations 'in a blatant way'.
Mr George said politically motivated interest rate changes had rarely
happened in the past.
The experience of the February meeting, when Mr George and Mr Clarke had
initially differed over whether to cut rates and which ended in agreement on
a 0.25 percentage-point cut in base rates to 5.25 per cent, had been the
'clincher' in persuading the two men to publish accounts of their
discussions. This was because speculation of differences between the two,
soon after the meeting, had been exaggerated.
Mr George said he considered the decision to publish the minutes was 'a
terrific step in its own right'.
He added that he was happier with the UK's present monetary policy regime,
which is based on a target range for underlying inflation and in which the
Bank has greater powers than before in the execution of policy, than he had
been with monetary policy under the European exchange rate mechanism or in
the 1980s when the government pursued a broad money target.
He stressed that the greater responsibilities given to the Bank since
Britain's exit from the ERM should not be confused with independence.
However, the requirements for the Bank to publish its views on inflation
each quarter and be accountable for its advice to the government
concentrated the Bank's mind.
