FT  04 OCT 94 / Azerbaijan state of emergency
Azerbaijan's President Haydar Aliyev imposed a state of emergency yesterday
after interior ministry troops held the general prosecutor captive overnight
to demand the release of jailed colleagues. The president said the seizure
of Mr Ali Umarov by the special interior ministry police amounted to a 'coup
d'etat'. He said that 'aggressive forces inside and outside the country are
still trying to destabilise the republic'. Government troops encircled the
base to which the disgruntled units withdrew after releasing Mr Umarov
without achieving their demands. All phone lines were cut between the
capital, Baku, and Russia and other former Soviet republics.
