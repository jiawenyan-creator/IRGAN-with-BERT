FT  16 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Crude price lifts oil shares
Oil stocks led the London stock market forward yesterday with Shell
Transport standing out, the shares jumping 18 to 728p on turnover of 12m.
The move puts the stock back towards its all-time high, reflecting the
strength of underlying oil prices.
One month Brent crude was back to Dollars 15 a barrel, up from the recent
low of Dollars 12.70 just after the Opec meeting at the end of March agreed
to maintain output levels. Also, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price
jumped through Dollars 16 prompting a rash of share buying in New York on
Thursday night.
The US buying led to a scramble for stock in London early yesterday morning
as traders fought to cover their short positions. The higher price also
persuaded US investment banks Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch to raise
oil price forecasts. Dealers said Salomon lifted its WTI forecast by 35
cents to Dollars 16.10. British Petroleum, also benefiting from a small
disposal, gained 13 1/2 to 390p. Enterprise, which confirmed earlier
speculation of a small find in Cambodia, improved 22 to 457p.
