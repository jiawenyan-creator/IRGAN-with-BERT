Mechanical Properties"] 
  [Text] A project to develop nanocomposite ceramics with 
improved mechanical properties is being led by a research group 
at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, under 
European funding. 
  Nanocomposite structures consist of inclusions of an inert 
phase, such as 5 volume percent of 10 nanometer particles of 
silicon carbide, in a conventional ceramic matrix such as 
alumina or silicon nitride. The improvement in strength 
obtained can be dramatic the researchers say. For example, 
alumina can be strengthened from 300 megapascal to 1500 
megapascal, and its toughness, hardness, creep resistance and 
Weibull modulus are also increased. 
  The objective of the proposed work is to establish a more 
systematic understanding of nanocomposite structures in terms of 
mechanisms and processing paths so that full advantage can be 
taken of the property enhancements. 
  Other partners in the programme are the University of 
Limerick in Ireland, the University de Valenciennes et du 
Hainaut-Cambresis in France, and the Centre de Recherche de 
l'Industrie Belge de la Ceramique in Belgium. The project will 
last for three years.
