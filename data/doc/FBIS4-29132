  [Text] BERITA BUANA discusses President Suharto's 
criticism of the recent press coverage of the country's purchase 
of 39 East German warships. Speaking at a ceremony to hand over 
three East German ships in Teluk Ratai, Lampung, President 
Suharto said press freedom had been abused in setting one person 
against another. 
  BERITA BUANA believes the head of state's remarks should 
serve as a warning to the press, which seems to make it appear 
that the purchase is handled by Minister for Research and 
Technology Habibie alone. The truth is that the purchase of the 
ships is jointly handled by the Indonesian Armed Forces 
headquarters, the Defense and Security Department, the Finance 
Department, the National Development Planning Agency, and the 
Agency for the Study and Application of Technology. Therefore, 
journalists are urged not to present half-truths in their 
coverage and they must also maintain their independence and 
sense of responsibility.
