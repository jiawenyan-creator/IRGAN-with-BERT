FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptionals cuts Sema to Pounds
13m at midway
Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company, yesterday reported
a strong underlying increase in first-half profits, although the absence of
exceptional gains on disposals meant pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 15.2m
to Pounds 12.6m.
Excluding disposals, pre-tax profits on ordinary activities increased by 34
per cent to Pounds 14.2m in the six months to June 30, up from Pounds 10.6m.
There were losses this time of Pounds 1.64m from the disposal of I-Linie,
the German software products business, to IBM, compared with profits of
Pounds 4.63m.
Earnings per share slipped from 10.46p to 9.13p, but adjusting for disposals
they rose from 7.05p to 8.79p. An interim dividend of 1.6p (1.2p) has been
declared.
About 40 per cent of the equity is held by Paribas and France Telecom, while
Cap Gemini Sogeti, a rival computer services group, has 27.7 per cent.
Group turnover grew by 28 per cent to Pounds 298m (Pounds 233m), underpinned
by strong organic growth in the UK for the second successive year and by
more modest growth in France.
The latest results also include a full six months contribution from the
Swedish facilities management, information services, consulting and systems
integration businesses of the state-owned SKDforetagen group which were
acquired in October.
