SPIRITUAL SERL 
Many young artists could learn a great lesson from Jon Serl ("Inside the Mind 
of an Artistic Outsider," by Kristine McKenna, Nov. 12). While schlockmeisters 
such as Jeff Koons and Mark Kostabi are turning the art world into a joke with 
their crass commercialism, Jon Serl has been quietly making important art 
solely for the purpose of spiritual release. 
Greed and irony may be hip nowadays, but how many of these younger artists will 
still be thriving when they're 96?
