FT  04 OCT 94 / SNP gains ground as Labour falls
The Scottish National party is gaining ground mainly at the expense of
Labour, an opinion poll in The Herald newspaper in Glasgow says.
The System Three poll puts the SNP on 29 per cent, a rise of five points on
last month. Labour has 51 per cent, down four points, and the Tories 11 per
cent, down one point.
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, said: 'This poll shows that the Blair bubble is
starting to burst. As Labour's southern agenda moves further and further
away from mainstream Scottish values, this swing from Labour to the SNP will
continue.'
The poll of 1,024 people in 40 constituencies, was conducted late last
month. Figures exclude 16 per cent 'don't knows' or 'won't says'.
