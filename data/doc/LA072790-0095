JOGGER TRIAL DEFENSE CHARGES COERCION 
A defense attorney tried to show that a police detective coerced a confession 
from a youth held more than 24 hours for questioning in the rape and attempted 
murder of a Central Park jogger for which the youth and two others are on 
trial. 
Outside of court, an attorney for defendant Raymond Santana, 15, accused 
Detective Michael Sheehan of lying about how he obtained Santana's graphic 
confession in which he admits feeling the woman's breasts and taking part in 
the attack. Assistant Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Lederer wrapped up her case after 
presenting 43 witnesses during 22 days of testimony.
