 

As the Commission stated in Order Nos. 497 and 497A, pipelines need only contemporaneously disclose general
transportation information provided to an affiliate; they need not disclose information related to the affiliate's
specific transportation request.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 This distinction appears reasonably self-explanatory, and KGPC has not explained why the distinction is difficult
to make, nor has it identified specific situations that cause it difficulty, so that the Commission can provide guidance.

KGPC further requests clarification of the Commission's statement in Order No. 497E that, even though sales
and marketing information no longer must be disclosed under Standard F, the Commission is not barred from examining
such questions, if relevant and necessary, in specific cases. KGPC requests that the Commission specify the circumstances
in which it will consider such issues. 
In Order No. 497E, the Commission removed the general requirement for pipelines to disclose sales and marketing
information. However, the Commission still retains the right to determine in individual proceedings that certain
pipelines must disclose sales and marketing information when the circumstances show such disclosure is needed to
prevent undue discrimination. 


 C. Standard H_Tieing Gas Subject to Take-Or-Pay Relief 


In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to eliminate 161.3(h) of the regulations which prohibits pipelines from
conditioning or tieing an agreement to release gas subject to take-or-pay relief to the purchase of services from
a marketing affiliate. The Commission stated that this provision should no longer be needed since Order No. 636 established
procedures for dealing with gas supply realignment (GSR) costs resulting from the reformation or termination of
take-or-pay contracts after the unbundling of sales from transportation service.

</FOOTNOTE>


Hadson and Indicated Parties argue for retention of this provision. Hadson states that, while the size of the take-or-pay
problem has been reduced, the Commission has approved pricing differential mechanisms for reducing GSR costs under
which gas subject to take-or-pay contracts is auctioned by the pipeline or marketing affiliate on a monthly basis.
It also states the Commission has approved reverse auctions. These mechanisms, it asserts, still create the potential
for anticompetitive tieing. Indicated Parties suggest that the phrase gas supply realignment costs be substituted
for take-or-pay costs to ensure that pipelines do not attempt to tie the availability of unbundled transportation
and storage services to the purchase of specific gas supplies.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 But they do not explain why retention of this requirement is necessary in light of the procedures established in Order
No. 636 and the restructuring cases for dealing with GSR costs. 


<FOOTNOTE>

They both also contend the Commission should retain current 250.16(b)(2)(xiii), which requires disclosure
of whether any gas being transported is subject to take-or-pay relief. Indicated Parties again suggests the substitution
of gas supply realignment costs for take-or-pay. 
</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission will delete this requirement. Hadson has not demonstrated how the pipeline would rig an auction or
a reverse auction
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 that would result in tieing of an agreement to release gas to the purchase of services from an affiliate. The auction
or reverse auction involves bidding on gas contracts which is independent of any services provided by a marketing
affiliate. Moreover, the Commission can better monitor potential affiliate abuse in auctions by considering the
circumstances of the auction mechanism proposed in individual cases rather than by promulgating a generic standard,
which may not apply to certain cases.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 


<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
In a reverse auction, parties bid an amount that the pipeline must pay them to take over pipeline gas contracts with
prices that are above the market price. The pipeline, therefore, accepts the lowest bid (rather than the highest as
in a standard auction).

D. Standard I (New Standard H)_Affiliate Discounts Contemporaneously Disclosed To Similarly Situated Shippers



1. Retention of Standard H 


The Commission is retaining the current standard, which is being renumbered Standard H. Current Standard I requires
pipelines making a transportation discount to an affiliate to make a comparable discount contemporaneously available
to all similarly situated non-affiliates. A number of commenters contend this provision should be removed. 
El Paso asserts the regulation is not needed, contending pipelines will not make an unjustified discount to an affiliate,
because the pipelines will lose money. It further argues that pipelines may actually forgo making beneficial and
competitive case specific discounts to affiliates because of the vagueness of the term ``similarly situated.''
It asserts pipelines may not offer their affiliates a discount to avoid the risk of having to unjustifiably reduce
rates to other shippers.
