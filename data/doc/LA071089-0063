Iran's powerful Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani will face former Cabinet 
minister Abbas Sheibani in the July 28 presidential election, the official news 
agency IRNA reported. It said the two men were chosen by the Council of 
Guardians from among 80 people who had registered as candidates. "There is no 
serious challenger," one Iranian analyst said. "The only thing is how many 
millions they can get to vote to give Rafsanjani a strong political hand." 
Meanwhile, a radical deputy who had mounted a one-man challenge to Iran's 
leaders, accusing them of turning soft, quit Parliament. Iranian newspapers 
said last week that Abdolmajid Sharpasand had charged that a few leaders are 
monopolizing power and, because liberals with foreign affiliations are in the 
ascendancy, Iran is drifting away from its Islamic ideals.
