Regulation: 

24 CFR 811.107(a)(2), 811.107(b), 811.108(a)(1), 811.108(a)(2), 811.108(a)(3), 811.114(b)(3), 811.114(d),
811.115(b).




Project/Activity: 

Birmingham, Alabama HA refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Roosevelt Manor Apartments.




Nature of Requirement: 

The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing
revenue bonds from Federal income taxation and authorize call of debentures prior to maturity.




Granted By: 

Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner.




Date Granted: 

June 28, 1993.




Reasons Waived: 

The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also
agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal
was approved by HUD on June 8, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.10%. The refunding will
also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $1,210,000 at current low-interest
rates will save Section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of
outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 10% to 10.75% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.10%. The
refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.78%
to 6.70%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing
HUD's Section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing
the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire,
a priority HUD objective.
