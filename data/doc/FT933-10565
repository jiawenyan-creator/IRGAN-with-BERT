FT  03 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Strong yen prompts wave
of selling in export issues
THE YEN'S strength prompted concern over the profitability of leading
exporters, and share prices lost ground with many investors inactive, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average shed 36.61 to 20,343.53 after a day's high of 20,412.64
on arbitrage-linked buying during the first few minutes of trading, and a
low of 20,231.32 in the afternoon session.
Volume came to 210m shares, falling below 300m for the first time in three
trading days. Financial institutions reshuffled portfolios, while investment
trusts were inactive. Declines led advances by 616 to 336, with 196 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 5.12 to
1,654.79, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.31 to 1,250.92.
Export-oriented companies, including car manufacturers, electricals, and
precision instrument makers, were sold in response to the higher yen. Honda
Motor dipped Y30 to Y1,360, Hitachi Y16 to Y853 and Canon Y20 to Y1,340.
Steels and shipbuilders, already facing lower profits due to the higher yen,
also lost ground. Nippon Steel retreated Y5 to Y365 and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Y3 to Y417.
A further rise in gold bullion prices supported mining shares. Mitsui Mining
and Smelting, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y11 to Y556, while
Sumitomo Metal Mining gained Y20 at Y1,090.
Profit-taking depressed Nikkatsu, the bankrupt movie producer, by Y5 to Y23.
The issue gained ground last week on reports that Namco, a video game maker,
was considering helping Nikkatsu's rehabilitation programme.
Banks were some of the few bright spots of the day. Speculation that
financial stocks will have a larger weighting in the new capitalisation
weighted futures index, which will replace the Nikkei 225 index later this
year, encouraged buying. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank moved up Y10 to Y2,350 and
Mitsubishi Bank Y30 to Y2,930.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 73.11 to 22,391.04 in volume of 8.4m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, weakened Y290 to Y9,500 on
profit-taking.
Roundup
A MIXED mood was again seen in the Pacific Rim.
