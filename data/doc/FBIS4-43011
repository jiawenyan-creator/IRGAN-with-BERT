  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 2 -- Some 30 tonnes of emergency 
aid for Rwanda will be flown on Friday [3 June] from Italy to 
the Ugandan town of Entebbe, where it will be distributed to 
refugees from the Rwandan civil war, the Foreign Ministry said 
on Thursday. 
  Another plane with a further 30 tonnes of aid will fly to 
Bujumbura, Burundi, for refugees there. 
  Medical equipment provided by Italy arrived in Burundi 
today, 
and another consignment will be sent to the Ugandan capital 
Kampala within the next few days. 
  These latest initiatives are part of an emergency programme 
for a total of almost ten billion lire (6.2 million dollars) 
financed by the Foreign Ministry's cooperation department.
