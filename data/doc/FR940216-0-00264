(3) For purposes of this paragraph (d), all applicable blendstocks produced or imported shall be included, except
those for which the refiner or importer has sufficient evidence in the form of documentation that the blendstocks
were: 
(i) Exported; 
(ii) Used for other than gasoline blending purposes; 
(iii) Transferred to a refiner that used the blendstock as a ``feedstock'' in a refining process during which the blendstock
underwent a substantial chemical or physical transformation; or 
(iv) Transferred between refineries which have been grouped pursuant to 80.101(h) by a refiner for the purpose
of determining compliance under this subpart. 
(e)(1) Any refiner or importer shall have exceeded the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change threshold
if: 
(i) The peak year blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change calculated under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this
section is more than ten; or 
(ii) Beginning on January 1, 1998, the cumulative blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change calculated under
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is more than ten. 
(2) Any refiner or importer that exceeds the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change threshold shall, without
further notification: 
(i) Include all blendstocks produced or imported and transferred to others in its compliance calculations for two
averaging periods beginning on January 1 of the averaging period subsequent to the averaging period when the exceedance
occurs; 
(ii) Provide transfer documents to the recipient of such blendstock that contain the language specified at 80.
