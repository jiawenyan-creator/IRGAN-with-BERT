FT  18 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Caution before US move
Foreign exchanges spent a nervous session in London as markets went through
the day positioning ahead of the US Federal Reserve's eventual decision to
tighten monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith.
In the run-up to the announcement of an increase in the 3 per cent discount
rate to 3.5 per cent, and comments by a Fed spokesman that the Fed wanted to
see a 50 basis-point rise in the fed funds rate, markets had eyes for little
else beyond the meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Markets Committee.
The market had been widely discounting a 25-50 basis-point rise in the funds
rate, and the possibility of a discount rate increase.
The Fed's failure to lift rates at the normal funding time (15.30 GMT) left
observers thinking that the tightening was likely to have been a more
complicated proposition than many had assumed.
The dollar, which edged higher after the Fed announcement, had closed in
London at DM1.6683, down from DM1.6740 on Monday. Against the yen, it
finished at Y104.380 from Y104.580. It ended in New York at DM1.6720 and
Y104.525.
Elsewhere, sterling weakened against the D-Mark to finish in London at
DM2.5095 from DM2.5174. The Greek drachma remained fairly steady as the
central bank maintained a policy of high interest rates to defend the
currency.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said the Fed's
decision to add reserves to the system through overnight system repos had
clearly been a holding operation.
The market's expectations were clear from the federal funds rate, which
stood at around 4 1/8 per cent at 15.30 GMT, the typical time for Fed
action, against a then-official level of 3 3/4 per cent.
In Europe the D-Mark was generally slightly weaker, closing in London at
FFr3.426 against the French franc from FFr3.429. The Spanish peseta regained
some ground to close at Pta 82.63 against the D-Mark from Pta 82.84.
In Greece, high overnight rates underpinned the drachma. Overnight money was
at 200 per cent, with the drachma steady at Dr148.30/35 to the D-Mark.
The Italian lira ended at L956.6 from L961.5 per D-Mark, helped by the
belief that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will win the confidence vote in
parliament today.
In Germany, the repo rate is expected to fall by about 5 to 8 basis points
today after the Bundesbank announced another variable rate repo. Call money
was steady yesterday at 5.35/50 per cent, compared to the existing repo rate
of 5.35 per cent.
After the Bundesbank cut its official rates by 50 basis points last week,
the market speculated that the repo rate might fall by as much as 10 to 15
basis points. That position has since been abandoned and most analysts are
predicting a more modest move.
Ms Phyllis Reed, European fixed income strategist at BZW, said the
Bundesbank had succeeded in arresting the pessimism about the extent to
which German interest rates were still likely to fall. It was thus
'perfectly reasonable to return to a dull, few points per week, rate of
cuts'.
The Bundesbank, she said, could not be expected to maintain the aggressive
pace of easing seen between the last two sets of official rate cuts.
Ms Reed predicts a cut of, at most, 5 basis points today, although she
maintains the view that three-month money rates are likely to fall to about
3 3/4 per cent by the year-end.
Sterling traded in a very narrow range against both the D-Mark and the
dollar. It closed in London at Dollars 1.5043, from Dollars 1.5039 on
Monday, and finished easier at DM2.5095 from DM2.5174.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg in London,
commented: 'The events of the past week have taken some of the political
risk premium, that had been accumulating in the currency, away for a while.'
This had allowed the 'growth story' to show through more prominently.
The pound's progress, however, is likely to be subject to no further
setbacks for the dollar. If the dollar falls back, sterling is unlikely to
be secure above DM2.50.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England injected Pounds 571m liquidity
into the system to clear a Pounds 550m shortage. Overnight money traded in
the 4 to 4 3/4 per cent range.
Futures markets generally lost ground, with the prospect of higher US rates
generally bad for short-term contracts. Some of the longer month short
sterling contracts performed better. Amid modest volumes, the December
contract closed 9 basis points lower at 93.96.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said a large portion of the
volumes came from a single sale by a European bank. He added that trade had
been nervous, with traders reluctant to take positions, but he predicted
that the market was preparing for a decisive move.
The December Euromark contract finished at 95.20 from 95.25.
