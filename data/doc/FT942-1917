FT  22 JUN 94 / Waldegrave faces survey censure
Labour is planning to table a motion of censure against Mr William
Waldegrave, public services minister, for preventing the cross-party Commons
Treasury and Civil Service committee from conducting an attitude survey
among civil servants.
The committee will today publish a report on the proposed survey, which
would be part of its inquiry into the changing status of civil servants
under the government's market orientated reforms.
Mr Waldegrave believes the survey would constitute a breach of Civil Service
impartiality.
