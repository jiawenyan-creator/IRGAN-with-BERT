FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Granada gives details of share options
Granada, the leisure and television group, has become one of the first
companies to give full details in its annual report of share options held by
its directors.
Under new guidance issued by the Accounting Standards Board in September,
greater transparency was urged on companies, although a few already
published share option details.
The report shows that Mr Gerry Robinson, the group's chief executive, is
sitting on a paper profit of Pounds 2.3m.
He has 737,500 share options which he can exercise now at a price of 184p
each. Granada's share price closed the week at 498p.
