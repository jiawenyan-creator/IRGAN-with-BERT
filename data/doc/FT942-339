FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dutch boost for Goodman Fielder
Goodman Fielder, the large but ailing Australian food group, is to increase
its share of the Dutch bread market to about one-third through an agreement
with Verenigde Bakkers, an association of independent bakers in the
Netherlands. Goodman's European baking business, Quality Bakers Europe,
currently holds around 25 per cent of the Dutch bread market.
The VBN bakeries will remain independent, but their products will use
Quality Bakers branding, and supply, billing and distribution will be
handled by the Goodman unit.
The move comes just one week after Mr Barry Weir, Goodman chief executive,
told shareholders the company should be able to achieve a 9-10 per cent
margin on sales, and set out a number of proposals to help the company to
this objective. In the latest half-year, sales margins were under 7 per
cent.
