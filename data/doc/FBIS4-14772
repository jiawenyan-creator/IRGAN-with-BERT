<F P=106> [Interview with SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA Chief Editor Valentin </F>
Chikin by Aleksandr Golovenko; date, place not given: 
"SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA Suspended"] 
  [Text] The "Pressa" Publishing House stopped printing 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA as of 31 March. This is what its chief 
editor, Valentin Chikin, said: 
  [Chikin] The pretext for the stoppage is financial. It 
appears that we owe the publishing house for printing work. At 
the same time we have not of course forgotten that the editorial 
office incurred losses of over 1.3 billion rubles -- without a 
kopek's compensation -- as a result of actions, deemed illegal 
by the court, on the part of the Ministry of the Press and the 
selfsame publishing house to close the newspaper in 
October-December 1993. 
  The opposition public, electoral associations, and State 
Duma 
deputies' factions have a permanent platform in SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA. It has repeatedly confronted the country's president, 
head of government V. Chernomyrdin, his deputy O. Soskovets, and 
the leadership of the press department with the issue of 
protecting the newspaper from unlawful persecution, creating the 
basic conditions for it to publish, and safeguarding the mass 
readership against insults to its human rights and political 
views. These appeals seemed to have met with understanding. 
But time passes, words remain just that, and there is still no 
compensation for the losses, no subsidies for the subscriber, 
and no concrete assistance for the editorial office. 
  Now, when we are all talking about civil peace and social 
accord, when the quest for ways of mutual understanding is under 
way, the closure of a popular opposition newspaper is tantamount 
to a stark demonstration of unwillingness to hear the voice of 
the people.
