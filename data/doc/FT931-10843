FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Gillette lifted by overseas
operations
GILLETTE, the US toiletries and shaving products company, yesterday
announced after-tax profits of Dollars 508.6m for 1992, up from Dollars
409.4m in the previous year. The Boston-based group said that there had been
improvements in its US business, but international operations were the main
driving force.
Sales for the year rose by about 10 per cent to Dollars 5.16bn.
The full-year result came after a fourth-quarter profit of Dollars 135.3m,
up from Dollars 114.3m in the same period of 1991. Sales in the final three
months of the year rose to Dollars 1.51bn from Dollars 1.34bn.
Gillette said that sales and profits from the core blade and razor business
increased significantly. Braun products were considerably ahead.
In the stationery division, where Gillette sells under the Paper Mate and
Waterman brand names, sales were up strongly, but profits were static.
On the toiletries and cosmetics front, sales edged ahead but profits fell
sharply. Gillette said that expenses to support established brands and the
launch of a new male toiletries line at the year-end overshadowed excellent
results elsewhere in the division.
