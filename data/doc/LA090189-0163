P.M. BRIEFING; 
U.S. WARNED OF CRIPPLING LACK OF EDUCATED, EFFICIENT WORK FORCE 
A "work force crisis" will cripple the United States' ability to compete 
internationally without immediate steps to improve the education, training and 
efficiency of U.S. workers, said a report submitted today to Labor Secretary 
Elizabeth Hanford Dole. 
At a news conference where Dole received the report, the secretary said the 
problems in the work force require the attention of business, labor, government 
and private citizens. 
"The skills of our work force have not kept pace with the more complex jobs of 
today," Dole said. 
The report was produced by the Commission on Workforce Quality and Labor Market 
Efficiency, created in 1988 by Dole's predecessor, Ann McLaughlin. 
The commission's 44 recommendations cover three broad fronts: improving 
education for young people, providing lifetime education and training for 
workers, and improving productivity and efficiency by providing more help to 
working parents and developing a system to better match workers with jobs.
