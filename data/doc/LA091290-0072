NEWBORN GIRL FOUND NEAR ROAD, COVERED WITH ANTS 
An abandoned newborn girl found covered with fire ants in a plastic bag was 
reported in fair condition at a local hospital Tuesday, officials said. The 
infant was found Monday after her 19-year-old mother told police she had given 
birth and left the child along a Waller County road.
