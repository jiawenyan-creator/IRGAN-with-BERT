The House approved a 4.9% cost-of-living increase in benefits for about 2.5 
million disabled veterans and their survivors. The increase, effective Dec. 1, 
would raise from $1,468 to $1,539 a month the basic benefit payment for a 
veteran with 100% disability resulting from service in the military. Maximum 
monthly benefits would rise from $2,559 to $2,684 under the legislation, which 
was approved without opposition on a voice vote. The package also orders the 
Army to set aside an area at Arlington National Cemetery for the unmarked 
burial of cremated remains. Also approved was an extension of Vietnam-era GI 
Bill education benefits to 1977 and 1978 graduates of the military academies 
and 1978 graduates of Reserve Officer Training Corps programs.
