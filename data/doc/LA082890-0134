NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: SOUTH PLACENTIA 
Here in what is the southern "tip" of Placentia, a subtle reminder of Orange 
County's past stands aside for its pedestrian present. A wooden trellis on 
Crowther Avenue designates the site of the Ontiveros Adobe. Mounted on a stone 
under the trellis, the plaque shares space with several industrial parks west 
of Kraemer Boulevard at Porter Way. 
Juan Pacifico Ontiveros received a Mexican land grant for the Rancho San Juan 
Cajon de Santa Ana (35,970 acres) in 1837. He built the adobe that bears his 
name in 1841. The land subsequently was parceled out: 1,165 acres were sold to 
German colonists for $2 an acre to found what became Anaheim; other portions 
later evolved into Fullerton and Brea, as well as Placentia. 
"The Ontiveros Adobe would have been the oldest standing adobe in North Orange 
County," said Cecil Rospaw, vice chairman of the Placentia Historical 
Committee, a nine-member group appointed by the City Council. 
The adobe's site (a total of 3,900 acres) was purchased by Daniel Kraemer, an 
Illinois farmer. The adobe ultimately ended up in the hands of one of his 
grandsons, Ben Kraemer, who modernized it as late as 1940 -- into a California 
bungalow. 
"It had been lived in over the years and had been so modified that it had lost 
a lot of its historical character," said Jack Slota, assistant city 
administrator. "Even the historical society didn't think it was worth the 
recovery." 
"It's very difficult," Rospaw said. "I toured with two very well known county 
historians. (He was with the Orange County Historical Commission at the time.) 
They both gave reports to the city saying that while you could find the old 
adobe and the original square nails, they couldn't justify the expense 
($100,000 to the city of Placentia) to restore the original adobe." 
The (Ben) Kraemer family never found oil on their property, Rospaw said. But in 
the 1970s there was a chance to sell the land. The estimated price: $70,000 to 
$80,000 per acre, a latter-day form of striking it rich. "It's an absolute 
tragedy," said Rospaw of the loss of the Ontiveros adobe, "but in this 
(historical preservation) you have to figure out what can be done and what 
can't be done." 
What couldn't be done this time was having the taxpayers foot the bill for the 
restoration. The result is the series of heartless industrial parks spanning 
Crowther Avenue. 
The only people liable to pay homage at the Ontiveros Adobe historical site 
plaque are workers at neighboring industrial centers or truck drivers making 
deliveries there. Children traveling by at top speed on their bicycles appear 
to have no time to stop and read the marker under the wooden arborway, much 
less grasp the image of a time and lifestyle so far removed. 
In a neighborhood whose residents are 55% Latino, it is no surprise to find 
something like Placita Santa Fe ("Old Town"). Populated with establishments 
such as the Mexican Supermarket and restaurants such as El Farolito and Mi 
Ranchito, it is a commercial area serving locals. 
But there is one that has attained countywide acclaim: Santa Fe Avenue's 
Tlaquepaque Restaurant. Raul Davis opened the bakery and family restaurant in 
1963, and fruit pickers once jammed the place for breakfast before heading off 
to work in the surrounding orange groves. It still opens every morning at 6 
(even though the orange groves are gone), filling the morning air with wondrous 
aromas. In the 1970s, Davis' father, also named Raul, hired El Mariachi 
Uclatlan to perform for an hour every Friday at lunchtime. The group, which 
first made its mark in the county at Tlaquepaque, opened the El Mariachi 
restaurant in Orange in 1981. 
The one-hour Friday lunchtime performances that got mariachi music in Orange 
County off the ground now stretch from noon to 2 p.m. The Mariachi Estrellas de 
America, a polished eight-piece band, is a weekly feature at the Tlaquepaque. 
One wonders what Juan Pacifico, who had to settle the claim for ownership of 
his rancho in the U.S. Supreme Court, would make of it all.
