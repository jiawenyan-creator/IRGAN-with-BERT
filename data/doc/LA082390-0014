METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY CONSIDERS PENALTY FOR SACRIFICE OF 
ANIMALS 
A group of Los Angeles City Council members wants to make the ritual sacrifice 
of animals a crime punishable by a fine up to $1,000 and six months in jail. 
Councilmen Richard Alatorre, Hal Bernson and Nate Holden, serving on the 
council's Public Safety Committee, have approved a measure that would make 
animal sacrifice a misdemeanor. The full council must vote on the proposal. 
Currently, there is no municipal law against people sacrificing animals in 
religious ceremonies, officials said. To prosecute someone under state law, 
suffering by the animal must be proven, City Atty. James Hahn said.
