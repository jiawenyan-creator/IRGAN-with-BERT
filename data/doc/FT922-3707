FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Croydon was saved too
Sir, Vanessa Houlder (Property Market, June 5) is not comparing like with
like on the similarities or otherwise of Docklands and Croydon.
The situation in Croydon in the early 1970s was very similar to that of
Docklands today. Developers, having built an enormous amount of speculative
office space, faced the prospect of buildings standing vacant. It took Home
Office and the Department of the Environment intervention to save the
situation. I know. I was one of the unfortunate civil servants who had to
work there.
