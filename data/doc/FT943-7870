FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Bristol Scotts board removes chairman
The chairman of Bristol Scotts, the lossmaking property and leisure group,
has been replaced in the latest stage of a boardroom power struggle.
Mr Anthony Kerman was asked to resign when the board met after the company's
annual meeting on Thursday. He was then removed as chairman on a majority
vote, and Sir Ian Rankin, a shareholder who became a non-executive director
in December, was elected as his successor.
Mr Kerman had been re-elected by the annual meeting and remains a director,
as does his father Mr Isidore Kerman and brother Mr Nicholas Kerman. There
are four non-family directors.
Sir Ian was proposed as chairman by Mr Ian Stevens, a substantial
shareholder who also joined the board last December. In 1993 the company
incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 246,073.
The company also announced that it was holding talks with parties interested
in buying its Eastgate Retail Park property. A further announcement would be
made should contracts be exchanged.
