FT  18 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
GOLD was fixed at Dollars 348.40 a troy ounce in London yesterday afternoon,
little changed from the overnight close, after easing back from five-week
highs. Dealers said producer selling, fund liquidation and profit-taking
prompted by recent gains emerged above the Dollars 350 level. But the market
was well supported on the dips, comfortably holding Dollars 348. Uncertainty
and volatility in Europe's currency markets ahead of this weekend's French
referendum continues to support gold, while there was talk of Middle East
buying in the morning. On the LME some base metals were beginning to respond
to factors other than the currency markets. COPPER staged a late rally as
Comex firmed, ZINC received a reminder of impending supply tightness when
the cash premium began to widen, while ALUMINIUM headed lower after its
ample supply situation was brought back into focus by Wednesday's higher
than expected CIS export estimates. London COCOA stabilised around the day's
lows after coming under pressure earlier from profit-taking and a sterling
rally. There was talk of a report forecasting a 25,000-tonne deficit for
1992-93.
