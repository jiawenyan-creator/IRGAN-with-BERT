FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Mobil to book Dollars 80m gain
from sale to BASF
MOBIL, the US oil and gas group, yesterday said it would record an Dollars
80m third-quarter gain on the sale of its polystyrene resin business to BASF
of Germany.
In the 1991 third quarter the group earned Dollars 365m, or 87 cents a
share, on revenues of Dollars 15bn.
Mobil also said it had further cut its capital appropriations budget for the
year, to Dollars 4bn from Dollars 4.8bn, in response to sluggish economic
growth and depressed margins in its downstream operations and chemicals
business.
At the end of last year, Mobil said its 1992 appropriates budget would be
Dollars 4.8bn, about Dollars 1bn below previous projections.
Mr Allen Murray, Mobil's chairman and chief executive, said: 'At that time,
I indicated that the 1992 budget included Dollars 800m which would not be
appropriated this year unless business conditions improved.'
The company expects the impact from lower appropriations to be seen beyond
1992, since there is a lag between a cut in capital appropriations and lower
capital expenditures.
As a result, 1992 spending will be only slightly below the Dollars 5bn spent
in 1991. Mr Murray said that Mobil's savings from a recently announced
restructuring would be 'greater than previously anticipated'.
Salaried payroll in the US is expected to fall by about 10 per cent, or
2,000 people, by the end of 1992.
In addition, it expects to sell more than Dollars 600m of assets this year,
exceeding 1991 asset sales. Between 1986 and 1990, Mobil sold nearly Dollars
7bn of assets, Mr Murray said.
On Wall Street, Mobil's share price closed Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 62
1/2 .
