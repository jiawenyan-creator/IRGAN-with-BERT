PRINT COVERAGE FAILED, BUT RADIO WENT DISTANCE 
Jim Babbitt of Manhattan Beach writes (March 11) to complain, "all that 
marathon coverage and not one word about wheelchairs." 
While he may be unhappy with print coverage, he should know that during the 
course of six hours of coverage, KNX Newsradio provided: a live interview with 
the defending wheelchair division champion; live coverage of the start of the 
wheelchair race, coverage of the winner crossing the line, and minutes later, a 
live interview with the winner. 
To paraphrase Mr. Babbitt, "All that critiquing and not one word about radio."
