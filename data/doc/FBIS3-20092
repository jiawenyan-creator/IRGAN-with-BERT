  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Central Council of Jews in 
Germany has called for tough punishment of the persons 
responsible for the arson attack on Luebeck Synagogue. There 
must be no leniency for the culprits, the Central Council said 
in Bonn today. The latest attack was "part of a series of 
shameful assaults on foreigners and perceived foreigners which 
have already claimed numerous lives." The public and society 
were called upon to "outlaw the spiritual fathers of such 
attacks who are based in the right-wing extremist parties and 
groupings and are preparing the ground for them with their 
slogans and pamphlets."
