<F P=106> [Hans O. Alfredsson report: "Voter Collapse for New </F>
Democracy"] 
  [Excerpts] Things are going well for the Center Party and 
the Moderation Coalition Party, the high-scoring Social 
Democrats' figures are little changed, while New Democracy has 
run into difficulties, according to the SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo 
[Swedish Institute for Opinion Research] poll for April. 
  New Democracy has lost half its voters since early February 
when Ian Wachtmeister announced his plans to resign as party 
leader. [passage omitted]
