FT  25 MAY 93 / Steinkuhler in offer to resign
MR Franz Steinkuhler, leader of Germany's powerful IG Metall engineering
workers' union, yesterday offered to resign after accusations that he
benefited from insider dealing in the shares of Daimler-Benz.
At the same time he appealed for support from his union members to let him
stay in office and win back their confidence.
In a separate letter to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of the supervisory board
at Daimler, of which he is a member, Mr Steinkuhler said he would not attend
any further meetings until an inquiry into insider dealing on the Frankfurt
stock exchange reported on his particular case. He will not attend the
company's annual general meeting tomorrow, at which his position on the
board is certain to be an issue.
His move was seen yesterday not as an admission of defeat by the most
powerful union leader in Germany, but as a calculated gamble to maintain his
position.
In a letter to top officials of the 3.3m-strong union, he admitted he made a
'political mistake' in buying and selling the shares of two companies
closely linked to Daimler.
Although he denies the charge of insider trading in the shares of both
Fokker, the Dutch aerospace manufacturer controlled by Daimler, and Mercedes
AG Holding, the Daimler holding company, he admitted that it was wrong to
have bought and sold them at all as a board member.
He promised that all the shares had now been sold, and the profits paid into
the solidarity fund for the recent strike by union members in the east
German engineering and steel industries. Mr Steinkuhler bought DM1m (Pounds
390m) worth of MAH shares, and earned a profit of at least DM64,000 on the
sale of a first tranche, after Daimler decided to dissolve the holding
company and exchange its shares for full company shares.
