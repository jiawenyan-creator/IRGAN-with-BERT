  [Text] Zagreb, March 5 (TANJUG) -- Croatia will seek from 
the U.N. Security Council before the expiration of the U.N. 
peace-keepers' mandate on March 31 to restore full control of 
its borders, the Croatian Defence and National Security Council 
ruled on Saturday. 
  "We have received firm guarantees for the security of the 
Croatian state, a speedier reintegration of the U.N.-protected 
areas into Croatia's constitutional and legal system and the 
earliest possible repatriation of all refugees," said the 
council at a session chaired by Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman. 
  Croatia considers as its territory the Republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK), which was proclaimed by Serbs in their ethnic and 
historical territories in Croatia in 1991. The RSK, which was 
placed under U.N. protection in the spring of 1992, 
energetically opposes any idea of Croatia controlling its 
territory. 
  Commenting on the Moslem-Croat agreement reached in 
Washington on Tuesday on creating a federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian Defence and National Security 
Council said it was a historic event which further consolidated 
the independent and sovereign Croatian state and ensured the 
survival of the Croatian people in Bosnia. 
  The agreement also fully protects the strategic interests of 
the Croatian state, the council said in a statement. 
  "The agreement is not directed against the interests of the 
Serb side in Bosnia...and it will enable the finding of a 
solution acceptable to all three nations in Bosnia together with 
the Serb side," it added. 
  The preliminary agreement on forming a Moslem-Croat 
federation in the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, signed under strong pressure from 
Washington, envisages that the federation subsequently form 
confederate ties with neighbouring Croatia.
