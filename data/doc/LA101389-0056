FINDERS OF PLANE PART REAP REWARD 
A farm family whose cornfield yielded a key piece of wreckage from United 
Airlines Flight 232 that crashed in Sioux City in July collected a $116,000 
reward Thursday. 
Janice Sorenson of rural Alta ran over a titanium fan blade disk while 
combining corn on Tuesday. The piece came from a General Electric tail engine 
on the United DC-10 that crashed July 19, killing 112 of the 296 people aboard. 
The disk is considered the most essential piece of evidence to finding out why 
the plane's No. 2 engine disintegrated in flight. General Electric offered 
$50,000 for return of the disk alone and a total of $271,000 in rewards for 
other missing engine parts such as bolts and fan blades. The disk pulled from 
the Sorenson's farm field contained many other parts sought by investigators. 
GE field representative Jerry Clark presented a check for $116,000 to the 
Sorensons on Thursday and said another check for $3,000 will be coming later. 
"We'll give some to charity, although I don't know about our church," Janice 
Sorenson said. "My grandfather said he saw two churches ruined after they 
received a lot of money."
