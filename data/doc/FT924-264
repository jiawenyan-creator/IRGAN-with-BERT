FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: Moulinex chairman warns of 'bad'
results
MOULINEX, the French household electronics group, is experiencing a 'black
year', according to Mr Roland Darneau, chairman, with pressure on both sales
and margins.
Mr Darneau told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that the group, which has
already reported a heavy loss for the six months ended June, faced further
problems in the current half-year, although it might manage to stay in the
black.
Moulinex, which last year significantly expanded its household electronics
interests by buying Krups of Germany, made a loss after tax of FFr11m
(Dollars 2m) in the first six months of 1992, against net profits of FFr35m
in the same period of the previous year, on static sales of FFr3.7bn.
The group has been hit by the impact of the economic slowdown across Europe,
including its main markets of France and Germany, and by the financial
effect of the DM130m Krups deal.
The acquisition of Krups, which specialises in coffee machines and electric
mixers, was largely responsible for the rise in Moulinex's turnover from
FFr5.96bn in 1990 to FFr8.36bn in 1991, when it made net profits of FFr149m.
Mr Darneau, who yesterday secured shareholders' agreement to extend
Moulinex's year-end to March 31, anticipated 'bad results' by the end of the
present year, when the value of unsold stocks should be around 12 per cent
higher than the previous year at FFr2.1bn.
However, he said there were some signs of improvement, particularly in
Germany, which now accounts for a fifth of sales.
The French national telephone company France Telecom has decided to increase
its holding in state-owned Thomson to 19.9 per cent from 17.7 per cent,
Reuter reports from Paris.
France Telecom said the operation would bring FFr350m to the government.
