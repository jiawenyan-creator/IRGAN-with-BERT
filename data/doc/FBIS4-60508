  [Text] In a funeral procession last night, Palestinian 
policemen carried on their shoulders the body of Jihad 'Asfur, 
an Islamic Jihad activist who was killed by IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] soldiers' fire on 22 May. 'Asfur's funeral was held in 
Khan Yunus, and he was buried in a quasi-military ceremony. His 
body was driven to the cemetery on a Palestinian police jeep. 
Some 30 policemen attended the funeral, and with them were 10 
members of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads, the Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] military arm, who were armed with M-16 
rifles. Thousands of Hamas supporters came to the funeral. 
Four Palestinian policemen carried 'Asfur's body to the grave. 
According to eye witnesses, one of the policeman even kissed 
the body before it was buried. The policemen and the Hamas 
activists fired their guns in the air to salute 'Asfur, as is 
customary in military funerals. 
  As will be recalled, the Fatah leaders declared that the 
Palestinian policemen intend to disarm Hamas activists and other 
armed Palestinians. 'Asfur was killed on 22 May when IDF 
soldiers fired antitank missiles at a house on the outskirts of 
Hebron.
