P.M. BRIEFING; 
STOP NAGGING, SEOUL TELLS U.S. 
The United States should stop nagging South Korea on bilateral trade issues and 
start working with Seoul as a cooperative partner, South Korea's top economic 
official said today. 
"The U.S. economic relationship should be broadened," Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Economic Planning Lee Seung Yun told visiting American businessmen. 
"Rather than somewhat narrowly focusing on bilateral issues and conflicting 
concerns as in the 1980s, we should strive for a mutually beneficial 
partnership in the 1990s." 
He slammed what he called the "interventionist practices of the United States," 
such as forcing South Koreans to impose so-called voluntary restraints on steel 
exports. "It would greatly help our efforts to reduce government intervention 
if the United States also reduces its government interventions restricting 
imports," he said. 
The U.S. trade representative's office over the last few years has threatened 
retaliation under the Super 301 provision of the revised trade act to pressure 
South Korea to open its markets to foreign-made goods and reduce its exports.
