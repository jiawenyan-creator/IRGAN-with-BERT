FT  16 APR 93 / Letter: EBRD: striking a wrong chord and reluctant to lend
(1)
Sir, We have learned to live with many of the excesses of the 'conspicuous
consumption' society over the years, but the latest outbreak at the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development strikes a really inappropriate chord
in these difficult times ('Spending at the European Bank', April 13). Such
examples of apparent gross abuse of money supposedly destined for aid and
re-development bring the whole process of international aid and development
into question yet again.
It is particularly sickening for those of us who are conscientiously and
carefully trying to help in the rebuilding of eastern Europe. For example,
for the price of half a marble wall, Ashridge has provided in-depth
management development for more than 200 top and senior managers from Czech
and Slovakian companies and supported them in turning their visions into
practical business plans and actions. The work is funded on a shoestring and
thus, for example, can involve travel across Europe by road in order to save
travel funds. Perhaps in future the bank might like to offer any spare seats
in its executive jet to support development efforts like ours]
