  [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- "Major national cooperation 
is needed in order to try to turn round the current situation. 
The Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) wishes to lead this 
national cooperation," MDF spokesman Karoly Herenyi said on 
Monday at his party's press conference, analysing first round 
election results. 
  Herenyi said the MDF could contact Christian Democrats and 
Independent Smallholders at local level, wherever candidates of 
these two parties are still in the running for the second round. 
The spokesman said the Hungarian Justice and Life Party has no 
political weight at all after its tiny election result, but the 
MDF counts on the voting base of Istvan Csurka's party. 
  Herenyi also said the Democratic Forum presidium met on 
Monday morning. There was no debate at the session, he said, 
and the evaluation was limited to merely stating the results. 
He added that dispute and looking for possible scapegoats would 
be dangerous between the two rounds of the elections. It seems 
to the MDF senior body that the renewed advance of former 
leftists cannot be stopped in Central and Eastern Europe.
