CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION PILL 
Your editorial says doctors have a "responsibility" under the Hippocratic oath 
to give people RU-486 "as a safe alternative to surgical abortions." 
This would be news to Hippocrates. His oath, the basis for civilized medicine, 
states, "I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will 
I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give a woman an 
abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art."
