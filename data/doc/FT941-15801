FT  13 JAN 94 / People: Courtney to take the credit
Peter Courtney, former finance director of Rank Organisation and The Boots
Company, has become non-executive chairman of Hull-based Cattle's Holdings,
one of the few quoted financial companies to specialise in weekly
home-collected credit.
Courtney, 61, takes over from Roy Waudby, 65, who has headed the company for
more than a decade and was on the board when founder Joseph Cattle floated
the company over 30 years ago.
Cattle's, like its bigger rival Provident Financial, has grown from being a
Northern check trading business involving thousands of agents who collect
weekly instalments from individual homes, into a consumer financial services
company. Since it bought Compass Credit from Standard Chartered three years
ago its shares have more than trebled and the company is now capitalised at
Pounds 190m.
Cattle's chief executive Eddie Cran, 42, who joined the group at the time of
the Compass acquisition, says he had wanted a non-executive chairman who was
a finance man. Courtney says he was attracted by the enthusiasm of Cran whom
he describes as 'quite a performer'.
Since resigning from Boots in April 1990, Courtney has spent a lot of his
time helping sort out Throgmorton Trust, an investment trust which lost its
way in the 1980s. He expects to go non-executive shortly.
Although Courtney, a Yorkshireman by birth, is rather coy about who put his
name forward for the Cattle's job, he seems to have found favour with the
Yorkshire business mafia. In June he was made non-executive chairman of the
Bradford-based Yorkshire Building Society.
