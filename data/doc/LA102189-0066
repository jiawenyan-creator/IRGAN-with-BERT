BEIJING PUSHES FOR STRICT ANTI-PROSTITUTION LAWS 
City lawmakers in the Chinese capital have called for jails to be built to 
house prostitutes and urged severe punishment, including the death sentence, 
for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution, the official New 
China News Agency said Friday. 
The municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its 
first anti-prostitution statutes, the agency said. 
China has national laws against prostitution, but penalties are generally 
light. According to a 1986 law, women caught selling sexual favors are detained 
for less than 15 days or, in more serious cases, sent to labor reform camps.
