  [Text] On 25 January, a day before the debate at the U.S. 
Senate on the lifting of the trade embargo against Vietnam, 
former U.S. war veterans, who are now Senate members, called for 
the support of a resolution demanding the lifting of the trade 
embargo to help solve the fate of more than 2,000 American 
missing in Southeast Asia. 
  Democratic Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Republic Senator 
McCain of Arizona, and Democratic Senator Pressler of South 
Dakota stressed that the Vietnamese Government is cooperating to 
the best of its ability with the United States in locating 
American remains in rural areas, examining archives, and 
creating favorable conditions for the U.S. side to interview 
Vietnamese war veterans on what happened to American soldiers 
missing in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. They said the United 
States is in danger of losing this great cooperation unless it 
lifts the trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  Senator Kerry said we have reached an agreement with 
Vietnam. 
If they help us with their documents, contacts, and 
excavations, then we must reciprocate. In another interview on 
25 January, he also stressed that it is about time to totally 
lift the trade embargo. 
  Meanwhile, according to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, U.S. 
Government officials on 26 January said that based on the 
progress reached, high-level advisers of President Clinton have 
suggested that the trade embargo be lifted.
