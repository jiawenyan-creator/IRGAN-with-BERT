PACIFIC PARAMETERS: PHILIPPINES; 
AQUINO'S RIGHT ON BASES 
This is the debut of a new Opinion feature -- excerpts of editorials and 
commentary from around the Pacific Rim. 
Except during coups or earthquakes, the only time the American media deigns to 
mention the Philippines is when the issue of the U.S. military facilities in 
the country crops up. 
Such a focus has given the impression that the bases lie at the heart of the 
U.S.-Philippine relationship. (But) as President Corazon Aquino put it: "The 
(bases) . . . are not the heart of our economy nor the soul of our political 
well-being." 
We support Aquino in her avowed determination that . . . the two governments 
shall "craft a new relationship -- one more equitable, mutually beneficial and 
respectful of each other's sovereignty." We hail, too, her declaration that "it 
is now necessary for our government to work with the United States for 
arrangements regarding the orderly withdrawal of their forces from our 
country." 
These are . . . not sugarcoated terms of surrender to U.S. demands to extend 
the bases' lease.
