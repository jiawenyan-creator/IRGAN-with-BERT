FT  16 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Pressure on franc contributes
to weaker Paris
THE Bundesbank's decision to hold interest rates seemed to have little
effect on bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was slightly disappointed by the Bundesbank decision. Pressure on the
franc continued in the money markets, sending the currency even closer to
its ERM floor. Nevertheless, said brokers, the recent show of unity between
French and German politicians, as well as frequent intervention by central
banks to support the franc, suggests that the currency will weather the
present storm.
The CAC-40 index lost 28.07 or 1.4 per cent to 1,963.08 in turnover of some
FFr3.2bn. Weakness in the bond market contributed to the fall in equities,
while some profit-taking was also in evidence after last week's gains as
speculation had intensified that devaluation might be imminent.
Lyonnaise-Dumez weakened after a negative analysts meeting and news that one
of its divisions had suspended payments. The shares lost FFr19.80, or 4 per
cent to FFr462.10. Generale des Eaux initially gained from some switching
out of Lyonnaise, but as speculation that it might sell its Cie Immobiliere
Phenix fizzled out the shares lost ground, closing down FFr11 at FFr2,114.
FRANKFURT, barely moved by the Bundesbank's lack of action on interest
rates, saw the DAX index slip 3.99 to 1,807.66 as the arguments continued
over its prospects.
Merrill Lynch said that the enthusiasm over recovery prospects in German
cyclicals is misplaced: 'The present euphoria is likely to evaporate as
concerns over potential recovery in 1994 arise and further cuts in interest
rates are seen to be grudgingly low'.
In Frankfurt, Mr Patrick Bettscheider, equity dealing head at Bank Julius
Bar, said that the bank's UK-based clients were heavily underweight, and
waiting for a correction to 1,750. He thought that there would be big buying
if the DAX gets down to 1,780.
Turnover fell from DM9.6bn to DM8.4bn. BASF rose by DM2 to DM252.20; Bank
Julius Bar said that BASF has a gas pipeline which will break the Ruhrgas
monopoly in Germany and add DM5 a share to BASF earnings from 1995.
ZURICH fell on profit-taking, the SMI index losing 11.8 to 2,399.1. Sandoz
ended SFr25 lower at SFr3,340 on interim results which, said Ms Birgit
Kulhoff, pharmaceuticals analyst at Swiss Volksbank, took in lower than
expected turnover, and higher earnings.
Meanwhile, SMH dropped SFr14 to SFr238 as Mr Martin Newson, at Goldman Sachs
in London, took it off his buy list. Mr Newson said that he had been a long
time bull of the stock and that, indeed, he had just upgraded his earnings
forecast for the watchmaker; but the share price, he said, had gone high
enough.
MILAN was unsettled by news of further delays in the privatisation
programme, particularly in the telecommunications sector. Hopes that the
privatisation of Stet would go ahead speedily following the announcement on
Wednesday that Italcable and Sip were to be merged, evaporated as quickly
yesterday. The government said yesterday that the privatisation of Stet will
only take place after the sector is reorganised, with most analysts setting
a date sometime in the latter half of 1994.
Stet shed L20 to L3,905 at the close, before going to L3,890 on the kerb.
Italcable lost L316 to L7,574. The Comit index inched 0.91 ahead to 554.57.
There was news of another delay in the privatisation programme, this time of
two weeks, in the sale of Sme, the state food group. Bureaucratic delays
were blamed as the shares lost L107 to L5,962.
Among insurers, Generali briefly broke the L40,000 resistance level on
strong overseas buying, before closing L960 higher at L39,750. Brokers
commented that there was also steady activity in second line insurers.
AMSTERDAM was attracted to KLM on the cyclical recovery theme as the shares
rose Fl 2 .40 to Fl 33.40, mainly on overseas interest. Since the start of
the month the shares have risen by some 27 per cent.
The CBS Tendency index lost 0.1 to 117.0. DSM, another cyclical favourite,
fell back Fl 1.00 to Fl 97.30 after recent strong gains and an 11 per cent
rise since July 1. Kleinwort Benson issued a sell recommendation yesterday
in anticipation of disappointing second quarter results due later this month
and downgraded its 1993 profits forecast to Fl 7m from Fl 246m in 1992.
STOCKHOLM showed continued strength in Ericsson which has been attracting
substantial overseas buying this week, the B shares adding another SKr17 to
SKr383. The Affarsvarlden index put on 5.10 to 1,14490.90. Shipping stocks
were behind the gains in OSLO as the All share index improved 2.87 to
518.59, a 22 month high.
MADRID continued its pattern of little movement in thin trading, the general
index losing 0.73 to 259.31 as the peseta fluctuated in the foreign exchange
market. Construction stocks saw the worst of the declines, with Uralita down
Pta24 to Pta822 in spite of a Nomura buy recommendation.
TEL AVIV continued its up and down career, the blue chip index recovering
4.11 to 195.95 in anticipation of a slowdown in inflation which was
confirmed after hours.
