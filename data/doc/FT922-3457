FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (2): Upsurge in equity
issues as Wall Street scents recovery - Bumper underwriting fees are being
earned
TO SAY that the corporate America has been cashing in on record stock market
levels would be an understatement.
During 1991, total US equity issues reached a record Dollars 56bn - almost
three times the level seen in the previous year. The current 12 months got
off to a similar start: total equity issues, including preferred stock,
reached Dollars 29bn in the first three months, and the pace has appeared to
slacken only slightly in the second quarter.
This upsurge has been mirrored in the area of 'initial public offerings' -
that is, companies floating their shares for the first time. IPOs rose to a
heady Dollars 18.3bn in 1986, the year before stock markets crashed round
the world, but for the next three years, the annual figure barely topped
Dollars 6bn. Then in 1991, it spurted upwards, to Dollars 16.3bn. In the
first quarter of 1992, it reached Dollars 11bn.
The reason for this flood of new equity is simple. Wall Street has been
scenting the economic recovery for well over a year and marking share prices
up in advance of the hoped-for earnings improvement. Historic price-earnings
multiples are, therefore, high.
Meanwhile, a high proportion of companies has balance sheets which are still
burdened by debts taken on during the 1980s, when leverage was fashionable
and credit easy. The desire to restructure balance sheets is, consequently,
widespread. Although low interest rates have meant that part of this
financial overhaul has centred on revised debt arrangements, the replacement
of debt by equity has been another crucial ingredient.
On top of this, certain cyclical industries are lagging behind Wall Street's
optimism. These would certainly include the airline sector, which has
stacked up after-tax losses of Dollars 5bn-plus in the past two years and
may well remain in the red in 1992, and the car industry. Here, searing
losses have dented corporate liquidity, giving companies another incentive
to raise new funds.
The list of major corporations which, for either or both of these reasons,
have tapped equity investors is extremely long. Among the most prominent has
been General Motors, which only last month raised Dollars 2.14bn (before
expenses). This was the largest stock offering to investors ever seen in US.
In terms of sums raised, nevertheless, it was beaten by the Dollars 2.8bn
Time Warner rights issue - where the company's existing shareholders were
invited to subscribe for new shares. Rights issues are rare in the US, and
Time Warner's first proposal - which incorporated a sliding subscription
price depending upon shareholder demand - had to be scrapped after it was
deemed coercive. A conventional fixed price offering was scheduled instead.
That has not been the only investment banking innovation to hit the market
in the past 12 months - although some 'new products' have been more warmly
received. A good deal of publicity, for example, has attached to 'Percs' - a
type of quasi-equity developed by Morgan Stanley.
Percs - the name stands for preferred equity redemption cumulative stock -
are sold at the market price of the common stock, and are mandatorily
convertible at the end of three years. They pay a higher dividend than
ordinary shares, but the amount of capital appreciation which holders can
enjoy is capped, usually at 30 per cent.
In short, for issuers they are less dilutive, although higher-yielding, than
common stock; for investors, there is a better income flow, but capital gain
is pegged. RJR Nabisco - which has been steadily restructuring its balance
sheet since the Dollars 25bn buyout - took advantage of this hybrid in
significant fashion, as did General Motors and K Mart.
driven by broadly similar considerations - with a good number of issues
being former leveraged buyouts now returning to the public marketplace. This
wave has ebbed somewhat in recent weeks and some issues have been cancelled,
with fund managers wailing about the amount of prospectus-reading which has
been required.
Nevertheless, new potential flotation candidates are still filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission - perhaps in the hope of catching the
boat before it departs. At the end of last month, for example, Revlon -
taken private by former corporate raider, Mr Ronald Perelman in the 1980s -
announced that it was packaging most of its cosmetics business into a new
subsidiary and would float a minority interest in this to investors.
In the insurance sector, the Equitable, one of the nation's largest life
insurers, filed for a stock offering on the same day. This would allow the
insurer to shed its mutual status and turn itself into a shareholder-owned
company, raising sorely-needed capital on the way. If the Equitable scheme
is successful, some pundits believe that other ailing insurers may follow
suit.
This wave of new issues has, of course, meant bumper underwriting fees for
Wall Street firms. According to IDD, they posted a 140 per cent increase in
aggregate disclosed underwriting fees last year, after a 40 per cent decline
in 1990. Total fees amounted to Dollars 4.66bn, up from only Dollars 1.94bn
a year earlier, and just shy of the record Dollars 5.04bn seen in 1986.
Fees from underwriting debt securities rose from Dollars 806.3m to Dollars
1.32bn, but the increase on the equity front was even more marked.
Underwriting fees from common stock issues nearly trebled, from Dollars
1.05bn to Dollars 2.85bn, while fees from preferred stock issues increased
from Dollars 66.2m to Dollars 489.4m. The first few months of this year
indicate that 1992 could be better still.
