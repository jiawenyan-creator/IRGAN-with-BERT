FT  23 MAR 94 / Smith aims at Eastleigh Tories
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday launched the party's high-risk
campaign for the Eastleigh by-election by urging Conservative voters not to
switch to the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Smith said that either Labour or the Liberal Democrats could win in
Eastleigh, the Hampshire seat which became vacant when Stephen Milligan, the
Conservative MP, was found dead last month.
But he told a public meeting in the constituency that only a Labour victory
could prepare the ground for a change of government at the next general
election.
Labour is planning a high-profile campaign designed to demonstrate that the
party remains capable of winning seats from the Conservatives in the south
of England.
The campaign risks backfiring if the Liberal Democrat party, which came
second in the 1990 general election, succeeds in winning the seat.
The Conservatives are defending a majority of more than 17,000 - less than
the margin overturned by the Liberal Democrats in a by-election last year in
nearby Christchurch.
Mr Smith accused the Liberal Democrats of spreading a 'myth' that Labour was
bound to fail in the south. He said that Liberal Democrat by-election
victories had failed to change government policies.
