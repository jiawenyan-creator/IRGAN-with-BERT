FT  31 JUL 93 / Books: The Mughals in miniature
This brilliant illustration of the Mughal ruler Humayun giving audience in
his tent comes from J. M. Rogers's attractively written Mughal Miniatures
(British Museum Press; Pounds 9.95; 128 pages.) It is one of a new series of
short highly illustrated guides to Islamic art by experts in their fields;
Persian painting, metalwork and, soon to appear, tiles.
The art of Mughal India in the 16th and 17th centuries is a terrific
subject, and Professor Rogers's book is broader in scope than one might
think, thanks to his emphasis on the personalities of the emperors, Akbar,
Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Awrangzib. Their voracious appetite for art yielded
little to Habsburg or Medici contemporaries. Emperor Akbar's library of
24,000 volumes is estimated to have cost three times the sum he spent on
building the city of Fatehpur Sikri.
The strangeness of Mughal art, with its bizarre Dureresque Crucifixions, is
explicable when we read about Akbar's and Jahangir's real love of European
art. They even ordered copies of famous Roman images of the Madonna to be
displayed in public places.
Small wonder that the Jesuits misinterpreted them as thirsting for baptism,
whereas Akbar was set on a quite other goal, the imposition of his Universal
Religion.
Whether you are planning a visit to northern India or simply interested in a
fascinating chapter in the interchange of cultures, this is a book worth
having.
