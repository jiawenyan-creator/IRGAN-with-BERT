  [Text] Congressional and presidential candidates are 
increasingly concerned over the growing deterioration of public 
order in various parts of the country. They are complaining 
that they are no longer able to carry out their campaigns 
because of threats from guerrilla groups. 
  Liberal presidential hopeful David Turbay has called upon 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo to, more or less, tighten his 
belt and adopt measures that will allow the candidates to 
campaign. 
  [Begin Turbay recording] It is true that the government has 
made an effort in this area, but I believe it is up to Dr. Cesar 
Gaviria's administration to tighten its belt and see what sort 
of measures can be adopted on this final leg of the campaign to 
ensure protection. [end recording] 
  This concern has also been expressed in the past few hours 
by 
Liberal Party Director Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala.
