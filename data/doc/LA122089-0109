DRUG KINGPIN'S AIDE WAS KILLED IN RAID 
A man killed last week at the side of drug kingpin Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha has 
been identified as one of the lieutenants of the powerful Medellin cocaine 
cartel, police said. Authorities initially thought the man was one of the 
bodyguards slain during a gun battle with police at a coastal ranch. But Luz 
Mary Celades, the wife of Rodriguez Gacha, identified the body as that of 
Gilberto Rendon Hurtado, reportedly the No. 8 man in the cartel. Rendon Hurtado 
was wanted for extradition to the United States, but he was not on the 
so-called dirty dozen list of top drug traffickers wanted by the U.S.
