BRIEFLY 
Turner to Offer Program for Schools: Turner Broadcasting System said it plans 
to offer a commercial-free daily news program for schools as an alternative to 
the ad-supported Channel One service tested recently by Whittle Communications. 
Turner Chairman Ted Turner said his Cable News Network would begin providing 
the daily 15-minute news show, called CNN Newsroom, on Aug. 14. The show would 
be carried on CNN before dawn each school day and could be recorded to use in 
class. A teacher's guide would also be available daily on how to use the 
programming.
