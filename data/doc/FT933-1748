FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Canal-Plus rises 33% to FFr676m
CANAL-PLUS, the French media group, lifted net interim profits by 33 per
cent, to FFr676m (Dollars 120.3m) from FFr507m in the first half of 1992. It
forecast 10 per cent growth in net earnings for the full year, to FFr1.2bn.
News of the rise at Canal-Plus, which expanded rapidly in the 1980s but last
year saw profits stabilise at FFr1.1bn, comes at a highly-sensitive time.
The company is preparing to renegotiate the terms of its original French
pay-TV franchise with the government.
It also coincides with intense speculation about the future of Canal-Plus'
relationship with Havas, the French leisure group that owns 23.5 per cent of
its equity. Havas is reported to be planning to add the 20.4 per cent of
Canal-Plus held by the Compagnie Generale des Eaux utilities concern to its
own stake, provided the government relaxes controls over television
ownership.
The rise in net profits at Canal-Plus disguised flat profits at the
operating level. Operating income fell marginally to FFr864m from FFr866m.
