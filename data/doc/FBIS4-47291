  [Abstract] Experimental studies were made of the generation 
of a relativistic electron beam and pulsed microwave radiation 
using the energy of chemical explosives. The microwave generator 
used was a highly precise relativistic generator based on a 
triode with a virtual cathode. The energy of a strong 
relativistic beam is transformed with an efficiency up to 
30-40% into the energy of an electromagnetic field with 
the 
oscillatory motion of electrons in a potential well created by 
the real and virtual cathodes. High-voltage explosive-magnetic 
generators with interception of the magnetic flux, which are fed 
by spiral explosive-magnetic generators, were developed for 
transforming the explosion energy into electromagnetic energy. 
The matching of the impedances of the explosive-magnetic 
generators and the relativistic generator, as well as the 
shaping of the necessary form of the electric pulse, was 
accomplished using electroexplosive current interrupters. As a 
result, voltage pulses up to 600 kV with a steepness of the 
leading edge about 60 ns are sent to the relativistic generator; 
the amplitude of the current across the triode attained 16 kA. 
The peak power of the microwave radiation sent into the 
atmosphere was not less than 100 MW. A model of operation of 
system elements is proposed. The experimental apparatus is 
described in detail. It is shown that the theoretical 
computations are reasonably consistent with experimental data.
