FT  13 JUL 92 / Construction Contracts: Isle of Wight water disposal schemes
HIGH-POINT RENDEL is to design and supervise the construction of two major
schemes for Southern Water to dispose of wastewater and stormwater from two
Isle of Wight towns, Ventnor and Bembridge.
Work has already begun on scheme identification and the whole Pounds 18m
project, incorporating treatment works, pumping stations, pipelines and long
sea outfalls, is due for completion during 1995.
Conceptual schemes for Ventnor and Bembridge are already in place after
earlier feasibility work by two Southern Water companies, Southern Projects
and Southern Science, and Rendel's first role is to identify appropriate
schemes for planning approval. It will then undertake detailed design,
prepare contract documents and supervise construction.
The Ventnor scheme is expected to incorporate a sea front interceptor sewer
and pump station at Collins Point with a pumping main/gravity sewer to
headworks at Flowers Brook and an 800 metre long sea outfall.
At Bembridge a pumping main/gravity sewer could run from a pump station at
Lane End to headworks at Foreland Field Road, incorporating a 2,300 metre
long sea outfall. Rendel will also be considering alternative proposals to
include pumping 4km to a treatment works at Sandown.
