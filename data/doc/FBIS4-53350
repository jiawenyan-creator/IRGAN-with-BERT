  [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- Kim Chong-pil, chairman of 
the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, on Friday emphasized the 
"justness" of the May 16 military coup d'etat which toppled the 
popularly created John M. Chang administration in 1961. 
  Kim, the top brain behind the coup led by Maj. Gen. Pak 
Chong-hui, said he had joined the Army and staged the coup to 
realize his dream to create a strong country where people do not 
starve. 
  Saying that prior to the coup, Korea had a pitiful economy, 
so pitiful that a visiting U.S. senator described South Korea 
and the Philippines as suckers of American blood, Kim said he 
had engineered the military coup to bring about an economic 
development which he said is prerequisite to democracy. 
  In a lecture before the third graders of Yoi-do high school 
as a one-day teacher, Kim said that thanks to the coup he 
staged, the country could attain a food self-sufficiency in the 
1960s and now people can make overseas trips freely. 
  He said some people speak as if everybody can successfully 
engineer an economic development. "In truth, it is not so, as 
you can see in the anecdote of Columbus's egg," he said. 
  Meanwhile, the United People's Party denounced Kim's remarks 
as a sophistry. 
  "We were astonished to learn that Kim made a far-fetched 
sophistry and self-centered argument about economic development 
before high school students," party spokesman Kim Su-il said.
