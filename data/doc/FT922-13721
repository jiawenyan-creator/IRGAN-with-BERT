FT  10 APR 92 / Bank to chair Indonesia aid forum
THE World Bank has agreed to Indonesia's request that it set up and chair a
donor consultative forum. The request was made after Indonesia dissolved the
Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), the previous forum, in March.
Indonesia had accused the Netherlands, which chaired the IGGI, of using aid
as a political tool to interfere in its internal affairs.
The decision to set up a new forum was made after consulting 'the
traditional members of Indonesia's donor community' from whom the bank
'received broad support', the World Bank said in a letter to the Indonesian
government.
The first meeting of the new forum will take place in Paris on July 16 and
17, only one month after the cancelled annual meeting of the IGGI. Indonesia
received Dollars 4.75bn (Pounds 2.76bn) in donor commitments at the last
IGGI meeting, and officials say they are confident of a similar response in
July.
The meeting is likely to be a test of how far donors regard Indonesia as
having moved on the issue of human rights. Many donors have expressed
concern at the killing of civilians by security forces in East Timor last
November but have since welcomed a government report criticising the role of
the armed forces in the event.
