FT  06 FEB 92 / Letter: Pollution could result from radio-link telephones
Sir, In your story 'Radio-link residential telephone service licensed'
(January 30) it was envisaged that 'one million homes could have telephone
aerials on their roofs by early next century'. I have little wish to be a
killjoy, but shouldn't the government investigate how much electromagnetic
energy should be allowed to be carried in our environment?
There must be a limit to the amount of electromagnetic energy we can pump
out before human beings become seriously affected; we cannot be totally
immune from such influences. Do we have to wait until the first effects
become apparent, as we did with sea, river, land and air pollution?
Several years ago as a chief research engineer, I was asked by the Cabinet
Office what I considered to be the most worrying problem for the 1990s and
beyond. I had no hesitation in responding: electromagnetic pollution. Time
has moved on, and we continue to treat our environment as an infinite
absorbing container for electromagnetic emissions. Energy cannot be created
or destroyed; so where is all this electromagnetic energy ending up and how
much is being absorbed by us?
Do we have to repeat past mistakes and incur costly penalties in first
waiting for some unacceptable manifestations to occur?
