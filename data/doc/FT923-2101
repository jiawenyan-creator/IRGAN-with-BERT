FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Perloff raises Etonbrook stake
Mr Andrew Perloff, and companies acting in concert wuth him, have increased
their stake in Etonbrook Properties to 18.75 per cent, the largest single
holding in the former BES company which came to the market last year.
The increase involved Mr Perloff and Panther Securities, of which he is a
shareholder, purchasing 15,000 Etonbrook shares.
Last month Mr Perloff failed to secure a seat on the board for himself and
Mr Malcolm Bloch. At that time his concert party spoke for 15 per cent of
Etonbrook.
However the concert party was able to defeat a proposal by Etonbrook to
repay its preference shares which would have allowed the company to make a
25p per share capital repayment and pay a 2.75p dividend.
