FT  15 OCT 92 / Dos Santos postpones poll results
EXPLOSIONS rocked the Angolan capital, Luanda, early today in the wake of
intensified diplomatic efforts to prevent a resumption of civil war.
Witnesses said that a big blast occurred at an ammunition dump, sending
rockets into the air and causing smoke to drift over the city. There were
also unconfirmed reports of fighting near the residence of President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos before and after the blast.
Earlier, tension had appeared to ease after President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, under pressure from the United Nations and South Africa, agreed to
postpone the release of final election results until the conclusion of an
investigation of allegations of electoral irregularities.
Unita, the former rebel group that was backed by the US and South African,
has threatened to plunge the country back into civil war after alleging last
month's elections were fraudulent.
The announcement of the postponement came after a meeting between the
president and Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, who is trying
to broker a political compromise in the war-shattered country's deep crisis.
'This country was on the brink of war before this decision so this is an
extremely important step for peace in the region,' Mr Botha said. Mr Botha
said he would send his aircraft to the central city of Huambo today to
persuade Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita leader, to come immediately and meet Mr dos
Santos in Luanda.
'There is a wish on both sides to meet, there is a wish to form a government
of national unity,' Mr Botha said.
