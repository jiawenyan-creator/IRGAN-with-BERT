FT  04 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Dow Jones
The changes that bring Walt Disney, Caterpillar and JP Morgan into the now
rather anachronistically-named Dow Jones Industrial Average should help to
underpin its rediscovered credibility.
During the 1980s, the Dow was stigmatised as a relic of a dying industrial
age. Other indices, with a higher proportion of fashionable technology and
service stocks, routinely outperformed it. Since then, fashion has changed.
Buttressed by the Magic Kingdom, the Dow now looks a more plausible symbol
for American capitalism.
