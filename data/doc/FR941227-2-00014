Import Situation and Conclusion



U.S. imports of men's and boys' wool suits, Category 443, from Guatemala began in September of 1993 and reached a 12
month year-ending August 1994 (September 1993-August 1994) level of 63,959 units (5,330 dozen). Guatemala's imports
in calendar year 1993 (September-December) were 7,915 units (660 dozen). There were no Category 443 imports from
Guatemala during the year-ending August 1993 nor during calendar year 1992. Guatemala shipped 1,930 units (161 dozen)
in calendar year 1991.

The sharp and substantial increase in Category 443 imports from Guatemala is disrupting the U.S. market for men's
and boys' wool suits.

1993, a 15 percent decrease. Production for the first half of 1994, at 164,000 dozen, was flat relative to the 162,000
dozen produced during January-June 1993. U.S. production for the year-ending June 1994 was 9 percent below the year-ending
June 1993 level. By contrast, U.S. imports increased from 278,000 dozen in 1992 to 309,000 dozen in 1993, an 11 percent
increase. Imports continued to increase in 1994, reaching a record level of 334,000 dozen for the year-ending August
1994, 11 percent above the 302,000 dozen imported during the same period a year earlier.

The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 73 percent in 1992 to 95 percent in 1993, and continued to
increase in 1994, reaching 100 percent during the year-ending June 1994_U.S. imports equalled U.S. production.
The U.S. producer's share of the domestic market fell from 58 percent in 1992 to 51 percent in 1993, a decline of seven
percentage points. The U.S. producer's share declined to 50 percent for the year-ending June 1994.
