FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Monsanto hit by higher costs
A rise of almost 20 per cent in raw material costs contributed to a 14 per
cent drop in operating income at Monsanto, the US chemicals group, in the
third quarter.
Other factors were lower margins in Roundup herbicide, lower bulk prices for
the artificial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet) and the absence of income
from discontinued businesses. However, the company was on its way to 'an
outstanding 1994', Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman, said.
Worldwide sales of Roundup were well ahead in the quarter, though a tilt in
volume towards lower-margin markets as a result of weather conditions had
reduced profits. Operating profits in pharmaceuticals were maintained on a 4
per cent rise in sales.
Sales of the controversial substance BST (bovine somatotropin), used to
increase milk yields, were well ahead of expectations, the company said.
Introduced to the US market early this year, Posilac - Monsanto's version of
BST - had got off to 'a very good start', a spokesman said.
Net earnings for the quarter, helped by a Dollars 21m tax settlement, were
up 22 per cent at Dollars 116m, or 99 cents a share.
Full-year net earnings from Rohm and Haas, the speciality chemicals
producer, should beat their previous record of Dollars 230m set in 1988, Mr
Lawrence Wilson, chairman, said yesterday. Net earnings in the third quarter
were Dollars 55m, compared with a loss of Dollars 23m, bringing the
nine-month total to Dollars 211m.
