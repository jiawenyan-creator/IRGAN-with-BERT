  [Text] Komsomolsk on Amur June 9 TASS -- The primary 
organisation of the Russian National Unity Movement formed in 
Komsomolsk on Amur distributes newspapers and leaflets. The 
organisation is in opposition to both democrats and communists. 
On matters of national policy it holds an even tougher stand 
than the Zhirinovskiy party. The movement's credo is "revival 
of the Russian nation". 
  Members of the local organisation of the Russian National 
Unity Movement strive to enlist support among workers, the 
military and youth. The movement has supporters among Cossacks 
and the local patriotic society RUS. The organisation's leaders 
have contacts with Moscow and receive from Moscow newspapers and 
booklets, specifically "The Russian Order", "Russian World", 
"Our Fatherland". These publications are blatantly 
nationalistic. The authorities of Komsomolsk on Amur try not to 
notice the new organisation that has not been registered 
officially.
