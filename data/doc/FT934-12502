FT  26 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
The GOLD price bounced back above the Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce mark at the
London bullion market yesterday following the sharp fall at the end of last
week. As the price moved up Dollars 3.75 to Dollars 371.75 an ounce dealers
said most of the interest came from professionals who had been caught short
by the late bounce on Friday evening at the New York Commodity Exchange
(Comex). Some encouragement was also taken from the market holding above
Dollars 365 throughout last week. SILVER prices were only marginally higher
but PLATINUM gained Dollars 4.60 to Dollars 376.35 an ounce in light
trading. Buying of the white metal had been noted towards the close at the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange. 'The fundamentals haven't changed but the market
and the charts are both positive,' one London dealer commented. At the
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended in the middle of the day's
range after being trimmed back by technical selling in New York. COCOA
prices ended closer to the highs, but dealers said conditions were dull,
with total turnover amounting to only 2,117 lots (10 tonnes each).
