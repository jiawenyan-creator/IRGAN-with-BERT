FT  04 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Crest
It is obviously embarrassing that the London stock market is unlikely to
meet the original deadline of next January for introducing five-day rolling
settlement. Five-day settlement has become the international standard, while
some rival markets are moving towards a three-day system. Delay makes London
look unprofessional, reinforcing the impression created by last year's
Taurus fiasco.
Nevertheless, delay is better than disaster. The move to five-day settlement
is due to occur under the old paper-based system. Fast paper settlement may
be feasible but there is clearly a risk that back offices and registrars
could be swamped by paper mountains. It certainly makes sense to see how
10-day settlement, due to start in July, beds down before progressing. There
may even be a case for postponing fast settlement until Crest, the
electronic system that fills the role that Taurus should have filled, is up
and running.
Meanwhile, the stock exchange has been snubbed in its ambition to hold a 30
per cent stake of Crest. Its share will be no higher than that held by at
least 17 other financial institutions, if indeed it decides to take part at
all. The exchange may yet receive the consolation prize of operating Crest
under contract - a possibility held out yesterday by the Bank of England.
But, to win the contract, it will have to compete. Success cannot be
guaranteed.
