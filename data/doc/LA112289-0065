METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'MOON DIAL' ARTIST FAILS IN FINAL PLEA TO 
SAVE WORK 
In a final bid to keep his controversial "Moon Dial" sculpture on display in a 
park along Santa Monica Boulevard, artist George Herms asked the Beverly Hills 
City Council Tuesday night to reverse its order to remove the piece by Friday. 
"When I was invited to bring this piece to Beverly Hills, I didn't mean to 
bring in visual Muzak," he told the council. "This was an opportunity to bring 
some challenging art to Beverly Hills." 
City officials died not budge, however, sticking to their earlier order giving 
Herms until Friday to remove the assemblage of five rusty buoys and two old 
window grates. Otherwise, workmen will take it down at 1 p.m. Monday, store it 
and bill him, they said.
