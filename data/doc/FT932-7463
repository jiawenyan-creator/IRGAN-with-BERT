FT  24 MAY 93 / Uttar Pradesh governor removed
India's federal government yesterday removed the governor of Uttar Pradesh,
a key northern state where Hindu extremists demolished a mosque last
December, Reuter reports from Lucknow. Mr B. Satyanarain Reddy was replaced
by Mr Moti Lal Vohra, President Shankar Dayal Sharma's office announced.
Nearly 2,000 people were killed in riots after the mosque demolition.
Congress leaders of Uttar Pradesh have been demanding Mr Reddy's removal
since the razing of the mosque. They suspect him of loyalty to the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government which was ruling in the
state at that time.
