FOOD PARK PLANS IN GALLERIA WIN APPROVAL 
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday approved a $1.8-million renovation 
and expansion of the Glendale Galleria Food Park to expand eating areas and 
provide outside dining. 
The proposed new food service area will feature a colorful theme emphasizing 
California recreation and increase seating capacity by more than half, said 
Barbara Knight, acting redevelopment director. Present seating capacity is 350. 
A portion of the expansion will occupy space once held by Ohrbach's department 
store, which closed in July, 1987. Most of the space already has been converted 
into smaller shops. 
Agency approval is required for any renovation in the downtown redevelopment 
area exceeding $50,000, Knight said.
