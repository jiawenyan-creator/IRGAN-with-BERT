HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
ALEMANY UPSETS TAFT, 48-46, ON BURR'S 3-POINT BASKET AT BUZZER 
Junior guard William Burr made a three-point basket as time expired Friday 
night to give Alemany High a 48-46 upset win over Taft in the first round of 
the fifth annual Simi Valley tournament at Simi Valley High. 
Alemany, which did not lead until the final shot, battled back from a 40-32 
deficit at the beginning of the fourth quarter. 
With six seconds left and the Indians trailing, 46-43, Alemany's Greg Ryan made 
two free throws. Taft Coach Jim Woodard used a timeout to set up an inbounds 
play, but Irvin Scott's pass was intercepted by Alemany's Tim Fontenette, who 
was fouled with four seconds remaining. 
Fontenette missed the front end of the one-and-one but Ryan grabbed the rebound 
and called timeout with one second remaining. Alemany Coach Rocky Moore 
designed the last play to go to Fontenette, but the 6-6 forward was covered and 
Burr, standing 22 feet away from the basket, took the final shot. 
Burr scored a game-high 26 points including six three-point shots. Guard Casey 
Sheahan paced Taft with 15 points and forward James Yoakum added 12. PAUL OLSON
