LAX BUTTERFLIES, INGLEWOOD WALL 
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter is mentioned (Times, July 15) as 
offering a plan to turn 200 acres of the Los Angeles International Airport sand 
dunes into a nature preserve, thereby protecting the endangered El Segundo blue 
butterfly. 
On the same page it was revealed that Inglewood tentatively approved a 
five-block-long, eight-foot-high wall on West Boulevard along the Inglewood-Los 
Angeles border to protect itself from crime spilling into the neighborhoods 
from the Los Angeles side. 
It is noteworthy that this part of Los Angeles falls within Councilwoman 
Galanter's jurisdiction. 
For years, Inglewood and Los Angeles citizen groups tried to contact the 
councilwoman about this area and the dismal condition it is in. Just a few 
months ago, one of Inglewood's volunteer organizations had a meeting with one 
of the councilwoman's deputies regarding this location. Recently a group of Los 
Angeles-Florence area residents met with the same deputy, discussing the same 
subject. The results, as always, have (ranged) from lip service to nonexistent. 
While it is commendable to show concern about the environment, it also would be 
commendable to show compassion and actions for people and conditions in other 
parts of the councilwoman's district.
