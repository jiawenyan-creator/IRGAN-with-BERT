 

Therefore, EPA views the following measure as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM

10

 emissions reductions in Telluride: Colorado regulation entitled ``State Implementation Plan_Specific Regulations
for Local Elements, II. Telluride Nonattainment Area,'' which requires continued implementation of local programs
to control solid fuel burning devices, eliminate coal burning, and prohibit installation of additional solid fuel
burning devices. The RACM (including RACT) provisions in the SIP are described further in the TSD associated with
EPA's June 23, 1994 proposed rulemaking on this SIP.

A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including
available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented,
can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed rulemaking for the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area SIP (59 FR 32397). EPA has reviewed the state's documentation and concluded that it adequate justifies
the control measure to be implemented. The implementation of Colorado's PM

10

 nonattainment plan for Telluride will result in attainment of the PM

10

 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. EPA is approving the Telluride PM

10

 plan's control strategy as satisfying the RACM (including RACT) requirement.

EPA also finds that the State of Colorado's December 9, 1993 submittal of PM

10

 contingency measures for the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area meets the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. Specifically, section II.B. of the State
regulation entitled ``State Implementation Plan-Specific Regulations for Local Elements'' provides that, upon
the determination that the area has failed to attain the PM

10

 NAAQS or make reasonable further progress (RFP), the following will be implemented: (1) 0.30 miles of dirt roads within
the Town of Telluride will be chip-seal paved, and (2) either 2.0 miles of unpaved San Miguel County gravel roads at
the Ski Ranches Subdivision or 0.75 miles of private dirt roads at the Hillside/Gold King Subdivision (each within
the Telluride nonattainment area) will be chip-seal paved. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and regulation
and concluded that they adequately meet the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. By this action, EPA is approving
the PM

10

 contingency measures for the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area.

Finally, EPA announces a clarification to the Telluride moderate PM

10

 nonattainment area boundary, which is based on a legal description of the map outline of the area, as follows.

The Telluride nonattainment area begins at the intersection of Colorado State Highway 145 and the Telluride service
area boundary, as it existed in 1991. The western edge of the nonattainment area until it meets Remine Creek is defined
as follows:
