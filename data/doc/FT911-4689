FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel drops 87% and
sees no relief
DEPRESSED markets for pulp, paper and wood products brought an 87 per cent
drop in MacMillan Bloedel's first-quarter earnings and the company sees
little hope of improvement later in the year.
Net profit was CDollars 3.8m (USDollars 3.27m), compared with CDollars 30m
or 26 cents a common share in the first quarter of 1990 when the recession
was already biting into forest products companies' earnings.
Sales were CDollars 678m, against CDollars 781m.
After preferred dividends, there were no earnings attributable to the common
shares in the latest quarter.
Newsprint markets were weak and a price increase posted on January 1 failed
to hold. Advertising volume in the western US market has fallen drastically
this year. Pulp and containerboard prices continued to decline.
MacMillan said the brighter spots included offshore and speciality timber
markets and the Netherlands fine paper affiliate KNP made a good profit
contribution.
