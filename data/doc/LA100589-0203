BRIEFLY 
Stock Rise Puzzles Helionetics: Helionetics Inc., a small Irvine defense 
contractor, said it "did not understand" why the company's stock rose sharply 
in unusually heavy trading on Tuesday and Wednesday. More than 40,000 
Helionetics shares changed hands on both Tuesday and Wednesday, contrasted with 
an average daily volume of about 1,000 shares. The over-the-counter stock rose 
62.5 cents per share to $4.125 on Tuesday, then fell 12.5 cents to $4 on 
Wednesday, Helionetics said. Helionetics Chairman Charles W. Jobbins said a New 
York investment firm, Rosenkrantz, Lyons &amp; Ross, recently issued "a 
favorable research report on our company." He said the company has not issued 
any press releases that might explain the stock's recent activity.
