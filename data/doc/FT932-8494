FT  19 MAY 93 / Sri Lanka ruling party wins local polls
SRI LANKA'S ruling United National party has won the largest number of seats
in six of the seven provincial councils in Monday's elections.
In the prestige battle for the island's capital Colombo, however, it was
beaten by its traditional rival, the Sri Lanka Freedom party of Mrs Sirima
Bandaranaike, the former prime minister.
The SLFP led a newly formed left-wing coalition including the communists and
the socialists. No polls were held in the war-torn Tamil-dominated north and
east.
Mr Sirisena Cooray, the UNP general secretary who is also housing minister,
described the national outcome as 'a clear vindication' of the programme of
President Ranasinghe Premadasa, assassinated by a Tamil 'Tiger' suicide
bomber on May 1.
'Mr Premadasa's poverty alleviation programme and his new scheme to open 200
textile factories helped the rural poor and gave new hope to the village
youth,' he added. The murder also produced a wave of sympathy for the
populist president who spent most of his time in remote rural areas.
Another killing ten days earlier undoubtedly helped the Democratic United
National Front to make a spirited debut. Its leader, Mr Lalith
Athulathmudali, a former UNP minister, was gunned down when he was
addressing an election rally last month.
Mr Athulathmudali and two fellow ministers had been sacked from the
government after their attempt to impeach Mr Premadasa proved abortive.
