Preliminary Determination



We preliminarily determine that imports of furfuryl alcohol from Thailand are not being, nor are likely to be, sold
in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).
We have calculated a preliminary less than fair value margin of zero percent for Thai furfuryl alcohol sold in the United
States during the period of investigation. 



Case History 



Since the initiation of this investigation on June 20, 1994, (59 FR 32953, June 27, 1994), the following events have
occurred. 

On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
in this case (59 FR 38201, July 27, 1994). 

On July 19, 1994, officials of the Department of Commerce (the Department) visited the petitioner's facilities to
observe the furfuryl alcohol production process for purposes of developing the questionnaire. 

On August 3, 1994, we issued the antidumping questionnaire to Indo-Rama Chemicals (Thailand) Ltd. (IRCT), which
accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of
investigation (POI). In August 1994, the Department conducted a questionnaire presentation in Thailand. 

IRCT submitted responses to the relevant sections of the Department's questionnaire on September 6, 1994, and September
21, 1994. On September 16, and October 3, 1994, the petitioner submitted comments regarding deficiencies in IRCT's
questionnaire responses. A supplemental questionnaire was issued on October 6, 1994. On October 14, 1994, the respondent
submitted its response to this supplemental questionnaire. 

At the request of the petitioner, on October 18, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determination until
no later than December 9, 1994 (59 FR 53634, October 25, 1994). 

On October 14, 1994, the petitioner alleged that the respondent was selling furfuryl alcohol in the home market at
prices below the cost of production (COP). On November 21, 1994, based on the petitioner's allegation, the Department
initiated an investigation of sales below the COP (

see

 decision memorandum from Richard Moreland to Barbara Stafford dated November 21, 1994). The Department issued IRCT
Section D of our questionnaire on November 28, 1994. 

The respondent had originally submitted purchase price (PP) data in response to Section C of our questionnaire. However,
as more information was put on the record, it became unclear whether prices to the United States should have been reported
on a PP or an exporter's sales price (ESP) basis. Accordingly, on December 2, 1994, the Department requested that the
respondent submit ESP data. (On several occasions prior to December 2, we had suggested that respondent submit this
ESP data if respondent thought it was necessary (

see

 memo to file from Greg Thompson dated December 2, 1994).) On December 7, 1994, the respondent submitted the ESP data.
Based upon the information that is now on the record, we are treating IRCT's U.S. sales as ESP transactions. 



Scope of Investigation 



The product covered by this investigation is furfuryl alcohol (C

4

H

3

OCH

2

OH). furfuryl alcohol is a primary alcohol, and is colorless or pale yellow in appearance. It is used in the manufacture
of resins and as a wetting agent and solvent for coating resins, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and other soluble
dyes. 

The product subject to this investigation is classifiable under subheading 2932.13.00 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes,
our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. 



Period of Investigation 



The period of investigation (POI) is December 1, 1993, through May 31, 1994. 



Such or Similar Comparisons 



We have determined that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. IRCT reported that it sold merchandise in the home market identical to that sold in the United States.
Accordingly, no difference in merchandise information was reported in IRCT's sales listings. In accordance with
19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade. 



Fair Value Comparisons 



To determine whether sales by IRCT of furfuryl alcohol to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. 



United States Price 



For the purpose of this preliminary determination, we have found that all of IRCT's U.S. sales to the first unrelated
purchaser took place after importation into the United States. Therefore, we based USP on ESP prices, in accordance
with section 772(c) of the Act. 

We calculated IRCT's ESP sales based on FOB U.S. storage or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States.
In accordance with section 772(e) of the Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for the following movement charges:
foreign brokerage, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S.
inland freight. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for credit and warehousing expenses, and indirect selling
expenses incurred in the United States and in Thailand. Finally, we added duty drawback to the USP calculations in
accordance with section 772(d) of the Act. 

We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT)
decision in 

Federal-Mogul Corp.

 v. 

United States

, 834 F. Supp. 1991 (CIT 1993). (

See Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux
from France,

 59 FR 14136 (March 25, 1994).) 

In those cases where the respondent failed to provide information on a given expense, we relied upon the highest charge
listed in the U.S. database for that expense as the best information available (BIA), in accordance with section 776(c)
of the Act. In those cases where the respondent failed to provide any information on duty drawback, we made no addition
to USP as BIA.
