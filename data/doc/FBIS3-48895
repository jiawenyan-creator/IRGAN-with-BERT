  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 29 (ANTARA) -- In response to recent 
talks between President Suharto and Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic, Indonesia plans to post an RI [Republic of 
Indonesia] ambassador in Sarajevo, Bosnia, this year. 
  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told the press after 
inaugurating 
Syam Sumanagara as inspector general at the Foreign Ministry 
here over the weekend that the realization of the plan to open 
full diplomatic ties with Bosnia should be implemented soon. 
  "We are just waiting for a decision on who will be appointed 
Indonesian ambassador to Bosnia," he said, adding that Bosnia is 
also considering a reciprocal step. 
  The plan to open full diplomatic ties between Indonesia and 
Bosnia has been discussed by President Suharto and Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic, who visited Indonesia recently. 
  Alatas said that Indonesia will maintain its stance to 
support Bosnia on the issue of the lifting of arms embargo 
imposed by the United Nations to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He said that Indonesia also backs Bosnia's rejection to the 
idea or resolution of lands division in the region. [passage
