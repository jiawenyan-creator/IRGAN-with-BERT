FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bajaj Auto in cash call
Bajaj Auto, India's largest producer of motor scooters, has announced plans
for a Dollars 250m Euro-issue.
Part of the proceeds could be used to finance plans to produce low-cost
cars.
Mr Rahul Bajaj, chairman, said he hoped to begin by making 50,000 cars a
year, later increasing to 100,000.
Mr Bajaj did not say when the final decision on the scheme might be taken,
or who the potential foreign partners might be. However, the company is
unlikely to go into production before the end of the decade.
The announcement came as Bajaj Auto reported full-year net profits up
sharply to Rs1.46bn (Dollars 46.6m) from Rs520m, due to strong exports,
tight control on interest charges, and reduced provisions for depreciation.
Sales overall rose 28 per cent to Rs16.5bn.
