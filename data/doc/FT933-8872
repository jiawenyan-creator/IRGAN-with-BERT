FT  13 AUG 93 / Iraqi loans trial subpoena for Baker
MR JAMES BAKER, the former US secretary of state, yesterday became the
latest former Bush administration official to receive a subpoena to testify
in the forthcoming Iraqi loans trial, set to begin in Atlanta next month.
A subpoena was issued to Mr Baker and seven other state department officials
by lawyers for Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former manager of the Atlanta
branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
Mr Drogoul is accused of making more than Dollars 5bn of improper loans that
helped to finance Iraq's war machine.
Mr Drogoul, who was allowed to change his plea from guilty to innocent last
year after it emerged that the CIA had withheld vital documents from a
federal judge in Atlanta, has claimed that the Iraqi loans were part of a
covert policy approved by the Reagan and Bush administrations.
Those subpoenaed yesterday include Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the former
acting secretary of state; former US ambassadors to Baghdad Ms April Glaspie
and Mr David Newton; Mr Abraham Sofaer, the former state department legal
adviser; and Mr Richard Murphy, the former assistant secretary of state. Mr
Robert Simels, lawyer for Mr Drogoul, said Mr Baker and others would be
asked 'to further corroborate US awareness of BNL's role in the finance of
exports to Iraq'.
Mr Simels said he had been notified that the Justice Department had filed a
motion on behalf of former President George Bush to block the subpoena
issued last month calling for him to testify in court.
He added that government lawyers were also seeking to issue their own
subpoena, for notes and tapes of an interview conducted last year with Mr
Drogoul by CBS Television. CBS said yesterday it would not comment until it
had been formally served with the subpoena.
