FT  04 SEP 92 / ANC shuns resumption of talks
PROSPECTS for the resumption of talks between the African National Congress
and the South African government received a setback yesterday when the ANC
reaffirmed its two-month suspension of discussions on a new constitution and
called for popular protest to put pressure on Pretoria.
ANC leaders emerged from a three-day meeting of the organisation's national
executive committee to declare that resuming talks would be pointless until
the government took firmer action to halt township violence. 'Government
must take steps to prove that it is not just paying lip service to the
elimination of violence,' said Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general.
Earlier, the troika of European Community ministers met President FW de
Klerk in their efforts to break the negotiations deadlock. They were due to
leave South Africa last night after a two-day visit during which they met
leaders of the main South African political parties.
Negotiations over the past fortnight between Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Roelf
Meyer, minister of constitutional development, appear to have foundered over
the issue of violence, and the release of ANC political prisoners, both ANC
preconditions for the resumption of wider-ranging talks on a post-apartheid
constitution.
The two men are to continue discussing this, but it is unclear that the ANC
can bring much more pressure to bear on government to force further
concessions. After last month's week-long campaign of mass action, it is
unlikely the ANC can mount another sustained campaign. And while talks
remain deadlocked, business confidence will remain low as the country's
worst economic recession in memory continues.
