IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE'S OPENING SEASON FILLED WITH LOCAL GROUPS; 
CULTURE: THE NEW ARTS FACILITY BEING BUILT ON THE UCI CAMPUS SHOULD BE READY TO 
OPEN IN MID-OCTOBER. 
Ten local arts groups have been added to the roster of the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre, it was announced Tuesday, completing the projected programming 
schedule for the 1990-91 season. 
The $17.6-million facility, formerly called the Irvine Theatre, is under

The latest round of performance dates has been given to five dance companies, 
two drama troupes and three cultural organizations. 
The best-known is Ballet Pacifica, which is based in Laguna Beach and has 
appeared throughout Orange County. (Related story, F3.) It will present four 
ballets -- "Eight Lines," "Duetto," "Interior" and a new work still to be 
decided -- on April 12 and 13. A second program on May 31 and June 1 will 
feature "Graduation Ball" and "Les Femmes." 
The other dance companies are the Arpana Dance Co., which will stage a 
full-length production with about two dozen Asian Indian dancers (Nov. 23); the 
Irvine Ballet, which will present a holiday program (Dec. 14-16) and a 
children's production (March 1 and 2); the Irvine School of Dance (June 9), and 
the Irvine Academy of Performing Arts (June 20-22). 
The drama troupes scheduled for performances are the Irvine Civic Light Opera
