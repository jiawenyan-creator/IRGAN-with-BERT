  [Text] Odessa February 10 TASS -- A transport airliner 
carrying a group of servicemen from the Odessa Military District 
left the Ukrainian city of Nikolayev for Sarajevo on Thursday. 
They are to replace the fighters of the Ukrainian battalion who 
have already served their time in U.N. Peacekeeping Forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to Commander of the Odessa Military District 
Vladimir Shkidchenko, the current rotation is not a usual one, 
since a unit of Ukrainian volunteers will for the first time 
include eight women, largely surgical nurses. Earlier, 
Ukrainian servicemen had to seek for medical assistance in 
American and German hospitals and to pay for this in hard 
currency. 
  The Ukrainian parliament passed a decision to increase the 
numerical strength of the Ukrainian battalion in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina up to 1,220 fighters, the commander reported. 
Preparations for this have already got underway, including on 
the basis of the Nikolayev garrison's training centre.
