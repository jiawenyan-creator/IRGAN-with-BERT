CLARIFYING ROAD'S ROUTE 
I would like to add my two cents worth to all of the discussion about the Bob 
Hope land swap which would trade 59 acres of National Park Service land for 
5,700 acres of land for preservation of open space, parkland and recreational 
areas. I understand that this would provide access to Jordan Ranch for the 
development of a PGA golf course and 750 houses. 
I happen to know a lot about the plan. And I know enough to know that the road 
proposed through the 59 acres does not go through the middle of the park as 
some people who oppose the exchange and the project have erroneously stated. 
The proposal allows for a two-lane road, part of it tunneled, which would, for 
the most part, only be used by residents. The road does not run through the 
middle of the park, only along the edge that is already adjacent to 
development, thus preserving surrounding ecologically sensitive areas. 
At the present time, there is no public access to the park. There is only a 
temporary easement through land owned by Potomac Investment Associates, the 
developer proposing to develop Jordan Ranch. If the land swap were successful, 
there would be a new entrance owned and operated by the Park Service. 
The input of all parties, including the general public, is always a valuable 
part of the negotiations. When the final decision is made it is called a 
"deal." And there is nothing sinister about it. 
But, what would be a crying shame is that so-called "grass-roots activists" who 
oppose this proposal continue pushing to the point that it falls through and 
the public at large loses an opportunity of the ages. 
I presume that those same activists will want to take the credit if this "deal" 
does not go through. I hope they are equally prepared to take the blame if the 
open space is lost forever to the general public.
