PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FILTERING THROUGH COFFEE VS. CHOLESTEROL CONTROVERSY 
Question: When are the researchers going to make up their minds about coffee? 
First the commercials tell us that caffeine is bad because it makes you jumpy. 
Then the papers say filtered coffee is better because it won't raise 
cholesterol. 
Now I hear that decaf makes cholesterol go up. I won't give up coffee, but 
what's the safest way to drink it? 
A. The coffee and cholesterol controversy has been raging for years. At long 
last we are starting to get answers to some puzzling contradictions. 
Years ago Scandinavian scientists reported that coffee raised cholesterol 
levels, but U.S. investigators couldn't confirm the findings. Now there's an 
explanation. New research shows that the way the coffee is prepared may 
influence the results. 
Scandinavians generally boil the grounds, and coffee prepared that way raises 
cholesterol. Americans mostly make coffee with a paper filter, which appears to 
eliminate whatever component raises cholesterol. Unfortunately, decaffeinated 
coffee, even if filtered, may raise the bad LDL cholesterol level. Unless 
another study contradicts these findings, stick with regular filtered coffee. 
Q. I had to laugh when I read about all the interest in Bag Balm for dry skin. 
We have been using an udder product called Bova Cream for years. It is 
greaseless, odorless and doesn't stain. You can't get a better hand cream. 
A. We have been inundated by enthusiastic readers endorsing both Bag Balm and 
Bova Cream for dry, cracked skin. Several catalogues now carry Bag Balm, 
including Burpee and the Vermont Country Store. You can also order it directly 
from the Dairy Assn. Co., Lyndonville, Vt. 05851. Bova Cream is sold by 
agricultural co-ops across the country.
