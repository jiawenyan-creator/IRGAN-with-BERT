FT  26 JUN 92 / New Kabul strife looms
AFGHANISTAN appears set for a new power struggle with signs of renewed
tension between the country's interim President, Mr Sibghatollah Mojaddedi,
and his rival mujahideen leaders, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
Mr Mojaddedi is due to step down on Sunday under a two-month-old agreement
between mujahideen factions, and hand over power to another interim
government which would hold elections. However, he has made clear he wants
to stay on. 'I am not interested (in staying in power). But I cannot ignore
the people's will and expectations,' he said this week addressing supporters
in Kabul who asked him to stay in office.
Said one supporter: 'We will wage jihad (holy war) against anyone who
opposes him. We have enough power.'
The president's statement came only a day after an official spokesman
announced in Kabul that he would not step down on Sunday.
