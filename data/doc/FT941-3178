FT  17 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television
The charm of the original programmes about Fred Dibnah in the 1970s was that
we seemed to be looking at a survivor from a saner age: here was a man who
earned his living as a steeplejack, drove steam engines in his spare time,
and ran a paternalist family. Now, judging from the first in the new BBC2
series, Life With Fred, there are practically no mill chimneys left, and
Dibnah has been turned into some sort of 'new man' (8.00 BBC2).
If memory serves, The First Ever Minder should prove that the series was
originally intended to provide a niche for Dennis Waterman after he left
'The Sweeney", and that George Cole's character, though older, was
subordinate. 'Gunfight At The OK Launderette' has Waterman, as Terry, caught
up in a siege (8.30 ITV).
Dawn French's Murder Most Horrid has all the plot and action which Jennifer
Saunders' 'Absolutely Fabulous' so notably lacked. Perhaps they should form
a partnership: the French narrative with the Saunders dialogue could be a
winning combination. Today's story has French playing a housekeeper (9.00
BBC2).
