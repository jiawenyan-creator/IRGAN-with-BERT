FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Ukraine seeking trade reform
THE Ukrainian government yesterday moved to repeal export quotas and slash
export taxes in an attempt to boost falling trade revenues.
Foreign businessmen have been scathing about the system of export quotas and
taxes introduced in Ukraine at the start of the year. Many western
economists blame the arbitrarily administered and restrictive system for
this year's sharp drop in the country's exports outside the former Soviet
Union.
Government officials said the cabinet of ministers approved a decree
yesterday which promised to cut by 80 per cent taxes on the export of a
number of ferrous metals, cast iron, cement, chemicals and other
commodities. The decree also calls for the removal of export quotas on
several categories of goods.
If the decree is implemented it will bring the rules governing Ukrainian
exports outside the former Soviet Union closer into line with the more
liberal regulations on exports to other member countries of the Commonwealth
of Independent States.
Mr Serhii Teriokhin, deputy minister of the economy, said the attempt to
liberalise trade with countries beyond the former Soviet Union was aimed at
compensating for the republic's deteriorating economic relationship with
Russia.
Over the past year Russia has incrementally raised prices for the oil and
gas which it supplies to Ukraine. Experts estimate that Ukraine, which
traditionally received Russian fuel at a fraction of the world price, now
pays 70 per cent of world rates for the oil.
The government decree is likely to meet guarded approval by businesses,
still smarting from export restrictions imposed at the beginning of the
year.
