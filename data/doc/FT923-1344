FT  23 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
DERIVATIVES markets sensed early that the Bank of England would cut UK
lending rates yesterday and institutions continued to buy the stock index
futures, writes Terry Byland.
The December FT-SE contract closed about 10 points above the fair value
premium to the cash index, which allows for dividend flows and financing
costs and was re-estimated at about 42 after yesterday's rate cut. Business
in the December future declined to 11,862 contracts.
In later dealings, the contract extended its gain as sterling rallied
strongly against the D-Mark to the accompaniment of suggestions that some
form of ERM realignment was hatching in the currency arena.
Locals, or independent traders, played a less dominating role as the running
was taken up by institutions evidently seeking to position themselves ahead
of the gains expected in the underlying stocks. Nicholas Knight of Nomura
Research now expects the Footsie to reach 3,500 by December.
In traded options, business slipped to 43,383 from Monday's 44,058. The
FT-SE contract traded 13,604 against 19,998. The list of active contracts
was led by the Euro FT-SE with 3,058 deals.
