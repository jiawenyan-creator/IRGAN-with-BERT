FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Coal side losses hit Great Western
Higher unit production costs in the coal division resulted in increased
losses at Great Western Resources, the US-based energy company, in the six
months to March 31.
There was increased revenue in oil, gas and coal giving turnover of Dollars
71.6m (Pounds 48m), against Dollars 59.1m. Profits from the oil and gas
divisions were substantially higher, the company said, but pre-tax losses
were doubled at Dollars 4.08m (Dollars 2.03m).
The company added that new mining equipment had become available and the
rail network had returned to normal and coal division results should return
to expected levels.
The results were also affected by much higher exploration costs of Dollars
4.36m (Dollars 581,000).
Losses per share were 4 cents (2 cents).
