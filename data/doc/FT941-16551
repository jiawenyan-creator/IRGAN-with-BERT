FT  10 JAN 94 / Malaysian hard line on foreigners
Malaysia has launched a crackdown against an estimated 250,000 foreigners
who are working illegally in the country, writes Kieran Cooke from Kuala
Lumpur.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister, said the government would ban
recruitment of unskilled and semi-skilled foreign workers until the problem
of the illegal immigrants had been sorted out.
The rapid growth of Malaysia's economy in recent years has reduced the
unemployment rate to less than 3 per cent and led to serious labour
shortages in many sectors. The government says there are 1m foreign workers
 -one in eight of the labour force - in Malaysia.
Employers in the construction and plantation industries have expressed
concern that any wide-ranging moves against foreign workers would lead to
serious production shortfalls. On some plantations up to 80 per cent of
workers are foreigners, most of them Indonesian or Bangladeshi.
