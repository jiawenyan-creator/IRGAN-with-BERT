FT  17 SEP 93 / Border deaths defendants guilty
THE case billed as Germany's most spectacular trial since the Nuremberg
Tribunal wound up yesterday with three second-level East German officials
convicted for killings at the Cold War border to the west, agencies report
from Berlin.
But the cancer-stricken former communist leader, Mr Erich Honecker, 81, was
in Chilean exile and his security chief, Mr Erich Mielke, 85, was in a
prison hospital when the 10-month proceedings ended.
Former Prime Minister Willi Stoph, the third ailing member of the National
Defence Council who prosecutors said had ordered border guards to shoot to
kill, was living at home.
Of the remaining defendants, former Defence Minister Heinz Kessler was
sentenced to seven and a half years in jail, his deputy, Fritz Streletz, to
five and a half years and Suhl district Communist party leader Hans Albrecht
to four and a half years. Mr Kessler and Mr Streletz, who have spent 28
months in prison, were freed after the trial pending appeal. Mr Albrecht has
been free on account of poor health. All had denied any wrongdoing.
As in the 1945-46 Nuremberg trial of Nazis, the court judged the leaders of
a defunct state for human rights abuses according to a code that did not
exist when the alleged crimes were committed.
The trial opened after earlier manslaughter convictions for individual
border guards sparked off charges that authorities were punishing only the
'little fish'. Mr Honecker, whom the court released in January because of
his terminal liver cancer, was overthrown in 1989.
Prosecutors originally picked out 13 deaths from among hundreds of border
killings for manslaughter charges against the six original defendants. This
was later narrowed down to seven cases.
