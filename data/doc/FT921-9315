FT  12 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease as hopes of interest rate
cut recede
SHORT-DATED Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday after comments from Mr
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, dampened hopes of another
interest rate cut.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year govern-ment bond was up  1/16 at 102
7/16 , yielding 7.781 per cent, but the two-year note was markedly weaker,
down  5/32 at 99 3/4 , yielding 4.992 per cent.
Already unnerved by this week's planned auction of Dollars 36bn in new
government securities, market sentiment took another knock yesterday morning
when Mr Greenspan, addressing a conference of the Independent Bankers
Association of America, said that the 1 percentage point cut in the discount
rate in December should prove enough 'to turn the economy onto the path of
sustained recovery'.
Although the Fed chairman later reiterated his assertion that the
authorities were prepared to ease policy again should economic conditions
warrant it, his earlier comments were interpreted by market participants as
a hint that no further interest rate cuts were in the pipeline.
Since last Friday, when the January employment report showed a much larger
decline in civilian payrolls than analysts expected, the market has been
building its hopes that the Fed would sanction another easing of monetary
policy to assist the ailing economy. Yesterday's comments from Mr Greenspan
put a dent in those hopes.
The reduced likelihood of a policy ease was underlined just before noon when
the Fed intervened in the credit markets with a round of matched
sale-purchase agreements. The Fed's target for the rate remains at 4 per
cent, and yesterday's intervention was intended to pressurise the Fed funds
rate upwards from 3 7/8 per cent, where it has languished since Monday on
hopes of an interest rate cut.
Later in the session, sentiment received another knock when there was a
lacklustre response from investors to the afternoon auction of Dollars
15.02bn in three-year notes. Demand for the sale, the first part of the
three-leg Dollars 36bn refunding programme, was subdued, and the securities
eventually fetched an average yield of 5.54 per cent, below expectations.
The absence of retail buyers at the two-year note auction does not augur
well for the remaining two legs of the refunding, and analysts warned
yesterday that Treasury prices could suffer if tomorrow's sale of 10-year
notes and 30-year bonds runs into similar problems.
FAVOURABLE producer output figures and renewed hopes of a base rate cut
helped the UK government bond market to start the day on a firm note, but
prices drifted back during the day to close slightly lower.
British producer output price growth slowed in January, with output prices
rising 4.5 per cent year-on-year. Traders said the figures provide a
favourable backdrop for the gilt market, pointing to a fall in underlying
retail price inflation and adding to speculation about a cut in the base
rate.
Hopes of an interest rate cut pushed gilt prices higher on Monday and the
rise continued yesterday morning, allowing the Bank of England to sell some
of its new tap stock, the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012.
Traders estimated that between Pounds 300 and Pounds 500m of the Pounds
1.25bn issue was sold.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 98.01 and traded at around 97.26
by late afternoon on average volume. Traders said short-dated gilts closed
higher on the day, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 moving from 101 5/32
to 101 7/32 . The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 was unchanged
at 116 9/32 , yielding 9.33 per cent.
SPANISH government bonds rallied on expectations of lower inflation and a
possible cut in interest rates. The rally was mainly driven by domestic
buying although traders reported some foreign interest.
The January Consumer Prices Index due to be released tomorrow is now
expected to show a 1.5 per cent month-on-month rise rather than the 1.8-2.0
per cent month-on-month increase originally forecast.
The lower inflation forecast fuelled hopes of lower interest rates, given
the strength of the peseta. The 11.60 per cent bond due 1997 rose from
100.95 to 101.15, while the 11.30 per cent bond due 2002 rose from 102.55 to
a high of 102.95 before settling back to 102.85 by late afternoon.
LONG-DATED German government bonds edged up on worries about a shortage of
ten-year paper.
Traders said ten-year bond prices climbed on speculation over whether the
Bundesbank would be issuing much long-term paper before the summer.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 88.14, rose to a high of
88.31 before closing at 88.21.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
