  [Text] More than 754,000 tonnes of goods, valued at $538 
million have been exported during the first two months of the 
current year [year beginning 21 March]. Despite a reduction in 
weight compared with a similar period last year, the value of 
the exports shows an increase of over 4 percent. 
  The deputy for the Trade Ministry and the director general 
of 
the center for the expansion of exports, in an interview with 
correspondents today, also added: Non-oil exports last year 
[year beginning 21 March 1993] were valued at more than $3.8 
billion. It is forecast that in the current year that figure 
will rise to over $6 billion through increased state export 
capability. 
  Trade ministry deputy Mr Sa'idlu added: Current exports by 
the Islamic Republic of Iran to Islamic countries increased 
ten-fold compared with those before the revolution. Imports 
from those countries also rose from $380 million to $3.2 billion. 
  The director general of Iran's center for expansion of 
exports said: The Fifth Islamic Trade Fair will be held in 
Tehran beginning 25 Tir [16 July] with the participation of 
Islamic states and the cooperation of the Islamic Conference 
Organization for the purpose of expanding cooperation and the 
axis of unity, fraternity, and trade.
