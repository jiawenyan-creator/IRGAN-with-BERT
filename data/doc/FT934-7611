FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Salinas sees his big gamble vindicated -
Mexico
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas's huge gamble in embracing the North American Free
Trade Agreement more than three years ago has been vindicated by the
decision of the US House of Representatives to support the agreement, but
the costs of ratification have been higher than he could have ever have
imagined.
The agreement - still to be ratified by the US and Mexican Senate but
certain to be passed by both - is widely considered the most important
economic and foreign policy initiative taken by Mr Salinas in his five-year
administration, and possibly by any Mexican president in decades.
The pact formally reverses generations of Mexican nationalism, and would in
all likelihood lock in the pro-market economic reforms of the Salinas
government for the fore seeable future.
'It is a turning point for Mexico,' says Lorenzo Zambrano, the chief
executive of Cemex, the giant Mexican cement company. 'It guaran tees the
change from a closed protected economy to an open, competitive one.'
Other Mexicans see the treaty in almost metaphysical MEXICO terms. 'Nafta
buries the Mexican revolution,' says Mr Homero Aridjis, a poet and
ecologist. 'It is the end of an epoch and a new economic revolution will
start.'
The agreement's approval would come as a personal boon to the president, who
had staked much of his personal prestige on the treaty. It should also make
next year's presidential election easier for Mexico's ruling party, from
which Mr Salinas is prevented from standing.
Nafta's passage should also help Mexico in its quest to join the
Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation. Standard &amp; Poors,
the US rating agency, said that the agreement combined with conservative
economic policies could help Mexico earn investment grade status and revised
its outlook for Mexico from stable to positive.
