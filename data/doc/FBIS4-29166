  [Text] Vanuatu is calling for greater trade among South 
Pacific island countries to address economic problems raised by 
Australia in the launching of its policy statement on the South 
Pacific. 
  Speaking in Sydney yesterday, Australia's minister for 
Pacific island affairs, Gordon Bilney, warned the South Pacific 
that it must improve its economic performance to avoid a bleak 
future. Vanuatu's prime minister, Maxime Carlot Korman, says 
Australia has raised the issues at the right time: 
  [Begin Korman recording] I think the subject announced by 
Mr. 
Bilney is the subject of the day. It is so important and I 
think we can work together to find a solution and make the 
situation change in the level of economy. [end recording] 
  However, Mr. Carlot Korman said he does not believe the 
situation is as bad as Australia has suggested. In his address, 
Mr. Bilney said that unless the region faces its problem 
urgently the result could be urban slums, mass unemployment, and 
lawlessness.
