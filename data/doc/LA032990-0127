AVIATION BUFFS REVEL IN 'THE CORNER' VIEWS 
Antelope Valley aviation fans simply call it "the corner." 
On a good day they might see some of the newest and most secret aircraft in the 
world as they look east from Sierra Highway and Avenue N in Palmdale into the 
Air Force's Plant 42. 
Patrick Stebbens, 33, a dishwasher for a local hospital, says he's seen the B-2 
Stealth bomber, the B-1 and the SR-71 "Blackbird," which was retired from 
service recently. Stebbens said he tries to observe the Air Force base at least 
three times a week. 
Another regular, Bjorn Engstrom, 40, of Palmdale, said he likes to start his 
day at the corner, where up to 100 others might be taking in the sights. "Many 
times I stop out here at 7 a.m. with my coffee and newspaper," he said while 
pointing out the underside of an Air Force jet to his son, Erik, 9. 
"If I can, I'll stop by at lunchtime again and maybe a quick five or 10 minutes 
in the afternoon. It's kind of a hobby to just come by and watch the airplanes. 
There's been quite a few friendships built out on this corner," Engstrom said. 
Sitting in the cab of his truck, local resident John McWhirter is equipped with 
a chattering CB, a radio scanner spitting out aircraft call signs and a cooler 
filled with drinks. "We're all airplane buffs and it doesn't cost us anything," 
he said. 
Gary Larsen, 47, of Quartz Hill brought his son, Jason, 11, and daughter Gail, 
21, out for an afternoon of sun and airplane watching. "It's great to come out 
and watch what the planes do," Gail said. 
Mixed in with the regulars are first-timers such as Palmdale resident Joe 
Tyson, 31, who brought his wife, Andrea, and two children to see the show. 
"It's neat," he said with a grin. "I plan to come back." 
"I love to watch the airplanes," said Tom Engblom, 43, a Lancaster construction 
worker who has been a regular since 1987. DAVID LUSTIG
