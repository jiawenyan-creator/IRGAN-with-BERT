  [Text] Vladivostok February 15 TASS -- In conditions of 
acute power shortage, the administration of the Primorye 
territory, the Russian Far East, decided to consider the 
possibility of using reactors of nuclear submarines of the 
Pacific Fleet to generate electricity for Vladivostok power 
supply. 
  Technical and economic aspects of this unusual method of 
conversion of military facilities to civilian uses were 
discussed by representatives of the territorial administration, 
the Pacific Fleet and scientific circles at a conference here on 
Tuesday. Experts believe that the quality of Russian 
technologies with a guaranteed maintenance system will ensure 
complete radiational and ecological safety for the population. 
  The use of the energy potential of one submarine can meet 
the 
needs in heating and electricity of no less than 50 houses with 
many apartments.
