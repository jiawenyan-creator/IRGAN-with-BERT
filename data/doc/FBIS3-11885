  [Text] Through a document signed on 18 March by Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella and his Bolivian counterpart, Antonio 
Aranibar, shortly before Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada ended the visit he paid to Argentina at President Carlos 
Menem's invitation, Argentina and Bolivia agreed to partially 
deregulate the trade of hydrocarbons and their byproducts. 
  In addition, the chiefs of state asked their advisers to 
conduct a two-month study of an agreement authorizing the two 
countries' goods to freely cross their common border, without 
paying customs fees. These goods are to be used in competitive 
manufacturing plants in Bolivia, to be sold in the two 
countries' markets, and to be exported to third countries. 
  This is stated in the long joint declaration that should 
have 
been released on 17 March, but was only released the following 
day. 
  It is stated in the declaration that Bolivia will supply to 
Argentina gas under equal conditions as the gas that is produced 
here, and a binational commission will be created to study the 
situation of Bolivian immigrants. This commission will recommend 
urgent solutions to the problem. 
  It has been learned that Argentina will deem this commission 
a pilot experiment in solving the problems of foreigners 
immigrating from neighboring countries. 
  The agreement on oil establishes overall and reciprocal 
deregulation of import tariffs on crude oil and gas (from 
Bolivia) and oil byproducts (from Argentina) as mentioned in an 
attached list.
