FT  04 NOV 94 / Investors see little growth in forests
The first analysis of returns from direct investment in forests has
confirmed the old adage that money does not grow on trees.
In the past 16 years forests have delivered a return of only 4 per cent a
year, compared with 11.4 per cent from commercial property.
The study, commissioned by the Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain,
was by Investment Property Databank, which specialises in measuring the
performance of commercial property.
Once tax incentives are included the annualised return from forestry rises
to 7.1 per cent. Adjusting for inflation, however, the annualised pre-tax
return since 1977 is minus 2.8 per cent, compared with a real return of 4
per cent from commercial property and 11.4 per cent from equities.
IPD looked at the annual valuations of 126 privately owned forests in the
UK. It found forests in northern England and central Scotland tended to
perform best. Mature forests tended to outperform newly planted areas. As
plantations mature trees become the dominant element in the valuation.
The performance of older forests depends on timber prices, although there
appears to be a two-year lag between a change in timber prices and movement
in forestry values. This delayed response may reflect a market dominated by
private investors acting on scanty information.
On the positive side, the study found that forestry showed lower volatility
than any other institutional asset class, and its performance was largely
independent of bonds or equities. This suggests that forestry could be used
by investment institutions to reduce portfolio risk.
