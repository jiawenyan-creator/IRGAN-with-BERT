group
POHANG Iron and Steel (Posco), South Korea's leading steelmaker, and Myanmar
Metal Industries have agreed a joint venture to be set up in March following
a feasibility study.
The venture's plant in Myanmar will produce basic metal products, including
nails, bars and corrugated galvanised sheets. Posco will supply wire rods
and cold-rolled sheets to the plant as raw materials.
Myanmar is the third Asian country in which Posco has set up or expanded
production facilities this year, following larger ventures in China and
Vietnam. Posco wants to develop south-east Asia and China into its main
export markets. South Korean trade with Myanmar amounted to Dollars 27.7m
during the first nine months of 1992.
