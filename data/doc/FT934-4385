FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (4): Battered banks get tough on
lending - Corporate Finance
Gathered around a table at the Mikasa Chamber of Commerce, small business
owners in a small town in northern Japan described the pains of recession.
For them, the speculative era of the late 1980s meant a slight rise in
sales, but the following downturn is leaving more obvious scars.
Sales in local stores have fallen, components makers are being squeezed by
their larger customers, and banks are selective about new lending. An
example of the banks' new toughness, a Mikasa company owner explained, was
that they were wary of accepting low-priced local land as collateral and
many companies did not have much else to offer.
But Mikasa companies also have little immediate desire to expand shops or
factories because demand is in decline and there is no need for new
capacity. The corporate reluctance to invest and the banks' increased
emphasis on risk management - in the wake of reckless lending during the
speculative years - form a pattern seen throughout Japan.
Larger companies, which have more access to capital markets, soaked up the
cheap money available during the late 1980s when new issues were easily
digested on the Tokyo stock market. However, the cheapness of new finance
led to a weakening of discipline, and investments in new plant or in
diversification were made without enough concern for profitability, either
on the part of the company or its banks.
One result of that investment binge is a continuing decline in return on
equity for listed Japanese manufacturers, slipping from 8.3 per cent in 1989
to 3.1 per cent last year and an estimated 2.5 per cent or lower this year.
The binge also left Japan's banks with a large pile of non-performing loans
which they have only just begun to clear away.
At the end of March, the 11 leading commercial banks announced an average 70
per cent increase in loan loss reserves for the year, and wrote off Y72.8bn,
an increase of 478 per cent on a year earlier, but a small share of their
then official total of Y8,435bn in problem loans.
Smaller banks, such as the Shinkin, on the lowest rung of the banking
ladder, are under pressure, partly from rash lending in the past but also
because decline in regional areas has hurt their core customers. It is
expected that the average fall in their first-half banking profits will be
30 per cent, while lending increased by a record low of 3 per cent.
The difficulty in estimating the bubble era damage, and in reading
longer-term attitudes to fresh lending, is that the official problem loan
figure does not include the lending of financial affiliates, used by banks
for some of their more adventurous deals during the late 1980s. Banks also
do not calculate the burden of loans to troubled clients on which interest
rates have been delayed or shaved to almost zero as part of a restructuring
package.
Bad loans are likely to be a burden until late in the 1990s and, in the
meantime, Japanese companies will have to deal with banks which are changing
their lending policies. For example, a leading steelmaker said its main bank
had traditionally charged the same interest rate for all companies in the
group, but was now making a distinction, charging higher rates for group
members thought to be exposed to the property downturn.
The head of a publishing company in Tokyo complained that banks were willing
to assist larger customers, but had been unsympathetic in dealing with
smaller companies. The Bank of Japan has concerns about financial
institutions becoming too risk-averse and starving a recovery of funds,
although the bank tends to blame weak demand for the unusually low loan
growth this year.
Banks say they are more than willing to assist good quality customers but
the evidence is that new customers courted during the late 1980s, when
financial institutions expanded rapidly, are receiving less assistance than
the banks' traditional customers.
Ms Tomoko Fujii, economist at Salomon Brothers, said smaller Japanese
companies had sharply increased their borrowing this year from three public
institutions - the Japan Development Bank, the People's Finance Corporation
and the Small Business Finance Corporation - which received an increase in
funds as part of the government's attempts to stimulate growth.
Growth in loans outstanding at the three institutions was 13.7 per cent in
the year to July, compared to the meagre 4.2 per cent growth in the year to
September 1991. These institutions, which provide concessional rates, are
more favoured sources than commercial banks, slow to pass on the benefits of
the fall in official interest rates in the past year.
But Japan's leading life assurers, attempting to increase lending to
industry and reduce the share of securities in their portfolios, say the
demand for loans has been less than they expected. The largest eight life
companies are reported have experienced a 0.1 per cent fall in the ratio of
outstanding loans to total assets in the year to end March.
For much of the past year, Japanese banks were helped by the strength of
Tokyo stock prices, which increased their unrealised gains on securities
holdings. But the recent weakness in the Nikkei average has made the banks
more aware of their vulnerability and puts more pressure on their corporate
customers, also dependent on their equity portfolio as a buffer against the
bad times.
The change in the stock market's mood could prompt Japanese banks to be even
tougher, further undermining corporate confidence. Economic recovery could
hang on the balance between the demand for new loans and the willingness of
Japan's bruised banks to meet that demand.
