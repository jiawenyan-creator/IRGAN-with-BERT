  [Text] After listening to a report made on 8 June at a 
work meeting of the provincial governor and vice governors by a 
provincial people's government economic and trade delegation 
that had just returned from the United States, provincial 
Governor Zhang Wule emphatically called for further emancipating 
the mind, deepening reform, expanding opening up to the outside 
world, sponsoring more economic and trade fairs abroad, and 
paying more friendly visits to foreign countries and regions so 
as to invite more foreign investment. 
  In accordance with this year's provincial government work 
plan, the Gansu Provincial People's Government Economic and 
Trade Delegation headed by provincial Vice Governor Cui Zhenghua 
recently held "The 1994 Gansu Province Economic and Trade Fair" 
in Los Angeles. 
  After listening to the provincial delegation's report, 
Governor Zhang fully affirmed achievements scored by the 
delegation during its recent visit to the United States and 
hailed the province's trade fair in the United States as a 
complete success. He said: The trade fair has attained the 
desired results. Its success has once again attested to the 
fact that Gansu still has great potential to expanding and open 
up further to the outside world. Therefore, we should make more 
vigorous efforts to emancipate the mind and expand reform and 
opening up to the outside world in the years to come. So long 
as we do a good job in this regard, we will certainly be able to 
expand foreign trade and invite more foreign investment. To this 
end, we should make continued and redoubled efforts to explore 
new methods of deepening reform and expanding opening up to the 
outside world and engage in more foreign-related economic 
activities in the future.
