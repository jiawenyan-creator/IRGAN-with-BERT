ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
CANCER PATIENTS GIVEN FAKE CARE, POLICE SAY 
A local physician has been charged with giving bogus treatments to cancer 
patients, police said Tuesday. 
Dr. Glen C. Mahoney gave three cancer patients intravenous solutions of 
hydrogen peroxide, a common disinfectant that also is used to lighten hair 
color, Huntington Beach detectives said. 
Mahoney, 61, was charged with three counts of giving fraudulent treatment and a 
single count of insurance fraud. 
The charges were filed Oct. 11, but Peterson said police decided not to reveal 
the arrest until after the doctor's arraignment, which had been scheduled for 
Monday in Superior Court. The arraignment, however, was delayed until December. 
The filing of charges culminated a yearlong investigation that began when the 
family of an Irvine cancer patient called Huntington Beach police to complain 
about the treatments the doctor gave him. 
"He was given some treatments that involved IV (intravenous) solutions 
containing hydrogen peroxide," said police Sgt. Bill Peterson. 
That patient, Kenneth Sims, 39, died during the course of the investigation 
from complications arising from his cancer, Peterson said. Detectives twice 
searched the doctor's Main Street offices for medical records and have since 
found two women who were given the same treatment for cancer, Peterson said. 
Mahoney remains in business. Neither he nor his attorney could be reached for 
comment Tuesday. 
Hydrogen peroxide is sold in drug stores, but it is not commonly accepted as a 
cancer treatment. 
"The effect of giving hydrogen peroxide intravenously may well be the 
destruction of the red blood cells in the blood stream," said Dr. Steven 
Armatrout, professor of medicine at UC Irvine.
