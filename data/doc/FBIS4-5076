  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Political parties and 
representatives of many countries denounced the U.S. hostile 
policy toward Korea. 
  The national committee of the Workers' Party of Zaire in a 
statement on March 30 said that the situation of the Korean 
peninsula has become acute due to the provocative moves of the 
United States and vehemently denounced the bellicose U.S. 
administration's hostile policy toward Korea. 
  The statement demanded that the United States discontinue 
the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises as it promised to the 
DPRK and stop the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea 
and the United Nations keep aloof from the U.S. moves of 
aggression. 
  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ecuador in a 
statement on March 29 called upon the peaceloving people of the 
world to put a stop to the arrogant military action of the U.S. 
imperialists for deploying "Patriot" missiles in South Korea and 
igniting a new war and to extend firm solidarity with the Korean 
people's cause of justice. 
  A letter of protest was sent to the U.N. secretary general 
on 
March 28 by Guillermo Santiago, representative of the Dominican 
Communist Party; Camilo Gonzalez, representative of the Chilean 
Popular Unity Action Movement; Luis Agoes, representative of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party of Panama; Mauricio Castro, 
representative of the Salvadorian Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front; and Mauricio Santillana Oliva, representative 
of the Communist Party of Chile, who are resident in Cuba. 
  The letter demanded that the U.N. no more be used as an 
arena 
of bargaining among big powers and that the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula be resolved through DPRK-USA talks.
