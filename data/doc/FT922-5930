FT  28 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Body Shop
It might seem churlish, but the obvious conclusion from Body Shop's annual
results is that the group is no longer growing fast enough to justify the
aggressive rating of its shares. Pre-tax profits rose by more than a
quarter, but the admission that the UK market is three or four years away
from saturation was a timely reminder that mere size can be a hindrance to
spectacular performance.
Granted, there remains huge scope in the US, where the group's retailing
formula seems to work. But development there will take years, and plenty can
go wrong along the way. Even after their 16 per cent underperformance of the
market this year, the shares look ambitiously priced on a current year
multiple of 29. It will doubtless take more than ventures into wind farms
and corporate videos to stop the multiple gradually drifting back to more
realistic levels.
