REBEL BAND KILLS AMERICAN RANCHER 
Communist rebels killed an elderly American rancher on the central Philippine 
island of Masbate after he refused to pay "revolutionary taxes," officials 
said. 
The victim, Stewart Frank Raab, was the second American killed by Filipino 
rebels in a month and the fifth in the past year. Raab, 76, was seized Tuesday 
by about 30 New People's Army guerrillas at his ranch near Milagros, 240 miles 
southeast of Manila, a military spokesman said by telephone from Masbate. Raab, 
who was born in the Philippines when it was still an American colony, had been 
paying "revolutionary taxes" -- or protection money -- until the rebels 
increased the fee to $34,000 a year.
