  [Text] Pristina, 10 Feb (TANJUG) -- Borislav Prelevic, the 
vice president of the Party of Serbian Unity [Stranka Srpskog 
Jedinstva -- SSJ], said in Pristina today he demanded that 
Ibrahim Rugova, the president of the Democratic Alliance of 
Kosovo [Demokratski Savez Kosova -- DSK], be arrested in, as he 
put it, "his capacity as the leader of an enemy terrorist 
organization." 
  At a news conference, Prelevic said that Rugova and his 
aides 
were explicitly working on dismantling the Serbian state in this 
area. He also warned that they themselves would bring Rugova to 
court if official organs failed to arrest him. 
  Borislav Prelevic told the press about a recent meeting 
between Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, and SSJ President Zeljko Raznjatovic 
Arkan, saying that on an that occasion Arkan had been given a 
secret weapon. This is a solar and laser weapon tested in 
real-life conditions, called "Elipton," Prelevic explained. 
  According to Prelevic, Zhirinovskiy and Arkan signed a 
treaty 
on military cooperation that envisages, among other things, that 
in "the event of foreign aggression against any Serbian land 
dozens of thousands of Kozaks will come to their aid."
