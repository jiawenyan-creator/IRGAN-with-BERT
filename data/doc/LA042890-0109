TECHNICAL GLITCH SHUTS 5 N.Y. FUTURES MARKETS 
The five New York futures and options markets shut down early on Friday after a 
communications glitch prevented thousands of traders, brokers and investors 
from receiving price data. 
Action in the nation's major oil and metals trading pits came to a standstill 
when the exchanges discovered that no price quotes were leaving the building. 
Exchanges employees and participants said it was the first time in recent 
memory that the markets were closed because of a technical problem. Traders 
reported no panic and an orderly shutdown. Some players took an early weekend. 
Trading was halted at 11:20 a.m. at the New York Commodity Exchange, the 
nation's main metals market; the New York Mercantile Exchange, the main oil 
trading market; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the Cotton Exchange, and 
the New York Futures Exchange. 
The problem involved communication lines inside the exchange at the World Trade 
Center in lower Manhattan and prevented price quotations from being transferred 
from the trading floor to computer screens in the outside world. 
"The high-speed futures line is dead," Tom Crisalli, an operations employee 
with the Commodity Exchange Center, which oversees the five futures markets, 
said early Friday afternoon. 
Failing to resolve the problem, the exchanges shut down at 2 p.m. after giving 
traders a few minutes to settle pending deals. The regular closing times for 
most commodities run from 2:20 p.m. until around 3 p.m. The New York Stock 
Exchange composite index-futures contract continued to trade until its normal 
4:15 p.m. close. 
Employees said the system began transmitting data again at 2:49 p.m. Officials 
said the exchanges would reopen Monday. But the exact cause of the glitch 
remained unclear.
