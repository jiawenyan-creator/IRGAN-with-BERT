FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Caracas recovers 6.8%
Venezuela
Shares on the Caracas stock exchange climbed strongly after the central bank
said that it was to hold an auction of dollars in an attempt to ease
pressure on the bolivar.
The Merinvest composite index rose 6.8 per cent to 112.39, recovering all of
Monday's losses. Electricidad de Caracas put on 34.50 bolivars to 310
bolivars.
The currency has been under pressure since the resignation last week of the
central bank president, Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, over a disagreement with the
government regarding economic policy.
Analysts have maintained that the country's financial markets will remain
volatile until the central bank introduces measures designed to tackle
inflation and the budget deficit. The government and central bank tried to
calm the markets over the weekend with statements which ruled out immediate
currency controls or devaluation.

The stock market was easier in early trading after a rise in domestic
interest rates at the weekly auction. The IPC index was off 20.54 or 1 per
cent at 2,210.19 in volume of 7.6m shares. Brokers now see short-term
technical support at the 2,200 level.
Interest rates on benchmark 28-day treasury bills or Cetes were raised by 24
basis points to 16.49 per cent.
