Program Announcement and Proposed Funding Priorities for Cooperative Agreements for Area Health Education Centers
Program for Fiscal Year 1994 


The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications are now being accepted for
fiscal year 1994, Cooperative Agreements for the Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) Program under the authority
of section 746(a)(1), (previously section 781(a)(1), title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended
by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on
the proposed funding priorities stated below. 
Approximately $18.7 million will be available for this program in FY 1994. Total continuation support recommended
is $8.4 million. It is anticipated that $10.3 million will be available to support nine competing awards averaging
$1.14 million. 
The Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, makes the following amendments to this program.



(1) Period of Support 


The maximum period during which the AHEC programs may receive payments shall be 12 years, subject to annual approval
by the Secretary and the availability of appropriated funds. The maximum period during which an AHEC center developed
by a program may receive payments shall be 6 years. The provision for a 12-year maximum shall not be construed as establishing
a limitation on the number of awards under this authority that may be made to the school involved. 


(2) General Requirements 


As provided in section 746(b), a medical or osteopathic medical school may not receive an award for operational expenses
under the existing basic AHEC award authority unless the program: 
(a) Maintains preceptorship educational experiences for health science students; 
(b) Maintains community-based primary care residency programs or is affiliated with such programs; 
(c) Maintains continuing education programs for health professions or coordinates with such programs; 
(d) Maintains learning resource and dissemination systems for information identification and retrieval; 
(e) Has agreements with community-based organizations for the delivery of education and training in the health professions;

(f) Is involved in the training of health professionals (including nurses and allied health professionals), except
to the extent inconsistent with the law of the State in which the training is conducted; and 
(g) Carries out recruitment programs for the health science professions, or programs for health-career awareness,
among minority and other elementary or secondary students from the areas the program has determined to be medically
underserved; 


(3) Requirements for Participation of Other Health 
Professions Schools or Programs 


The former requirement that participating medical schools provide for the active participation of at least 2 schools
or programs of other health professions (including a school of dentistry if there is one affiliated with the medical
school's university) is modified to require also participation of a graduate program of mental health practice if
there is one affiliated with the university. 


(4) Requirement for Expenditure of at Least 75 Percent of Award in Centers 


The former requirement that at least 75 percent of the total funds provided to a school under any AHEC program authority
(basic AHEC programs, AHEC Special Initiatives or Model AHEC programs) be expended by the AHEC program in AHEC centers
has been amended, as provided in section 746(e)(1)(A) to require also that the school enter into an agreement with
each of such centers for purposes of specifying the allocation of the 75 percent of funds. 


(5) 

Alternative Matching Requirements for New AHEC Programs 
Developed Under Basic AHEC Authority 


As provided in section 746(e)(2), for an AHEC center developed as part of an AHEC program first funded under the basic
AHEC authority on or after October 13, 1992, the existing requirement that not more than 75 percent of total operating
funds be provided by the Federal Government (section 746(e)(1)(B)), is amended to establish a ceiling of 55 percent
of any fifth or sixth year of the development or operation of the center.
