Announcement of an Opportunity To Join a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement on Healthcare Information
Technology Architecture Standards (HITAS)

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to establish a healthcare information system. The infrastructure will
include application platform, application software, storage, human/computer interaction, and communication
technologies. It will share medical information while maintaining confidentiality of patient data.



Through the CRADA, called the ``Forum on Healthcare Information Technology Architecture Standards'', NIST will
provide the mechanism for industry and users to resolve standards-related technical issues that currently inhibit
deployment of medical information technology products. Parties interested in participating in the CRADA should
be prepared to invest adequate resources in the collaboration and be firmly committed to the goal of rapid development
and deployment of new healthcare information technology.

The program will be within the scope and confines of The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Public Law 99502,
15 U.S.C. 3710a), which provides federal laboratories including NIST, with the authority to enter into cooperative
research agreements with qualified parties. Under this law, NIST may contribute personnel, equipment and facilities_but
no funds_to the cooperative research program. Members will be expected to make a contribution to the forum's efforts
in the form of materials, equipment, personnel, and/or funds. The program is expected to last three years. This is
not a grant program.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Detailed planning for the consortium began on March 1, 1994. Interested parties should contact NIST to confirm their
interest at the address, telephone number or FAX number shown below no later than July 15, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a forum to
establish a healthcare information system infrastructure. Through the CRADA, NIST will provide a venue and process
for industry and users to resolve standards-related technical issues.




This project is based upon a shared, global vision of a large scale distributed healthcare information infrastructure
which will encompass application platform, application software, storage, human/computer interaction, and communication
technologies, integrated via object oriented middleware. The new infrastructure will share medical information
while maintaining the security and confidentiality of patient data.

The CRADA will also provide links among the user requirement-driven Open Systems Environment Implementors Workshop
(OIW), the consensus-driven base standards community, and the market-driven technical community to reduce time-to-market
for complex technical products requiring simultaneous consensus in a variety of technical areas.

International market input from the workshops and the standards community are crucial to meeting government and
industry objectives for common solutions across the global marketplace. Coordination with accredited U.S. and
international standards groups is an important aspect of this partnership.

Participants will be assured of the technical and economic feasibility of the resultant technical products. This
will accelerate acceptance of the specifications, promote rapid development of commercial products, and contribute
to earlier deployment of technology to meet user needs.
