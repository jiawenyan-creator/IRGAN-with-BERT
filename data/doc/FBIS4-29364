  [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Pretax profits of 95 firms 
listed on the over-the-counter (OTC) market climbed 16.2 percent 
in fiscal 1993 over a year earlier for the first rise in three 
years, a private think tank reported Friday [17 June]. 
  The Daiwa Institute of Research, affiliated with Daiwa 
Securities Co., predicted a 15.8 percent rise in the same firms' 
profits for the current fiscal year ending next March 31. 
  The think tank said the effects of restructuring measures 
will be quickly reflected in their business results because 
corporations listed on the OTC market are relatively small in 
scale. 
  The listed firms also consist mainly of processing and 
service industry firms, whose recovery was quicker than that of 
the materials, construction and electric companies which are 
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
  The institute said improvement of their financial balances 
also contributed to profit growth. 
  The combined deficit in their financial balances dropped 
19.3 
percent to 33.8 billion yen in fiscal 1993. 
  It said the OTC firms moved to raise funds through new stock 
issues and convertible bonds by decreasing borrowings from banks.
