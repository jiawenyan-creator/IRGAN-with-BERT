DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS AT LOS ANGELES ZOO 
While reading "Clean Up Act, L.A. Zoo Told" (Part B, Sept. 13), I experienced 
deja vu. I truly thought I was seeing another article about a slumlord. 
The animals at the zoo are unable to complain. They, as "tenants," have had 
their rights violated. We have taken them out of their natural environments and 
caged them for our enjoyment. We have entrusted their care to Warren Thomas, 
zoo director, who should have been aware when these slovenly conditions started 
to appear and should never have let them continue. Instead, he is passing the 
buck by blaming "middle-level employees for failing to inform him" of the 
problems. Everyone is to blame. 
Some slumlords have had fines imposed on them and were sentenced to live in the 
hovels they allowed their tenants to exist in. Perhaps Thomas, besides paying 
the fines, should reside for at least a week in one of the, and I quote the 
Humane Society, "deplorably barren and sadly outdated compounds." His meals 
should be some of the food that was stored improperly.
