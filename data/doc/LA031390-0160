NATION; 
BULLETS HIT ANOTHER GREYHOUND 
The chairman of strike-crippled Greyhound visited hospitalized passengers, 
offered a $25,000 reward for information on a sniper and rode a bus to prove it 
safe, but early today more bullets hit a Greyhound bus in Chicago. 
No injuries were reported in today's shooting on Interstate 57 on Chicago's 
South Side. A company spokesman said it was the seventh such incident since a 
drivers' strike began March 2. 
Greyhound executive Fred G. Currey crisscrossed Florida on Monday, seeking to 
calm fears about bus travel after a sniper's bullet Sunday hit a Greyhound bus 
operated by a replacement driver in Jacksonville, Fla., injuring eight 
passengers.
