FT  19 FEB 93 / Campaign to save Bart's facilities
THE Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, yesterday
decided to campaign to retain St Bartholomew's hospital's 24-hour accident
and emergency facilities.
A meeting of the Court of Common Council, the equivalent of a meeting of the
full council in a London borough, expressed the 'gravest misgivings' at
Tuesday's announcement on London healthcare by Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
health secretary, which has put the future of Bart's in doubt. Mrs Joyce
Nash, chair of the corporation's health and social services committee, said
the City would risk damage if the proposals made it seem less attractive as
a financial centre.
Bart's managers have decided to enter discussions on a merger with the Royal
London hospital. That was opposed yesterday by the Bart's Patients' Campaign
which has been fighting to save the hospital.
