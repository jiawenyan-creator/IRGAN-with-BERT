 Method 24A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used to determine the VOC content and density of publication rotogravure
printing inks and related coatings. 


(3)

 The following ASTM methods and practices are the analytical procedures for determining VOC: 


(i)

 ASTM D147585: Standard Test Method for Density of Paint, Varnish, Lacquer and Related Products. This test
method is incorporated by reference in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(ii)

 ASTM D236987: Standard Test Method for Volatile Content of a Coating. This test method is incorporated by reference
in paragraph (c) of this section. The following minor modifications should be used for multicomponent coatings.
All components of the coating are to be weighed in the proper proportion into the analysis container and mixed together
just prior to analysis and the mixture is allowed to stand for at least one hour but no more than 24 hours prior to being
oven dried at 110 degrees celsius for one hour. 


(iii)

 ASTM D379286: Standard Test Method for Water Content of Water-Reducible Paints by Direct Injection into a
Gas Chromatograph. This test method is incorporated by reference in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(iv)

 ASTM D401781 (1987): Standard Test Method for Water Content in Paints and Paint Materials by the Karl Fischer
Method. This test method is incorporated by reference in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(v)

 ASTM D445785: Standard Test Method for Determination of Dichloromethane and 1,1,1-Trichloroethane in Paints
and Coatings by Direct Injection into a Gas Chromatograph. (The procedure delineated above can be used to develop
protocols for any compounds specifically exempted from the definition of VOC.) This test method is incorporated
by reference in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(vi)

 ASTM D269786: Standard Test Method for Volume Non-volatile Matter in Clear or Pigmented Coatings. This test
method is incorporated by reference in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(vii)

 ASTM E18085: Standard Practice for Determining the Precision Data of ASTM Methods for Analysis and Testing
of Industrial Chemicals. This practice is incorporated by reference in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(4)

 Use of an adaptation to any of the analytical methods specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(B) (

1

), (

2

), and (

3

) of this section may be approved by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient
documentation for the Administrator to find that the analytical methods specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(B) (

1

), (

2

), and (

3

) of this section will yield inaccurate results and that the proposed adaptation is appropriate. 
(C) 

Calculations.

 Calculations for determining the VOC content, water content, and the content of any compounds which are specifically
exempted from the definition of VOC of coatings, inks, and fountain solutions as applied shall follow the guidance
provided in the following documents. 


(1)

 ``A Guide for Surface Coating Calculation'' EPA340/186016 (which is available from the National
Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) 


(2)

 ``Procedures for Certifying Quantity of Volatile Organic Compounds Emitted by Paint, Ink and Other Coatings'' (revised
June 1986) EPA450/384019 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services,
5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) 


(3)

 ``A Guide for Graphic Arts Calculations'' August 1988 EPA340/188003 (which is available from
the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161) 
(ii) 

Automobile or Light-Duty Truck Test Protocol.

 The protocol for testing, including determining the transfer efficiency, of coating applicators at topcoat coating
operations at an automobile assembly facility shall follow the procedure in: ``Protocol for Determining the Daily
Volatile Organic Compound Emission Rate of Automobile and Light-Duty Truck Topcoat Operations'' December 1988
EPA450/388018 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285
Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161). 
(iii) 

Capture System Efficiency Test Protocols.
