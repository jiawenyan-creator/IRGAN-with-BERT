Alternate I.

 As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

(f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict
of interest certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for
work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest certification
for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor
has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest, but no additional
conflict of interest certifications are required. 
Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the contractor shall search its records accumulated,
at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document.
In the COI certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all
actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the Contracting Officer or that to
the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist.
In addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating
to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of
interest to the Contractor. The certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor recognizes its
continuing obligation to identify and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance
of this work assignment or other work related to this site. 


Alternate II.

 As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

(f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict
of interest certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for
work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest certification
for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor
has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest, but no additional
conflict of interest certifications are required. 
Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the contractor shall initially search through all of
its available records to identify any actual or potential conflicts of interest. During the first three years of this
contract, the contractor shall search through all records created since the beginning of the contract plus the records
of the contractor prior to the award of the contract until a minimum of three years of records are accumulated. Once
three years of records have accumulated, prior to certifying, the contractor shall search its records accumulated,
at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document.
In the certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all actual
or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the Contracting Officer or that to the best
of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist. In
addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating
to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of
interest to the Contractor. The certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor recognizes its
continuing obligation to identify and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance
of this work assignment or other work related to this site.
