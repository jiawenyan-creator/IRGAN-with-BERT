  [Text] The Russian Federation's Acting Finance Minister 
Sergey Dubinin described the latest economic edicts issued by 
the Russian president as a timely step aimed at establishing 
order in the financial sphere. He said these edicts were 
drafted by the Finance Ministry in conjunction with other 
bodies, including the Russian Central Bank, the State Tax 
Service, and the Economics Ministry. 
  Sergey Dubinin believes that the presidential decrees will 
help solve a whole range of problems to do with the revenue part 
of the state budget, in particular through the better collection 
of taxes. Implementation of these documents will make it 
possible to step up, at least in part, the solution of the 
problem of nonpayments. In addition, the edicts are targeted at 
improving financial discipline in general.
