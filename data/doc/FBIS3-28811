  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 11 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas has said that Russian president Boris Yeltsin has sent a 
letter applying for a NAM [Nonaligned Movement] guest member to 
the NAM chairman, President Suharto. 
  "I inform you that Yeltsin has sent an official letter 
requiring a status as NAM guest member," Alatas told a press 
conference here Thursday. 
  According to Alatas, the application letter will 
procedurally 
be delivered to the Coordination Bureau of NAM in New York, the 
U.S. for discussion. The minister also expressed confidence 
that the Russian wish would be accepted. 
  Meanwhile, chairman of the NAM Executive Board Nana Sutresna 
pointed out that the presence of the Russian application letter 
indicated an appreciation to the Indonesian leadership. 
  "Such an appreciation does not only come from NAM member 
countries but also from non-NAM mamber nations due to 
Indonesia's consistence in implementing decisions made at the 
NAM summit in Jakarta last year," Sutresna added. 
  NAM's guest members included Austria, Australia, New 
Zealand, 
Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany. As a NAM guest member, 
according to Sutresna, a country cannot take part in debates and 
is not involved in drafting decisions. However, a NAM guest 
member country has the advantage of getting information on the 
South nations' stance and considerations from the first hand, he 
said.
