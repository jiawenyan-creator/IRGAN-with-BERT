  [Text] Units from the Somali armed forces today peacefully 
demonstrated in the streets of Mogadishu. These armed forces 
started their march near the former port of Mogadishu and they 
were composed of various sections of the country's armed forces, 
with each unit led by an officer. They gathered at the UN 
office in Mogadishu. The Voice of the People radio reporters 
who are the source of this item add that the officers leading 
the armed forces have handed a statement of complaint to the UN 
office in Mogadishu. They made it clear that the armed forces of 
Somalia are ready to save the people from these difficult times, 
as has always been their tradition. 
  One officer called Colonel Shabib Shaykh Ali Muhiyadin Asr, 
told Ilm Osman Farah, alias Elmi Boderi, our reporter, that the 
Somali armed forces will once again rescue their people as they 
did in the 1963 drainage campaign, in the defense of 
independence in 1964 and in the rescue of the people during the 
famine of 1974. 
  The officer called on the political organizations in the 
country to unite and arrive at a consensus to facilitate the 
establishment of a Somali nation living according to Islamic 
shariah. 
  The demonstration, which ended peacefully, was zealously led 
by the musical band of the armed forces, who played the national 
anthem. Many people crowded the streets, shouting slogans 
including: "Somalia belongs to Somalis," "Victory to the Somali 
armed forces," "The Somali people should unite," and so on.
