FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Etam calls truce with Oceana
ETAM, the fashion retailer, yesterday declared a truce with its erstwhile
foe and largest shareholder, Oceana Investment, by appointing to its board
two directors from the South African held group.
Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the appointment of Mr Stanley Lewis
and his son Michael as non-executive directors would give Etam the stability
it needed to concentrate on its business. 'It allows us to focus on the
bottom line and not be looking over our shoulders,' Mr Miles said.
Oceana is the vehicle for the South African Lewis family, which owns a 50
per cent share in one of the country's leading fashion retailers, Foschini,
and 36.25 per cent of Etam. Oceana failed in its hostile Pounds 121m bid to
take over Etam two years ago and in efforts to get board representation.
Mr Miles said Etam had dropped its resistance to board appointments after it
became clear that Oceana backed the current strategy. 'It was a realisation
that they are not short-term players and that they have decided to support
the management,' Mr Miles said.
The new directors will form part of the 14-strong Etam board. Oceana intends
to continue adding 1 per cent a year to its Etam holding, as allowed by
takeover rules.
