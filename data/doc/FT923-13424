FT  14 JUL 92 / Observer: Bad chemistry
Ken Schofield and Mike Marshall, two of the better known personalities in
Britain's chemical industry, have one thing in common. They both made a lot
of money selling their chemical companies and ending up as boss of the
company that bought them out. However, the similarities end there.
Yesterday Ellis &amp; Everard turfed 48-year-old Marshall out of his chair and
recalled a 64-year-old member of one of the founding families, Simon
Everard, who had been doing the job for eight years until 1990.
Ellis &amp; Everard is going through a rough patch but is not in as dicey a
position as Hickson was when Schofield took the helm. Perhaps that's part of
the problem, since Schofield saved Hickson and is now working his magic on
MTM. Marshall has had less time to prove himself.
Nevertheless, it's a bit of a surprise that Marshall has been shown the
door, especially since he owns five times as many shares as the rest of the
board put together. It all seems a bit odd since it was Everard who anointed
Marshall as his own successor.
