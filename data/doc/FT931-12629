FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Jewellers seek equity infusion
PEOPLES JEWELLERS, Canada's biggest jewellery chain which is in bankruptcy
protection, is seeking an outside equity infusion as part of its general
restructuring programme.
Peoples, controlled by the Gerstein family of Toronto, had to write off its
CDollars 133m (Dollars 104m) investment in Zale of the US at the end of 1992
and reported a heavy loss. Zale has been operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
The restructuring plan has a deadline of February 26, under an agreement
with its principal secured creditor, the Bank of Novia Scotia.
