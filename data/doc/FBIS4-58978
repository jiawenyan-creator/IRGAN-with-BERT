  [Text] Head of government Mokdad Sifi has given an 
exclusive interview to today's LE PARISIEN, in which he has 
reiterated Algeria's hope in all its sons. 
  Concerning the security situation, the head of government 
has 
reaffirmed that the security forces are in control of all 
regions, despite an increase in provocative acts at times. He 
asserted that anything else is merely propaganda and biased 
interpretations. 
  The head of government has stressed Algeria's respect for 
human rights and pointed out that instructions had been given to 
the security forces to avoid the pitfall of abuses. 
  Replying to a question regarding what Algeria was expecting 
from France, Sifi said: Everything of concern to Algeria should 
be of concern to France. It is in the interest of France to 
help Algeria, because our country's problems, if not checked, 
will have repercussions in the Arab Maghreb and France. Once 
the situation stabilizes, Algeria will be one of the biggest 
markets for France and Europe. 
  Concerning the Algerian expatriate community in France, the 
head of the government said it is possible for such a 
community--it is its duty--to play an important role. Our 
citizens should play a role in the management of the country, he 
added. 
  As far as the political issues in the country are concerned, 
Sifi has affirmed that dialogue is continuing with Algerians, 
who jealously support the unity of the people and the homeland. 
His government has no right, however, to choose a political 
model for the society. Hence, it is not right for any political 
minority to impose its will upon others, he added.
