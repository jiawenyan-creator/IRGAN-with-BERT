FT  04 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices
Demand for pepper has increased in the wake of the attractive prices quoted
for almost all black and white grades, reports Man-producten. The weaker US
dollar and the soft undertone of the market makes prices in European
currencies extremely cheap. Indonesian white pepper is offered at Dollars
1,175 a tonne cif and black pepper grade 1 from various origins at Dollars
900 cif. Sarawak's new crop is being harvested; the Indonesian and Brazilian
crops are to be expected soon.
