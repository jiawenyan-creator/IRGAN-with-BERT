FT  24 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities calmer after slight
bonds recovery
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were little changed at the end of trading yesterday after
the European currency crisis, domestic polit-ical and economic concerns and
apprehension about third-quarter earnings had kept investor demand for
stocks dampened, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Tuesday's losses were linked to heavy declines in the bond market, where
concern about inflation had sparked a substantial sell-off. The fact that
bond prices were slightly better yesterday therefore helped to calm equity
markets.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off just 2.16 at 3,278.69,
having spent most of the day a few points below Tuesday's close. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.30 to 417.44, while the American SE
composite was down 1.08 at 379.91 and the Nasdaq composite 0.04 easier at
582.96. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 205.4m shares.
The background to trading, however, remained troubling. Renewed pressure on
the French franc, in spite of a jump in French interest rates, confirmed
that the European currency crisis was not over. Some analysts hope that
turmoil overseas will persuade international investors to buy US assets for
safety, but so far there has been little evidence of foreign investors
rushing into US stocks or bonds.
The domestic fundamentals, meanwhile, remain mixed, and investors are
awaiting the third-quarter reporting season with some trepidation. They are
particularly fearful that, because of slower than expected economic growth
during the summer, companies will soon be warning that their earnings will
fail to match expectations.
A case in point yesterday was Black &amp; Decker, which tumbled Dollars 3 1/8 ,
or 16 per cent, to Dollars 16 1/8 in turnover of 2.7m shares after the
company warned that net income for the third quarter would be in the range
of the meagre Dollars 12m it earned in the second quarter.
Another profits warning came from Fleming Companies, the shares declining
Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 1/4 after the wholesale food group said its earnings
would be about Dollars 3.10 a share for 1992, and not between Dollars 3.20
and Dollars 3.30 a share as originally estimated.
General Motors remained in the doghouse, falling a further Dollars 1 to
Dollars 32 on volume of 4.4m shares as more and more auto analysts drop the
stock from their recommended lists. GM's weakness spread to Chrysler, which
lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 22 3/8 , but Ford resisted the selling and edged
Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 40 1/4 .
Alexander's advanced Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 27 after announcing that it
had agreed to sell six store properties to Bradlees in a deal worth about
Dollars 82m. Bradlees was down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 13.
On the Nasdaq market, Video Lottery plummeted Dollars 10 to Dollars 14 on
turnover of 3.3m shares following news that the Gaming Commission in the
state of Victoria in Australia had voted to remove the company from its list
of approved manufacturers.
Canada
THE TORONTO market closed mixed but at its best point of the day as worries
about the weak Canadian dollar continued to plague equities. The currency
lost a further  1/2 cent against its US counterpart, making its fall so far
this week more than three cents.
The TSE 300 index finished a slight 1.6 up at 3,404.4, but falls led rises
by 308 to 262 after volume of 31m shares.
Stelco 'A' fell 30 cents to CDollars 2.55. The United Steelworkers union
said Stelco plans to lay off about 630 union workers and 150 management and
staff by the end of November.
