FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: CRA satisfied with 70% stake in
Cail
CRA, the Australian resources group, had acquired 70 per cent of Coal and
Allied (Cail), Australia's third-largest coal producer, when its bid of
ADollars 11.50 (USDollars 8.27) a share closed yesterday.
The group said it was 'very satisfied with the outcome of this offer',
although its hopes of acquiring 100 per cent of Cail fell when Ube
Industries of Japan, the second-largest shareholder, said it would not sell
its 11 per cent holding.
CRA, which first tried to take control of Cail two years ago, is the largest
coal producer in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales.
