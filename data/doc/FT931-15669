FT  12 JAN 93 / Installations at 30,000 a week: FT Satellite Monitor
NEW installations of satellite dishes last month ran at more than 30,000 a
week for the first three weeks, Continental Research said yesterday.
The monthly FT Satellite Monitor produced by Continental shows a total of
120,000 new sales and rentals of satellite dishes during December.
However, there was a large drop from nearly 250,000 householders in November
who said they would definitely install satellite television to 68,000 last
month, although 1.89m householders said they probably would.
Continental Research, which has interviewed more than 4,000 adults every
month for nearly four years, believes 2.596m homes have satellite dishes.
This figure - which does not include homes receiving satellite channels by
communal aerials or cable television - shows little overall growth. This is
because Continental has this month removed 120,000 from the total to reflect
the fact that the satellite which served the defunct British Satellite
Broadcasting was switched off last month.
Continental believes the total of those receiving satellite channels by any
means is 3.098m.
Barb, which produces the official television ratings in the UK, believes
that on January 1 there were a total of 2.297m homes with satellite dishes
in the UK, 299,000 fewer than Continental estimates.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a substantial stake in BSkyB, the
largest satellite broadcaster in the UK.
