METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : WOMAN IN BARRY CASE PLEADS NO CONTEST 
The woman who helped the FBI arrest Washington Mayor Marion Barry on a 
crack-cocaine charge pleaded no contest Friday to a charge of driving under the 
influence of alcohol and was sentenced to three years' probation. 
Hazel Diane Moore, 38, who also uses the name Rasheeda Moore, was not present 
in Van Nuys Municipal Court when her attorney entered the plea. 
A second count of driving under the influence was dropped. 
Court Commissioner Mitchell Block fined Moore $927 and ordered her to enroll in 
a court-approved alcohol education program. The commissioner also restricted 
her from driving anywhere but to and from work. Moore was arrested by Los 
Angeles police on New Year's Day in North Hollywood for driving with a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.12%, substantially above the new legal limit of 0.08%. 
Moore, a former model, lives in Burbank.
