FT  31 MAR 94 / Lilley issues rightwing warning
One of the four rightwing cabinet ministers who argued against the
compromise deal over European Union voting rights last night warned Mr John
Major not to turn his back on the Thatcherite ideas that underpinned Tory
success in the 1980s.
In a defiantly upbeat speech, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security
secretary, predicted that Conservative ideas that dominated the economic
debate in the 1980s were set similarly to dominate European policy in this
decade.
But, delivering the first Spectator lecture, he said that this agenda needed
to be developed 'with vigour and conviction'.
He urged the party to do more to 'debunk the fallacies' of European
supranationalism.
Mr Lilley called on the party to 'emphasise the positive side of our own
vision of Europe'.
Self-government was 'a good thing, not a bad thing'. Voluntary co-operation
was 'much better than subordination'. Free markets were 'better agents of
change, harmonisation and solidarity within the Community than are central
directives, transfers and programmes'.
He added: 'Ideas of choice and competition, less government rather than
more, self-reliance rather than dependency, still ring true with most
people's experience and chime with their values.'
He said Conservatives were united in favour of a 'co-operative,
decentralised Europe'.
Mr Lilley said that the real divide on Europe was not within the Tory party.
Instead, he claimed that the commitment to a free market was now in the
centre ground of British politics and that it would become 'the centre
ground of European politics as the decade proceeds'.
The biggest difference was between the Conservatives on the one hand, and
Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the other, the latter being
'increasingly committed to submerging Britain in a super-state'.
