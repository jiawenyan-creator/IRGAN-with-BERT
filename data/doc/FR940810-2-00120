voting requirement with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account. The Application
states that pass-through voting privileges will be provided with respect to all variable contractowners so long
as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable contractowners.
Rules 6e2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from the pass-through
voting requirement with respect to several significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding
imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder are observed. 

5. Rules 6e2(b)(15) and 6e3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act give the Participating Insurance Companies
the right to disregard voting instructions of contract holders. Rules 6e2(b)(15)(iii)(A) 6e3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(

1

) each provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contractowners with respect
to the investments of an underlying fund, or any contract between a fund and its investment adviser, when required
to do so by an insurance regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A)
of Rules 6e2 and 6e3(T) under the 1940 Act). Rules 6e2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(

2

) each provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instructions of contractowners if the contractowners
initiate any change in the underlying investment company's investment policies, principal underwriter, or any
investment adviser (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii), (b)(7)(ii)(B), and (b)(7)(ii)(C) of Rules
6e2 and 6e3(T) under the 1940 Act). Applicants represent that these rights do not raise any issues different
from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts. Under Rules 6e2(b)(15)
and 6e3(T)(b)(15), an insurer can disregard contractowner voting instructions only with respect to certain
specified items. Applicants also note that the potential for disagreement among Participating Separate Accounts
is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e2 and 6e3(T) that the participating insurance company's disregard
of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations.
