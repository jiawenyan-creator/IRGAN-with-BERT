FT  14 JAN 94 / Kohl pledges 'special role' for Germany
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, speaking in the Bundestag, yesterday pledged a
special role for Germany, because of its geography and its history, in
seeking to integrate both Russia and the rest of eastern Europe into the
institutions of western Europe, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
He recognised the security concerns of the east European democracies, and
equally, the fears in Russia of being isolated or fenced in by hostile
forces. 'We must not create new divisions, and thus create new tensions in
Europe,' he said.
