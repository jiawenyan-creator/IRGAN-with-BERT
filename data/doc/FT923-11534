FT  24 JUL 92 / Observer: Castro de luxe
The Spanish hosts of the Ibero-American summit are testing the visiting
heads of state with a punishing Madrid-style entertainments schedule.
Starting dinner last night at 10pm, the leaders were then scheduled to head
for a concert which started at 15 minutes after midnight.
Earlier in the evening, the schedule had appeared threatened by the blind
octogenarian president of the Dominican Republic, Joaquin Balaguer, whose
half-hour speech to the opening session overshot the seven minutes allowed
by a considerable margin. This looked like taking the spotlight from the
Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who everybody also feared would also make an
extended speech.
Castro, who on his first visit to the United Nations in New York, moved into
a hotel in Harlem and regularly ordered out for fried chicken, is allowing
himself a little more luxury these days. Along with other leaders, the
bearded president is holed up in the Ritz, which by no stretch of the
imagination is a proletarian hotel.
