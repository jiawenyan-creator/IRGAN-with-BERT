ON THE SIDELINES; 
HARVARD STRENGTHENS REGATTA LEAD 
Harvard University boosted its stature as the favorite in the Ladies Challenge 
Plate at the Henley Regatta by reaching the semifinals with a hard-fought 
one-length win today. 
The Harvard heavyweight eight held off a tenacious English crew, Notts County 
B. For most of the race the distance between the boats fluctuated between half 
a length and three-quarters of a length. 
Harvard also reached the semifinals of the Britannia Cup for coxed fours, but 
rather more comfortably. It took an early lead against the Lea Rowing Club B, 
another English crew, and steadily increased this to 3 1/3 lengths by the 
finish. 
The University of Pennsylvania reached the quarterfinals of the Thames Cup, for 
eights, and the quarter-finals of the Visitors Cup, for coxless fours.
