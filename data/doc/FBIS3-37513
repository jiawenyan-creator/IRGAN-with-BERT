  [Text] Berlin, 17 Feb -- The press center of the Western 
Group of Forces [WGF] has denied rumors appearing in the German 
press to the effect that, after the Russian troops withdraw, 
some of the ammunition belonging to them may remain in Germany. 
  Citing information from the Mixed Russian-German Commission, 
the WGF press center said today that, over the past three years, 
580,400 tonnes of ammunition belonging to the WGF has been 
removed from German territory, and a further 81,040 tonnes were 
used up during that time during military training. As of 1 
January this year, 15,560tonnes of ammunition remains in the 
possession of the WGF, which tallies with the envisaged plan. 
  Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, co-chairman of the Russian 
section of the Mixed Commission and WGF commander in chief, 
assured the German side back in mid-January that, by the time 
the troop withdrawal is complete, the remaining ammunition would 
be fully removed from German territory. 
  The WGF press center also rejected speculation over the 
norms 
for the expenditure of ammunition on military training. Each 
army has its own military training methods, so that comparing 
ammunition expenditure norms for these purposes in different 
armies would be inappropriate. 
  In the current treaties, the intensity and military training 
methods of the Russian troops who are still on German territory 
are not under discussion. They are exclusively an internal 
matter for the WGF command, a press center announcement says.
