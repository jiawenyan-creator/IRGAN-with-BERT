  [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- The Slovak Foreign 
Ministry "believes NATO's military intervention will contribute 
to ending confrontation between the hostile sides in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina," a ministry declaration obtained by CTK today reads. 
  The communique states the NATO strike "will lead to the 
resumption of political negotiations under the auspices of 
international organizations." 
  NATO fighters attacked Bosnian Serb positions on Monday [11 
April] afternoon in an attempt to prevent a Serb advance on the 
Bosnian town of Gorazde, a UN designated "safe haven." The 
strike came less than 24 hours after Sunday's strike against 
Bosnian Serbian positions. 
  The ministry's communique expresses concern at the 
escalation 
of the conflict in Bosnia just as new hopes for peace had 
emerged after the end of the siege of Sarajevo. 
  The air strikes demonstrated that the "international 
community is prepared to use even these means to prevent the 
further suffering of the civilian population" in Gorazde, the 
communique reads.
