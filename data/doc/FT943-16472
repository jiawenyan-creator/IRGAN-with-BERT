FT  04 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Mannesmann faces shareholder
grilling - Other Companies
Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest industrial companies, is likely to face
some testing questions from shareholders on Friday concerning Mr Werner
Dieter, the chief executive who is being investigated by the state
prosecutor for 'activities likely to harm the company.' Mr Dieter allegedly
obliged Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary, to buy hydraulic machinery at
inflated prices from Hydac, a company largely owned by his family. The state
prosecutor in Dusseldorf last week opened an investigation and Mannesmann,
which reported a 1993 turnover of DM28bn (Dollars 17.1bn), has commissioned
KPMG, the auditors, to conduct a separate enquiry. There are growing doubts
that the 64-year-old Mr Dieter, chief executive since 1985, will now be
elected chairman of the supervisory board as planned. Mr Dieter has
described the charges as 'laughable' and said they were leaked by the
company to wreck his election to the supervisory board.
