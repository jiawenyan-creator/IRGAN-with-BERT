I. Installment Payments for Women and Minority-Owned Businesses



2. In the 

Third Memorandum Opinion and Order,

 we adopted certain provisions to ensure the opportunity for businesses owned by women and minorities and small businesses
to participate in the regional narrowband PCS auction to be held October 26, 1994. Specifically, we adopted a 40 percent
bidding credit for women and minority-owned firms and installment payments for small businesses. Small businesses
are defined as businesses with less than $40 million in annual gross revenues. On further reflection, we believe that
to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS, minority and women-owned
companies, as opposed to just small businesses, should be allowed to pay their winning bids in installments.

3. As we noted in the 

Third Memorandum Opinion and Order,

 the original provisions adopted for designated entities in the narrowband PCS service were based on assumed relatively
low capital entry costs. The experience in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction in July led us to adjust the designated
entity provisions for the regional auction to take into account the much higher than expected prices paid for narrowband
licenses. Specifically, we raised the bidding credit from 25 percent to 40 percent for women and minority-owned businesses
and we raised the financial thresholds for businesses wishing to qualify as small businesses. We remain concerned,
however, that, given these high costs, businesses owned by women and minorities will be unable to participate successfully
in the upcoming regional auction without installment payments.
