CAMPBELL OUTSTRIPS COUNTY'S LEGISLATORS IN SPEAKING FEES 
Private groups paid Sen. William Campbell $46,900 to speak to them in 1988, 
more than his taxpayer-paid salary and five times the amount received by any 
other lawmaker representing Orange County, according to his annual statement of 
economic interests. 
Campbell, a Republican who represents a stretch of the county from Brea to 
Laguna Niguel, ranked behind only Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) among 
lawmakers whose annual financial disclosures were filed Wednesday with the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
Campbell, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, also reported 
receiving gifts valued at $5,534 and more than $10,000 in income to his spouse 
from a consulting firm that has produced Campbell's annual conference on women. 
State legislators are paid $40,816 a year, plus $88 per day in living expenses 
while the Legislature is in session. In 1988, lawmakers could receive unlimited 
gifts and speech-making fees but starting Jan. 1 were limited to $1,000 a year 
from each source. 
Spoke to 30 Groups 
Campbell spoke for money to 30 groups in 1988, receiving amounts as low as 
$150, from the United Domestic Workers of America, and as high as $5,000, from 
Friends of Lubavitch Inc. of New Orleans. His largest gift was a $3,140 trip in 
April funded by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. 
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) finished a distant second to Campbell among 
Orange County lawmakers, collecting $8,400 for nine speeches. Among others, 
Seymour received money from the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health 
Systems, the California Medical Assn. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. His largest 
fee was $2,500 from the California Assn. of Realtors, a group for which Seymour 
once served as president. 
But Seymour's fees in 1988 were less than what he earned in 1987 and not even 
half of the amount he received in 1986. He attributed the drop to his lower 
profile since losing his post as chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus in 
May, 1987. 
"I don't think it has anything to do with John Seymour," he said. "If you can 
get the leader or a leader of any organization to speak, somehow that carries 
greater credibility than a member of the rank and file." 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) led the delegation in the value of gifts 
received with $18,017. More than $15,000 of that amount came in legal and 
accounting services from Santa Ana lawyer Lisa K. Hughes and from accountant 
Bruce Hughes. 
Allen Wednesday said the fees were in connection with her divorce last year 
after 21 years of marriage. 
"I paid some of it, and we negotiated the last part of it," Allen said. "She 
(Lisa Hughes) is a good Republican and wanted to do it for me. Part of it she 
just wrote off." 
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) received gifts valued at $14,954 in 
1988. Much of her total came in two privately funded trips to New Zealand and 
Egypt. 
Trip to Egypt 
Bergeson's $4,041 trip to New Zealand was financed by a consortium of 
industrial companies, including Atlantic Richfield, Chevron and Dow Chemical 
Co. While she was abroad, officials from Southern California Edison and 
Southern California Gas paid for some of Bergeson's meals. 
Bergeson said the South Pacific trip focused on alternative energy sources, 
particularly geothermal energy and liquid natural gas, which she said is used 
extensively in the country's automobiles. 
The Egyptian trip, on which Bergeson was accompanied by her husband, Garth, was 
sponsored by the government of Egypt at a cost of $3,000. In addition, the 
California Optometric Assn. and the California Retailers Assn. picked up the 
tab for a $66 dinner the couple had in Egypt. 
Bergeson said the trip to Africa was part of Egypt's effort to increase foreign 
investment in that country. 
Bergeson was also paid $200 for a speech she never gave. The meeting she was 
scheduled to address was canceled, but the engineering company that sponsored 
the meeting, Guyer Santin Inc., paid her anyway for her "consideration in 
agreeing to speak." 
"I had a speech all prepared and then they called and canceled the meeting," 
Bergeson said. "They said they would have it later, but it never came about." 
At the low end of the scale, Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who 
took office Dec. 5, reported receiving no gifts or speech-making fees. 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), the only member of the delegation who has 
a personal policy against speaking for money, also reported no fees. 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who usually does not accept 
honorariums for speeches, said he decided to take a $1,000 payment from 
Farmers' Insurance Co. in 1988 and then use the money to reimburse his district 
office staff for the cost of their parking at luncheons and other local 
functions they attend. 
"I don't want to get into that thing where I'm selling myself as a politician 
to speak places," he said.
