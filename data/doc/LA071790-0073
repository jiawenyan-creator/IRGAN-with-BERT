VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO; 
RESIDENTS REDUCE USE OF WATER 11% 
Camarillo residents cut water consumption by 11% during May and June, but 
overall water use rose 5% in the 1989 fiscal year that ended June 30. 
Residents began to use less water after the City Council adopted a conservation 
ordinance in April that makes it illegal to hose down sidewalks or wash 
automobiles with hoses that do not contain automatic shut-off valves. 
The ordinance also prohibits lawn watering between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
During May and June, the Camarillo Water Department pumped 489 million gallons 
of water, compared to 538 million gallons during the same time last year, 
producing a savings of 49 million gallons, Elwell said. 
"This shows that people are very aware of the water shortage and have begun to 
reduce wasteful practices," said John Elwell, city director of community 
services. 
Since the ordinance was adopted, the city has issued 282 citations. Of those, 
four were to second-time offenders, who were fined 50% of their most recent 
water bills, Elwell said. The remaining 278 citations were warning notices. 
To encourage people to save even more water, the council has decided to bill 
customers monthly and introduce a tiered pricing system. 
Starting Oct. 1, customers who reduce water use by 10% will notice no change in 
their monthly rate, said Anita Bingham, city finance director. Those who use 
more than the average 11,968 gallons a month will pay more depending on how 
much water they use, she said. 
The average water bill, which is sent every two months, is $34.40, Elwell said.
