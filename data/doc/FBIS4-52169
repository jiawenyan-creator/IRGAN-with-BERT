  [Text] The prime minister has said as far as the Singapore 
Government is concerned, the Michael Fay case is closed. Mr. 
Goh Chok Tong said the decision has been taken, Fay has been 
caned, the matter will be left behind us. He believed 
Singapore-U.S. relations are robust enough to withstand whatever 
action the U.S. may take against Singapore. 
  Mr. Goh said the reaction of Singaporeans was not 
unexpected. 
He noted it was a rebuff attitude because Singaporeans believe 
in caning as a deterrent. He was responding to questions raised 
by reporters at the istana [palace] garden party this evening.
