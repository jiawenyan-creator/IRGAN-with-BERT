FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: MAI looks set on Intrum Justitia as holding
is increased to 17.4%
MAI, the financial services and media company headed by Labour peer Lord
Hollick, appears to have set its sights on Intrum Justitia, Europe's largest
debt collection agency, as its next takeover target.
MAI announced yesterday that it had increased its holding in the
Dutch-based, but UK quoted, company by 1.3 per cent to 17.4 per cent.
Intrum's shares were steady yesterday at 88p. The market has been
speculating for some time on MAI's intentions towards Intrum.
However, any bid attempt would have to receive the backing of Mr Bo
Goranson, Intrum's chief executive, who owns more than 30 per cent of the
group.
Earlier this month, Intrum announced a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 16m. Net borrowings were reported at Pounds 16.6m, for gearing of
27 per cent.
Mr Goranson has said that the group, which has been acquisitive in recent
years, now intended to consolidate. Half of its sales are generated in
Scandinavia, while the UK provides some 29 per cent of turnover.
MAI recently announced a 12 per cent advance in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 33.9m.
