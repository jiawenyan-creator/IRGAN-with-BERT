FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: A sure way to end speculation
Sir, After the recent pointless speculative run on the franc, can there
really be any doubt that the markets are not capable of rational judgment?
It is one thing to topple the currency of the UK, deep in recession and with
a decimated industrial base, but quite another to turn on the franc. France
boasts a healthy set of fundamentals.
Against the spirit of the ERM it may be, but one is tempted to applaud the
Spanish central bank's decision to limit currency movements in order to end
speculation. Perhaps in this way European monetary policy can be determined
by rational beings, rather than by a mob of barrow boys.
