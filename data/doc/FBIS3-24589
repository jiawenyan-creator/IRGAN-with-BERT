  [Abstract] This article describes an algorithm to calculate 
corrections for sea bottom relief. The main problems to be 
solved in developing this type of algorithm are automating the 
construction of a digital model of the sea bottom, and 
simplifying and speeding up calculations of the effects of 
elementary bodies (approximated by a layer of water). The 
article presents a new approach to solving these problems. 
Points at which the depth of the sea is known are arranged in an 
irregular grid, and depths are calculated in a regular grid 
within that portion of the survey area. Two interpolation 
methods are described. The collection method is described. It is 
used to calculate the gravitational effect of rock beneath the 
sea. The algorithm has been implemented in the software of an 
automated system to process on-board gravimagnetic measurements. 
Product testing is described Results of its use are presented. 
The algorithm is used to study Bouguer anomalies. Figures 2;
