FT  02 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
INTEREST IN the London derivatives markets was very thin on New Year's Eve
but stock index futures continued to hold a good premium against the cash
market, writes Terry Byland.
Traders said optimism for economic recovery in the new year remained solid,
encouraged by favourable comments from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor
of the exchequer, and from the British business community.
At the close of the half-day trading session, the March contract on the
FT-SE Index showed a premium of 20 against the cash market - a premium of
about eight above fair value, the calculation which allows for dividend and
financing flows on the underlying blue chip stocks.
Earlier, the future ran to a premium of 30 against cash, but both
institutional and independent traders were unwilling to chase the future any
higher ahead of the holiday weekend. Trading volume was a mere 1,688
contracts.
In traded options, similar holiday factors prevailed. Business dropped to
8,691 lots from Wednesday's 21,718, with the FT-SE contract trading only
2,767, against a previous 8,801. The active stocks list was headed by BP
(805 contracts), and US regulatory moves encouraged Glaxo (521) and Fisons
(445). BTR, on 771 lots, also attracted interest.
