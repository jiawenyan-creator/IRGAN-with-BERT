FT  16 JUN 92 / Observer: Chile sauce
Journalists are not the only craftsmen sharpening knives ahead of the US
presidential election. Chilean woodcarvers are also hoping to make their
mark with thousands of six-inch-tall Dan Quayle dolls.
The dolls are a version of the 'Randy Indian', a souvenir which tickled the
veep's fancy when he visited Chile three years ago. His purchase of the
saucy memento - which give a whole new meaning to the term 'pop-up' - got
more mileage in the US press than the rest of his Latin American tour.
'I am getting several orders from delegates to the Democratic convention,'
says Steve Anderson, a US businessman living in Chile. 'But I think they
will also be popular among Republican delegates in the Pat Buchanan camp.'
Despite recent allegations about the Democratic front-runner's past,
Anderson has no intention of marketing a Bill Clinton version; he is working
for Clinton.
