FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hall warns of Pounds 4.2m provisions for
Stadco
Hall Engineering (Holdings), the automotive engineering, steel products and
stockholding group, announced a larger than expected restructuring of Stadco
Automation, its automotive pressings and production systems business, which
will require provisions of Pounds 4.2m.
Hall's shares fell 13p to 150p and analysts said they expected pre-tax
profits for the year to be reduced from an estimated Pounds 5m to about
Pounds 800,000. However, the company said it hoped to maintain the final
dividend at 3.02p, which will be paid from reserves.
The move comes less than two months since Mr John Sword took over as
managing director.
Mr Alastair Smith, finance director, said Stadco had suffered from a lack of
new orders because of strong competition and a slowdown of car sales in
Europe. He said the restructuring would involve 125 redundancies, or half
the division's workforce, along with a write-down of certain assets, mainly
plant and equipment.
The estimated cash cost of the restructuring is Pounds 3.1m, including the
cost of redundancies, pension top-ups and provisions on current contracts
with Audi which have suffered delays.
The group issued a profit warning in May in anticipation of restructuring
costs of about Pounds 500,000 at Stadco and because of competitive pressure
across all its divisions. Interim pre-tax profits were later reported down
from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 2.01m.
