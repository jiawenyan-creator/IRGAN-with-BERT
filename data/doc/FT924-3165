FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Cuts help raise Siebe by 6.8%
COST-CUTTING helped Siebe, the UK-based international engineering systems
and controls group, increase interim pre-tax profits in spite of lower
sales.
Turnover fell by 6.8 per cent to Pounds 757.3m in the six months to
September 30, but the pre-tax profits were 6.8 per cent higher at Pounds
80.3m (Pounds 75.2m).
Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman, said there were glimmers of recovery in the US
 -particularly in consumer-related goods - but this would be partly offset
by signs of a slowdown in Germany and Japan.
The group had achieved higher margins by better cash management, tight
control of working capital and staff reductions, mainly in the US.
A total of 1,200 jobs were shed during the six months, bringing the group's
total workforce down to 31,000, compared with 38,000 three years ago.
More than 90 per cent of Siebe's sales go outside the UK, with the US
accounting for about 45 per cent. Had these results been translated at last
year's exchange rates, the sales figure would have been Pounds 30.9m higher
and the pre-tax profits figure up Pounds 2.7m.
Siebe welcomed the recent devaluation of sterling and said it was likely to
reverse the first half's adverse translation effect, assuming that the pound
stayed at its present level.
Mr Stephens said the group had completed the integration of Foxboro, the US
industrial controls group which it bought for Dollars 650m in 1990, and was
now on the look-out for further acquisition opportunities.
Net cash flow was Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 36.3m) and net indebtedness was
Pounds 490m, giving gearing of 68.7 per cent, compared with 88.4 per cent
last year. The group said it was on target to reduce the gearing figure to
the mid-50s by next year.
Mr Stephens said the group spent the equivalent of 4.1 per cent of sales on
research and development, of which it capitalised Pounds 14m during the
half-year.
Siebe's tax rate was 41.9 per cent (41.4 per cent). It included a write-off
of Pounds 700,000 on unrelieved advance corporation tax, down from Pounds 2m
thanks to increased repatriation of royalties.
Earnings per share rose by 5.4 per cent to 11.7p (11.1p) and the dividend is
increased by 10 per cent to 3.3275p (3.025p).
