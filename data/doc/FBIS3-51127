  [Text] Luanda, 13 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina arrived today in this capital for a two-day 
official visit during which he and the Angolan authorities will 
discuss future relations between their two countries. 
  On his arrival in Luanda from Ghana, the site of the first 
stopover in his first African tour, Robaina was greeted by 
Angolan Foreign Minister Venacio da Moura, who will be his main 
host here. 
  Other important local government leaders and Cuban 
Ambassador 
to Angola Reinaldo Calviac [name as received] were also present 
at the welcome ceremony. 
  According to an official source, the Cuban foreign minister 
will be received by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. 
He will also meet with Prime Minister Marcelino Moco as well as 
with Franca Van Dunem, president of the Angolan Parliament. 
  Robaina is also scheduled to meet with the Cuban community 
in 
Angola, approximately 300 persons, and he will be making other 
contacts. 
  During an exclusive interview granted to PRENSA LATINA this 
week, da Moura said that Robaina's visit will contribute to 
maintaining the same historic level of excellent ties, 
friendship, and cooperation that exist between the two states. 
  He added that his visit will also serve to keep the torch of 
solidarity burning that the Cuban people lighted when Cuban 
blood was spilled alongside that of the Angolan people in 
defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of this 
country. 
  At the conclusion of his stay in Luanda, Robaina will travel 
to Harare, Zimbabwe, the third stop in his tour, which also 
includes Namibia and Zambia.
