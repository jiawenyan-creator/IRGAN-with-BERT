  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Bophuthatswana President 
Lucas Mangope announced on Friday [11 March] he would recommend 
to a special sitting of the Bophuthatswana Parliament on Tuesday 
next week that the homeland participate in the April elections. 
In the statement issued by the President's Office he said he had 
disclosed this in advance because of the urgency and gravity of 
the current political situation, "and in the hope that this 
would make a positive contribution to resolving tension and 
uncertainty in the region". 
  He said the North-Western Christian Democratic Party had 
been 
registered with the Independent Electoral Committee which he 
intended to "vigorously lead in the elections to demonstrate 
where the sympathies of the people of the North-West Province 
lie". 
  Mr Mangope said this announcement should "de-legitimise" all 
reason for strikes and other actions because it addressed the 
major concerns that have been raised. He voiced his support for 
continuing mediation on outstanding constitutional issues and 
would participate in negotiations to that end.
