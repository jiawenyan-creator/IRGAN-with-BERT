FT  23 MAR 93 / Volvo bus plant opens in Scotland
VOLVO, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, yesterday started
production at its Pounds 6.5m bus chassis assembly plant at Irvine,
Ayrshire, Kevin Done writes.
The operation, which runs alongside Volvo's existing truck assembly plant at
Irvine, has a capacity to build 1,500 bus chassis a year.
The start of production marks the completion of Volvo's rationalisation of
its bus operations in the UK. These have been drastically reduced since
Volvo's Pounds 24m takeover of Leyland Bus in 1988.
Mr Bjorn Larsson, president of Volvo Bus, said the UK bus operations had
cost Volvo nearly Pounds 100m - which includes the acquisition price and
five years of losses. As part of the restructuring, Volvo has transferred
all bus chassis assembly to Irvine from the former Leyland Bus plant at
Workington, Cumbria. This will close by the end of June with the loss of
more than 100 jobs.
Volvo ended all production of bus bodies in the UK last year. With the
transfer of chassis production to Irvine it is giving up the Leyland Bus
brand name.
Volvo said the transfer of production had created 70 new jobs in the Irvine
bus assembly operations with the prospect of a further 80 'as markets
recover, demand increases and plant output moves towards its 1,500 units a
year capacity'.
Volvo assembled 2,309 trucks at Irvine last year with a workforce of 300. On
the new bus line it is planning to build chassis for the Olympian
double-deck bus and the B6 single-deck midi bus. Output of the heavy-duty
B10M single-deck bus/coach chassis is planned to start in 1994.
