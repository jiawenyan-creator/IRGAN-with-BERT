  [Text] Huehuetenago -- Thirty-two Central Americans 
(Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Hondurans) were detained and 
taken to the Mexican immigration office at La Mesilla, 
Huehuetenango. 
  They said that the Mexican authorities had treated them 
badly, had given them drugs, accused them of belonging to the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), took their money, and 
held them under arrest for several days. They added that many 
are under arrest in Villa Hermosa, Tabasco, and Chiapas. 
Therefore, they call on the corresponding authorities, as well 
as Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia to 
conduct investigations into the outrages committed against the 
illegal aliens in Mexico.
