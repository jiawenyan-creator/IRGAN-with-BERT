FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Redland slides
A variety of reasons were put forward to explain the underperformance of
Redland, whose shares gave ground as other leading building materials stocks
made good progress.
Dealers described the loss of Mr Gerald Corbett, the finance director, to
Grand Metropolitan as a serious blow to Redland, but also focused on the
impact of the Russian elections on sentiment in Germany, where Redland has a
significant presence. There was also a worry that the much hoped for
reduction in German interest rates may be deferred until the new year.
Redland retreated 6 to 577p on turnover of 1.4m shares. RMC, also extremely
sensitive to economic trends in Germany, shrugged off the interest rate
worries, closing 5 higher at 904p. GrandMet also fell back, with talk of a
big US seller and reaction to Mr Corbett's appointment. The shares dropped
13 to 445p.
The recent welter of heavy interim dividend increases from the utilities
sectors continued apace, with the waters, recs and power generators
beneficiaries of some sizeable switching out of the market's cyclical areas
and into the relative safe havens of the utilities.
After Monday's bout of profit-taking, many of the recs returned to favour.
Northern, due to report interims this morning and expected to increase its
payment by around 18 per cent, advanced 10 to a peak 706p. Southern
Electricity, up 7 at 679p, announced the expected 20 per cent rise in
dividend.
Water shares outperformed the recs, however, still boosted by the recent
European Commission move to redefine its water quality standards. Southern
Water's dividend was up to best expectations and saw the shares rise 12 to
660p. North West was the front runner among the FT-SE 100 constituents,
finishing 12 stronger at 586p, while Severn Trent gained 9 at a peak 626p.
Anglian Water closed 7 up at 586p after 589p.
Lucas Industries was one of the most resilient performers in the motor
components area of the market, the shares creeping up almost imperceptibly
to a record 196p before ending a net 1 1/2 ahead at 195 1/2 p. Turnover was
an unremarkable 1.8m shares. Dealers reported plenty of keen buying interest
in the stock and noted a resurgence of takeover speculation involving the
likes of T&amp;N.
BP continued to attract the lion's share of activity in the oil sector, but
came under some determined selling pressure late in the session as Wall
Street lost ground.
The stock was given a strong boost on Monday as at least two of the market's
most influential brokers, NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett, were said to
have been keen buyers of the shares. Today BP hosts a presentation to
investment analysts at Britannic House.
Other analysts, however, were sceptical of some of the recent bullish
stories on BP. 'I will be very interested to hear how BP will manage to
achieve some of the more exotic profits figures that are said to be in the
market if the oil price continues around the current Dollars 13 levels,'
said one specialist. BP ended 2 1/2 firmer at 326 1/2 p, after reaching 334p
around midday.
Lasmo held at 107p. PDFM, the fund management group which has sharply
increased its stake in Lasmo over the past few months, announced that it had
lifted its holding in the debt-laden oil group by 6.4m shares in the past
two weeks. PDFM's stake was raised from 12.16 per cent to 13 per cent.
Granada Group added 6 at 501p, with UBS said to be positive. The
announcement that Granada target LWT was in talks with Yorkshire TV saw the
former fall back 12 to 576p. YTV put on 2 at 165p.
Composite insurers came under pressure shortly after midday, with one
marketmaker said to have been offering stock acquired in the previous day's
programme trade. General Accident fell 18 to 706p, Royal Insurance 12 to
311p and Sun Alliance 8 to 365p.
Radio shares were active following good results from Southern Radio, up 7 at
65p. Chiltern Radio climbed 14 to 116p, Capital Radio 5 to 254p and GWR 27
to 630p.
