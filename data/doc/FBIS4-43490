  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- During the first visit to Bonn on 
Thursday [16 June] by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 
Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl should clearly distance himself 
from Berlusconi's fascist coalition partners. This was 
requested by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and 
Greens on Wednesday. 
  During his one-day visit to Bonn, Berlusconi will discuss 
bilateral relations. Other subjects on the agenda are the 
upcoming economic summit in Naples and Germany's European Union 
presidency. The visit will be Berlusconi's first trip abroad as 
head of government. 
  "The presence of neofascist ministers in the Italian 
Government is a disgrace for Italy and a danger to peace in 
Europe," Deputy SPD Chairperson Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said. 
The Federal Government must rule out any official contacts with 
them. 
  In the view of the Greens, Kohl will make himself an 
"accomplice of the European right-wing extremists" by receiving 
Berlusconi in Bonn. This would upgrade the profascist 
government internationally, Ludger Vollmer, head of the Alliance 
90/Greens, criticized. 
  The SPD and Greens have once more called on the chancellor 
and CDU chairman to prevent the acceptance of Berlusconi's 
party, "Forza Italia," into the Christian Democratic group in 
the European Parliament. 
  Meanwhile, the Bundestag Presidium has rejected a request by 
the Alliance 90/Greens to ask the Federal Government to 
elucidate in the Bundestag its position on the participation of 
the fascists in the Italian Government. The government was the 
result of the sovereign will of the Italian voters and has to be 
"neither commented on nor criticized" by the Federal Government, 
said Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth.
