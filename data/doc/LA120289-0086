Amotorcyclist led police on a lengthy pursuit in Simi Valley at speeds up to 70 
m.p.h. until he crashed into a chain-link fence on a dead-end street and died,

James ran four red lights after police tried to pull him over for speeding, 
police said. Police gave up the chase when they lost sight of the motorcycle 
but sighted him again about 30 minutes later, weaving in and out of traffic, 
and renewed the pursuit. 
Police said they lost sight of him again, but minutes later discovered his 
wrecked motorcycle next to the fence. James, who was not wearing a helmet, had 
a suspended automobile driver's license and had been convicted of nine vehicle 
code violations since February, 1987. He was not licensed to drive a 
motorcycle, police said.
