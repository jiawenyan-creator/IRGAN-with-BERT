FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola Amatil up 22% in first
half to ADollars 40.1m
Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australian soft drinks group, announced after-tax
profits for the six months to June up 22.4 per cent to ADollars 40.1m
(USDollars 30m).
The group is 51 per cent-owned by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and has interests
spanning Australasia, Indonesia and eastern Europe.
Sales were 11.6 per cent higher, at ADollars 1.04bn, while operating
profits, before interest and tax, were ADollars 89.7m, compared with
ADollars 75.2m in the same period of 1993.
CCA said the Australian market had been competitive, but sales had risen by
7 per cent and profits by 9 per cent. There was a strong performance from
New Zealand, while in Fiji, sales had grown solidly but profit had been
affected by additional marketing costs. A new bottling plant in Suva is due
to be completed later this year.
In eastern Europe, CCA reported satisfactory volume, sales and profits
growth in both Austria and Hungary in local currency terms, but foreign
currency movements had depressed returns in Australian dollar terms. Sales
and profits from the Czech Republic increased strongly.
