FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: London SE needs 'circuit breakers' to
avoid volatility
Sir, A large part of the market turmoil seen in London last week can be
directly attributed to the operation of futures and options trading. On the
two days when the FTSE-100 Share Index fell more than 50 points, futures
trading was heavy while trading in the actual market was light.
The trading rules of the London market encourage aggressive use of traded
options and futures, whether on the bear or the bull tacks. It is surely now
time for the stock exchange to follow the lead of the New York Stock
Exchange (and other markets) by introducing 'circuit breakers'. These would
come into operation automatically on a 50-point fall (or rise) in the
FTSE-100 Share Index.
Only in this way can the London market avoid the creation of false markets
through excessive volatility.
