FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa makes gains
South African shares made reasonable gains in the afternoon helped by an
improvement in the futures exchange. The overall index was up 33 at 5,506,
the industrial index added 39 to 6,307 and the gold index lost 4 to 2,101.
Traders said that further gains would depend on Wall Street's performance,
the direction of the dollar and the movement of South African listed
companies on Nasdaq overnight.
Among the main movers De Beers and Anglos both gained in spite of a stronger
financial rand, the former adding R2.25 to R109.25 and Anglos R4.50 to
R229.50. Vaal Reefs shed R1 to R409 rand.
