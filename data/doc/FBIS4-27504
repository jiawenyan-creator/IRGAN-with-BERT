  [Text] Moscow, May 30 (KCNA) -- V. Tolstsikov, chairman of 
the Central Council of the Russian Association for Friendship 
and Cultural Cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea, sent a letter on May 26 to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin concerning Kim Yong-sam's trip to Moscow slated for 
early June. 
  In the letter dated May 25 he said it was made known through 
publications recently that Yeltsin would meet Kim Yong-sam of 
South Korea and discuss "North Korea's nuclear issue" with him. 
Judging from the recent foreign trips of the South Korean big 
shot, he said, one can guess easily that one of the basic aims 
to be sought by him in his forthcoming visit to Russia is to 
discuss this issue. 
  Noting that this South Korean has been peddling the fake 
ware 
of "North Korea's nuclear issue", he said this is, in essence, 
aimed at slandering the DPRK, impairing its prestige and, 
furthermore, at stifling and destroying it as their masters 
across the ocean are seeking to do so. 
  The DPRK is an independent state and an ally of Russia, he 
stressed, asking Yeltsin not to do acts of distressing the DPRK, 
a state which has been friendly to Russia for scores of years.
