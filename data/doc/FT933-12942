FT  22 JUL 93 / Nadir puts case with dossier of court transcripts
FUGITIVE businessman Mr Asil Nadir last night released a 60-page dossier of
documents, court transcripts and letters in an effort to prove his view that
he would not get a fair trial in Britain, agencies report.
Hundreds of copies of the dossier were sent to politicians, church leaders
and news organisations. Much of the contents refers to court hearings
subject to a contempt of court order and cannot be published.
Claims in the dossier refer to allegations made by Mr Michael Mates, the
former Northern Ireland minister, in the Commons that the prosecuting
authorities tried to bring pressure on the trial judge, Mr Justice Tucker.
Mr Nadir, the former chairman of the collapsed Polly Peck conglomerate, fled
to northern Cyprus in May while awaiting trial on 13 charges of theft and
false accounting.
The SFO said last night: 'There's nothing new about these court documents.
They have been circulating for some time. We were in court and we do not
need to look at them.'
The dossier's introduction says its purpose is to reveal for the first time
what happened behind 'closed courtroom doors'.
Its aim is 'to bring to the attention of politicians, opinion-formers in the
media and churchmen and libertarians, the fabrications and distortions' in
the lead-up to the trial.
Mr Nadir says in a letter accompanying the dossier that he was not intending
to show contempt for British law. 'I left the country because I did not see
why, if found guilty as a result of the constant tampering with my trial, I
should then languish in jail for years . . . until someone decided to take
up my case and proved my innocence.'
'I doubt very much that 'Free the Belgravia One' would strike a chord with
the sympathies of the British people, however great the miscarriage of
justice.
'It became increasingly evident that the behaviour of the prosecution
amounted to a miscarriage of justice in the making,' he adds.
