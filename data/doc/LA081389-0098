THE WORLD 
A California man who had been working in Vietnam said he was briefly detained 
in manacles and denied access to diplomats before being deported. Daniel 
Robinson, 25, of San Rafael, a student at Princeton University, said he was in 
Vietnam for the past 10 weeks to research a travel guidebook under a contract 
with an Australian firm. He said the visit was authorized and assisted by Hanoi 
and that he had a valid visa. But he said he was questioned three times over 
three days, told he had to leave because he lacked necessary documentation and 
put on a flight to Bangkok.
