FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Consortium gets support for ITN bid
THE CONSORTIUM led by Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications yesterday
got the support needed to make the offer for Independent Television News
unconditional.
The consortium, which also includes Central, London Weekend, Reuters,
Granada, Anglia and Scottish, already had the agreement of ITV shareholders
holding 74.7 per cent, just below the 75 per cent needed to change the
articles of association.
Thames Television, the largest shareholder, had already signed the offer.
Yorkshire and Tyne Tees, which together hold 14.4 per cent of ITN, had not
signed before and are still unhappy about part of the news supply agreement
with ITN.
Yorkshire said it believed it had the support of enough ITV companies to
block the deal.
To do that Yorkshire needs the support of HTV, Ulster, Grampian and Border.
Two of the companies are believed to have signed the offer yesterday, taking
acceptances to above 75 per cent.
