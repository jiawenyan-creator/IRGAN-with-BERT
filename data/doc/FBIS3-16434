  [Text] Dismantling the nuclear warheads being withdrawn 
from the territory of Ukraine is an issue which is causing grave 
concern to those involved in the protection of the environment. 
The processing of radioactive materials may cause serious 
damage to the environment. Today, we learned that warheads from 
the Ukrainian missiles are being sent to the town of Arzamas-16. 
Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, the Minister of Natural Resources: 
  [Begin Danilov-Danilyan recording] Only to Arzamas-16. It is 
the enterprise that specializes in these particular things. 
From the point of view of the general safety of Russia it is 
better to bring Ukrainian warheads to Russia, to dismantle them 
and process what they contain, rather than to leave them in 
Ukraine. My honest word; this is better. If another incident 
should occur there, consequences will be far greater than from 
Chernobyl. [end recording]
