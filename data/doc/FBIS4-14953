  [Text] Ashgabat 5 April, TASS -- The government of 
Turkmenia [Turkmentistan] held bilateral talks with delegations 
of Iran and Russia in Ashgabat on Tuesday within the framework 
of the international consortium on transportation of Turkmen 
energy resources to the world market. 
  As a results of the talks two intergovernmental agreements 
were signed: The one with Iran -- on the construction of an oil 
pipeline as far as Tehran which will ensure delivering 6 million 
tons of Turkmen oil to Iran, and the other with Russia -- on 
cooperation in the development of fuel and power complexes. 
  "This document shows that Russia is interested in export of 
Turkmen oil and gas to the world market," Yuriy Shafranik, 
member of the interstate council of the consortium and minister 
of fuel and power engineering of Russia, told TURKMENPRESS. 
  "We will try to help Turkmenia by consulting and in the 
construction of the oil pipeline itself. The interaction in 
this direction will allow both states to cooperate on the 
European market in the future without infringing upon mutual 
interests. We will also back other routes of Turkmen energy 
resources," Yuriy Shafranik pointed out.
