FT  10 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Favourite among the safest
British Airways claims to be the world's favourite airline, but which is the
safest?
The International Airline Passengers Association has spent six months
developing a system for evaluating airline safety. It looked at how many
accidents airlines had suffered and how many deaths per million passengers.
It also looked at other, less quantifiable, factors. These included aircraft
maintenance and the quality of pilot training, the age of aircraft and the
air traffic infrastructure in an airline's base country.
BA is among the six safest large airlines. The association said BA had only
one accident in its last 3m flights and had 'an excellent management'.
But top of the list of safe large airlines was American. 'Every American
flight sets another world record for most flights without an accident, now
over 9m,' the association said. 'No other airline . . . has been close to
this record.'
The association believes American's success lies in its innovative pilot
training and the right it gives to all mechanics to ground an aircraft.
The other large carriers with good safety records are SAS ('accident free
for over 24 years, an unbelievable number'), Delta, Lufthansa and Southwest.
The best of the medium-sized airlines were All Nippon, America West, Ansett
Australia, Canadian Airlines International and Saudi Arabian Airlines.
