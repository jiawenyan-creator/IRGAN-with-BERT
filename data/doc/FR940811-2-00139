 

The following restrictions apply to the use of the ``Star of 
Life'': 

1. As a registered certification mark, the ``Star of Life'' 
must always be accompanied by the symbol consisting of a 
capital letter R surrounded by a circle, 

i.e. 



&reg;

. This 
marking shall appear immediately adjacent to the ``Star of 
Life'' on all decals, uniform patches, printed material, 
plaques, pins, buckles, name plates, etc. Where the item 
consists solely of the ``Star of Life'' and does not have 
an adjacent surface of surrounding area (

e.g., 

a lapel 
pin), the 

&reg;

 shall appear on the reverse side of the item. 

2. The Specifications below include a sample of the 
registered blue ``Star of Life'' symbol, and identify the 
color of the symbol and its dimensions (for three sizes). 
Deviations in size may be made, provided they are 
proportionate. Other deviations may be made, provided 
they create the same commercial impression created by the 
registered mark. 

3. Some manner of demarcation (such as function-identifying 
words or letters printed on bars and attached across the 
bottom separately, and edging of different colors) should 
be used on patches or other apparel or personal items 
(such as badges, lapel pins, buckles, name plates, 
plaques, etc.) worn or used by an individual, to 
distinguish those worn or used by an individual: 

a. who: 

i. has satisfactorily completed any training 
course that meets or exceeds the U.S. 
Department of Transportation National Standard 
Curricula or has been approved by a State or 
Federal agency involved in the provision of 
emergency medical care; and 

ii. is authorized by a State or Federal agency 
involved in the provision of emergency medical 
care to participate in a qualified emergency 
medical care system; 




from those worn or used by an individual: 



b. who by title and function is authorized by a State 
or Federal agency involved in the provision of 
emergency medical care to administer, directly 
supervise, or otherwise participate in all or a 
specific part of a qualified emergency medical care 
system.
