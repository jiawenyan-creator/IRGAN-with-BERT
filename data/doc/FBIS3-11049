  [Text] Honduras yesterday officially signed in Geneva, 
Switzerland, the GATT membership protocol to become a 
contracting party after two years of difficult negotiations. 
  From Geneva, Economy and Commerce Minister Dalmer Urbizo 
Panting, after signing the GATT protocol, reported the ceremony 
was held in the presence of 26 GATT contracting countries. "For 
Honduras, the signing of this protocol represents a historical 
event of great importance, which concludes a long, intense, and 
sustained campaign to transform and strengthen the economy's 
external sector," Panting noted. 
  With the signing of the membership memorandum, it is now up 
to Congress to ratify Honduras' GATT membership. On 11 April, 
at the latest, the country will become a contracting party. 
  Additionally, Panting reported that he met with 
representatives of the Intellectual Property Office in Geneva, 
where techniques were established to create a similar office in 
Honduras. He added that the way in which this organization will 
cooperate with our country in different areas was analyzed in 
order to establish an adequate framework for international 
investments.
