  [Text] Jerusalem, March 17 (AFP)--The Jewish gunman who 
massacred 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque was with another 
armed settler, two soldiers told the inquiry into the February 
25 slaughter. 
  "I saw Barukh Goldstein arrive armed with an M-16 and his 
pistol," said Sergeant Kobi Yosef who was on guard duty at the 
entrance to the Tomb of the Patriarchs. 
  "Then another settler, who I didn't know, arrived armed with 
a short-barrelled Galil rifle." 
  An army ballistics experts said that all the Palestinians 
casualties had been hit by shots from a short-barrelled Galil, 
an Israeli-made assault rifle capable of firing up to 750 
bullets a minute. 
  Goldstein was beaten to death by Palestinians in the mosque.
