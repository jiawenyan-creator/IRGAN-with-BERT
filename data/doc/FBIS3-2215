"Trade Fairs: From Being a Supplement To Being a Main Sector"] 
  [Text] Fifteen years ago, trade fairs, the "capitalist 
tail" barred from development for many years, emerged as the 
times required. 
  In 1978, trade fairs throughout the country rose from zero 
to 
33,000, and the annual turnover was 12.5 billion yuan, which 
amounted to 5.4 percent of total retail sales that year. They 
merely played a supplementary role in commodity circulation. 
  In the following 15 years, trade fairs in China made amazing 
progress. By the end of 1993, there were a total of 83,001 
trade fairs, which was an increase of 150 percent over 1978, and 
the annual turnover reached 534.3 billion yuan, which was an 
increase of 410 percent over 1978. The annual turnover 
accounted for 28.03 percent of the total volume of retail sales, 
which was an increase of 22.63 percent over 1978. Regarding the 
investment of market construction, it rose from zero in 1978 to 
21.7 billion yuan in 1993. 
  The development of trade fairs solved urban and town 
residents' "shopping basket" problem, which could not be 
overcome for many years. By the end of 1993, the volume of 
vegetable business in trade fairs amounted to 850 percent of 
that of state-run businesses, the volume of dried and fresh 
vegetable business amounted to 740 percent, and the volume of 
meat, poultry, and egg business amounted to 330 percent. Trade 
fairs have become a shopping place which we cannot do without, 
even for a moment. The development of trade fairs has even 
promoted the development of rural economy, settled a large 
number of surplus laborers, brought in more state revenue, and 
given an impetus to the building of cities and towns. Trade 
fairs have become an important channel for commodity circulation. 
  With the participation of state-owned enterprises and 
collective enterprises, trade fairs in China in the 1990's are 
no longer those of a traditional sense, but they are the "grand 
arena" of joint competition between state-owned, collective, 
private enterprises, and individual businessmen in cities and 
towns. Today, trade fairs in China are no longer confined to a 
supplementary role in supplying daily necessities for cities and 
towns, but they are a large market made up of multiple parts, 
including consumer goods, industrial products, means of 
production, and factors of production. According to statistics, 
there are now a total of 4,700 markets of means of production 
and over 1,700 markets of factors of production throughout the 
country.
