ALHAMBRA POLICE FATALLY SHOOT DRIVER WHO LUNGED AT OFFICER 
Alhambra police shot and killed an apparently unarmed man Thursday morning when 
he bolted from his car after a traffic stop and then charged a pursuing officer 
in a dark stairway, authorities said. 
The man, in his 20s, was not identified. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the 
scene of the shooting, which occurred on a quiet block of apartment houses near 
the corner of Valley Boulevard and 4th Street. 
An officer stopped the man at the intersection about 4 a.m. after he observed 
him driving slowly in a maroon Honda Civic with no headlights on, said 
sheriff's deputies, who were asked to assist in the investigation. 
During the stop, the driver was acting "suspiciously" and giving conflicting 
information about who owned the car, sheriff's spokesman Gabe Ramirez said. 
The officer then called for a second patrol car, but the man ran off on 4th 
Street, "reaching toward his waistband as he ran," Ramirez said. 
The officers ran after him and were searching the area around an apartment 
building "when he suddenly appeared from a darkened stairway and charged" one 
of the policemen, Ramirez said. 
The officer fired once with his service revolver, striking the man in the 
chest. Neither of the officers was injured, and no weapons were found on the 
man or in the area, Ramirez said.
