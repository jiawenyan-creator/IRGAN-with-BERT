FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): End to red channel - Customs Powers
CITIZENS OF EC member states will no longer be required to pass through red
and green channels at UK frontiers from the beginning of next year, under
limitations to the powers of Customs &amp; Excise unveiled by the Chancellor
yesterday.
The red and green channels, which help Customs officers to detect purchases
of goods currently subject to duty, are being abolished as part of the
process of harmonisation with other EC states in preparation for the
creation of the single European market.
Customs officers will no longer have the automatic right to stop and
question EC citizens who may be carrying goods which are subject to duty,
either in person or at vehicle checkpoints. Limitations will be lifted on
the import of any reasonable quantity of goods such as alcohol, tobacco and
perfume on which duty has been paid.
Individuals from non-EC countries will still be subject to searches and
limitations on the quantity of goods they may bring in to the UK. Customs
officers will still be able to stop people on suspicion of carrying drugs or
other prohibited goods.
'We will be changing from a red and green channel to a green channels with a
red spot,' said a Customs spokesman last night.
Under a transitional arrangement the duty-free industry will be allowed to
maintain shops at frontiers until 1999. There will be limits on the volumes
of goods purchased without payment of duty from these shops.
