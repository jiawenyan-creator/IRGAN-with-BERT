TV REVIEW; 
DON'T MAKE ROOM FOR 'ROMANCE' 
The summer series "Room for Romance" is "Love, American Style" 1990, the kind 
of non-stick, inconsequential TV anthology that you can flick away like lint. 
It premieres at 10 tonight on CBS (Channel 2 and 8), the locale being a New 
York apartment house as hermetically sealed and climatically controlled as a 
shopping mall, the characters being residents who look like they were squeezed 
from a tube of toothpaste. 
The sights, sounds and smells of New York are shut out here, as are real 
emotions and intense feelings. 
Tonight's three stories all involve romance, a sort of quick-dissolving, 
sexless sex that is set to lilting elevator music. The show's only recurring 
characters are a sardonically philosophizing concierge (Dom Irrera) and a 
precocious 10-year-old resident (Rebecca Harrell). Their too-infrequent, 
lobby's-eye observations about the lives of the other tenants provide the only 
relief from the hour's tedium. HOWARD ROSENBERG
