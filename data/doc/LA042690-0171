HARCOURT MULLS SELLING SOME ASSETS 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., which has vowed for months that none of its 
assets were for sale, said Wednesday it is discussing the possible sale of a 
portion of its publishing business. 
Peter Jovanovich, president and chief executive officer, said the Orlando-based 
corporation has begun preliminary discussions involving the sale of some or all 
of its existing debt at a discount, or the purchase of "certain assets of the 
company by a third party." 
The statement followed a report earlier Wednesday that former U.S. Sen. Eugene 
McCarthy, who has served for a decade on HBJ's board, said discussions had been 
under way with Thomson Corp. of Canada for a month. 
The report by Dow Jones News Service said McCarthy did not know whether HBJ or 
Thomson made the initial overture.
