  [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- A civil defense exercise, 
including an air-raid drill, was conducted for 20 minutes across 
the country Wednesday afternoon. 
  In view of the tension over North Korea's nuclear program, 
the exercise stressed war preparedness for the first time since 
1992, when the focus was shifted to preparations for such 
disasters as floods and earthquakes. 
  In Seoul, an air-raid siren sounded at 2:00 P.M. and a 
yellow smoke bomb was set off in front of the Daewoo building at 
2:05, indicating that the building had been "hit" by a chemical 
bomb. 
  Toxicity fighting units rushed to the building and 
ambulances 
and first-aid teams evacuated 30 "injured" people from the 
building to eight hospitals, including the Red Cross hospital. 
  At 2:08, black smoke spewed from the building's third and 
ninth floors, indicating they had been hit by bombs. Fire 
trucks brought the blaze under control while rescue teams 
evacuated people from the building with ropes. Destroyed power 
and telephone lines and water pipes were repaired immediately. 
  Participating in the air-raid drill at the building were 33 
vehicles, including 16 fire trucks and nine ambulances, 400 
civil servants and Daewoo civil defense corps members. 
  Other people in the building were evacuated to its 
basements. 
  In addition, a vehicular traffic control drill took place on 
a road near Chungnang-chon River, assuming that the road had 
been inundated. 
  No military aircraft, such as helicopters, were used in the 
exercise because of inconvenience caused to citizens and for 
fear that North Korea would use the move in its anti-South 
propaganda offensive, officials said.
