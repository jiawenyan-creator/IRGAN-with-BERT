FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME copper rally continues
Copper prices continued their rally yesterday at the London Metal Exchange,
reaching the highest levels since July's two-year peak.
A burst of investment fund buying in mid-session took the three months
delivery price through resistance around the Dollars 2,500-a-tonne mark,
traders told the Reuters news agency. The price touched Dollars 2,520 a
tonne before easing back to Dollars 2,509.50 at the close, up Dollars 39.75
on the day.
The aluminium market was also strong, aided by news of problems at Kaiser's
Ghanaian operation (see next story). Having reached Dollars 1,534.50 a tonne
at the close the three months position added nearly Dollars 10 in after
hours trading.
News that a strike had been averted at the Sudbury, Ontario, operation of
Falconbridge, the second largest western nickel producer, only briefly
interrupted the metal's price rise.
Yesterday's Dollars 134 rise to Dollars 6,259 a tonne for three months
delivery took the advance over the last seven trading days to Dollars
481.50.
Falconbridge said it reached agreement early yesterday morning with mine,
mill and smelter workers to avert the threatened strike, reports Reuters
from Toronto.
'We have an agreement as of 05:15 (local time)' said company spokesman Mr
Gerald Foley at a Sudbury hotel where management and union representatives
had been negotiating through the night. The Canadian Auto Workers Union,
which represents the Sudbury workers, had threatened to strike if no
agreement was reached by 8am.
Mr Foley said the new contract would be for three years but disclosed no
further details of the deal, which covers some 1,400 workers.
The Sudbury plant last year produced 38,300 tonnes of nickel, 47,200 tonnes
of copper and 800 tonnes of cobalt.
