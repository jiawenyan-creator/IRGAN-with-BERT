  [Text] Yekaterinburg June 9 TASS -- Ex-Procurator General 
of the Russian Federation Aleksey Kazannik, sacked by President 
Yeltsin after the amnesty of the latter's political rivals, and 
his supporters in the Urals and Siberia are now working to found 
a new political party, which they call "The Party of People's 
Conscience." 
  The party's founding congress is due to take place in 
Yekaterinburg on Friday. 
  According to prepared documents, the party seeks to bring 
together Russia's intellectual potential and concentrate on 
implementing a theoretically-based reform policy and forming 
competent governing structures, including the federal government. 
  The party intends to announce that it would form 
"constructive opposition" to the present authorities, reject the 
ideology of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia and Russian 
National Unity. 
  At the same time, the Kazannik party will be ready to team 
up 
with all sound- and patriotically-minded associations.
