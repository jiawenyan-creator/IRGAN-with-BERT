FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Scantronic restricted by high component
prices
High semiconductor chip prices held back the first-half profits advance at
Scantronic Holdings, the security components manufacturer and distributor,
despite a 10 per cent gain in core UK sales reflecting new product launches.
Pre-tax profits were virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.59m in the six months
to September 30, compared with Pounds 1.55m, on turnover ahead 12 per cent
to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 18.5m).
Mr Chris Brookes, chief executive, said high component costs in the first
half, related to a fire at a Japanese resin plant in the summer, had
squeezed margins and adversely affected performance. However, he said chip
prices had since subsided and margins had now returned to previous levels.
Overall operating profits edged higher to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.71m) while
net interest charges increased to Pounds 175,000 (Pounds 167,000).
The UK operations reported reduced operating profits of Pounds 1.49m (Pounds
1.6m) on turnover which grew to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.3m).
Since the end of September the group has acquired the Alarmexpress wholesale
distribution business which is expected to broaden the UK customer base and
contribute to profits in the second half.
International operations, mainly in continental Europe, reported slightly
higher operating profits and turnover. The North American operations again
showed a small operating loss but turnover grew strongly to Pounds 4.93m
(Pounds 3.97m) reflecting an additional Pounds 600,000 spent on sales and
marketing, and they are expected to be profitable in the current half.
Earnings per share edged up to 1.88p (1.84p) and the interim dividend goes
up from 0.79p to 0.843p.
The group also restated its latest full year results to comply with FRS 3.
In particular a Pounds 1.5m charge previously reported as an extraordinary
item - mainly related to a damages claim against the former owner of
Arrowhead, a US acquisition - has been reclassified.
As a result the pre-tax profit for the year to March 31 has been restated to
Pounds 1.59m with losses per share of 0.3p.
