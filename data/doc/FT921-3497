FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: TI shows resilience with 18% fall -
Acquisitions make up for lower sales from existing operations
TI, the specialist engineer, yesterday demonstrated a resilience amid
difficult trading conditions, reporting an 18 per cent fall in 1991 pre-tax
profits to Pounds 105.2m. After allowing for a one-off hedging gain in 1990
of Pounds 7.3m, profits last year fell only 13 per cent.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, chairman, said he was satisfied with the results
which demonstrated the benefits of having a wide spread of industries and
markets.
Earnings per share fell from 55.5p to 44.8p but the group proposed an
increased final dividend of 13.5p, giving 20.5p for the full year, a 5 per
cent advance.
Turnover was 1 per cent higher at Pounds 899.5m with bolt-on acquisitions
almost offsetting the Pounds 29m lower sales from ongoing businesses.
Interest earned fell from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 7.8m, as the group spent
Pounds 106m acquiring businesses and Pounds 28m reorganising them, turning
net cash of Pounds 51.6m into a net debt of Pounds 37m. The overall
operating margin fell from 12.1 per cent to 10.7 per cent.
Of the three core divisions to emerge from TI's drastic restructuring over
the past five years, engineering seals performed best, increasing pre-tax
profits from Pounds 36.8m to Pounds 42.5m and margins by 0.4 percentage
points to 15.1 per cent.
Profits at specialised tubes fell from Pounds 43m to Pounds 34.3m and
margins slipped two percentage points to 8.8 per cent. The problems were
concentrated in the UK at the old Tube Investment industries, Desford and
four smaller businesses.
In specialised engineering profits fell from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 18.2m
with some erosion of margins, partly because aircraft engine builders
deferred spending programmes.
COMMENT
Six years after Mr Lewinton began to transform the old Tube Investments
bicycles-to-kettles mish-mash, TI's three core divisions are well placed to
be an early beneficiary of any economic recovery. This year TI may not set
the world alight. But if anything like the expected recovery emerges in the
US, where TI derives 45 per cent of sales, 1993 should see a jump in
earnings. The group has also dispelled some suspicions about its accounting
policies. TI, we are told, will no longer surprise the City with the release
of provisions to cover reorganisation costs on acquisitions; it will tell us
first. Organic growth and small bolt-on acquisitions, already proving
successful, should lead to a modest rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 110m
this year, giving 47p of earnings and a prospective multiple of 13. In 1993,
however, profits are forecast at about Pounds 127m, or 53p and a multiple of
11, a substantial discount to the market for a company with strong
management. TI has less room for manoeuvre should it embark upon a large
bolt-on or another sizeable acquisition to build into a fourth core
business. Last year's Pounds 106m acquisition programme led to a Pounds 99m
write-off of goodwill against the balance sheet, reducing shareholders'
funds to Pounds 252m. Any further acquisition, unless financed by new paper,
would be likely to increase gearing quite sharply on net debt currently
standing at Pounds 37m.
