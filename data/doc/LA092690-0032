METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GUNMAN BURSTS INTO HOME, KILLS 2 MEN 
A gunman burst into a South Los Angeles home Monday night and fired repeatedly 
at a group of people sitting in the living room, killing two men, police said. 
Jason Lemuel Combs, 28, was hit 11 times and died at the scene, police said. 
His landlord, 62-year-old Leon Jefferson, was hit once and died less than an 
hour later at California Medical Center. 
Police were looking for two women they believe were sitting with the victims in 
the house in the 1100 block of East 23rd Street during the 10 p.m. shooting. 
Jefferson owned the house and had a rental arrangement with Combs, who was 
paroled from state prison in August, police said. 
At the house, police found hypodermic needles, crack cocaine pipes and a 
substance they believe to be cocaine. 
"The shooting may . . . be narcotics related," said Detective Bernie Skiles.
