RACING DRIVER DIES DEFENDING CHAMPIONSHIP 
An accident during a race at Lancaster National Speedway claimed the life of 
the track's defending champion.

feature event Sunday at about 10 p.m. when his car touched wheels with a car

retaining wall. 
Carey walked away from his car, but Druer had to be freed using emergency 
cutting tools. He was taken to Erie County Medical Center and was pronounced 
dead at 12:25 a.m. of multiple injuries.

and not Carey's fault."
