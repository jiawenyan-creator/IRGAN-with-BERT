FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Domestic &amp; General 24% ahead
Domestic &amp; General, the domestic appliance insurer, yesterday announced a 24
per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 9.56m for the
year to the end of June.
However, the results came towards the lower end of analysts' expectations,
and this, together with a warning of increased expenditure on its German
operations and new product development sent the shares retreating 92p - or 5
per cent - to Pounds 16.93.
Turnover increased to Pounds 66m (Pounds 56.3m), while earnings per share
advanced to 93.47p (75.63p). The dividend is raised to 27.75p (22.5p) with a
proposed final of 18.5p.
Mr Martin Copley, chairman, said that although the rate of growth had slowed
over the year, particularly in the second half, trading was still
satisfactory.
He added that the company was focusing its attentions on the uninsured
market - less than 30 per cent of domestic appliances in the UK are
currently insured - and the largely unexploited European market. However,
those objectives would necessitate additional expenditure 'which will
continue to impact in the coming year.'
Another cloud on the horizon was the on-going DTI inquiry into extended
warranties, the outcome of which was being awaited by the company before it
introduced some new products to the market.
Total contribution (underwriting profits before expenses) amounted to Pounds
16.66m (Pounds 13.29m) and investment income increased slightly to Pounds
6.38m (Pounds 6.14m).
The company also announced that it was applying for a full listing on the
London Stock Exchange, but added that it had decided against having a share
split.
