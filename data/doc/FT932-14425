FT  19 APR 93 / Observer: Olympic bid?
One of the mysteries of the 13-year-old London Marathon is why Chris
Brasher, the Olympic gold medallist who has masterminded the highly popular
event from the very beginning, has never been honoured.
In fact it seems that he was offered a gong back in the 1980s but turned it
down on the grounds that he didn't like Margaret Thatcher, the prime
minister at the time. 'That bloody woman did nothing for British sport,'
says Brasher in yesterday's Mail on Sunday. And in case the current
sport-loving prime minister thinks of renewing the offer, Brasher is of the
view that as he has to deal with politicians one shouldn't accept honours
from people you deal with. How honest.
However, there is a theory abroad - not denied by Brasher himself - that he
would like the chairmanship of the British Olympic Association if it was on
offer. The problem is that he is now 64 and the new BOA chief Craig Reedie a
mere 51 and digging in for a decade's service.
It has been rumoured that Brasher's Olympic ambitions are now sublimated
into vigorous support for Manchester's bid to stage the 2000 Games. But if
Manchester gets the nod in September, Brasher could re-emerge as a runner
for the top job on the grounds that it would be nice to have an Olympian in
charge, especially if Britain is going to host the turn-of-the-century
games.
