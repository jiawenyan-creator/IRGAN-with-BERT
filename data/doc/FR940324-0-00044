<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that comprise the shallow water species fishery by vessels using
trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those
portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. This action is necessary because the first seasonal
allowance of Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) apportioned to the shallow water trawl fishery category
in the GOA has been caught.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is 
governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 
and 672. 



An emergency interim rule (58 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) apportioned the Pacific halibut PSC limit for trawl gear
into bycatch allowances and seasonal apportionments thereof among fishery categories. In accordance with 672.20(f)(3)(iii)
the shallow water species fishery, which is defined at 672.20(f)(3)(ii)(A) was apportioned 500 mt of Pacific
halibut PSC for the first season, the period January 20, 1994, through March 31, 1994. 

The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, 
in accordance with 672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating in the trawl shallow water species fishery
in the GOA have caught the first seasonal allowance of Pacific halibut PSC apportioned to that fishery. Therefore,
NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for each species and species group that comprise the shallow water species fishery
by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those
portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. The species and species groups that comprise
the shallow water species fishery are: Pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel,
and ``other species''. This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., March 21, 1994, through 12 noon, A.l.t., March
31, 1994.
