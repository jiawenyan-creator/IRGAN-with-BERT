 

As a result of the previously discussed AD review, 
the CAA listed the actions specified in the referenced 
service instructions as mandatory with CAA AD 0030781 
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these 
airplanes in the United Kingdom. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the United 
Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the 
United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of 
the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the 
applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant 
to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has 
kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. 

Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy 
and after reviewing all available information including 
that received from the CAA, the FAA has determined that 
AD action should be taken to (1) eliminate the 
repetitive short-interval inspections required by AD 810903 R1, Amendment 394150; and (2)
continue 
preventing inadvertent rudder movement caused by a 
cracked rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket, which 
could result in loss of rudder control. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other JAL HP137 Mk1 
and Jetstream series 200 airplanes of the same type 
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 
810903 R1 with a new AD that would (1) retain the 
inspections of the rudder pedal adjusting mounting 
bracket for cracks and require replacing any cracked 
part as required by the current AD; and (2) require 
replacing this mounting bracket with an improved part 
of increased sectional dimension, P/N 1379111E 1, as 
terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The 
proposed inspection would be accomplished in accordance 
with Jetstream Service Bulletin No. 9/10, dated April 
28, 1981. The proposed replacement would be 
accomplished in accordance with the Instructions to 
Modification No. 5162, Part 1 and Part 2, Issue 1, 
dated June 1981. 

The FAA estimates that 11 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 160 workhours per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed modification, and that the 
average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts 
cost approximately $1,800 per airplane. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $116,600. 

All 11 of the affected airplanes are HP137 Mk1's; 
there are no Jetstream series 200 airplanes registered 
in the United States, but they are type certificated 
for operation in the United States. According to FAA 
records, none of these HP137 Mk1 airplanes are in 
operation or anywhere near operating condition. For 
this reason, JAL no longer stocks Modification No. 
5162, but can develop modification kits within three 
months after order. Since there are no airplanes 
currently in operation, the cost impact of the proposed 
AD would be narrowed to only those owners/operators 
returning their airplane to operation. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of 
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in 
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by

The Proposed Amendment 



Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated 
to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation 
Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: 



PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues 
to read as follows:






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 
49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 



39.13 

[Amended] 



2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing AD 810903 R1, Amendment 394150, and by adding a new AD to

read as follows:






Jetstream Aircraft Limited: 

Docket No. 94CE14AD. 
Supersedes AD 810903 R1, Amendment 394150.






Applicability: 

HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream Series 200 
airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any 
category. 



Compliance: 

Required as indicated after the effective 
date of this AD, unless already accomplished. 

To prevent inadvertent rudder movement caused by a 
cracked rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket, which 
could result in loss of rudder control, accomplish the 
following: 

(a) Within the next 100 hours time-in-service, 
unless already accomplished (compliance with AD 810903 R1), inspect the rudder pedal adjusting mounting

bracket for cracks in accordance with Jetstream Service 
Bulletin (SB) No. 9/10, dated April 28, 1981. 

(1) If cracks are found, prior to further flight, 
replace the mounting bracket with an improved part of 
increased sectional dimension, part number (P/N) 
1379111E 1, in accordance with the Instructions to 
Modification No. 5162, Part 1 and Part 2, Issue 1, 
dated June 1981. 

 This replacement is referenced as 
Modification No. 5162. 

(2) If no cracks are found, reinspect at intervals 
not to exceed 100 hours TIS until Modification No. 5162 
is incorporated. 

(b) Upon the accumulation of 15,000 hours TIS or 
within the next 200 hours TIS, whichever occurs later, 
replace the rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket 
with an improved part of increased sectional dimension, 
P/N 1379111E 1 (Modification No. 5162), in accordance 
with the Instructions to Modification No. 5162, Part 1 
and Part 2, Issue 1, dated June 1981.
