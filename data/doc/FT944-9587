FT  15 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BSkyB
The retail portion of the BSkyB flotation contains an unusual feature:
shareholders will not know the price of the shares when they send in their
application forms. They will write out cheques specifying how many pounds
worth of shares they wish to buy, but the price will be set later after a
book-building process involving institutions.
The main advantage of the technique is that the time between pricing an
offer and the start of dealing will be shortened. Typically in the UK, there
is a delay of up to two weeks to give small investors time to turn round the
paperwork after the price is set. By shortening the period, underwriting
risk could be reduced and the proceeds from the offer increased. Such a
system is common in the US.
BSkyB's sponsors must convince small shareholders to buy shares without
knowing what their price-earnings ratio or yield will be. A similar
technique was used in the third tranche of BT's privatisation. The
difference is that then retail investors did not simply have to rely on
institutions' judgment of what constituted a fair price; they were sold
shares at a discount to what the professionals paid.
