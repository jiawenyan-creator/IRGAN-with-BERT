FT  02 MAR 94 / Observer: Minim cabs
Hands up all who know 1994 is the Year of the London Taxi? You did? Then
presumably you will be off to the South Bank's Purcell Room on April 25 to
listen to the Licensed London Taxi Drivers' Orchestra perform some Mozart
and Bach. No comments please about metre, direction, dud notes or such like.
