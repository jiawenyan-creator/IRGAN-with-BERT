  [Excerpts] Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov 
has arrived on an official visit. He was received at Ankara 
Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. 
  In a statement at the airport, Cetin pointed out that Turkey 
and Bulgaria are not only neighbors, but two friendly countries 
with close relations. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] The cooperation and relations 
between us will contribute significantly not only to our two 
countries, but to the solution of the problems in the Balkans. 
They will also contribute to the peace and stability in Europe. 
Actually, the relations between Turkey and Bulgaria offer an 
example for the region. [end recording] 
  Daskalov said that, during his visit, they will discuss ways 
of further developing existing relations. 
  Daskalov then visited Cetin and conferred with him for some 
time. Later, official talks were held between the delegations of 
the two countries headed by the respective foreign ministers. 
  Cetin said before the meeting that they were trying to 
conclude certain agreements before them. These agreements will 
further strengthen the legal basis of the relations between the 
two countries, he said, adding that cooperation is intensively 
developing especially in the field of defense. [passage omitted] 
  Daskalov also met with Murat Karayalcin, state minister and 
deputy prime minister. 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] As you know, tomorrow I will 
pay a one-day visit to The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM], to Skopje. We discussed that a little. The approach 
of both countries to FYROM is very positive and warm. 
Consequently, I thought it was appropriate that this visit was 
paid one day before my visit to Skopje. [end recording]
