FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Move to ease NY investment rules
THE Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday voted to propose new rules
making it easier for companies to register plans for securities offerings
and to widen the pool of institutional investors allowed to buy privately
placed securities under Rule 144a, writes Patrick Harverson.
The proposal will halve the size of the public float required for
non-investment grade offerings to Dollars 75m, eliminate the requirement
that qualified companies have trading volume of 3m shares, and allow
companies with a 12-month operating history to file shelf registrations,
rather than the present 36-month minimum.
