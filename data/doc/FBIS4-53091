  [Text] Kobe, May 16 KYODO -- The first major consignment 
of foreign apples to enter Japan arrived at the western Japan 
port of Kobe from New Zealand on Monday [16 may] without fanfare. 
  The 19 ton shipment of apples represented the first 
significant importation of foreign apples since the government 
formally liberalized the domestic apple market in 1971. 
  Although Tokyo could have allowed imports of foreign apples 
at that time, it has long maintained an import ban on apples 
from major exporters such as the United States and New Zealand, 
citing concerns over the spread of moths or viruses. 
  But the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has 
decided to lift the import ban on U.S. and New Zealand apples, 
saying they have cleared the technical limitations that 
previously had barred them from Japan. 
  The first load of apples from New Zealand will go onto store 
shelves soon after passing inspection at the Kobe quarantine 
station. 
  Traders said a total of some 500 tons of foreign apples, 
including imports from the U.S., are expected to arrive this 
year.
