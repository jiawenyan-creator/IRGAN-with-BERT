FT  07 MAR 92 / Safeguard for buyers
THE government yesterday announced moves to prevent mortgage lenders forcing
home-buyers to purchase unwanted insurance policies and other financial
services as a condition of a loan, David Barchard writes.
It said it planned to stop the 'tying' of one financial service to a
mortgage. However, it would not ban deals in which a mortgage is cheaper
because it is combined with other financial services, provided that
consumers are not misled.
Many consumers have complained that they may be forced to stop an existing
insurance policy and switch to another to obtain a mortgage. When a
home-buyer is forced to surrender an endowment policy from one company and
switch to another, it usually involves a substantial loss to the person
concerned.
The government proposals would mean that every lender would have to make
clear to customers whether the availability of a secured loan was linked to
the purchase of another service.
For mortgage loans, lenders and brokers would have to stress as soon as a
customer inquired about a mortgage that they were willing to provide the
loan by itself.
