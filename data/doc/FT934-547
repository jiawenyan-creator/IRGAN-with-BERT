FT  24 DEC 93 / Large decline forecast in craft jobs
Craft and skilled manual jobs are expected to decline by as much as 520,000
during the 1990s, a fall of 14 per cent during the decade, a government
report says.
Occupational trends and projections to the year 2000 have been produced by
the Institute for Employment Research at the University of Warwick. The
forecasts, published yesterday, highlight the increase in higher-level jobs
which will require a more highly skilled workforce. The most rapid growth is
expected in the managerial, professional and technical categories. At the
same time the general skills content of most jobs is increasing.
The largest proportionate fall, of 35 per cent, will be in the primary
industries.
The government has not formally endorsed the forecasts but said they were
'useful broad indicators'.
