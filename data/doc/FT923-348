FT  29 SEP 92 / Healthcare for ethnic minorities to be probed
WAYS of improving the provision of health services to Britain's ethnic
minorities are to be examined by the government following a report by Dr
Kenneth Calman yesterday.
Dr Calman, in his first report as the government's chief medical officer,
draws attention to the need to address particular health issues affecting
ethnic minorities and to 'take positive steps to eliminate discrimination
within the NHS'.
There is evidence, Dr Calman says, that people with different genetic and
cultural backgrounds can experience patterns of disease that give rise to
particular needs from the health service.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said after publication of the
report that she wanted the NHS to be 'more precisely tuned' to the needs of
people from ethnic minorities.
Lady Cumberlege, junior health minister, is to meet representatives of
ethnic minority communities, NHS managers and professional bodies as the
first step towards drawing up an action plan for meeting special needs. The
government is also looking at ways of improving employment and promotion
opportunities in the NHS for people from ethic minorities.
