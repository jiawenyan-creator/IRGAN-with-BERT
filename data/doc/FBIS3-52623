  [Text] Tehran, Jan 6 (AFP)--The Iranian Foreign Ministry 
has dragged its feet in trying to secure a truce between the 
warring factions in Afghanistan, the semi-official TEHRAN TIMES 
charged Thursday [6 January]. 
  The English-language daily accused the ministry of acting 
"sluggishly" in undertaking a "not-so-successful" effort to 
secure a ceasefire in Kabul earlier this week. 
  "It could have launched an extensive diplomatic move through 
contacting the warring sides as well as regional countries in a 
bid to contain the war," it said. "This sluggishness is in no 
way justifiable." 
  Tehran said on Tuesday that the rival Afghan forces had 
agreed to a truce in response to an Iranian offer to evacuate 
some of the wounded from Kabul. 
  A spokesman said the representatives of Afghan President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar had 
informed the foreign ministry of their acceptance. 
  However heavy fighting has been continuing for six days, 
with 
the forces of former communist general 'Abdol Rashid Dostam 
pounding Kabul from the air and ground on Thursday. 
  The forces of Dostam and Hekmatyar have been battling 
alongside each other for control of the capital in the worst 
fighting in Kabul in six months. 
  More than 2,000 people have been killed or wounded since the 
fighting began on Saturday.
