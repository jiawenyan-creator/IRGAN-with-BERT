FT  31 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: European futures trade comes
of age - Non-US exchanges took the lead in a record year
In a record year for futures business, the market share of the US exchanges
relative to the rest of the world dwindled, as it has every year for the
past decade. For the first time, the combined volume of the 47 futures
exchanges outside the US exceeded that of the 15 US exchanges.
The continued shift was apparent despite historically high turnover for the
Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME),
which together traded well over 300m contracts. This preserved their places
as the top derivatives exchanges in the world.
In part, the trend reflects cyclical developments within the industry. Many
European exchanges have been operating for less than 10 years, and are still
at a stage of rapid growth, fuelled by successful new product launches. The
US market, on the other hand, is more mature, and relies on organic growth.
The faster growth of non-US markets was also driven by historically low US
interest rates, which encouraged US fund managers to diversify into overseas
markets. They used futures to hedge their underlying investments - or, in
some cases, took positions using futures, which are more liquid than some
cash markets.
'The domestic user base in the US is getting more mature, and we are
benefitting from the fact that they are looking to manage risk overseas,'
says Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of the London International Financial
Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe). At the same time, the European base
continues to expand, while Asia remains a largely untapped source of
business, he adds.
Industry experts say that to remain competitive with newer rivals, US
exchanges will have to consolidate, cut costs, and co-operate more. Attempts
in this direction failed more often than they succeeded in 1993, but US
markets prospered regardless, on a surge of global interest rate
restructuring.
Institutional participation was most marked at the CME, where overall volume
was up a modest 9 per cent at the end of November, but where open interest,
a gauge of how many positions are held for long-term hedges, ballooned to
5.6m, nearly double that of its closest competitor, Liffe.
The CME's Eurodollar futures, used extensively for hedging interest rate
swaps, saw year-to-date turnover surge to 60m contracts at the end of
November. The CME has been quietly extending delivery periods for the
instruments to accommodate over-the-counter traders, so that it is now
possible to hedge a three-month Eurodollar commitment for delivery 10 years
into the future.
Institutional interest in the CME has driven up membership prices to a
record Dollars 650,000, approaching the value of a New York Stock Exchange
seat, and widening the gap with the Chicago Board of Trade, where a seat
recently traded at Dollars 495,000. Mr Jack Sandner, the CME's chairman, is
effusive about the exchange's growth. 'All this at a time of low (US
interest rate) volatility,' he says. 'If interest rates start to rise, the
roof is going to blow off this place.'
An 18 per cent volume gain this year by the Chicago Board of Trade came on
the heels of a redistribution of US Treasury debt and flood-related crop
disasters. The CBoT had a once-in-a-decade boom in both financial and
agricultural products, with the most explosive growth occuring in its five-
and 10-year Treasury note contracts and its soya bean futures. However, the
CBoT's remarkable double-digit growth was nearly overshadowed by internal
management squabbles, renewed rivalry with the CME, and quarrels with
Reuters over the future of Globex, the electronic futures trading system.
While the CME opened a new trading floor this year to accommodate growth,
the CBoT is still struggling to replace its antiquated financial futures
trading room, a symptom, some traders say, of the exchange's inability to
plan for the future.
The New York Mercantile Exchange, the booming energy market, was the only
other US exchange to rank in the top 10 busiest futures exchanges in 1993.
Its bid to acquire the New York Commodity Exchange is still pending. If the
bid is successful, the exchanges' combined volumes - nearly 70m contracts -
could vault the Nymex back into fourth place. The strong performance by
European exchanges - with Spain's Meff and Italy's Mif also posting
impressive growth - reflected a period of unusual volatility, as currencies
within the European exchange rate mechanism came under repeated pressure.
The partial collapse of the system has encouraged more active hedging, in
both the over-the-counter and exchange-traded markets, with OTC trades
frequently offset by futures transactions.
The exception to the rule was Switzerland's Soffex, which traded 6.1m
contracts, compared with 8.6m for the same period last year.
Liffe's impressive performance, widening the gap with France's Matif, was
based on its ability to offer a broad range of European products. The
exchange managed to stave off competition from Germany's Deutsche
Terminborse (DTB) and Italy's Mif on its German and Italian interest rate
products, maintaining a market share of over 70 per cent in the key Bund
contract and increasing its share of Italian bond (BTP) futures trading from
60 per cent to 75 per cent. (Liffe traded 5.7m BTP contracts in the year to
November, up a massive 60 per cent on the previous year.)
However, there are potential problems on the horizon. Both Liffe's new
products launched this year - the Spanish bond and German medium-term bond
(Bobl) contracts - flopped. And the planned link-up between France's Matif
and the DTB also poses a threat to Liffe's dominance. While both the DTB and
the Matif say they do not plan to merge, the creation of a shared network
for trading French and German products - probably the most important
European markets - would be likely to attract at least some business away
from Liffe. If the exchanges were to merge, their combined volume is already
larger than Liffe's.
This may increase pressure on Liffe to join Globex, the troubled electronic
futures trading system developed by Reuters, the CME and the CBoT. So far,
volume on the system has been disappointing, and disputes over the running
of Globex have discouraged other exchanges (apart from the Matif, which
signed up at an early stage of development) from joining. However, the
agreement between the three backers of the system is due to be renegotiated
in April. Changes to the management of the system - currently run by the two
Chicago exchanges - are widely expected, possibly making way for new
entrants.
While continued growth in futures trading is predicted, it may be difficult
for European exchanges, as well as US exchanges, to maintain annual growth
of between 30 and 40 per cent. Most liquid bond and stock markets have
already spawned successful futures contracts, prompting exchanges to look at
more esoteric areas, such as insurance, which are unlikely to generate such
heavy volume.
Instead, industry specialists predict greater co-operation in marketing to
new users. The potential user base of European fund managers has yet to be
fully tapped, and traders report growing interest from Asia.
