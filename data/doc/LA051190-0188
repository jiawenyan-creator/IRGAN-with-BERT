WORLD; 
EMPRESS ELIZABETH OF EUROPE? 
Queen Elizabeth II should become Empress Elizabeth of Europe to ensure the 
unity of Europe, a royalist said today. 
"Monarchies are becoming more popular; there are kings and queens in Sweden, 
Spain, Norway, Holland, a grand duke in Luxembourg, and, if the public had its 
way, there would be further restorations," said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing 
director of Burke's Peerage, bible of the aristocracy. 
" 'Everybody loves a lord,' goes the phrase, and it is even truer that everyone 
loves a king even more." 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed concern last month that a united 
Europe could jeopardize Queen Elizabeth's sovereignty.
