FT  04 DEC 92 / Doubt on river grading plan
AN AMBITIOUS scheme to classify up to 10,000 stretches of river in England
and Wales into six quality classes was announced yesterday by the
government.
Water companies warned last night that the proposed statutory water quality
objectives might push customers' bills up higher.
Water companies are committed to spending up to Pounds 45bn to meet
environmental regulations - the water industry has warned that that spending
alone might double customers' bills in real terms by 2005.
Recent government figures show that while the number of serious cases of
river pollution dropped last year, the overall quality of rivers and canals
deteriorated between 1980 and 1990.
The new scheme hopes to shed light on those trends and improve quality.
In a consultation paper on river quality issued yesterday, the government
proposed classifying a trial group of about half a dozen catchment areas
next year.
Eventually most rivers or stretches of river in England and Wales will be
classified into at least one of six categories, depending on their use:
fishing; abstraction for drinking water; agricultural; industrial; special
ecosystem; and water sports. There will be six additional subclasses for
fishing rivers.
Each class will have different permitted levels of chemicals and target
levels of oxygen in the water.
The scheme will replace the present informal one based only on chemical
concentration, not on use.
