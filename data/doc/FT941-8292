FT  21 FEB 94 / Debate on worker democracy urged
Unions should reopen the debate on worker democracy in British industry, Mr
Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said at the
weekend.
He said at a London conference that schemes to increase employee involvement
should cover all workers and not just union members.
He criticised the attempt made nearly 20 years ago, spearheaded by one of
his predecessors, Mr Jack Jones, to introduce union democracy by appointing
union shop stewards to company boards. 'We failed to carry the workers with
us then,' said Mr Morris. 'We did not consult them or ask who they wanted to
represent them.'
Mr Morris said that if works councils were introduced into industry they
should not be exclusively for trade unionists. He added that workers might
well elect trade unionists to works councils, but it would be up to the
unions to convince workers to join them as members.
