  [Excerpt] Sanaa, 13 Jan (INA)--Yemeni President Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has said he intends to go to Aden, 
in the south of Yemen, to meet with Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, who has been staying in Aden since 19 August 1993. 
  In press statements aired by the Yemeni Television last 
night, Salih said he would go to Aden, Hadramawt, or al-Dali' 
out of his concern to find quick solutions to the country's 
crisis, which is burdening the Yemeni people. 
  In his statements, the Yemeni president accused for the 
first 
time some leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party, under Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, of not wanting to resort to logic 
and reason to overcome the crisis in the country. He said: I 
have realized that some of the demands are impossible and hide 
behind them a scheme, which exercises on the ground an 
undeclared secession. [passage omitted]
