FT  20 OCT 94 / Sharp decline in Mexican reserves
Mr Miguel Mancera, governor of Mexico's central bank, announced yesterday
that the country's foreign currency reserves had fallen to Dollars 17.2bn
(Pounds 10.8bn), Dollars 7.3bn less than at the end of last year.
The reduction since December follows central bank intervention to defend the
peso after the assassination of presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio and subsequent nervousness over the August presidential election.
Reserves were reported to have been as high as Dollars 28bn in early
February, indicating the extent of Bank of Mexico's support for the
currency.
Mr Mancera said at a bankers' conference in Cancun that intervention since
May had been sporadic and in small quantities and that reserves have been
relatively stable since then.
Mexico's foreign currency reserves are published only three times a year,
and are considered an important indicator of confidence in the currency.
Despite central bank intervention, the peso has lost nearly 10 per cent of
its value against the dollar this year and is now trading close to its lower
limit against the US currency.
