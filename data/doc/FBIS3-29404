  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Payments by a government- 
backed body to compensate workers for unpaid wages and severance 
pay have hit an annual record, the Labor Welfare Corp. said 
Thursday [17 February]. 
  The Labor Ministry-backed corporation told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE 
that as of February 10, fiscal 1993 payments totaled 4,032 
million yen, the highest since the corporation was established 
in 1976. 
  A total of 12,484 workers from 662 companies, mostly small 
businesses, received the benefits. 
  Payments for the year ending next March 31 are expected to
