  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic 
planner said Friday [11 March] her agency will keep watch to 
make sure that consumers are not subjected to price hikes 
because of a shortage of domestically grown rice. Manae Kubota, 
director general of the Economic Planning Agency, told a regular 
news conference that the agency is monitoring rice price trends 
to check if the supply shortage of Japanese rice is being 
translated into price hikes. 
  Kubota played down the seriousness of the alleged rice 
shortage, explaining that the government expects to secure 
stocks of three million tons of rice to meet demand in the 
coming six months. She said the three million tons comprises 
1.2 million tons in government holdings of Japanese rice, 1.7 
million tons in imports and 100,000 tons from this year's first 
harvest expected in August. 
  Consumers need not be panicky about getting rice, and should 
not rush to buy rice in excess of their needs, the EPA chief 
said. Kubota said the agency has no immediate plan to invoke a 
provision banning hoarding by rice wholesalers. 
  The government began importing rice last year to make up for 
a shortage of Japanese rice following a bad harvest.
