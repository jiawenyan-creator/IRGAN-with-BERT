TALKS BREAK DOWN ON ENDING CIVIL WAR 
Peace talks between rebels and the Sudanese government collapsed in 
disagreement over the country's Islamic legal code and other issues that have 
kept them at war for nearly seven years. "In my opinion, neither side came to 
Nairobi (Kenya) prepared to take the difficult steps necessary for peace," said 
former President Jimmy Carter, who acted as an unofficial mediator in the five 
days of talks. Both Carter and the Sudan People's Liberation Army said the 
talks failed, but the government said they were merely postponed.
