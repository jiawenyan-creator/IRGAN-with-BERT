  [Text] Details that were not put on paper but resulted from 
the agreement on unification of monetary systems signed in 
Moscow became the subject of Belarusian Finance Minister 
Stsyapan Yanchuk's interview with BELINFORM and the State 
Committee for Radio and Television. 
  During the interview, which was held on the evening of 19 
April at the House of Government, the minister stressed a number 
of points, which no one has addressed aloud. He said that 
despite the declared procedures for exchanging legal Belarusian 
tender for Russian rubles, the revaluation of key assets of 
enterprises will be conducted by all means. A correcting ratio 
will be utilized. The Republic should independently look for a 
source to settle the difference between the value of the 
Belarusian and Russian ruble for the exchange of money held in 
the savings accounts of Belarusian citizens. In addition, both 
in Russia and Belarus, a black market exchange rate for the U.S. 
dollar is used, therefore, when setting an exchange rate of 
Belarusian hares for Russian rubles, the black market exchange 
rate must be taken into consideration. 
  The finance minister also answered a variety of other 
questions.
