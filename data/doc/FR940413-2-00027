<DOCTITLE>Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


April 7, 1994.


Take notice that on April 4, 1994, Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State), tendered for filing as part
of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, First Revised Sheet No. 24, containing changes in rates for effectiveness
on January 1, 1994.
According to Granite State, the revised rates on First Revised Sheet No. 24 are applicable to its Rate Schedule LMS
(Load Management Service) which provides for swings in excess of the daily variance tolerances above or below scheduled
nominations for deliveries to its firm transportation customers under its Rate Schedule FTNN. It is further
stated that Granite State's Rate Schedule LMS service relies on a parallel daily swing service provided by Tennessee
Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) under its Rate Schedule LMSMA. Granite State further states that the rates
for its Rate Schedule LMS service are identical with and track the rates for Tennessee's underlying service. According
to Granite State, the revised rates on First Revised Sheet No. 24 track a reduction in Tennessee's rates for its Rate
Schedule LMSMA service which became effective for billing purposes on January 1, 1994.
According to Granite State, copies of its filing were served on its Rate Schedule LMS customers, Bay State Gas Company
and Northern Utilities, Inc., and the regulatory commissions of the states of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in accordance with Rules 211 and
214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests
should be filed on or before April 14, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection.
