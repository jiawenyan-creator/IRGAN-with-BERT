FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: No tax on these deals
I am neither resident nor domiciled in the UK. Are any of the following
transactions subject to UK tax?
1. Shares bought outside Britain and later sold there.
2. Shares bought in the UK and later sold there.
3. Shares bought in the UK and later sold elsewhere.
Would any of the rules be different depending on whether there are gains or
losses on the transactions?
As you are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK (and
presumably are not a Lloyd's underwriter or engaged in any trade, profession
or vocation in the UK), the answer to each of your questions is no.
