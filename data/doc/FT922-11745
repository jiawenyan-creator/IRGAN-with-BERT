FT  23 APR 92 / Li calls for reduced role of socialism
LI PENG, China's prime minister, has said the role of the state in the
socialist system must be cut back, Reuter reports from Beijing. Li, a
hardliner with close ties to elderly Communist Party conservatives, told a
group of visiting scholars that China must make 'fundamental changes in an
economic structure which has shackled the development of productive forces',
the official media reported yesterday.
His pro-market statements, made at a seminar on economic reforms on Tuesday,
are among the clearest signs to date that he is bowing to economic change as
advanced by Deng Xiaoping, 87, the paramount leader.
'The general trend in China will be for market regulation to expand greatly,
while direct planning continues to diminish,' the official New China News
Agency quoted Li as saying.
But his speech offered no concrete suggestions for reform and underlined his
determination to maintain the political strait-jacket imposed on China after
the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989. 'Structural transformation
and reform of the economic system must be implemented against a background
of political stability.'
