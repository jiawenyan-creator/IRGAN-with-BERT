  [Text] The official part of the visit to Russia by Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin started today. It is the first 
such visit in the history of relations between our two 
countries. In the morning the high-ranking guest laid a wreath 
at the tomb of the unknown soldier and honored the memory of the 
Soviet soldiers who lost their lives in the fight against 
fascism. 
  Today Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin received 
the 
Israeli prime minister. They discussed bilateral relations, the 
broadening of economic, cultural, and humanitarian cooperation, 
and international problems, including a settlement of the Middle 
East conflict. Right now the parties are signing six 
intergovernmental agreements on developing cooperation in the 
field of science and culture, the health service, and 
agriculture. The Israeli prime minister plans to meet Vladimir 
Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin, the chairmen of the chambers of the 
Russian parliament, today. Meetings are also planned with 
Russian Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Pavel Grachev. The visit 
will last four days, one of which the Israeli prime minister 
will spend in St. Petersburg, his mother's birthplace.
