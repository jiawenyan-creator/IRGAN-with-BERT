MARSH SETS UCLA RECORD IN 100 METERS 
Senior Mike Marsh set a UCLA school record of 10.07 seconds in the 100 meters 
Saturday in a nonscoring track and field meet at Gainesville, Fla. 
Marsh finished second to Florida's Dennis Mitchell, who ran 10.06 in a race 
that was just under the allowable limit for wind. 
Marsh, a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic track and field team, won the 200 in 
20.42 but was limping after the race. The Bruins' Steve Lewis, gold medal 
winner in the 400 at Seoul, also was entered in the 200 but pulled up during 
the race with a leg injury. 
They are doubtful for Saturday's dual meet at UCLA against LSU. 
Other outstanding marks at the Florida meet were a season best of 44.66 for 400 
meters by freshman Tyrone Kemp of Florida, a 195-foot toss in the discus by 
UCLA's Brian Blutreich and a 212-2 hammer throw by UCLA's Dave Wilson.
