FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: Hopping mad, but taking heart at Boots
Sir, Gordon Roddicks's slur - 'You have only to look at the customers in
Boots to know that they are not the same as ours' - made me hopping mad
('Body Shop shares fall 40 per cent on profit warning', September 17). The
two-headed monsters currently trawling round Boots for the things you can't
buy at the Body Shop (prescriptions and all proprietary medicines leap to
mind) can now take heart and pick up Boots' own-brand 'green' cosmetics with
a clear conscience.
If falling profit predictions encourage the Roddicks to look for ways to
make their chain attractive to those untermensch, could I make a couple of
suggestions? A few more polite, trained staff, particularly at the tills,
would make paying for the goods less of an assault course. And turn off that
