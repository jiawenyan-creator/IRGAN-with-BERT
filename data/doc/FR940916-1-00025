 

We concluded that a 30 minute opening schedule was not warranted, but, as a compromise, tested a 20 minute opening schedule
which would limit openings to 3 times per hour daily, year around. This test was conducted from January 1, 1994, to February
23, 1994. The results demonstrated that strong cross winds, heavy currents and shallow water adjacent to the channel
near the bridge create holding conditions for northbound vessels that could become unsafe for navigation if the opening
schedule is extended to 30 minutes. A daily 20 minute schedule would help reduce traffic delays without significantly
increasing the danger to vessels caused by the potentially unsafe holding conditions.


Discussion of Proposed Amendments


The proposed change would limit the maximum number of openings to 3 per hour with a 20 minute opening schedule. Since
the highway traffic data shows roadway congestion starts to increase in mid morning, the regulated period will be
from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. This change should reduce traffic delays without unreasonably impacting navigation.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs
with tows.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies
under section 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities.



Collection of Information


This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

)


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is
categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under
