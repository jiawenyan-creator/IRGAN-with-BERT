FT  29 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hope for Recs
Regional electricity companies (recs) advanced as the market looked beyond
the Budget and to the forthcoming results season, with its possibility of
big dividend payouts.
Analysts said worries about a possible windfall tax on excess earnings had
been discounted. And, although all ears would be on possible comments about
the future of the National Grid, investors were beginning to concentrate on
the interims, which begin with Seeboard on Thursday.
Mr Stephen Doe of Hoare Govett commented: 'We could see outstanding
dividends of up to 40 per cent from some of these companies.' Seeboard,
which has been trading around its all-time high, eased 1 1/2 to 408p.
Northern and Yorkshire, both bought actively by Swiss Bank according to
dealers, rose 22 to 809p and 10 to 721p.
