FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Banks give NHL approval to restructure
Pounds 540m of debt
NATIONAL HOME Loans, the mortgage lender and financial services group which
recently came close to collapse, has won approval from its banks for the
restructuring of loans amounting to Pounds 540m.
The group is also preparing to renegotiate the terms of its international
bond issues with bond holders.
NHL's bank lenders agreed to give the company a 90-day waiver on its loans
last February after it emerged that the troubled mortgage lender was in
danger of breaching a 'material adverse change' covenant on its loans.
The 59 banks involved have now agreed to extend the maturity of NHL's debt
and turn the four existing loans into one large facility, lead managed by JP
Morgan.
'The pricing on the loan will have increased somewhat' said Mr Jonathan
Perry, chairman of NHL, but declined to provide further details of the
margins over the London interbank offered rate, or the fees. The
restructured debt will mature on December 31 1995.
The new facility replaces four separate loans: a Pounds 176m loan which fell
due earlier this month; a Pounds 231m loan which matures in February 1993; a
Dollars 90m loan which matures in June 1993; and a Dollars 135m letter of
credit which matures next month.
NHL's difficulties stem from the weakness in the housing market and from the
problems of National Mortgage Bank, a sister company.
Last July, a group of 10 banks agreed to put up a Pounds 200m cash life-boat
for NHL after local authorities began pulling deposits out of National
Mortgage Bank in the wake of the BCCI collapse.
