FT  11 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Banking
One of the perennial problems facing banks is their inability to assess and
price risk correctly. In the 1970s banks went overboard lending on low
margins to developing countries, some nearly destroying themselves in the
process. A decade later property lending brought similar pain. The trouble
is that banks tend to develop an insatiable appetite for certain types of
business, sometimes as a type of aversion therapy for past mistakes.
Property lending, after all, offered the benefit of collateral which must
have seemed a godsend after sovereign lending. It turned out to be a dubious
advantage when borrowers ran out of cash and market values slumped. By then
loan pricing bore no relation to actual risk.
A new proposal from the London-based Centre for the Study of Financial
Innovation could go some way towards correcting this problem. Its latest
paper on capital adequacy suggests techniques commonly used for assessing
risks in the derivatives market could be applied to loan assets too.
Basically this would involve using computer models to establish the market
value of each individual loan, assessing its volatility and applying an
appropriate capital ratio.
The paper's main preoccupation is with the safety of the system. But its
proposal, which admittedly is fraught with technical difficulties, would
surely have an impact on pricing too. Banks would be forced into a subtler
measurement of risk which reflected the volatility of their income. Greater
precision in setting capital requirements would make it harder to underprice
risky business. Lending to small business might become prohibitively
expensive as a result. But the banks themselves would make fewer losses.
