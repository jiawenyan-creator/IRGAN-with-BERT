FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Conference papers gloomy
Several of the papers submitted to the TUC's conference are realistic to the
point of pessimism.
Mr David Marsden of the London School of Economics says that while too much
regulation at the bottom of the labour market might destroy jobs,
deregulation in the middle could destroy the potential for the 'co-operative
exchange' between employer and employee.
Mr Ewart Keep of Warwick University and Mr Ken Mayhew of Pembroke College,
Oxford, say that training is not the sole answer to Britain's industrial and
employment failings. They believe that Britain has a skills shortage, not
because of insufficient supply of skilled labour, but because of
insufficient demand.
Ms Patricia Hewitt of the Institute of Public Policy Research says that full
employment in 1994 must include women as well as men. But the unemployed are
trapped between a flexible labour market and an inflexible social security
system.
