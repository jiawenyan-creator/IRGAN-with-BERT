  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has played down the 
significance of an Israeli delegation receiving an invitation to 
visit Damascus, calling it too little, too late. According to 
the prime minister, the Syrians have again failed to show even 
one percent of the goodwill shown by Anwar al-Sadat when he 
proved he was ready for peace. 
  Speaking to Spanish and Portuguese reporters today before 
his 
visit to the Iberian Peninsula next week, the prime minister 
revealed that Damascus insisted that the Israeli Arab delegation 
travel without their Israeli passports. 
  [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at 
1800 
GMT on 18 February reports that "Our political correspondent 
'Imanu'el Rosen adds that sources in Jerusalem claimed that the 
initiative for the trip came from the prime minister. Knesset 
Member 'Abd-al-Wahab Darawshah, the head of the delegation, 
denied this claim, asserting that the initiative was completely 
his."]
