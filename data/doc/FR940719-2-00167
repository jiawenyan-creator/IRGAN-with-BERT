SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 182(a) of the Trade Act requires the USTR to identify foreign countries that deny adequate and effective protection
of intellectual property rights or that deny fair and equitable market access for persons that rely on intellectual
property protection. From among these identified foreign countries, the USTR must designate as ``priority foreign
countries'' those countries whose acts, policies or practices are the most onerous or egregious and have the greatest
adverse impact (actual or potential) on relevant U.S. products. Countries may not be identified as priority foreign
countries if they are engaged in good faith negotiations, or making significant progress in multilateral or bilateral
negotiations to provide adequate and effective protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights.





Although the USTR identified no priority foreign countries in the 1994 special 301 review, he did note that Argentina,
China and India presented particularly serious problems. The USTR stated that the status of each of these countries
would be revisited in 60 days, and that if satisfactory progress had not been made by that time, they would be designated
priority foreign countries.



The USTR also named trading partners to the administratively-created priority watch list and watch list. The trading
partners named to the priority watch list include the European Union, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey.
The trading partners named to the watch list include Australia, Chile, Colombia, Cyprus, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece,
Guatemala, Indonesia, Italy, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Spain, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates,
and Venezuela. Four of these trading partners_Egypt, El Salvador, Greece and the United Arab Emirates_will be subject
to out-of-cycle reviews, which are formal mid-year reviews when the USTR will determine whether the problems or practices
that resulted in those countries being placed on the list have been addressed. Finally, the trading partners warranting
special mention of their practices, but not warranting placement on a formal list, include Brazil, Canada, Germany,
Honduras, Israel, Panama, Paraguay, Russia and Singapore.
