FT  14 JAN 93 / BA faces probe by data registrar
THE government's data protection registrar has launched an investigation
into allegations that British Airways illegally gained access to Virgin
Atlantic's computer system, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Eric Howe, data protection registrar, confirmed yesterday that he had
written to Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, requesting further
details. 'We are trying to find out the facts,' he said.
His inquiry was sparked by newspaper reports of claims by Mr Branson that BA
had examined Virgin's computer data as part of a series of activities
'beyond any limits of commercially acceptable practice'.
Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, yesterday called for Lord
King, BA chairman, and Sir Colin Marshall, deputy chairman, to resign after
a 'campaign of deceit, lies and illegal activities' carried out by BA
against Mr Branson and Virgin Atlantic.
