CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
OIL SPILL BILL MUST BE WATERED DOWN 
A proposal to impose hefty fees on oil companies to build an oil spill cleanup 
fund and to make company employees and officials criminally liable for spills 
suffered a major setback in a state Senate panel. The Natural Resources 
Committee, which generally is friendly to environmental causes, approved the 
measure to keep it alive, but with the understanding that the author will 
present a new, less stringent bill. The decision upset the plans of the 
measure's Democratic backers -- Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Controller Gray 
Davis -- who wanted to move it through the Legislature quickly so oil companies 
would have less time to pick it apart.
