FT  02 OCT 92 / Observer: Blow for Punch
Has the fate of Punch, once Britain's best-known humorous magazine, been
ordained?
United Newspapers - which owns the title - has been trying to contact Bill
Tidy, a veteran cartoonist who lodged a bid for it at the end of August. He
has joined forces with Canadian physician John Cocker who is publisher of
the unlikely-sounding magazine Punch Digest for Canadian Doctors.
But with an irony worthy of the old organ, Tidy himself is away in Gibraltar
until next Tuesday. Still, Punch, which ceased publication in April, has
been around for 150 years. So it can probably wait a couple of days more for
resurrection from limbo.
