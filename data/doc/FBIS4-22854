  [Abstract] Integrals of function 
f(x[.sub]1[/],...x[.sub]n[/] along straight lines are 
called beam data. If n=2, the beam date correspond with the 
Radon transform ; this case is characteristic for classical 
computer X- ray tomography. Methods of 3-D (n=3) or even 4-D 
(n=4), the fourth coordinate can be time or wavelength with the 
tomography in the optical range. Reconstruction of function f(x) 
from its beam data is the 3-D reconstruction problem. This 
problem is meaningful for any type of tomography. Equations are 
provided for computing the Fourier transformation of uniform, 
generalized functions in a three-dimensional space. These 
formulae allow to construct effective numerical algorithms of 
tomographic 3-D reconstruction from the beam data. References 10
