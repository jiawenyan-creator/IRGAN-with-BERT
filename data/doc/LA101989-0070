EARNINGS 
AMR Corp.: The Ft. Worth-based parent of American Airlines said third-quarter 
earnings fell nearly 9% to $137 million. Chairman Robert L. Crandall said the 
fourth-quarter outlook also was "unhappy." Crandall attributed the poor 
showing, which had been expected, to an 11% jump in fuel costs and lower 
revenue per passenger mile. Revenue increased to $2.73 billion from $2.33 
billion in the same period last year.
