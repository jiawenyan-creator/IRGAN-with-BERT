  [Text] Pietermaritzburg Mar 21 SAPA -- About 2,000 inmates 
broke out of the Pietermaritzburg prison building on Monday [21 
March] evening and gathered in the prison's courtyard. 
Correctional Services spokesman Brig Chris Olckers told SAPA 
police and SA Defence Force reinforcements had been called in 
and the courtyard had been cordoned off. 
  Brig Olckers said 120 inmates had been injured after 
prisoners started rioting and destroying prison property, 
including cells, the prison radio room, the prison chapel and 
the archives room, which had been completely gutted. He said the 
inmates had broken out of various prison sections into the 
courtyard using beds to ram down walls. 
  The situation was being monitored closely as was the case at 
the Pretoria prison where extensive damage was caused at "death 
row" on Monday. Inmates had set alight 18 cells and destroyed 
bedding, furniture and computer cables, but the situation was 
under control. 
  Prisoners have embarked on protest actions countrywide, 
demanding the right to vote in the April election.
