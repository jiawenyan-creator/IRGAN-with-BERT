<F P=106> [Interview with Fausto Bertinotti, newly elected secretary </F>
of the Communist Refoundation Party, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] Fausto Bertinotti is the new secretary of the 
Communist Refoundation Party. He was elected by 160 out of 193 
delegates at the party congress last night--in other words, by 
the majority which favor opening up to the other parties on the 
left. Let us hear what Bertinotti has to say in this interview. 
  [Correspondent] Three years ago the Refoundation Party and 
the Party of the Democratic Left chose different paths. Today 
they find themselves sitting together at the table of the 
so-called progressive alliance. What is the true reason for 
this change of policy? 
  [Bertinotti] The reason for the coming together is found in 
the grave economic crisis in our country, in the failure of the 
ruling classes in this country, and the grave danger from mass 
right-wing reactionary forces. We stand together against these 
dangers; and in order to change things, a united left is 
necessary. 
  [Correspondent] You were one of the leaders of the Italian 
General Confederation of Labor [CGIL]. The number one problem 
in Italy today is unemployment. What could any future left-wing 
government do differently compared to what is being done today 
to fight this problem? 
  [Bertinotti] We would do many things differently because the 
problem of unemployment bears the stamp of what the governments 
of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and Guiliano Amato have done. This is 
why we must change; this is why we must give life to a strategy 
that will cut working hours and that will guarantee equal pay in 
order to start up the economy. There are many needs to be met, 
and there is a great need for work. 
  [Correspondent] Who is your closest ally and who is your 
most 
dangerous adversary? 
  [Bertinotti] Our closest allies are the mass movements in 
Italy, and the struggles of the workers and the students. Our 
most dangerous adversaries are people like Gianni Agnelli 
[chairman of FIAT], who want to fire workers or lay them off, or 
close factories, and like Silvio Berlusconi, who are running the 
risk of provoking an authoritarian evolution in our country. 
  [Correspondent] At the congress there emerged differences on 
the risk of sitting at the same tables as the progressives. 
There is a fear of sliding towards the moderates. 
  [Bertinotti] Of course there are risks, and the Refoundation 
Party is very alert to these dangers. The moderates will not be 
defeated by following their line. They will be defeated by 
offering an alternative.
