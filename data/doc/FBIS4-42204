  [Text] Vienna -- The recovery of the German economy is also 
having a favorable effect on Austrian foreign trade. During the 
first quarter of 1994 domestic exports to Germany rose by 2.2 
percent compared with the previous year, imports went up by 6.9 
percent. In 1993 Austria's exports to Germany experienced the 
sharpest decline since the end of the war: Compared with 1992 
they declined by 6.1 percent to 182.25 billion Austrian 
schillings [AS]. Imports from Germany declined by 8 percent to 
AS234.2 billion, according to Guenther Graf, the trade 
commissioner in Germany. 
  The recovery of the German economy could be seen already at 
the end of last year; however, its full effect will probably 
only be felt in 1995, Graf estimates. Austria's membership in 
the European Union will help to benefit from this recovery. 
  The exports of foodstuffs and beverages in particular will 
benefit from the opening up of the market. Austrian producers 
are very interested in the German market and are supported by 
the Chamber of Commerce with a concerted action program. 
  In 1993 foodstuffs and beverages were the only groups of 
products that experienced an increase despite the general 
decline in exports to Germany. The recovery of the German 
automobile industry also gives hope for an improvement to 
Austrian subcontractors.
