FT  03 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
A surge in PLATINUM prices in early Nymex trade lifted precious metal prices
in London, dealers said. The Nymex January platinum contract pushed through
resistance at Dollars 365 a troy ounce, taking spot metal above resistance
at Dollars 364 before the it fell back on profit-taking. Dealers said they
were looking for platinum to close above these levels to confirm an
extension of the rally of the past two days into a new, higher range. The
key upside target would then be Dollars 370, above which individual Japanese
investors are expected to re-enter the market. A sharp rise in TIN prices
dominated afternoon LME trading while other metals tried to stabilise after
the wide movements of the past few days, dealers said. German consumer
buying appeared to prompt short covering that took three-month through
Dollars 5,800, triggering buy stops. 'The trouble with tin is that it is
very thin and once the buy stops are satisified we could have an equally
sharp setback (today),' one trader said.
