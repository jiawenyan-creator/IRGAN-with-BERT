FT  09 SEP 94 / Berlusconi and central bank seek to end disputes
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, and the Bank of Italy
yesterday sought to bury the hatchet in a damaging two-month row over the
role of the central bank.
The peace initiative took the form of a well-publicised meeting organised
yesterday evening between Mr Berlusconi and Mr Antonio Fazio, the bank's
governor. The row has been a factor conditioning the negative sentiment
towards Italy in the financial markets that has seen the lira fall to
historic lows against the D-Mark.
The meeting was the first between the two since a formal round of
discussions which the prime minister held with leading institutional figures
in the immediate aftermath of taking office in May. Relations between the
Berlusconi government and the Bank of Italy began on an uncomfortable
footing with the search for a replacement for Mr Lamberto Dini, who left the
number two job as director-general to become treasury minister. Neither
could agree on who should be the right candidate.
The government was anxious to introduce new blood. Mr Fazio jealously sought
to preserve the central bank's autonomy and promote from within.
This gave way to increased sniping against the bank from members of the
right-wing coalition - notably from the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance.
The bank was accused of being elitist and too closely linked to the outgoing
government.
Matters were made worse by the half-point discount rate increase on August
11 at the height of the government's first lira crisis.
This provoked even more hostile attacks on the bank, including calls to
limit the term of the governor (at present unlimited), rewrite the
institution's statutes and remove Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the former
governor-turned-prime minster, from his position as honorary governor.
