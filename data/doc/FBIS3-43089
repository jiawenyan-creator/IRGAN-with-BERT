  [Abstract] The coefficients of signal spectrum logarithm 
expansion along base function systems may be used as a 
recognition signature. Feasibility of joined measurement of the 
energy and non-energy signal parameters, reflected from targets 
is analyzed. Algorithms are developed for estimating structural 
parameters applicable to the conditions of regular measurements. 
A system is examined of structural parameters for targets' 
identification. Spectrum analysis of complex signal envelopes, 
reflected from the ``i'' and ``k'' class signals indicate that 
they exhibit values of structural parameters _b_[.sup]_n_[/] 
and _a_[.sup]_n_[/]. For example, the absence of parameters 
_b_[.sup]_n_[/] and _a_[.sub]_n_[/] at _n_&gt; 2, constitute 

a characteristic feature of the spectrum of signals reflected 
from radar targets, combined in a class of single targets. 
Therefore, these parameters may be used as signatures of 
multiple-point targets in the background of single-point 
targets. References 5 Russian.
