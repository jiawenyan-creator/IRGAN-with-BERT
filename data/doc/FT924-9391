SHINING Path guerrillas yesterday killed a colonel of Peru's anti-terrorism

Reuter reports from Lima.
Five guerrillas shot Colonel Manuel Tumba in the head and back as he left
his apartment in the Surquillo district of Lima, according to police
officials. Col Tumba was administrative chief of the anti-terrorism police
(Dincote) and former head of counter-insurgency agents known as the Delta
Group.
