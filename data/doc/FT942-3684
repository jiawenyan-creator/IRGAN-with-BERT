FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Le Monde - Editorial
On one optimistic reading, these elections have been good for Europe. . .
solidly pro-European lists have, except for Italy, been reinforced.
Chancellor Kohl, to whom Europe already owes much, has held firm, while in
France the 'pro' vote has far outweighed the 'anti' vote.
But there is another more pessimistic interpretation. The new Strasbourg
parliament will be less 'European'. The level of participation in Europe
shows the rise of indifference towards the Union, and only improves when
domestic politics are most at stake - as in the desire for a change in
government in Britain, Spain, a political honeymoon period in Italy,
improvement in the German economy.
France showed itself on June 12 to be fragile, uncertain, disoriented, and
fragmented. It is being pulled apart by 'populisms'. An extreme right-wing
xenophobic nationalism continues to hang over it.
