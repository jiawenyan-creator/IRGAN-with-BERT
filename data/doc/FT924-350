FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: IRI to split SME into separate
units
IRI, Italy's largest state holding company, is planning to split its SME
foods, catering and retailing subsidiary into separate operations as a first
step to partial privatisation and dismemberment.
The proposal, which is due to be approved by an IRI shareholders' meeting
scheduled for January 7, is a vital preliminary to the disposal of some of
SME's main businesses.
The three divisions, to cover retailing and catering, frozen foods and food
production, involve a slight reshuffling of SME's current structure.
Autogrill, its catering arm, will be combined with the GS supermarkets
chain, while the Italgel frozen foods subsidiary will be split from the
other food production operations.
Union leaders, who met the managing directors of IRI and SME yesterday, said
IRI was ready to lower its stake in the retailing and catering business to
less than 50 per cent of the shares.
Separately, IRI has set out the criteria for the sale of its 67 per cent
stake in Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth-largest bank. Only bids for the
entire holding would be accepted, although bidders could make offers
individually, or in groups.
