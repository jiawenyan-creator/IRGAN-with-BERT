FT  25 MAY 93 / Observer: Paper tiger
One of the first things that accountant Ian Hay Davison needs to do when he
takes up the chairmanship of Newspaper Publishing, owners of The
Independent, is to get a wider boardroom table.
For Hay Davison, a former senior partner of Arthur Andersen, is a 'restless
man', according to The Independent's company historian, Stephen Glover. The
latter should know, since Hay Davison 'frequently lashed out' at Glover's
shins (unconsciously, of course) when the two of them used to sit around the
Indy's boardroom table. Hay Davison's other failing, according to Glover, is
that he often gets people's names wrong. Indeed, Glover was so irritated by
this that that, when he told Hay Davison that he was resigning, he insisted
on saying 'Goodbye George'. Vicious stuff.
