  [Text] Moscow February 10 TASS--"I support a multistructure 
economy and claim that our country should have both large 
agricultural enterprises and small farms," Russian Central Bank 
Governor Viktor Gerashchenko said here on Thursday, addressing 
the Fifth Congress of Russian Farmers. 
  Speaking of banking activities last year, the governor 
admitted that the bank made substantial mistakes which 
aggravated the economic situation of both farmers and the 
agro-industrial complex as a whole. 
  "This year," he said, "a decision was taken to grant a delay 
up to the end of this year to agricultural producers from paying 
interest on issued credits." In Gerashchenko's opinion, this 
will defuse somewhat the difficult financial situation in the 
countryside.He supported congress delegates who favoured the 
establishment of peasants' banks in Russia and promised every 
kind of support on his part. 
  Former Russian Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar challenged a 
thesis, 
now in vogue, on the equality of all forms of farming in the 
countryside. Gaydar stressed that, taking into account unequal 
starting conditions in the first years of their operation, 
farmers cannot compete with big agricultural producers. 
  Mindful of this, the present government, he said, "should 
give farmers greater support", including that for establishing 
peasants banks. There is no need for new bright ideas, Gaydar 
continued, since Russia has already the agricultural bank's 
network. 
  It is only necessary to create adequate conditions and grant 
privileges at the initial stage in issuing both long-term and 
short- term credits for the countryside, he added. 
  In Gaydar's opinion, the present government should continue 
previous work to liberalise the export of Russian agricultural 
produce and to take additional moves to establish a land market.
