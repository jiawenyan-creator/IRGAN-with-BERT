FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Ralston Purina after-tax profit
down at 9-month stage
RALSTON Purina, the St Louis-based consumer products company which recently
acquired the UK Ever Ready battery business from Hanson, has reported a
Dollars 68.4m third-quarter, after-tax profit.
This represents a small fall from the Dollars 70.7m seen in the same period
a year earlier, and was scored on sales of Dollars 1.86bn (Dollars 1.76bn).
The damage was done by an extraordinary item; earnings before tax and
extraordinary items were up from Dollars 116.8m to Dollars 124.4m.
For the first nine months, net profits were Dollars 285.2m, against Dollars
304.4m, on sales of Dollars 5.75bn, up from Dollars 5.54bn.
Ralston said its food businesses - both human and pet products - produced
lower operating profits in the quarter and in the nine-month period.
Pet food suffered from higher advertising and promotional costs and an
unfavourable sales mix; lower bread volumes hit Continental Baking, the
baking subsidiary due to be demerged; and cereals, despite improving in the
third quarter, still showed lower profits for the nine months.
However, other consumer products showed significant increases. Ever Ready
did well in its domestic market, although reduced European results dogged
the international division.
