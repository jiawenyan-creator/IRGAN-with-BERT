FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ford drives Honda out of US top
spot
FORD Motor claimed a symbolic victory over Japan when its Taurus mid-sized
car narrowly beat the Honda Accord to be the top-selling car in the US in
1992. The Accord has held the number one position since 1989.
Ford's recapture of the top spot will be taken as a further sign of the
renewed competitiveness of the US motor industry against Japanese rivals,
which was indicated yesterday by 1992 sales figures for the US vehicle
industry as a whole.
Japanese manufacturers saw their share of the US car market dip to 30 per
cent, from 31 per cent, the first reversal in several years.
Ford's car market share rose to 21.6 per cent from 19.9 per cent but ailing
General Motors dipped to 34.5 per cent from 35.4 per cent and Chrysler was
lower at 8.3 per cent, compared with 8.5 per cent.
In the combined car and light truck market, the Japanese share dipped to 24
per cent from 26 per cent due to some strong US products and tariff
barriers.
The Ford Taurus, relaunched in the autumn of 1991 sold 409,751 units, up
from 299,700, while the Honda Accord dipped to 393,477 from 399,297.
However, Ford's victory was only achieved by offering big discounts and
cheap lease finance to customers. The drive began in August and reached a
peak last month as the company scrambled to close the gap with Honda,
offering even more lavish incentives, including rebates to dealers willing
to put additional Tauruses into their demonstration fleets.
Honda replied with cheap financial packages of its own.
Ford was helped by its far greater number of dealer outlets across the US -
some 4,300 to Honda's 1,000 - and while Honda's sales go mainly to retail
customers, a large proportion of Tauruses go to fleet buyers, such as rental
companies.
