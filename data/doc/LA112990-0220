DIAMOND BAR TO INTERVIEW HOPEFULS FOR HORCHER SEAT 
The City Council meets today to interview candidates for the seat 
Assemblyman-elect Paul Horcher will vacate Monday. 
Under guidelines established earlier this month, each council member was 
allowed to submit two names to the city clerk. 
The candidates -- several of whom wrote the council members seeking nomination 
-- will be collectively interviewed this afternoon, and the council will make 
the appointment at its regular meeting Tuesday. 
By midday Wednesday, six candidates had been named. They are: 
* Clair Harmony 50, who owns a finance company and publishes a public 
administration newsletter, was nominated by Mayor Gary Werner. 
* Lydia Plunk, 35, a homemaker active in community affairs, was also nominated 
by Werner. 
* Don Nardella, 41, an attorney who currently serves on the city's Parks and 
Recreation Commission, nominated by Mayor Pro Tem John Forbing. 
* Joe Anthony, 44, an oral surgeon and former member of the state Board of 
Dental Examiners, was nominated by Horcher, who was permitted to nominate but 
will not vote. 
* Cindee Quan, 40, a teacher who currently serves on the city's General Plan 
Advisory Committee, was also nominated by Horcher. 
* Gary Miller, 42, a land banker and former councilman, was nominated by 
Councilman Jay Kim.
