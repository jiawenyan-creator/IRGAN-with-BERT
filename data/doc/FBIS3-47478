  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Ruling coalition parties 
came up with a proposal Thursday [13 January] to increase 
transparency in Japan's construction market and secure greater 
access for foreign firms, an official said. 
  The coalition parties asked Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
through the Cabinet Secretariat to use the plan in its program 
to help improve the nation's public works bidding systems, said 
Seiji Maehara of the Japan New Party. 
  A project team from the ruling parties on bidding systems 
for 
Japan's public works projects, headed by Maehara, came up with 
the proposal and won approval from coalition policymakers 
Thursday. 
  The ruling parties' proposal calls for an open bidding 
system 
for large-scale public works projects and "objectivity, 
fairness, equality and openness" in bidding for smaller projects 
that would not be subject to open bidding, Maehara told a news 
conference. 
  He said the ruling parties' panel thrashed out its proposal 
in time for cabinet approval of the government's action program 
expected next Tuesday before the January 20 deadline of 
potential sanctions from the United States. 
  "Given the situation, we had to ask the government to 
include 
the ruling parties' views (in the action program)," he said. 
  The ruling parties' project team did not specify the size of 
public works projects that are subject to open bidding. 
  It also failed to show any proposal on a possible halt to 
preferential treatment for U.S. construction firms in bidding 
for Japan's major public works projects. 
  But the panel acknowledged the need to eliminate 
discrimination against foreign participants in public works 
bidding in Japan, Maehara said.
