FT  23 JUN 93 / Job problems persist in confident Midlands
JOB PROSPECTS in the west Midlands hinge on the performance of medium-sized
companies rather than the small-business sector, a survey of the regional
economy published today shows.
The survey of more than 1,000 companies by Price Waterhouse, accountants,
with the Warwick and Wolverhampton Business Schools, shows that 25 per cent
of medium-sized businesses have reported staff increases, compared with 12
per cent of small companies and 19 per cent of large companies.
Job prospects remain gloomy, however. Nearly half the companies expect their
employment needs to decrease, while 33 per cent expect to recruit more
labour in the second half of the year.
There are also the first signs of a skill-shortage problem in the region.
Last winter 41 per cent of companies found it easy to recruit needed skills.
This proportion has now fallen to 35 per cent. The number of companies
reporting recruitment problems since last winter has risen from 8 per cent
to 12 per cent.
These concerns appear against a background of sharply rising business
confidence, with 49 per cent of companies reporting better sales and 77 per
cent expecting improved trading conditions over the next six months. Indeed,
more companies are looking forward to future growth than at any time in the
past three years.
