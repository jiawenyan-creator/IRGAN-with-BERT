  [Text] Port Sudan, 31 Jan (SUNA) -- The president of the 
republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, has said that the 
government will not be indifferent toward Garang, who has 
rejected peace and would not heed the voice of reason and come 
to negotiations. He pointed out that the Armed Forces and the 
People's Defense Forces were capable of protecting the homeland 
and deterring those who intended to cause it harm. 
  He said this yesterday when addressing a big rally at Port 
Sudan, Eastern State, on the occasion marking the promotion of 
5,000 recruits of the People's Defense Force. He affirmed that 
the revolution from the outset had declared that it would 
surrender power to the people. It had now undertaken to 
redivide the states, following acceptance by the states' 
salvation committees, representatives of the governorates and 
local councils in a conference recently held in Khartoum on the 
basis of a new vision. Al-Bashir saluted the people of the Red 
Sea area for their bold stand and unity.
