FT  21 NOV 94 / Markets: The fight for the dollar - Global Investor
It is Thanksgiving Week in both the US and Japan, and currency markets will
have an opportunity, over the turkey and the sake, to review the latest
developments in the struggle for the dollar.
Last week, the ailing currency received assistance from two quarters.
The Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates by 75
basis points on Tuesday was backed up by the release of trade figures on
Friday showing a slight fall in the US deficit with Japan. But after a brief
rally on both days, the doubts set in again, and with good reason.
The key to any dollar recovery remains the disequilibrium in the balance of
payments between the US and Japan.
That imbalance creates, in turn, a mismatch between world supply of, and
demand for, dollars.
The US currency's over-supply is caused principally by a growing funding
requirement in the US balance of payments and a lack of demand for the
dollars that are consequently being poured out into the world's financial
markets.
Without either a sharp fall in the supply of dollars or a sharp increase in
demand for them, there will be no respite.
It is worth examining the development of this supply/ demand disequilibrium
in some detail.
The US current account deficit declined at the end of the 1980s, as slower
growth cut imports.
In 1991 the deficit hit bottom - in fact it was almost eliminated - thanks
largely to once-only transfers received during and immediately after
Operation Desert Storm. But since then, the gap has widened again. Last year
it was back in 12 figures, and in the first half of 1994 was Dollars 69bn.
For the full year it is expected to reach Dollars 150bn - its highest since
1987.
The primary cause of the deterioration has been the unsynchronised nature of
the global recovery - the US economy, growing at an annual rate of more than
4 per cent for nearly two years, has sucked in imports, while US exporters
have struggled in weak overseas markets.
This decline in the trade and current accounts has meant dollars have been
flooding the currency markets.
But while in the past those outflows have been funded by long-term capital
inflows, the capital account has now added to the funding gap.
Even at the peak of the deficit in 1987, net inward direct investment and
portfolio investment accounted for almost two thirds of the current account
deficit. But last year, for the first time for more than a decade, both
portfolio investment and direct investment represented net outflows.
The combined effect of deficits on both the current and long-term capital
account left the US with an exter-nal funding requirement, met by inflows of
short-term, 'hot' money, of more than Dollars 150bn, a figure much higher
than at any time in the deficit years of the 1980s.
The counterpart to all those dollars is, of course, a scarcity of Japanese
yen. In Japan the picture is a mirror image of the US problems. The current
account surplus, though falling slightly this year in yen terms, is rising
still in US dollars as a result of the J-curve effect - the higher price of
exports initially outweighing the slight fall in demand for them. And in the
past three years the absence of Japanese investors from world markets has
meant the country has been running an additional surplus on its capital
account.
With no early sign of a significant slowdown in demand growth, US imports
will continue to grow until well into next year. And even though rising
demand abroad will help exports, the high level of capacity utilisation in
the US will make it difficult for exporters to respond to those
opportunities. So the trade deficit seems set to rise further.
More troubling in the longer term is that the rest of the current account is
being weakened by large outflows of investment income. The United States'
change in the 1980s to the status of debtor nation means that for the first
time since 1914 the volume of debts overseas will push the US into deficit
on this account - by about Dollars 5bn this year and more in the years
ahead.
In Japan the trade surplus is set to fall only gradually. Strong growth
overseas, particularly in Asian markets, is helping exports, and will
largely offset higher imports as the economy recovers. Overseas investment
adventures in the 1980s will produce a significant surplus on the investment
income line of the current account - as much as Dollars 60bn a year by the
end of the decade, according to some estimates.
Since the current account is unlikely, therefore, to show any sharp
improvement in the next year or two, the dollar's movement depends on the
capital account. That account is, of course, both the problem and the
solution to it. If foreigners, principally Japanese, can be persuaded to
invest in stocks and bonds in the US, there is a chance that the weight of
excess supply will be diminished. But can they?
Two things will make Japanese investors return to US assets - either a
further fall in the dollar to the point from which they believe it can only
rise, or a higher relative return on US assets. While yields on US bonds and
even equities have been rising as prices have fallen, the relative increase
has been much smaller, as Japanese yields have also risen. The return on the
US long bond has risen by a little under 3 per cent in a year, but in Japan,
the yield on the equivalent bond has gone up by nearly 2 per cent. The
differential yield on equities is similar, since in the past four months,
Japanese share prices have fallen faster than US ones.
But surely higher short-term rates in the US will entice Japanese investors.
In the past, according to Mr Ronald Leven of Morgan Guaranty in New York, a
short-term interest rate differential between the US and Japan of at least
300 basis points has been necessary to prompt a sustained upturn in the
dollar. Last week's move by the Fed put the spread at just above that level.
But the current steep US yield curve acts as a disincentive to Japanese
investors, who need a much flatter yield curve if they are to currency-hedge
any bond purchases
More important, Japanese institutional investors have become much more
risk-averse since their debacles overseas in the late 1980s. Many of them
continue to see the weight of dollar supply as too large a downside risk for
dollar assets. They prefer to wait for a further fall in the US currency
before they are prepared to end their investment strike.
