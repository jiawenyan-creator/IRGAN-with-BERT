  [Text] Visiting Bruneian Foreign Minister Prince Mohamed 
Bolkiah willl hold talks with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai this 
morning at 1000 at the government house. The Bruneian foreign 
minister arrived in Bangkok yesterday for a three-day working 
visit as guest of Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri. Accompanied 
by his consort, Prince Mohamed Bolkiah will have an audience 
with his majesty the king this afternoon at Chitlada Villa. 
  Brunei is now Thailand's fourth largest trading partner in 
ASEAN. Trade balance between the two countries has been in 
Brunei's favor. Major Thai exports to Brunei are agricultural 
products while imports from that country mainly include oil and 
petroleum products. 
  Brunei is a major labor market for Thailand. About 21,000 
Thai workers have so far been employed in that country, and the 
number is on the rise because of growing demand for Thai labor. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong visited Brunei last year, and the 
ongoing visit by his Bruneian counterpart is a return visit as 
well as to strengthen relations between the two countries.
