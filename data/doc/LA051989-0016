RABIN RULES OUT GOOD-WILL MOVE FOR PALESTINIANS 
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Thursday ruled out good-will gestures to 
improve conditions in the occupied territories and to encourage Palestinians to 
accept Israel's peace plan. 
Speaking on the eve of a 10-day visit to the United States, Rabin said Israel 
is not now ready to release prisoners, reopen universities and public schools 
or take other measures to improve the climate as the uprising by Palestinians 
in the occupied lands stretches into its 18th month. 
"The present situation leaves no room for gestures," Rabin said in an 
interview. 
Rabin specifically ruled out releasing large numbers of the 6,300 Palestinian 
security prisoners or reopening 11 Palestinian universities and colleges in the 
West Bank with a total enrollment of 17,000. They have been closed since 
February, 1988. 
He said two attempts were made to restart classes at 1,194 grade schools and 
high schools in the West Bank. But he said violent clashes immediately began 
between students and soldiers. 
"Once the schools were closed, there was a sharp reduction in the number of 
youngsters who were injured or worse," he said. 
Rabin suggested that Israel might be willing to show flexibility on the 
election participation of 140,000 East Jerusalem Arabs, international 
supervision and other unresolved questions about balloting if Palestinians 
first indicated agreement in principle to Israel's proposal. 
"If there will be acceptance in principle of (the plan) by Palestinians in the 
territories, we can go on and tackle other problems which are related to the 
matter of elections," he said.
