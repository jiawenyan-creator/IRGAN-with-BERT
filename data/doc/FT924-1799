FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sanderson Elect ahead to Pounds 2.8m
Pre-tax profits moved ahead at Sanderson Electronics, driven by a vigorous
performance in the UK which enabled the Sheffield-based computing services
company to shrug off losses at General Automation, the US computer
manufacturer in which it has a 49 per cent stake, writes Alan Cane.
Turnover for the year to September 30 increased to Pounds 21.4m (Pounds
20.5m) in difficult trading conditions, but profits rose 17 per cent to
Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.4m). Earnings per share were 24p (19.2p).
The market discounted the results, marking the shares down 46p to 226p,
after a 30p rise on Monday. The company declared a first interim dividend of
5.4p. For the present year, dividends totalling 9p have already been paid.
Analysts are looking for profits of Pounds 3.9m next year and believe the
shares are underpriced.
