MOVIE REVIEWS / L.A. FESTIVAL; 
FOREIGN CLASSICS HIGHLIGHT WEEKEND 
Following are reviews of selected screenings in the Los Angeles Festival's 
final weekend: 
The Realm of Fortune 
Mexico 
Sunday at 8 p.m., Melnitz Theater, UCLA 
 This 1986 social melodrama has the inevitability of a nightmare. 
Director Arturo Ripstein's tale -- from a Juan Rulfo story -- shows a truly 
horrifying rise, decline and fall: a sentimental, bumbling, childishly selfish 
town crier becomes a swaggering cockfighter, seducer and high-stakes gambler. 
But his wealth proves more squalid than his poverty. . . . Ripstein, with 
corrosive cunning, traps his protagonist in a quagmire of fetid success, a 
no-exit of splendid misery. The movie has a hypnotic rhythm, wonderfully seedy 
decor, and a crazy fairy-tale inevitability; some of Ripstein's jokes are as 
savage as Bunuel's. MICHAEL WILMINGTON
