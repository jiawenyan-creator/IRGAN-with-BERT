FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: Pioneer in reverse but payout
held
PIONEER International, the Australian building products and energy group, is
holding its dividend at 15 cents a share in spite of a 15.2 per cent fall in
net profit to ADollars 151.6m (USDollars 102.4m). Revenues rose 4.3 per cent
to ADollars 5.36m, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The figures reflected a 32 per cent fall to ADollars 149.2m in pre-tax
contribution from building products, partially offset by a 3.2 per cent lift
to ADollars 194.1m in contribution from the Ampol petroleum division.
