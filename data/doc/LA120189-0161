SHORT TAKES; 
BURNETT, ANDREWS SHARE BOND 
Carol Burnett and Julie Andrews say that coming from homes with alcoholic 
parents gives them a shared emotional background that has made them great 
friends. 
In Sunday's issue of Parade magazine, Burnett and Andrews say they have 
discovered an almost spiritual tie between them. 
"If I believed in reincarnation, I'd say we were sisters in a previous life," 
Andrews said. 
"Whaddaya mean, chum? I think we're sisters now!" Burnett replied. 
"We're both caretakers," Burnett said. "You see, what Julie and I now realize 
is that we were initially drawn to each other because . . . I hope I'm not 
talking out of turn, but we're both adult children of alcoholics." 
Andrews confirmed the link between them, saying: "I know Carol's family 
situation was far, far worse, but I think both of us grew up with the same 
kinds of needs and insecurities." 
"As adults, Julie and I both try to control situations because as children we 
were trying to cope with what was essentially an uncontrollable problem," 
Burnett said. 
The two will appear in a television special to be broadcast Dec. 13 on ABC.
