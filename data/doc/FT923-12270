FT  20 JUL 92 / New Algerian government
ALGERIAN Prime Minister Belaid Abdesselam formed a 22-strong government
yesterday, naming new men to the key oil and interior ministries in a
country hit by debt and shaken by unrest, Reuter reports from Algiers.
Twelve days after taking over from Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, the new prime
minister appointed Mr Hacen Mefti to head the energy portfolio and Mr
Mohamed Hardi as interior minister.
A notable departure was General Laarbi Belkheir, former President Chadli
Benjdedid's right-hand man, as interior minister.
Mr Abdesselam kept the key economy portfolio himself.
