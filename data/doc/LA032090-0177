THE SIDELINES; 
DAVIS CUP TEAM DROPS CASH 
Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash was dropped from the Australian Davis Cup 
team today by its captain, Neale Fraser. 
The four-man squad will face New Zealand in a World Group quarterfinal on March 
30 through April 1. 
Fraser said last Wednesday that Cash was under consideration for both singles 
and doubles in the quarterfinals, which will be played on a grass court at the 
Milton Tennis Center. Cash had not won a singles match for almost a year after 
undergoing surgery to repair an Achilles' tendon. His world ranking fell from 
fourth in May, 1988, to 627th. 
Fraser chose Mark Kratzmann to replaced the former Wimbledon champion.
