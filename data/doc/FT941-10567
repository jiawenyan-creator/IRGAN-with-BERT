FT  09 FEB 94 / Publican wins beer purchase test case
Publicans engaged in a long-running campaign against the terms of their
leases with Inntrepreneur, the joint venture between Courage and Grand
Metropolitan, yesterday won a significant victory in a High Court test case,
John Mason writes.
An application by Courage for a injunction to ban Midlands tenant Mr Martin
Bayliss from breaking the terms of his lease in buying half his beer stocks
from wholesalers at cheaper prices, was refused by Mr Justice Morritt.
The ruling could spark similar actions from other Inntrepreneur tenants
dissatisfied with their leases. Up to 200 other tenants are understood to be
considering action.
The ruling will remain until the European Commission reaches a decision
later this year on whether the UK's brewery tie system is legal under
European competition law.
Mr Bayliss had claimed that the terms of his lease, requiring him to buy all
beer direct from the brewers, made it impossible to buy stock and pay rent
on his Solihull pub. If able to buy at discounted prices, he could save
Pounds 10,000 a year, he told the court.
