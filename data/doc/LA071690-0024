POP MUSIC; 
EXEMPLARY BLUES-ROCK FROM MICK TAYLOR 
Remember Mick Taylor? 
In case you've forgotten, Taylor is the superb blues guitarist who played with 
John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in the late '60s and rose to fame when he replaced 
Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones. 
Since leaving the Stones in the mid '70s, Taylor has surfaced occasionally, 
with different bands or playing guest spots on albums or on movie scores. He's 
never gotten the acclaim he deserves, but whenever he plays the real blues-rock 
fans turn up. 
In the first of two shows at the Palomino on Friday, Taylor showed that he's 
one of the greats of the genre. He played an exemplary set -- mostly raunchy, 
Chicago-style blues with solid rock underpinnings. He and his four backing 
musicians' lengthy instrumental jams, sprinkled with vocals, were tautly 
constructed and never meandered. 
It was the kind of set that, while common in the rock scene in the late '60s 
and most of the '70s, is rarely heard anymore -- highlighted by driving beats; 
tight, faultless accompaniment; cleverly interwoven ideas; and dexterous lead 
guitar. 
But this wasn't dinosaur music. Taylor and his band played the creaky old 
standard "Red House," infusing it with a freshness and enough illuminating 
moments to make it sound almost brand new. DENNIS HUNT
