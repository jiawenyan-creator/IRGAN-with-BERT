FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Delay for O&amp;Y debt restructuring
plan
AN Ontario bankruptcy court yesterday postponed until Friday formal approval
of Olympia and York Developments' massive debt restructuring plan on its
Canadian assets, Reuter reports from Toronto.
Court approval - which would effectively allow O&amp;Y to emerge from eight
months of court protection from creditors - was postponed to allow creditors
to consider a legal motion introduced yesterday by Citibank of Canada in
opposition to the restructuring of an O&amp;Y unit, GW Utilities.
Citibank Canada, which voted in favour of the plan because of its claims on
GW Utilities, said in its motion said that a reorganisation of GW Utilities
was unfair. Citibank said it was not trying to overturn the whole plan, but
only the reorganisation.
Under the plan, O&amp;Y would privatise 89.5 per cent-owned GW Utilities by
buying the outstanding shares.
