A staff member at Robert Morris College in Pittsburgh twice in 14 years paid 
apartment rents for athletes who had been kicked out of dormitories, the school 
has informed the NCAA. 
Four athletes were involved, none of whom are currently at the college. One 
incident lasted five months, the other three months, according to college 
president Edward Nicholson. 
Nicholson did not think the violations were major, but would not discuss them 
in detail until the NCAA reviewed the report.
