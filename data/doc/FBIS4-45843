  [Text] Jinan, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Shandong Province has 
become China's first province to be basically free from leprosy. 
  According to the Ministry of Public Health, the province 
also 
took the lead in the country in wiping out kala-azar, filariasis 
and malaria. 
  According to historical data, this coastal province in east 
China has had a history of leprosy of 2,500 years. 
  A survey in 1960 found that the incidence of leprosy reached 
0.1 percent in 16 counties and 0.01 percent to 0.1 percent in 74 
counties. 
  To wipe out the infectious disease, the Shandong provincial 
government has set up 79 special leprosy control and treatment 
organizations since 1955. These organizations have employed 
1,691 people. 
  While launching massive publicity on the elimination of 
leprosy, these organizations have carefully ferreted out leprosy 
cases and effectively studied and treated the diseases over the 
past four decades. 
  By the end of last year the province had cured 39,654 
leprosy 
cases. 
  Shandong now has 255 patients under treatment. 
  Its incidence of leprosy over the past five years has 
dropped 
below 0.5 per 100,000 people, reaching the standard set by the 
Ministry of Public Health.
