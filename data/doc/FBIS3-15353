  [Text] Moscow, 3 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- The participants in the 
1 March meeting of the Coordinating Consultative Committee of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CCC CIS) "in principle 
approved the proposal to consider Ukraine an associate member of 
the CIS Economic Union." They instructed experts to complete 
work on an agreement on the conditions for Ukraine to join the 
Economic Union as an associate member before the upcoming joint 
meeting of the heads of states and governments of the 
Commonwealth, which is expected to be held on 31 March. 
  Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, commenting on 
the essence of this decision, stressed that when the Economic 
Union is discussing various questions, Ukraine will have the 
right to vote on those problems on which Ukraine has already 
ratified agreements within the CIS framework. During 
discussions of other questions Ukraine will have only the right 
of a consultative opinion. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin considers that "there will be no 
particular 
restrictions on Ukraine's activities within the framework of the 
Economic Union." He also noted that "Ukraine has moved further 
toward full membership than toward classical associate status." 
He considers that Ukraine's associate status in the CIS 
Economic Union is connected to a considerable extent with its 
internal political situation (the ratification of these 
documents will evidently be carried out by the next parliament). 
That is why Ukraine's associate status is a temporary 
situation, he explained. 
  Replying to a question about the possible time-scale for 
Ukraine to join the CIS Economic Union, Aleksandr Shokhin said 
that "this depends on Ukraine itself." He expressed the opinion 
that in order to have full and equal economic cooperation within 
the framework of the CIS, it is necessary for Ukraine "to smooth 
out" its economic policy and to overcome the trend toward 
hyperinflation.
