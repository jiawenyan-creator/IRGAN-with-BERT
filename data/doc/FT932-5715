FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: US insurer buys life side of
Aetna UK
NEW YORK LIFE, the large US life company which moved into the UK insurance
market when it acquired the Windsor Life group in 1989, is buying the life
insurance operations of Aetna UK, part of another big US insurance combine.
The operations which are changing hands comprise a mixture of life, health
and disability income insurance, and take in the second-largest provider of
employee benefits in the UK.
No purchase price for the deal was disclosed, but assets supporting the
operations total about Dollars 400m. The transaction is dependent on UK
regulatory approvals.
Aetna UK is part of Aetna Life and Casualty, the large US composite insurer.
Aetna said yesterday it would continue to run its remaining UK operations.
Yesterday's deal is the second acquisition made by Windsor Life since it
came under New York Life's control. In 1992, it purchased Gresham Life
Assurance.
