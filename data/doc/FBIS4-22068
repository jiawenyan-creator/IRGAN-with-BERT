  [Text] Special Prosecutor for Terrorist Crimes Daniel 
Espichan Tumay today categorically rejected any interference 
from foreign organizations in judging Peruvian laws for fighting 
against terrorism. And in reference to the comments made by 
President Alberto Fujimori, he said the demands of Amnesty 
International will not be met. [begin recording] 
  Espichan: Why do we have to accept orders from 
foreigners, from people who are not aware of our problems or of 
what we have to do? I believe that here in Peru we have very 
intelligent people, well educated people, who know the problem 
of terrorism. We therefore don't have to accept any indications 
from anyone. We are handling the situation ourselves, and are 
winning this war. I therefore believe that the instructions 
given by the president are correct. 
  Unidentified reporter: Does the fact that they 
were not allowed to meet with some officials mean abroad that 
something was being hidden? 
  Espichan: No, because the International Red 
Cross, which is a very important world organization, is 
authorized by law to visit the inmates held on charges of 
terrorism in Peru, and they can give the necessary information 
to any international organization that wants to verify the 
situation of the terrorists. [end recording]
