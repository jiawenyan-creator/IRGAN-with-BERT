S&amp;L '89 RED INK HITS RECORD $19.2 BILLION; 
THIFT INDUSTRY: MOST LOSSES OCCURRED IN INSTITUTIONS ALREADY TAKEN OVER OR 
TARGETED FOR GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER. 
The nation's savings and loans lost $19.2 billion in 1989, the worst 
performance ever and the third consecutive record, the government said today. 
With a $6.5-billion loss in the final three months of the year, red ink for all 
of 1989 easily topped the previous record of $13.4 billion in 1988. That had 
topped what was then a record of $7.8 billion in 1987. 
But James Freund, acting chief economist of the Office of Thrift Supervision, 
offered a glimmer of hope for this year, pointing out that the bulk of the 
losses occurred at institutions either taken over by the government or targeted 
for takeover. 
"I would presume by this time next year . . . the industry would be smaller and 
the losses would be smaller," he said. 
In the fourth quarter, for instance, the 485 institutions either under 
government control or targeted for government control compiled all the 
industry's losses while the rest of the industry, 2,393 S&amp;Ls, actually 
posted a slight profit of $28 million. 
The government's numbers also revealed the cost of the government's slow start 
in shutting down failed institutions. Losses on operations for the 485 totaled 
$2.6 billion in the October-December period -- an average loss of $29 million a 
day. 
Once these institutions are shut down or sold, the industry will no longer have 
to absorb that continuing expense. Since August, the government has disposed of 
52 S&amp;Ls and announced plans recently to close or sell another 140 by the 
end of June. 
Thrift industry deposits totaled $946 billion at the end of 1989, down $26 
billion from a year earlier. Most of the shrinkage occurred as institutions 
sold off assets in order to meet tough new financial standards enacted last 
August. 
The number of institutions open -- both failed and solvent -- totaled 2,878, 
down from 2,949 a year ago and from a peak of 3,246 in 1985. 
"1989 was clearly a year of substantial change and retrenchment for the thrift 
industry," Freund said.
