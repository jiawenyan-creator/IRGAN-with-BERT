  [Text] China's embassy in Wellington has protested strongly 
against New Zealand's decision to grant residence to up to 600 
Chinese dissidents. The embassy first secretary, (Wu 
Changshui), said China had no objection to legal immigration, 
but the decision by the New Zealand Government was linked with 
Chinese internal affair and not in keeping with the facts. He 
said it was entirely unacceptable to China. 
  Permanent residency status has been given to up to 600 
Chinese students who fear going back to China since the 1989 
crushing of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. The Chinese 
Students Association in Wellington says it welcomes New 
Zealand's decision and says it believes the Chinese granted 
residency will make a part of the contribution to New Zealand's 
economy and culture.
