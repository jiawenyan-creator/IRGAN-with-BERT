WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD; 
5 NAMED TO SAFETY PANEL 
The City Council has appointed five members to the newly created Public Safety 
Commission. 
The commission was established last fall partially in response to frequent 
complaints that local sheriff's deputies had engaged in anti-gay behavior. 
Besides serving as a forum for citizen comments on law-enforcement issues, the 
panel will also deal with fire prevention and disaster preparedness. 
The new members of the panel are: Christopher L. Fairchild, Aslan Brooke, Norma 
Kemper, Bronwen McGarva and John Altschul. 
Nancy Greenstein, assistant to the city manager, said that the panel will 
probably meet once a month but that no official guidelines for its operation 
have been adopted.
