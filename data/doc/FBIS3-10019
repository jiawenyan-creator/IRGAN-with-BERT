  [Excerpts] Brasilia -- During a conversation with deputies 
-- among them the PT [Workers Party] deputy for Rio Grande do 
Sul, Paulo Paim -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
said that despite the fact that the Social Emergency Fund 
amendment has not been promulgated, implementation of the 
provisional measure that will enforce the URV [Real Value Unit], 
which will be announced on 28 February, will cause public 
servant salaries to drop. This will happen because the current 
public servant salary policy adjusts salaries for only 50 
percent of inflation every two months. Therefore, at the time of 
conversion into URV's, the average value of the four previous 
months will include that inflationary loss, which will not be 
compensated for. 
  Like in the private sector, public servant salaries will be 
calculated on the basis of the average of the past four months. 
Despite the fact that public sector salaries were increased 192 
percent in January, at their collective agreement renewal date, 
salaries dropped very steeply in December, and this should have 
a negative influence on the average value. According to the 
current salary policy, public sector salaries should have been 
increased by 50 percent of the IRSM [minimum salary readjustment 
index], which would have been equivalent to a final increase of 
45 to 50 percent. Under URV regulations, however, public servant 
salaries will be increased only 20 or 25 percent. 
  This will produce a loss equivalent to approximately the 
inflation rate of one month, special Finance Ministry adviser 
Edmar Bacha admitted during a meeting with PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party] deputies and senators in Congress. 
  Economic team advisers assured, however, that contrary to 
what has occurred on other occasions, February's inflation rate 
will not be absorbed by the government stabilization plan. The 
calculation of average salary values for conversion into URV's 
will take into account this month's inflation rate, a technician 
has explained. [passage omitted] 
  During the conversation with Paim, Cardoso assured that the 
conversion of salaries into URV's will not depend on salary 
brackets. "Conversion will be valid for all brackets," Paim 
said. According to him, Cardoso "hinted, in a long talk, that 
the government will make all efforts to give the same treatment 
to prices and salaries." [passage omitted]
