FT  16 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan wants air links with 19 nations by
1997
TAIWAN will try to establish air links with 19 countries over the next five
years, Mr Eugene Chien, the country's communications minister, said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei.
'Our airlines will fly to 45 destinations and more than 40 foreign airlines
will fly to our country in five years' time,' Mr Chien told a meeting of
senior government officials, including President Lee Teng-hui and Premier
Hau Pei-tsun.
Taiwan's three international airlines fly to 26 destinations and 24 foreign
airlines have landing rights on the island. Taiwan has been hampered in
setting up air links with other countries because China claims sovereignty
over the island and has sought to isolate it diplomatically.
Only 29 countries have formal relations with Taiwan and talks to open air
links with other countries have been slowed by pressure from Beijing,
Taiwanese officials say.
Taiwan set up air links with Australia and New Zealand last year. But China
Airlines, China's flag carrier, suspended services between Taipei and Ho Chi
Minh City last year, after restoring air links broken off in 1975. Hanoi
sought the suspension, apparently after pressure from Beijing.
In April, Taiwan sent a delegation to Europe to try to set up air links with
Britain, France, Germany and Italy. Taiwan and Britain will sign a pact next
month to set up air links, Taiwan's mass-circulation United Daily News said.
Taiwan's second international airline, EVA Airways, will fly the
Taipei-London route in August, the daily added.
Communications ministry and airline officials declined comment, saying the
issue was politically sensitive because of Taipei's rivalry with China.
