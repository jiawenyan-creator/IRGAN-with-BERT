FT  19 MAR 94 / Bank plans first gilt with variable rate since 1979
The Bank of England is to launch its first government bond with a
variable-rate coupon - rather than a fixed interest rate - for 15 years.
The variable-rate issue will enable the Bank to proceed with its gilt sales
even in the present volatile bond market.
Although the Bank is well ahead with the government's funding programme, it
appeared keen to avoid delaying the next auction, as that might have
unsettled a jittery gilts market.
With a sale of conventional gilts, however, the Bank could have been locked
into yields many economists believe are higher than justified by Britain's
inflation and economic outlook. By contrast, the coupons on the
variable-rate gilts are likely to be adjusted at regular intervals.
Timing aside, the Bank had already been exploring variable-rate gilts as a
means of attracting more money from banks and building societies, which
regularly invest in floating-rate notes.
The new issue will be sold at auction on March 30, and details of the
amount, maturity and coupon will be announced by the Bank next Tuesday. The
coupon is likely to be set using the London interbank rate, the common
method of setting the coupon on floating-rate sterling bonds.
The Bank issued three variable-rate gilts in the late 1970s, but investor
demand was poor. Yesterday's announcement, however, gave a boost to gilt
prices.
