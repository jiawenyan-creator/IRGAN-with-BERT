A former Mexican army soldier, who admitted he shot 60 political prisoners and 
helped kill more than a hundred others, was granted political refugee status in 
Canada, according to his lawyer. Zacarias Osorio Cruz, 32, now lives near 
Montreal and is employed as an agricultural worker. A report published in the 
Toronto Star said Cruz told authorities that between 1977 and 1982, he was 
ordered to secretly kill prisoners who were "troublesome or bothersome to the 
high command." The Mexican government has denied having political prisoners. 
Attorney Stewart Istvanffy said Cruz tried to desert three times before 
slipping illegally into the United States in 1982. He moved to Canada in 1987.
