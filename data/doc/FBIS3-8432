  [Excerpts] There was a slight hitch in the agenda in 
Brussels, Gyorgy Foris reports: 
  [Foris] It created a general surprise in Brussels that, at 
the last minute, the meeting of the European Union's troika and 
the six Eastern European countries that had already signed the 
association agreement--Hungary included--was cancelled or, 
rather, postponed. The reason for the delay is the non-stop 
negotiation with Norway on admission. [passage omitted] 
  The Czech foreign minister's answer to all this was to 
propose the cancellation of the meeting altogether and to fix a 
new date in a few weeks. The parties finally agreed to it and 
parted. In the meantime, the bargaining over Norway's membership 
is still under way. 
  Opinions regarding the evaluation of these events are, to 
say 
the least, divided. The official Hungarian position--according 
to Gyorgy Granasztoi, Hungarian ambassador in Brussels--is that 
we understand the difficulties faced by the European Union and 
the Greek presidium. After all, the European Union is currently 
experiencing crucial hours these days. 
  Anyway, according to Hungarian evaluations, we are very 
satisfied with the results achieved during the past two days, 
and the Hungarian delegation considers its trip to Brussels 
successful. [passage omitted]
