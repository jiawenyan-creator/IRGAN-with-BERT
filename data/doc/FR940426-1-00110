Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection 


* * * * * 


S7.1.2Except as provided in S7.1.2.1 and S7.1.2.2, for each Type 2 seat belt assembly which is required by
Standard No. 208 (49 CFR 571.208), the upper anchorage, or the lower anchorage nearest the intersection of the torso
belt and the lap belt, shall include a movable component which provides a minimum of two adjustment positions. The
distance between the geometric center of the movable component at the two extreme adjustment positions shall be not
less than five centimeters, measured linearly. If the component must be moved manually, information shall be provided
in the owner's manual to explain how to adjust the seat belt and warn that misadjustment could reduce the effectiveness
of the safety belt in a crash. 
S7.1.2.1An integrated Type 2 seat belt assembly is not required to comply with the requirements of S7.1.2.
A Type 2 seat belt assembly is considered an integrated assembly if the seat frame is part of each of the seat belt assembly
anchorages, as defined in S3 of Standard No. 210 (49 CFR 571.210). 

S7.1.2.2As an alternative to meeting the requirement of S7.1.2, a Type 2 seat belt assembly shall provide
a means of automatically moving the webbing in relation to either the upper anchorage, or the lower anchorage nearest
the intersection of the torso belt and the lap belt. The distance between the midpoint of the webbing at the contact
point of the webbing and the anchorage at the extreme adjustment positions shall be not less than five centimeters,
measured linearly.
