  [Text] Magdeburg (DPA) -- So far, five arrest warrants 
have been issued in connection with the Magdeburg riots on 
Ascension Day [12 May]. Three rioters, for whom an arrest 
warrant has been issues, are still at large, Magdeburg Senior 
Public Prosecutor Rudolf Jaspers told DPA on Wednesday [18 May]. 
  According to Jaspers, one arrest warrant was refused. The 
Magdeburg Regional Court did not consider the evidence 
sufficient to take the Magdeburg citizen, who was sentenced to a 
two-year suspended sentence in the Elbterrase trial in Magdeburg 
in 1992, into preventive custody. Instead, the conditions for 
his suspended sentence were tightened. 
  The first arrest warrant was issued on Monday against a 
suspected leader of the bloody riots. On Tuesday, detention 
pending trial was ordered for another four right-wingers. One 
of the persons in detention pending trial had been sentenced to 
a suspended sentence of one year and six months for an attack in 
the Magdeburg city center. 
  According to Jaspers, another two arrest warrants are to be 
decided on Wednesday. One of the two rioters in question is at 
large. The other was temporarily arrested on Tuesday.
