GEORGIA DELAYS PUSH FOR SWINDALL'S DISBARMENT 
The State Bar of Georgia has agreed not to push for disbarment of former Rep. 
Pat Swindall, and he has accepted temporary suspension of his law license 
during appeal of federal perjury convictions. 
Swindall, a Republican, was convicted by a U.S. District Court jury in June of 
nine counts of lying to a federal grand jury in a money-laundering case.
