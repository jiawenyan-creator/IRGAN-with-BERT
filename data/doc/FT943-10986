FT  02 AUG 94 / Observer: Olympian choice
The embarrassing debacle over who will run the Sydney Olympic Games, due to
be held in the year 2000, has finally been ended. Gary Pemberton, chairman
of Qantas, the Australian airline, and of Brambles, the sizeable transport
group, has agreed to take the job.
The decision will be a relief to the Sydney Olympic Games Organising
Committee, which has been struggling to fill this seemingly attractive
position for almost a year.
Its troubles started when Rod McGeogh, the Sydney lawyer who headed the
effort to win the games, withdrew his name as a possible manager in the face
of some extremely ungracious local politicking.
So SOGOC called in headhunters and was on the verge of making an
announcement when the person concerned suddenly got an offer he couldn't
refuse from his existing employer. Since then, the idea of asking Mr
Pemberton, who was already president of SOGOC, has been on the cards.
The Australian businessman, who has a fairly low public profile at home,
will retain his Brambles and Qantas chairmanships, but give up some of his
other jobs. However, there is a catch.
Pemberton has only promised to take the job for two and a half years. SOGOC
plainly hopes that he will enjoy it so much that, come December 1996, he
will be prepared to stay on till the year 2000.
