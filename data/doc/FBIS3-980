  [Text] New administrative guidelines are being worked out 
to ensure the smooth running of the Ministry of External 
Affairs. The minister of state in the ministry, Chief Anthony 
Ani, made this known yesterday in Harare, Zimbabwe, while 
addressing the diplomatic staff of the Nigerian High Commission. 
Under the new arrangement, noncareer people will no longer be 
appointed as ambassadors while retired officers will not be 
granted contract terms. 
  Chief Ani explained that the move was to ensure that career 
FS [foreign service] officers attained the highest positions 
while still at their prime. The minister of state also 
announced that a number of the staff in outstations will be 
recalled as part of the reorganization and cost saving exercise. 
He appealed to them to cooperate in the restructuring which, he 
said, was to provide a better fate for them.
