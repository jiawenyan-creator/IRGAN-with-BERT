  [Text] Knin, 22 Mar (TANJUG) -- Talks between the republic 
of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia began amid tight security in 
the Russian Embassy in Zagreb today, but the delegations are not 
being led by Defense Ministers Dusan Rakic and Gojko Susak, as 
was envisaged, the RSK Foreign Ministry has announced. 
  The delegations are being led by the national security 
advisers to the heads of state of the opposing sides -- Generals 
Mile Novakovic and Hrvoje Sarinic -- because the RSK delegation 
learned only on arrival at the Russian Embassy that the Croatian 
delegation would not be led by Defense Minister Susak, but by 
Sarinic. 
  In this situation the RSK delegation nominated General 
Novakovic as head of its delegation, and demanded that in the 
event of the signing of an agreement the person signing (for 
Croatia) should be Susak. 
  Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister, 
informed Krajina's delegation of this change just before the 
beginning of the negotiations. The RSK delegation told Churkin 
of its dissatisfaction at UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] action 
which prevented the arrival of Krajina journalists in Zagreb, 
but also because "it failed to keep its word regarding the 
composition of the Croatian delegation."
