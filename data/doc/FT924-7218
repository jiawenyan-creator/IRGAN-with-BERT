FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: DoT signals approval to
Northwest Airlines
THE US Department of Transport has tentatively approved an essential legal
condition to the proposed integration of services between KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, the Dutch flagship carrier, and Northwest Airlines, the fourth
largest US airline.
Yesterday, the DoT announced that it was issuing a 'show-cause' order,
seeking comment on why it should not approve a request from the two carriers
to combine their operations and effectively function as a single carrier.
The order sets up a 21-day period for comments and replies, after which the
DoT will issue its final decision.
However, the US authorities made clear yesterday the agreement 'should
benefit the public by providing better services and enabling the two
carriers to operate more efficiently'. The DoT said it does not expect the
agreement to substantially reduce competition, but it will still require the
carriers to resubmit the arrangements for review in five years' time.
KLM has held a minority stake in Northwest ever since a Dollars 3.65bn
leveraged buyout of the US carrier in 1989. However, the two airlines claim
that any significant integration of their respective business has been
hampered by the need for immunity from prosecution under US anti-trust laws.
Because US law currently prohibits a foreign carrier from owning a
controlling interest in a US airline, the two airlines argue that there is
'a very real risk that collaberative planning, scheduling, pricing and
marketing of services could be challenged as being price-fixing and market
allocation agreements between horizontal competitors'.
The request for anti-trust immunity came shortly after the US and Dutch
government signed an 'open skies' aviation pact, essentially allowing each
others' carriers unfettered access to the respective home markets.
