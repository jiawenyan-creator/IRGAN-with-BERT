FT  22 FEB 93 / Rail union to ballot on series of 24-hour strikes
RAIL USERS could be hit by a series of one-day strikes late next month after
RMT, the main rail union, failed to win assurances from British Rail on
employment connected to the future privatisation of the railways.
RMT, which was seeking the assurances in talks last Friday, said yesterday
it would hold a ballot early next month for a 'rolling programme' of 24-hour
strikes. It must then start the strike within 28 days or reballot its
members.
An official said the union's executive had undertaken thorough consultation
and was confident that a large majority of the 70,000 RMT railworkers, out
of a total 125,000 rail workforce, would support the call.
A decision in favour of strikes could prompt a tough reaction from BR. There
has been a recent spate of strikes or strike calls in other industries, at
Yarrow, Timex and Peugeot. Nevertheless the latest pay data show a rapid
increase in pay freezes in manufacturing which does not indicate a growing
industrial militancy.
Although the rail strike call was originally linked with the related
campaign by the National Union of Mineworkers against the government plan
for extensive pit closures, the RMT says the main reason now is BR's refusal
to rule out compulsory redundancies. RMT believes that, apart from 7,000
redundancies now being completed, BR will seek a further 20,000 in the next
financial year. Other reasons for protest are BR's refusal to stop using
outside contractors and a 'watering down' of the redundancy payment scheme.
The other main rail unions - Aslef, representing train drivers, and TSSA,
white-collar staff - have not said whether they will also back strikes.
