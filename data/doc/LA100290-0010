GAY'S SUIT AGAINST BOY SCOUTS 
Being homosexual in a straight world must not be easy. We who are straight 
believe that homosexuality is truly an aberration and that we have a moral -- 
not necessarily religious -- obligation to our children to teach them by 
resolve and by example that the love between a man and a woman is the truest 
and most meaningful kind of love. 
To grant an avowed homosexual a position of authority over our youngsters 
undeniably gives legitimacy to that lifestyle. It is to be vigorously opposed.
