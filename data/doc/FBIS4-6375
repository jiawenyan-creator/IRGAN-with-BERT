  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- We will neither be 
frightened by the resumption of the "Team Spirit" war gamble by 
the warmaniacs nor be afraid of any threat posed by them with 
something bigger than Patriot missiles, says NODONG SINMUN in a 
commentary hitting out at the shipment of the Patriot missiles 
in South Korea by the United States and the South Korean 
authorities on April 18. 
  The U.S. introduction of a new missile unit into South Korea 
means an escalation of its belligerent moves to provoke a 
nuclear war against the DPRK on the Korean peninsula, the news 
analyst says, and goes on: 
  The United States and the South Korean warlikers 
ridiculously 
say the deployment of Patriot missiles is intended to 
"supplement the anti-aircraft defence capabilities" and it is an 
"effective means of defence" to counter someone's "surprise 
attack". This is a clumsy excuse for covering up their 
aggresive design. 
  The argument of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
warmaniacs that Patriot missiles entail no danger because they 
are for "defence" only revealed once again their shameless 
nature as cunning and wicked aggressor and provoker. 
  It is a daydream if they think they can threaten us and 
bring 
us to our knees with the introduction of sophisticated weapons 
of mass destruction and nuclear war gambles. 
  We love peace. But we are fully prepared to mete out a 
thousand-fold retaliatory punishment to the enemies if they dare 
provoke us. 
  MINJU CHOSON in its commentary says "we have the 
singlehearted unity of the whole party, entire people and whole 
Army several hundred times stronger than the A-bombs and H-bombs 
of the United States and invincible self-reliant defence 
forces." If the enemies dare provoke us, we will deal a decisive 
counter-blow at them, it warns.
