CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
CALIFORNIA; 
WARREN NOMINATED TO STATE LANDS PANEL 
Charles Warren, a member of the state Coastal Commission and a former 
assemblyman, is expected to be named top executive of the State Lands 
Commission. After serving in the Legislature for 14 years, Warren was appointed 
in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter to be chairman of the President's Council on 
Environmental Quality. He was named to the Coastal Commission by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). As a Democratic assemblyman 
representing Los Angeles, he was the principal author of the Coastal Protection 
Act. In his new post, he would continue to serve on the Coastal Commission. 
Warren's background has made him popular among environmental groups. And his 
appointment appears to be another signal that the Lands Commission intends to 
continue to play an activist role on environmental issues.
