FT  05 MAY 94 / Oil and gas output continues to rise
UK production of oil and natural gas continued to rise strongly in the first
quarter of the year, official statistics showed yesterday.
The Department of Trade and Industry reported that petroleum production
totalled 30.4m tonnes, a 30.8 per cent increase over the first quarter of
1993. Natural gas output rose by 16 per cent.
The increase in oil and gas production is a result of new fields coming on
stream and the output build-up from fields which are approaching full
production.
The statistics show that coal production continued to fall, with a 36.5 per
cent reduction recorded in the first quarter compared with the same period
last year. Total energy consumption for the quarter was up by 3.6 per cent.
The rise in oil and gas production, however, comes at a time of weak prices,
with producers reporting a continuing fall in revenues. Royal Bank of
Scotland, for example, recently estimated that UK oil and gas revenues fell
by 6 per cent in March.
