FT  16 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt
A combination of domestic and international factors will determine the
course of the bund market during the next few days.
On the international front, any move by the US Federal Reserve to raise US
interest rates will have a knock-on effect on the German market.
Paradoxically, the sharper the expected increase in US rates, the better the
immediate outlook for government securities in Germany - a decisive move
from the Fed may eliminate the uncertainty which has induced the German
market to follow the US downwards this year.
On the domestic front, the focus will be on this week's 'repo' tender
operations. Traders will be concerned to see how willing the Bundesbank is
to follow the generous, half-percentage point reductions in the discount and
Lombard rates last week with a substantial cut in money market rates.
Later in the week, the Bundesbank may release data on M3 money supply growth
for April. It is too early for last week's interest rate moves to have had
any effect, but the data will be studied closely for signs that the
'exceptional factors' which have bloated M3 growth this year are beginning
to recede. The consensus is for seasonally adjusted, annualised growth of 14
per cent or less, after more than 15 per cent in the previous month.
