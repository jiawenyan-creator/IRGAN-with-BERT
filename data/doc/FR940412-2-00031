SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

For reasons set forth in the summary and under the authority of DOD Directives 5126.9 and 4500.34 this revision will
supersede in part the current procedures published in DOD 4500.34R, Chapter 2, Personal Property Traffic
Management Regulation; the TQAP pamphlet, dated February 1992; and the CONUS Automated Rates System pamphlet, dated
1 May 1991. The proposed revisions were initially published for comments in the 

Federal Register

, Volume 58, Number 196, Wednesday, October 13, 1993, and Volume 58, Number 174, Friday, September 10, 1993. Comments
were received in writing and telephonically during the review of the program, September 1993 through January 1994.
There were 12 individual letter responses to the September 1993 

Federal Register

. This includes letters from carrier associations and bureaus. Sixteen letter responses were received with respect
to the October 13th 

Federal Register

 item. This also included letters from carrier association/bureau. Some changes were made to the proposed revisions
based on the comments received. The significant changes contained in the revision are as follows and will apply in
lieu of cited TQAP pamphlet, DOD 4500.34R, and CARTS paragraphs:



A. Carriers will provide a copy of the DD Form 1840, Joint Statement of Loss or Damage at Delivery, to the origin PPSO
within 75 calendar days of delivery of the shipment. The PPSO will sign and return by mail a receipt if a self addressed
stamped card or letter of transmittal is included by the carrier. (Reference TQAP, page 24, paragraph C.4.c.(8) and
DOD 4500.34R, page A23, para 52.e.)



Comments: 

The majority of freight forwarders oppose this change, while the van line carriers prefer to send the form to origin
or have no preference. Most of the carriers commented that they believe the service member should be responsible for
returning the form to a PPSO. The DOD strongly believes it is necessary to cut out the middle-man in the processing of
the DD Form 1840. This will lighten the administrative burden on the PPSOs and the carrier industry as well. In addition
to cutting out the middle man, the time for returning the form has been expanded to accommodate overseas mail. Other
paperwork must be returned to the carrier to show proof of delivery or to ensure payment to the carrier.

B. All shipments will be scored within 12 months of pickup date. If no destination information is known, the origin
PPSO will contact the destination PPSO to confirm the status of the shipment and request feedback on carrier performance
at time of delivery. This will also ensure that if the shipment is still in SIT points will not be taken away from the carrier
for not providing a DD Form 1840. Unless there is evidence in the file to show otherwise, these types of shipments will
usually score at 100. In addition, shipments noted as still in SIT 12 months after pickup will be flagged to prevent
them from being scored again in future cycles. (Reference TQAP, page 21, paragraphs C.3.e. and f.)



Comments: 

Carriers against the proposal suggested the origin PPSO not make any contact with the destination PPSO for status
on shipments. They would like an automatic score of 100. Again, the DOD believes communication between the origin
and destination PPSO is vital to ensure shipments are scored properly.

C. If the carrier discovers a shipment the PPSO failed to score 12 months after pickup, the carrier must identify the
shipment during the appeal cycle of the DD Form 2497. The shipment will then be scored within 45 days and batch mailed
according to TQAP procedures. This will allow the carrier an opportunity to appeal if necessary. The score will reflect
on the carrier's next semiannual score. (Reference TQAP, page 21, paragraph C.3.g. and page 26, paragraph C.6.e.)
