FT  22 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian nickel plant problems
'serious'
Production problems at Norilsk in Siberia, which supplies 120,000 tonnes a
year of the world's nickel, or 15 per cent of total output, appear to be
serious, according to Macquarie Equities, the Australian financial services
company.
Mr Jim Lennon, Macquarie's metals analyst, said last night, however, it had
still to be determined how serious the production losses would be. 'Some
people say the problems can be solved quickly but others say they will have
a long-term impact.'
Nickel is used mainly in the production of stainless steel for which demand
is booming.
While the Reuter news agency last Friday reported a senior official at the
Norilsk plant had denied the problems were serious, Mr Lennon said that
'usually reliable' Russian sources told a different story.
Mr Lennon said he understood that there was an explosion at a transformer at
the Norilsk thermal (gas-fired) power plant on November 4 which took about
two weeks to repair. The plant supplies heating and power to the town of
Norilsk and also to the smelting and refining plants. A power failure
stopped pumping and cooling systems at the station and this caused damage to
three of its four turbines.
The power 'outages' and restriction of heating then led to major damage to
uninsulated pipes and other equipment at the metallurgical plants because
present outside temperatures at Norilsk are minus 30 to minus 35 degrees
Centigrade. 'There are reports that a pipeline carrying concentrate to the
metallurgical plants froze and then exploded,' said Mr Lennon.
'One source expects problems throughout the winter, with full repairs not
being possible until next summer. If this is correct - but it is difficult
to confirm at the moment - there could be a substantial fall in nickel
exports from Russia next year.'
