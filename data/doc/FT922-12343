FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: Too hasty a decision
Sir, Despite the deferment of the date of the Labour leadership election
from Neil Kinnock's June preference to the compromise solution of July 18,
it appears that the Labour party is racing helter-skelter to appoint a
leader before a thorough and unhindered examination of the reasons for its
spectacular defeat on April 9 has taken place.
Surely it is fundamental to the crucial leadership decision-making process
that it has analysed and understood why the electorate chose to reject it
for the fourth consecutive term?
It is certainly not clear that this analysis can take place objectively in
the midst of a leadership election. Further, it is only when the party has
understood the reasons for its defeat that it will be able to make an
informed decision on who is most suitable to lead it towards its goal of
government at the next election.
