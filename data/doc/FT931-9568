FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BP faces Dollars 630m charge to end Alaskan
dispute
BRITISH Petroleum's US subsidiary is faced with a tax charge of Dollars 630m
(Pounds 417m) to end a dispute with the state of Alaska.
The charge reflects a wrangle between the company and the Alaskan
authorities which dates back to 1982 over the way the state taxes non-US
corporations doing business there.
The company has said it will pay the charge by June 30.
Mr Steve Ahearne, finance director, said that BP had made provisions to
cover the tax payment and that it would have no backdated effect on last
year's financial results which were announced yesterday.
BP reported a loss for 1992 but pointed out that its fourth quarter
replacement cost profit of Pounds 193m showed an improvement on Pounds 172m
in the third quarter and Pounds 72m in the same period of 1991. Replacement
cost profit strips out the effects of oil stock losses and gains.
Within the figures, there were bright spots such as a 30 per cent increase
in profits from the exploration and production division in the fourth
quarter when compared with the third quarter.
The business reported a replacement cost operating profit of Pounds 515m for
the final quarter compared with Pounds 396m in the third quarter and Pounds
427m in the same period of 1991.
The improvement was largely a result of the stronger dollar since oil prices
are quoted in dollars.
For the full year the exploration business made an operating profit of
Pounds 1.68bn (Pounds 1.7bn, or Pounds 1.8bn before the FRS 3 accounting
change) on a replacement cost basis.
Mr Ahearne stressed that BP has cut its costs and improved its operating
efficiencies in exploration to report average income per barrel produced of
Dollars 3.40 compared with Exxon, the industry leader, which makes Dollars
3.50 a barrel.
BP said it will book an extra 450m barrels to its oil reserve figures this
year. Oil output fell last year to 1.29m barrels a day from 1.36m b/d in
1991.
Gas production slipped from 1.26bn to 1bn cu ft a day.
The refining and marketing division also improved its income in the final
quarter in spite of difficult market conditions.
The division reported replacement cost operating profits of Pounds 117m for
the fourth quarter, compared with Pounds 75m. Profits for the year, however,
declined to Pounds 304m (Pounds 779m; Pounds 945m).
Mr David Simon, chief executive, reported 'green shoots,' in BP's US
marketing operations. But Mr Russell Seal, director of refining and
marketing, said that European refining margins were 'still giving a poor
return' and that there were short-term pressures in the market because of
over-capacity in some unsophisticated refineries.
The chemicals business reported a fourth quarter replacement cost operating
loss of Pounds 22m (loss of Pounds 34m a year earlier) but the business was
showing few signs of recovery.
Mr Simon said it was a 'hard slog' in chemicals and that the company would
be looking to make several disposals this year. The division incurred a loss
of Pounds 24m for the full year, (profit of Pounds 32m; Pounds 7m a year
earlier).
Operating profits at the nutrition division were Pounds 20m in the fourth
quarter, compared with Pounds 11m in the previous year. For the full year,
profits were Pounds 73m (Pounds 39m; Pounds 37m).
Group turnover for 1992 was Pounds 33.25bn (Pounds 32.61bn).
