FT  16 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Producing every golfer's dream
The latest in computer-aided design technology has been combined with some
of the most novel research in polymers to produce every golfer's dream - a
more accurate golf ball.
Developed by Spalding in the US, the 'Magna' ball is 2 per cent larger than
traditional balls but complies with the game's weight rules. The Magna has a
softer core and a thicker covering of Spalding's 'Zylin' polymer and larger
dimples on its surface. Spalding says these changes give the golf ball an
advantage of 11 to 17 extra yards on a drive. Spalding: US, 413 536 1200;
