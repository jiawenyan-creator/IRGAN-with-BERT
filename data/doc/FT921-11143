FT  01 FEB 92 / Ashdown spells out coalition deal terms
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday gave his clearest
exposition to date of his conditions for entering a post-election agreement
in the event of a hung parliament.
His comments were clearly intended to dispel suggestions this week from Sir
David Steel, the party's former leader, that a political pact could be
agreed that postponed or qualified electoral reform for the House of Commons
during the next parliament. Mr Ashdown said any agreement with one of the
big parties would require that the coming general election was the last
under the present first-past-the-post system.
A partnership would also depend on agreement about a five-year programme for
government in which Liberal Democrats would expect to serve.
Mr Ashdown's comments came amid mounting speculation that the Liberal
Democrats could have a decisive roleif no party gains an overall majority at
the election.
He did not rule out a referendum on voting reform, but said that could only
be held once the legislation for a new system had completed its journey
through the House of Commons. His clarification, in a Channel 4 interview
with Sir Robin Day, was clearly aimed at stamping on Sir David's suggestions
this week that the party may be ready to co-operate with a Labour government
that brought in proportional representation for Scotland and a new London
authority.
A Gallup opinion poll in the Daily Telegraph last night gave Labour a 1.5
point lead over the Tories. The results, against last week, were Labour 39.5
per cent (up 1.5), Conservatives 38 per cent (down 2), Liberal Democrats
17.5 per cent (up 1).
A poll in the Glasgow Herald last night confirmed support for the Scottish
National Party at the expense of Labour. The figures, with last month in
brackets, are: Labour 38 per cent (47 per cent); SNP 26 (21); Conservatives
23 (21); and Liberal Democrats 11 (11).
