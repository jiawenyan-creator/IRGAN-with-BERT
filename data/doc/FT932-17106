FT  02 APR 93 / English Estates in Pounds 40m sell-off
ENGLISH ESTATES, the government's industrial and commercial property
developer, yesterday announced the biggest sale yet in its programme of
disposals to the private sector.
In a Pounds 40m deal, to be completed by the end of this week, it is selling
95 modern estates of small factories and workshops in various parts of the
north of England to the Lancashire-based Northern Trust Company.
Mr Bill Locke, estate management director of English Estates, admitted
yesterday that the complexity of offering for sale a portfolio of 1,700
multi-tenanted freehold and leasehold units, totalling 3.1m sq ft, had
aroused some scepticism in the property industry.
'It's a sale the market has been looking at with interest,' he said. 'It's
been a bit of a legal nightmare.'
The portfolio was first marketed last autumn but all offers received were
rejected as too low. Mr Locke said lower interest rates had meant a change
in market conditions, resulting in new offers. Northern Trust said it
believed prices had neared the bottom of the market.
The buildings, 84 per cent of which are let, generate annual income of just
more than Pounds 6m, giving an initial return on the Pounds 40m purchase
price of about 13.5 per cent.
The deal brings to Pounds 180m the sum English Estates has raised by
property sales in the two years since the government ordered it to sell its
assets to generate income.
The Pounds 40m will be used to fund new developments. The National Audit
Office, the public expenditure watchdog, is preparing a study on the
disposals programme for publication this summer.
The sale to Northern Trust, a privately owned company with investment,
property and leisure interests, leaves English Estates with 5,000 units.
