FT  05 JUL 93 / Fears over redundancy continue to increase
THE PERCENTAGE of workers who fear that they may lose their jobs in the next
12 months continues to rise in spite of a further fall in official
unemployment figures, a MORI survey published exclusively in the Financial
Times shows today.
The increasing fear of redundancy is particularly pronounced among women,
people aged 18 to 34 and those living in the Midlands.
A quarter of those in work say they are 'very con-cerned' about being made
redundant, rising to 36 per cent among the youngest cat-egory, those aged 18
to 24.
The survey appears to indicate that some confidence has returned to
professional and managerial employees during the past month.
But overall, 44 per cent of workers are now 'very' or 'fairly' worried they
could be made redundant in the coming year - up from 41 per cent in April,
the first month of the research series commissioned from MORI by Industrial
Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions research group.
Official seasonally-adjusted unemployment figures fell between April and May
by 26,100 to 2.914m. This fourth consecutive monthly fall cut the
seasonally-adjusted jobless rate to 10.4 per cent from 10.5 per cent in
April and a winter peak of 10.6 per cent.
Anxiety among women has risen 5 percentage points since April to 40 per
cent, but is still lower than that shown by men.
Concern among all groups of employees in the Midlands has risen from 40 per
cent to 49 per cent.
MORI interviewed 978 adults aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work,
face-to-face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points
throughout Britain from June 24 to 28. Data were weighted to match the
profile of the population.
