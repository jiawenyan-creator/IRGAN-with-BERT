companies
THE strengthening Malaysian dollar against sterling and improved results
from other plantation companies were factors in the interim figures of three
groups in which Rowe Evans Investments has substantial holdings.
Beradin Holdings reported pre-tax profits up 49 per cent at Pounds 248,869
(Pounds 167,386) on turnover of Pounds 450,624 (Pounds 371,215). Earnings
per share were 0.9p (0.59p).
The company said that the oil palm crop and the average price was similar to
last year but the Malaysian dollar had risen by 19 per cent. The results
included net investment income of Pounds 24,346 (Pounds 378).
Singapore Para Rubber Estates saw pre-tax profits of Pounds 215,919, a rise
of 79 per cent on the comparable Pounds 120,757. Turnover was Pounds 361,405
(Pounds 278,716). Earnings per share were 1.3p (0.77p). Net investment
income was Pounds 51,863, against a charge of Pounds 48,678.
Lower crops of oil palm and rubber were blamed by Padang Senang Holdings for
a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 39,257 (Pounds 57,267) on turnover of
Pounds 210,940 (Pounds 224,847). Earnings per share were 0.36p (0.47p).
However, the fall was mitigated by the currency rise and higher investment
income of Pounds 30,932 (Pounds 6,361).
