FT  07 NOV 92 / Spain decries 'setback'
THE Spanish government is disappointed at British Prime Minister John
Major's decision to postpone final ratification of the Maastricht treaty
until next year, government spokeswoman Rosa Conde said, Reuter reports from
Madrid .
In Palma de Majorca, Spanish EC Commissioner Manuel Marin was more critical,
saying that the British decision was a setback in European union that
discouraged its EC partners.
'We are not used to a head of government accepting a public commitment and
then to see an about-turn because of domestic politics,' he said during a
seminar on the treaty on European union.
He said he did not believe the present impasse, pending the decisions of
Denmark and Britain, would last beyond the first half of next year.
'Europe must be built through decisions by real leaders who accept an
internal political cost,' he said. The danger was that the Edinburgh EC
summit in December would take place with two member countries unable to work
normally with the rest, he added.
