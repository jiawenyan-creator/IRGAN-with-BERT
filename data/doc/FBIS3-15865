  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 08, BNS -- Russia would like to carry 
out military transit through Lithuanian territory by road, by 
rail and by air, Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the Lithuanian 
working group for talks with CIS, told Lithuanian TV Monday [7 
March]. 
  The group announced after its meeting Monday that the 
Russian 
draft agreement on military transit should be discussed only 
when the parliament adopts a law on transportation of military 
and dangerous cargos through Lithuanian territory. 
  Commenting on the Russian draft, Bulovas said Lithuanian 
experts suggest to allow only transit by rail. In his words, 
transit by road is completely unacceptable to Lithuania, while 
transit by air can be carried out only in accordance with 
international regulations and requires separate permission of 
the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. 
  In Bulovas' opinion, Lithuania cannot create any specific 
regulations for Russian military transit. "The rules will be 
universal to all, be it Russia or NATO." The negotiator said his 
group is now working on regulations of transporting dangerous 
cargos by rail through Lithuania. 
  Bulovas noted that Lithuania does not have two borders with 
Russia, therefore it will be necessary either to sign a 
trilateral agreement between Lithuania, Russia and Belarus, or 
to conclude three separate bilateral agreements. 
  Bulovas said Russia has lately begun intensive transit by 
sea. In his words, the process is evident because the amount of 
transit by rail is considerably smaller than planned.
