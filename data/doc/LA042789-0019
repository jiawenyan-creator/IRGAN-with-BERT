MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
NBC News President Michael Gartner says "we didn't do anything wrong" in trying 
in advance to line up interviews with jurors after the verdict is given in the 
Oliver North trial. The judge in the case rapped NBC for sending one-sentence 
letters of invitation last weekend to the homes of jurors now considering a 
verdict in North's federal court trial in Washington. Gartner, speaking 
Wednesday to the New York chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences, called it "just good reporting, trying to set up an interview." 
On another issue, Gartner said NBC had made a mistake in closing its Houston 
bureau in January as part of a cost-cutting effort and said a bureau will be 
reopened in Texas. He did not specify when or where the bureau would be 
located. ALEENE MacMINN
