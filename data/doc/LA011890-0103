PAIN-COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES 
Whatever are we to do with these anti-abortionist gadflies? They trample the 
rights of most to intercede where they are wanted the least. Then they whimper 
that their right to violate the law is frustrated by police who, they say, have 
no business shoveling them from the public thoroughfare, like so much refuse, 
given their determination to behave irresponsibly. 
Is there, perhaps, some address to which we can send donations in order to buy 
the LAPD more nunchakus?
