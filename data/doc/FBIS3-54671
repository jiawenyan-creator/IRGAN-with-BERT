  [Text] Vilnius, Dec 30, BNS - The problem of Russian 
military transit through Lithuanian territory was a key topic in 
radio debates Thursday between Justas Paleckis, presidential 
foreign policy adviser, and Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the 
parliament's rightist opposition. 
  Paleckis said a solution acceptable to Lithuania, "which, of 
course, cannot be unilateral because interests must be 
coordinated," should be attained with the help of international 
organizations. 
  Landsbergis said Lithuania should not conclude any military 
treaties with Russia, to avoid the legalization of military 
transit. Lithuania can give permission for Russian transit in 
each separate case, he said, but denied allegations of wanting 
to completely ban military transit through Lithuanian territory.
