NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
THANK YOUR PARENTS, COSBY SAYS 
Bill Cosby told University of Notre Dame graduates to be grateful to their 
parents. 
"How did you come to live so long?" the 52-year-old comedian asked on Sunday. 
"Because they let you live," he answered to applause and laughter from the 
2,400 students, parents and faculty members. 
Cosby, who has a doctorate in education, received an honorary doctor of laws 
degree from the university. 
"With all of my heart and soul, I want all of you to understand that what you 
call the world out there is rough," he said. 
"It's rough not only in terms of your job but in terms of your personal 
relationships. You'll have many, many friends, but if your relationship with 
your mate is 100% of your heart, you'll never need a friend."
