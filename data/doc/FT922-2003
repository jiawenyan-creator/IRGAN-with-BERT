FT  19 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fax machine for the
globetrotter
Globetrotting executives can still face telecommunications problems once
they step off the beaten path. It is not easy, for example, to send a fax
from a Tibetan mountainside or check the head-office database from deepest
Africa.
But portable global communication is now a reality for travellers in areas
of unreliable or non-existent communications.
Inmarsat C mobile satellite earth stations, supplied by UK-based Applied
Satellite Technology, work with portable personal computers and use the
geostationary Inmarsat satellites to provide two-way telex, fax (send only)
and other data communications from anywhere in the world.
The briefcase-sized Nomad 2000 weighs 5kg and takes just minutes to set up
using a directional antenna. It works with any MS-Dos compatible computer
transmitting at a speed of 600 bits per second and can send data for 30
minutes or receive for 60 minutes using its internal batteries.
The Nomad 2000 costs Pounds 6,790 and can be supplied with an optional
Pounds 1,300 laptop computer. Applied Satellite Technology: UK, 0603 427434.
