FT  19 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Signs of revival in
syndication sector
ACTIVITY in the syndicated loans market is starting to pick up with several
European borrowers waiting to tap the market, according to bankers.
Ayuntamiento de Madrid, the Madrid council, is launching a deal expected to
raise about DM160m to finance its 1993 capital expenditure programme. It is
being lead-managed by Banco Central Hispano, Sumitomo and West LB.
The six-year deal has a margin of 27.5 basis points over D-Mark Libor, which
some European bankers regard as tight pricing.
However, others point out that pricing on loans has already started to edge
lower.
Another Spanish borrower, the motorway operator Aumar, is also expected to
tap the market soon with a deal of between Dollars 80m and Dollars 100m.
JP Morgan expects to launch its Dollars 500m deal for Vattenfall, the
Swedish power group, this week. The deal is a five-year loan priced at 40
basis points over Libor, with a commitment fee of 20 basis points on the
undrawn amount.
Investcorp, the Arab-led investment consortium, has signed a Dollars 330m
loan facility, its largest to date, which will be used partly to refinance a
Dollars 250m revolving credit as well as to provide additional funds for
general corporate purposes.
The deal, arranged by Bankers Trust International and Chemical Bank, is a
three-year term loan with a margin of 87.5 basis points over Libor. There is
a commitment fee of 37.5 basis points on the undrawn balance, and management
fees range from 45 basis points for participants to 80 basis points for
senior lead managers.
