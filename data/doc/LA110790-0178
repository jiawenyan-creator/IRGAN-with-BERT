THE SIDELINES; 
INDIANS TO MOVE CAMP TO FLORIDA 
The Cleveland Indians will abandon Tucson in 1993 and move their spring 
training camp to Florida. 
The Indians, who have trained at Hi Corbett Field in Tucson since 1947, said 
Tuesday night that they will move to Citrus County, Fla., in spring 1993. The 
site is 65 miles west of Orlando and 69 miles north of Tampa. 
The move requires approval by the baseball commissioner and the American 
League.
