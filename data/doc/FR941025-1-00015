Airworthiness Directives; Beech Aircraft Corporation 
Models 34C, T34C, and T34C1 Airplanes

AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to adopt a new 
airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to 
certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) Models 34C, 
T34C, and T34C1 airplanes. The proposed action 
would require replacing the eight wing attachment steel 
bolts and hardware with Inconel bolts and hardware. A 
report of the right lower aft wing attachment nut 
assembly separating in two pieces on a Model 
T34C1 airplane prompted the proposed action. The 
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to 
prevent the wing from separating from the fuselage 
because of failure of this assembly.
