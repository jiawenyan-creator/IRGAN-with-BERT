FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
San Gabriel 14, Burbank 7 -- Burbank quarterback Jeremy Sparks' pass with three 
seconds remaining in the game was incomplete in the game at San Gabriel. 
Burbank's Nelson Randin had carried the ball into the end zone three plays 
earlier on a 10-yard run, but the play was nullified because of a holding 
penalty. 
San Gabriel took a 6-0 lead on Christian Estrada's eight-yard touchdown run and 
boosted its lead to 14-0 early in the second half when Jerry Vasquez caught a 
21-yard pass from Todd Davidson. The pair also combined for the two-point 
conversion. Burbank scored on Chris Pene's one-yard run with 5:04 left in the 
game. Sparks completed 10 of 21 passes for 104 yards. KIRBY LEE
