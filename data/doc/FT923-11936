FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: GTE registers 13% gain after
Contel takeover
GTE, the largest local telephone company in the US, yesterday reported a 13
per cent increase in second-quarter earnings, helped by volume growth in its
telephone business and efficiency gains from last year's Dollars 6bn
takeover of telecommunications group Contel.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 446m, or 49 cents a share, from
continuing businesses, compared with Dollars 394m, or 44 cents, last year.
Revenues and sales rose from Dollars 4.85bn to Dollars 5.06bn.
The figures, in line with market expectations, do not include the group's
electrical products business, which it has put up for sale.
The company's local telephone operations reported operating income 9 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.02bn, although the increase totalled 5 per cent
when a Dollars 30m 1991 provision was stripped out.
Revenues totalled Dollars 3.98bn, up from Dollars 3.85bn, thanks to a 7 per
cent increase in usage of the company's local network for long distance
calling and a 3.7 per cent annual increase in access lines. These increases
were partly offset by lower tariffs charged by long-distance carriers for
access to its local network.
Its telecommunications services and products business produced operating
income of Dollars 65m, up from Dollars 42m, on revenues 8 per cent higher at
Dollars 1.09bn.
Its cellular telephone business produced revenues of Dollars 252m, up 30 per
cent. Some 56,000 cellular customers were added during the period, bringing
the total to 920,000, up from 682,000 a year ago. Average revenues per
subscriber rose slightly from the previous quarter to Dollars 78 a month.
For the six months income from continuing operations were Dollars 873m, or
96 cents, against Dollars 591m, or 65 cents, a year ago, when it took a 23
cents a share charge against earnings. Revenues totalled Dollars 9.89bn, up
from Dollars 9.54bn.
