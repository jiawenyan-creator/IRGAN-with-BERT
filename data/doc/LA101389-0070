ANNENBERG ENDOWS $1-MILLION PROGRAM TO HONOR U.S. JUDGE 
Former Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg has endowed a $1-million public service 
fellowship program at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Mass., in honor of Judge 
Irving R. Kaufman's 40 years on the federal bench. 
The endowment will fund fellowships for students or recent alumni who want to 
enter public service, Harvard officials said. The first awards, in the amount 
of $10,000 each, will be made for the academic year 1990-91. 
Kaufman, 79, was appointed to the federal bench in 1949 by President Harry S. 
Truman. He served 12 years in the Southern District of New York before being 
elevated to the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in 1961.
