FT  07 JUL 93 / Le Pen visit ends in transit lounge
AT LEAST he landed this time. Repelled by the hoteliers and local
authorities of Dublin and Edinburgh, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, beacon of
Europe's far right, arrived on British soil yesterday - to spend an hour in
a dingy Heathrow office defending himself against accusations of fascism and
profligacy.
He then flew on to Rome - a city where Mr Le Pen, mentioning Mussolini, said
he was 'always welcome and courteously received.'
This was in contrast to the reception his plans to attend meetings in Dublin
and Edinburgh met this week. Hotels, anxious to avoid demonstrations,
bounced his bookings and Edinburgh council called his proposed visit 'an
affront to the people of Edinburgh.'
Airport police yesterday forced Mr Le Pen to confine his visit to the
British Isles to a suffocating conference room between Terminals One and
Two.
Inside, Mr Le Pen contended with hostile questioning about his views and the
serial junketing that took him to a 5-star hotel in Corfu a fortnight ago
and raised questions in the European Parliament about the abuse of public
funds. Mr Le Pen produced figures which he claimed showed his accounts were
clean.
He said the treatment he had received in Edinburgh and Dublin was 'a defeat
for the European Parliament, a defeat for democracy and a defeat for
international courtesy, but not a defeat for us.' As an MEP he held
diplomatic status and should be able to travel freely throughout Europe.
Anti-fascist groups would not prevent him from visiting (or trying to visit)
one EC country a month, he said.
Having dealt with hospitality hiccups, he moved on to the issue of
immigration. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, was a 'dinosaur' whose
new laws would be hopeless to prevent a 'torrent migratoire.'
