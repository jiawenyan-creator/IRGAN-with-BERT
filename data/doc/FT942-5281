FT  06 JUN 94 / Gibraltar killings referred to Euro-court
Relatives of the three IRA members killed by Special Air Service troops in
Gibraltar six years ago yesterday welcomed the decision to refer the case to
the European Court of Human Rights.
The relatives said in a joint statement: 'This means that the case will be
finally decided by the court, in a full and public judicial hearing.'
The decision to refer the case was taken by the European Commission on Human
Rights, which also decided that SAS men who killed unarmed IRA members
Daniel McCann, Mairead Farrell and Sean Savage did not use excessive
violence.
The Strasbourg-based commission advises the European Court of Human Rights -
but the final ruling still rests with the court.
The relatives appealed to the commission after losing their fight against
the government in the British courts, saying the March 1988 shootings were a
breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.
But the commission decided that the SAS soldiers were justified in opening
fire because of the risk that the IRA members were armed or could be about
to detonate a bomb.
