  [Text] Moscow May 4 ITAR-TASS -- Experts from the Russian 
Machine-Building Committee proposed a programme to overcome the 
non- payment crisis in the domestic industry. After a working 
group, including representatives from the economy and finance 
ministries, the Central Bank and other organisations, considers 
the programme, it will be submitted to the government. 
  The programme's main provisions include state regulation of 
credit emission, control over cash and non-cash circulation, 
writing off enterprises' mutual debts, and determining 
enterprises' financial needs. 
  The experts believe that the non-payment problem can not be 
settled without anti-inflation measures, that is state 
regulation of prices for raw materials, fuel, transport services 
and foodstuffs. The experts welcome even caps on prices and 
wages.
