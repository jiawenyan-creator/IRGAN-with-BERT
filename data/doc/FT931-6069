FT  03 MAR 93 / Letter: Proposal at Lloyd's unfair to Names
Sir, In 'The incredible shrinking market' on Lloyd's problems (FT 24
February), Richard Lapper reports that increasingly market professionals
want to 'fence off' old liabilities by leaving syndicate accounts for 1990
open.
It is normal at Lloyd's to leave years of account open when they cannot be
closed in the usual way after three years because debt or potential debt is
so high as to make it unreasonable to ask new Names to take part in dealing
with it.
It is quite another matter to compulsorily ban all syndicates from closing
their 1990 year of account based, not on their individual commercial results
for 1990, which in many cases would legitimately allow closure, but on a
perceived need to encourage members of the corporate sector and others to
join Lloyd's and improve its capital base by insulating them from past
problems.
I understand the need for Lloyd's to restore its shrinking capital base. But
a measure such as this would introduce a two-tier membership. It would
penalise the existing membership, the source of Lloyd's capital so far, and
perpetuate the despair of those looking to escape from the worry of their
Lloyd's commitments by seeing their syndicates closed legitimately at the
three-year point. F Johnson,
