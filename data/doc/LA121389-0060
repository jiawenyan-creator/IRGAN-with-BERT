QUALITY TEAMS FILL GLENDALE TOURNAMENT 
It's tournament time in Glendale, a great opportunity for Coach Brian 
Beauchemin to schedule a few patsies for the Glendale College basketball team. 
Beauchemin, however, has gone grinch on his Vaqueros. 
The eight-team, double-elimination tournament begins tonight with seven of 
participants sporting records over .500. 
Antelope Valley (10-2), ranked 12th in Southern California by the JC Athletic 
Bureau, plays fourth-ranked Compton (9-2) tonight at 6 p.m. and Glendale (6-5) 
plays East Los Angeles (5-7) at 8 in first round games at Glendale College. 
College of the Canyons (5-5) plays 10th-ranked Los Angeles Harbor (10-4) and 
13-ranked Valley (6-3) meets sixth-ranked Cypress (8-1) in other first-round 
games Thursday night. 
"It's a well-stocked tournament," Beauchemin said. "I expect every game to be 
knock down, drag out." 
Antelope Valley is coming off a championship performance in last week's Golden 
West tournament where the Marauders dealt Cypress its only defeat. 
Antelope Valley is led by freshman point guard Dedan Thomas, the catalyst for 
the Marauders' up-tempo offense. He averages 12.3 points and 10 assists a game. 
Glendale is sparked by a quartet of sophomores that includes guard Bruce Heicke 
(16 points per game) and forwards David Swanson (16), Justin Lord (15.5) and 
Gary Fowler (14.5). 
Sophomore guard Steve Valenzuela (18 points) and forwards Larry Albritton (17) 
and Aaron Clark (17) are Canyons' top scorers. 
Shelton Boykin, a transfer from Texas-El Paso, is the key player for Valley, a 
team which features a number of talented sophomores, including Steve Ward, 
Cliff Barnes and Shawn DeLaittre -- none of whom played for Valley last season. 
"We haven't gelled," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said. "We have a lot of 
sophomores, but this is the first year they've played together." 
Second-round games will be played Friday with the championship round to be 
played Saturday.
