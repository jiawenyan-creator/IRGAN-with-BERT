MORNING REPORT: RADIO 
Sonya Friedman Leaves, Viscott Adds Hour: Radio psychologist David Viscott will 
expand his current KABC-AM program to two hours starting today. His 1-2 p.m. 
show will now be heard from 1-3 p.m., replacing fellow talk radio psychologist 
Sonya Friedman, who had been on the station from 2-3 p.m. Friedman has left the 
station in order to originate her Cable News Network show from New York, which 
will bring her closer to her husband and family in Detroit. Friedman 
temporarily replaced Viscott when he left the radio station from June to 
August. Claudia Puig
