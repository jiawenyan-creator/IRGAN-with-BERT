Protection of Stratospheric Ozone 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 With this action, EPA is proposing amendments to 
anticipate the phaseout of production and consumption of various 
ozone-depleting substances and to clarify minor aspects of the 
current regulation as provided for under section 604 and 606 of 
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA). To ensure an orderly 
phaseout of the production and consumption of halons in 1994, and 
of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, methyl 
chloroform and hydrobromofluorocarbons in 1996, this action 
proposes to alter the administrative requirements of the 
regulations so companies may continue to produce for special 
exempted uses. Today's action also proposes clarifications to 
improve the efficiency of the current requirements and to reduce 
the burden on the affected companies while ensuring continued 
compliance with Title VI of the CAA and in a manner consistent 
with the United States' obligations under the Montreal Protocol 
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer as amended. 


Specifically, EPA proposes to (1) change the requirements 
for the post-phaseout period for transformation and destruction 
of ozone-depleting substances; (2) establish the framework for 
the post-phaseout exempted production for essential uses; (3) 
revise the controls for imports of controlled substances that are 
used or recycled; (4) ease the requirements for exporting 
substances to Article 5 countries; (5) change the allowance 
requirements for exports of ozone-depleting substances; (6) 
clarify the definitions for transhipments and heels; (7) provide 
a period of reconciliation in which allowance balances may be 
adjusted; and (8) adjust the recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements.
