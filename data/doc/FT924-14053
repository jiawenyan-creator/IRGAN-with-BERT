FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: Merrill to advise IRI on sale of
bank
IRI, the Italian state-owned holding company which is privatising some
subsidiaries, has appointed Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, to advise
on the sale of Credito Italiano.
The surprise decision to sell Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth-biggest bank,
was announced by the government last month. But no indication was given as
to the timing or method of the deal. Analysts now expect the disposal of
part or all of IRI's 67 per cent stake to take place via a trade sale to a
group of outside buyers, probably around the year-end.
In spite of the government's enthusiasm for increasing popular share
ownership, the likelihood of a public placement of IRI's shares has
decreased owing to the current depressed value of the bank's equity. Credito
Italiano is now capitalised at around L2,000bn (Dollars 1.61bn), against an
actual value estimated by senior managers at between L7,000bn and L10,000bn.
The high price has also made a straight sale to a single buyer less
probable. A transfer of ownership to a foreign financial institution may not
receive the Bank of Italy's blessing, while the number of banks which could
afford to buy Credito Italiano is already limited.
Hence analysts expect at least part of IRI's shares to be bought by a 'hard
core' of private-sector Italian investors. Familiarity with the bank and the
domestic financial scene could persuade such buyers to pay a substantial
premium over current bourse levels. Another part of IRI's stake might be
floated simultaneously, or subsequently.
IRI said it would be up to Merrill Lynch to recommend the best procedure for
the sale to maximise the proceeds, while 'respecting the market and the
interests of Credito Italiano'. A mandate for valuing the bank, to take
place after Merrill Lynch makes its recommendations, may be awarded to
another institution.
