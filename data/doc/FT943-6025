FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Mr Major's statement
'The Downing Street Declaration offered an opportunity for peace. It calls
for a permanent end to violence and offers a balanced opportunity for all to
play a full part in the future political life of Northern Ireland.
'The IRA have declared a complete cessation of violence.
'I am greatly encouraged by this, but we need to be clear that this is
indeed intended to be a permanent renunciation of violence, that is to say,
for good.
'If it is, then many options are open. If they are genuinely and irrevocably
committed to use only peaceful and democratic methods in the future, then we
shall respond positively, as we said in the Joint Declaration.
'Let words now be reflected in deeds.'
