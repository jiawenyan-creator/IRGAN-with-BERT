FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Tax settlement will lift
Caterpillar
AFTER-TAX earnings at Caterpillar, the US construction equipment group, will
be boosted this year by Dollars 300m, or nearly Dollars 3 a share, following
the settlement of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, writes
Richard Waters.
Caterpillar said the money would be used to reduce outstanding debt, which
currently stands at over Dollars 4bn, including the retirement of some
relatively high-cost long-term debt. The costs associated with retiring
long-term debt would result in a pre-tax charge of Dollars 50m, Caterpillar
said.
The tax settlement relates to export sales made by the company in the period
1979-87. Last year, Caterpillar recorded a loss of just over Dollars 2 a
share before the effect of accounting changes. In New York, caterpillar's
share price closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 80 1/4 .
