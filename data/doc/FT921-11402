FT  31 JAN 92 / School standards criticised
THE STANDARD of education of more than a quarter of pupils in England is
unsatisfactory, the government's independent schools education watchdog said
yesterday.
In his annual report for 1990-91 Dr Terry Melia, the senior chief inspector
of schools, said that 30 per cent of primary school work inspected was less
than satisfactory. For secondary school pupils aged between 11 and 16, the
figure was 27 per cent.
