  [Text] Following the decision by Edem Kodjo of the Togolese 
Union for Democracy [UTD] to accept the post of prime minister, 
the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] has reacted saying that 
his acceptance constitutes a violation of the agreement signed 
on 26 March. CAR noted that under an agreement concluded and 
signed on 26 March by the two political parties which formed the 
parliamentary majority, it was decided that the new prime 
minister must come from the CAR party. On that same day, the 
UTD approved the nominee for that post. The fact that Edem 
Kodjo has accepted the post of prime minister is a blatant and 
unacceptable violation of the 26 March agreement. The CAR 
believes that no one can take advantage of the privileges of a 
parliamentary majority without adhering to the agreement upon 
which that parliamentary majority is based. 
  Therefore, the CAR has decided not to participate in any 
cabinet that may be formed by Edem Kodjo, in defiance of the 
desire expressed by the people during the 6 and 20 February 
polls and of the agreement signed on 26 March between the CAR 
and the UTD.
