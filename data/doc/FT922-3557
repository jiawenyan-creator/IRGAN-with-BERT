FT  11 JUN 92 / US allowed Indonesian arms sales to Iraq
THE Bush administration gave its approval in November 1989 to Indonesian
government arms sales to Iraq, according to a declassified State Department
cable made public in Congress yesterday.
The cable is the first confirmation that the US gave explicit approval to
allies to sell arms to Iraq, while Washington was ostensibly operating an
embargo against Baghdad. The cable was sent to instruct a US envoy who was
to hold a meeting with an Indonesian minister over Jakarta's wish to sell
French Super-Puma helicopters to Iraq.
The cable, which was classified secret and sent by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger,
the deputy secretary of state, says: 'Although the US severely limits the
sale of our own munitions-list items to Iraq, we have not had a policy of
discouraging other countries' arms sales to Iraq. Such a policy is in effect
with regard to Iran.'
Mr Sam Gejdenson, a Democratic on the House foreign affairs committee,
yesterday released the cable along with other documents illustrating the US
'tilt' to Iraq, both before and after the August 1988 conclusion of the war
between Baghdad and Tehran.
Mr Gejdenson, who yesterday claimed that Mr James Baker, secretary of state,
had withheld documents from his congressional investigation into US
relations with Iraq, stressed the Eagleburger cable was sent less than nine
months before Mr Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and well after the end of the
Iran-Iraq war.
At the height of the US tilt to Baghdad, in a cable signed in June 1984 by
Mr George Shultz, then secretary of state, it was stated that 'under present
circumstances, in which Iraq is clearly on the defensive and Iran is in
little danger of defeat, we are not actively opposing non-US controlled
exports of arms to Iraq, which do not contribute to widening the war'.
Mr Gejdenson yesterday also released a late 1988 State Department memo -
entitled Guidelines for US-Iraqi Policy - that seemed to oppose any arms
sales to Baghdad, but simultaneously suggested making an exception to the US
ban on weapons sales by allowing the sale of C-130 transport aircraft and
computers.
