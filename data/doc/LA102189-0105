MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE JOLTS BAY AREA 
I find the quick response of the Bush Administration to the San Francisco area 
earthquake interesting compared to the Administration virtually ignoring the 
Alaska oil spill, and its sluggish and inadequate response to Hurricane Hugo's 
devastation. 
How many electoral college votes does California have in comparison with both 
Alaska and South Carolina? Surely federal disaster response is humanitarian -- 
or is it another calculated political move?
