FT  10 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Separate accounts
HOW IMPORTANT is it for husbands and wives to maintain separate accounts in
order to satisfy the Inland Revenue that dividend and other income belongs
to one or the other?
We have separate interest-bearing accounts at the moment, and a joint cheque
account (either to sign) into which we transfer funds when necessary. But it
would be simpler (and produce a higher rate of interest) if we also had a
joint interest-bearing account into which all our funds were paid and to
which we both had free access.
Would the Revenue accept tax vouchers and P60s (my pension) as proof of the
receiver of the income for tax purposes?
If there have been no transfers of assets between you, then a joint
interest-bearing account should not cause any problems under the
anti-avoidance rules set out in, for example, section 674A of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (inserted by the Finance Act 1989, on the
introduction of independent taxation).
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR80(1992) (Income tax and married
couples) or, if you want more details of the anti-avoidance provisions (and
extra-statutory concession), free booklet IR83 (1990) (Independent taxation:
a guide for tax practitioners).
