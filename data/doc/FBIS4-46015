  [Excerpt] The United States is urging Israel to ratify the 
international convention on the elimination of chemical weapons 
within a few months. Israel will respond to this U.S. request, 
which was recently received here, by the end of the month. The 
Defense and Foreign Ministries are preparing to hold 
consultations on the reply. 
  On 22 May, a discussion on the Chemical Weapons Convention 
[CWC] was held at Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' office. 
Israel signed the convention in January 1993. In its reply to 
the United States, it will presumably announce that since the 
ratification date is not until next year, Israel will not 
address the issue at the present time. To prevent the CWC from 
harming its security and to ensure a Middle East free of 
chemical weapons, however, Israel will demand that Arab 
countries also sign the convention. [passage omitted]
