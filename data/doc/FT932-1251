FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cornwell warning
Cornwell Parker, the furniture and fabrics group, said that since its
interim statement in March, sales had been less resilient than expected.
As a result, unless there was a marked upturn in demand, pre-tax profits for
the year to July 31 would be lower than present market expectations. It
hoped to recommend an unchanged final dividend of 4p.
