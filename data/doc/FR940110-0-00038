In regard to condition (B), the legislative history of the amended statute states: ``In effect, this condition ``grandfathers''
only the particular person who holds the foreign ownership on May 24, 1993; the ``grandfathering'' does not transfer
to any future foreign owners.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 213, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 495 (1993), reprinted in 1993 U.S. Code

of the directors are aliens, or of which more than one-fourth of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens,
