Balance of the Clearing Account With the Slovak Republic Has 
Fundamentally Changed"] 
  [Text] Prague--The balance of foreign trade with 
Slovakia's clearing account fell in April from 2.067 billion 
korunas to 391.373 million korunas. This has been announced by 
Ondrej Kvacek of the Czech National Bank Public Relations 
Department. The figure of more than 391 million korunas 
approximately equals 11.5 million ECU's, which is less than a 
tenth of the permitted level of 130 million ECU's. During the 
year that this level has been in effect, it was exceeded 
twice--in December 1993 by 40.2 million ECU's and in January 
1994 by 46.1 million ECU's--and each time the Slovak party paid 
the difference in convertible currency in time.
