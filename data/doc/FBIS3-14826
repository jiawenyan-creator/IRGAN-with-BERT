appointed Sergey Tsiplyayev his plenipotentiary representative 
at the Interparliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  Yeltsin's decree notes that the appointment was prompted by 
the need for maintaining permanent relations between the Russian 
president and the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS states. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt at the presidential press service on Friday 
that Tsiplyayev, the president's representative in St. 
Petersburg, will perform his new duties concurrently. 
  The decree provides for setting up an office (which will be 
a 
component part of the president's staff) to ensure the operation 
of the president's representative at the Interparliamentary 
Assembly.
