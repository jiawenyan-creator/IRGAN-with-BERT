FT  19 NOV 92 / Tax collection costs jump
TAX COLLECTION costs increased sharply during 1991-92 to the highest level
in at least five years, the Inland Revenue's annual report showed yesterday.
Costs as a proportion of revenue collected rose to 2.06 per cent - a total
of Pounds 1.6bn - compared with 1.7 per cent last year and 1.61 per cent in
the previous 12 months.
The Revenue stressed that the average cost of collection was only a partial
indicator of performance. The cost was influenced by changes in the
structure and level of tax, and movements in income and profit, as well as
departmental efficiency, The Revenue said.
It added that nearly half of the increase was the result of the new bank and
building society interest arrangements, and the balance reflected a 2 per
cent increase in expenditure above inflation and a 3 per cent fall in tax
yield.
Setting up the new arrangements for tax and building society interest
totalled Pounds 163m for 1991-92 and Pounds 46m for 1990-91.
Total tax received was Pounds 101bn against repayments of Pounds 21bn. The
Revenue collected a further Pounds 37bn on behalf of other departments,
principally from National Insurance contributions.
Tax yield from tackling non-compliance rose by more than a quarter to Pounds
5bn, including a contribution of Pounds 1.7bn from counter-evasion and
counter-avoidance.
The proportion of tax unpaid from the collectable total rose from 62 per
cent to 64 per cent in line with the target for the Revenue's collection
offices.
Employment in the last decade has fallen from 73,980 to 69,800.
