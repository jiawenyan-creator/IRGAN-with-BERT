 

C. Constitutional Validity of Section 184 Process 



The automakers' comments on EPA's April 26 proposal have raised a number of arguments that the Agency's proceedings
under section 184 are unconstitutional.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has submitted a response to these constitutional arguments.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 EPA does not believe the arguments that section 184 is unconstitutional have merit. And in any case, given EPA's independent
authority under section 110(k)(5), any constitutional question regarding the validity of section 184 would not
affect the validity of the action proposed today.

The automakers argue that Congress, through section 184, is commandeering the legislative processes of the OTR states
by directly compelling them to take certain actions. The automakers argue that this violates principles of federalism
and the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Tenth Amendment to mean that Congress
cannot coerce states in their sovereign political capacity to regulate private conduct.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Section 184 is fully within the scheme of ``cooperative federalism'' that the courts have confirmed is consistent
with constitutional requirements.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 As with many other federal programs, section 184 is simply an unremarkable case under the Clean Air Act's SIP program
where Congress has provided incentives to the states as a method of influencing their policy choices. Congress may
attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds (as long as the conditions bear some relation to the purpose of the
federal spending), to influence states' legislative choices. And where Congress has the authority to regulate private
activity under the Commerce Clause, the Court has recognized Congress's power to offer states the choice of regulating
an activity according to federal standards or having state law pre-empted by federal regulation.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Here, Congress provided incentives to the states by placing conditions on highway funding; by allowing states to
apply a less stringent ``offset ratio'' for new stationary pollution sources; and by allowing states to themselves
impose regulations rather than having the federal government implement the program the state chose not to implement.
See sections 179 (highway and offset sanctions) and 110(c)(1) (federal implementation plans).

The automakers also argue that section 184 constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of federal authority to the
OTC and violates the Appointments Clause. They argue that through section 184 Congress delegated legislative authority
outside the federal government, or authorized state officials composing the OTC to exercise significant federal
executive authority that the Constitution commands only federal officials appointed consistent with the Appointments
Clause may exercise. EPA does not, however, believe that state officials exercise ``significant authority'' pursuant
to federal law in this context. EPA welcomes comment on the automakers' constitutional arguments and the response
from NRDC that are in the docket. 



D. Consistency of EPA Action With Limitations on Authority Under Sections 177, 202 and 209 of the Act 



EPA's proposed action is fully consistent with both the letter and spirit of sections 177, 202 and 209 of the Act. These
three provisions make it clear that Congress wanted auto manufacturers to have to meet only two types of standards_federal
standards and California standards. Section 177 specifically contemplates that California's standards may apply
outside California. 
Approving the OTC's recommendation is doing no more than requiring states, based on need, to exercise authority given
to them by Congress. EPA is authorized to take this action under sections 184 and 110. EPA disagrees with those commenters
that claim sections 177 and 202 preclude EPA from approving the OTC's recommendation. 

Requiring adoption of the LEV standards in the OTR does not change any current federal standard, so it is not prohibited
by section 202. Section 202(b)(1)(C) explicitly precludes EPA only from exercising its authority under section
202 to modify certain specified standards prior to model year 2004_it is not a general prohibition of all EPA action
relating to the control of emissions from motor vehicles. Thus, EPA may not modify certain mandatory federal standards
applicable nation-wide to motor vehicles until model year 2004. However, today's proposal requires only that states
adopt certain programs applicable to motor vehicles in such states, as states are permitted to do under section 177.
EPA is not proposing to rely on section 202 to require the LEV standards, so the prohibition in 202(b)(1)(C) is irrelevant.


The automakers have argued that granting the OTC petition violates section 177 because EPA is making a choice (whether
states should adopt California standards) that section 177 reserves to the states. This misconstrues the nature
of section 177 and fails to read section 177 together with section 110(k)(5) or section 184. Section 177 provides an
exception to the general prohibition in section 209 against states (other than California) adopting motor vehicle
emission standards. Section 177 thus provides states the discretion to adopt controls that section 209 would otherwise
preclude. Sections 110(k)(5) and 184 allow EPA to require states to take actions that would otherwise be left to their
discretion. The language of section 177, that the states' authority applies ``[n]otwithstanding section 209,''
makes clear that Congress intended to provide an exception to section 209, not bar EPA requirements under sections
110 or 184. 



IV. Basis for Approval of OTC LEV Recommendation. 



A. Necessity 



1. Legal Interpretation of Necessity 



EPA's April 26 proposal contains an extensive discussion of the Agency's approach to interpreting the ``necessary''
standard under section 184(c), and includes several options. See 59 FR at 2172527. Today, EPA is proposing
its interpretation of this standard. Section 110(k)(5) also includes a ``necessary'' standard providing that,
upon an EPA finding of SIP inadequacy, the Agency is to require that the state submit SIP revisions that are ``necessary''
to correct the inadequacy. EPA is proposing that, in this particular case, the ``necessary'' standard under section
110(k)(5) be interpreted the same as the ``necessary'' standard under section 184(c). 

If EPA approves or partially approves the recommendation, section 184(c)(5) provides that EPA is to issue a finding
that the SIPs for the states to which an approved requirement applies are inadequate to meet the requirements of section
110(a)(2)(D). Section 110(a)(2)(D) provides that SIPs are to contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions
within the state that will ``contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any
other state.'' 

EPA is proposing that contributing emissions are significant under section 110(a)(2)(D) at least where controlling
such emissions is necessary to bring any downwind area into attainment. EPA also is proposing that emissions interfere
with downwind maintenance under 110(a)(2)(D) at least where controlling such emissions is necessary for downwind
areas to maintain the NAAQS.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 EPA is further proposing to interpret section 184 to mean that the Agency may approve the OTC's recommendation if the
measures are necessary for any area in the OTR to attain or maintain the NAAQS.




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
EPA is not addressing in this rulemaking whether, under section 110(a)(2)(D), a state's emissions may ``contribute
significantly'' to nonattainment or ``interfere with maintenance'' in another state when controlling the upwind
state's emissions is not strictly necessary but nevertheless would be helpful to downwind states' efforts to attain
and maintain the NAAQS.
