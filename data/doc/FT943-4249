FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: KHD cuts deficit as new orders
rise 60%
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, the German engineering group, yesterday reported a
60 per cent increase in new orders in the first half, during which it cut
its interim net loss to DM93m (Dollars 60m) from DM98m.
The company, which had warned earlier of a 'typical' first-half deficit,
said operating earnings had improved markedly, but the bottom-line figure
had been reduced by heavy launch costs and restructuring measures.
It forecast an unchanged break-even result for the full year and said all
the turnover increase in the review period - DM1.35bn compared with DM1.28bn
 -had come from foreign sales.
Overseas turnover rose 16 per cent while domestic revenues shrank 8 per
cent.
Sales of engines and other drive components rose 4.5 per cent and
agricultural equipment improved 18 per cent, while industrial plant turnover
fell 26 per cent.
The group's order book was lifted by a 163 per cent rise in demand for
industrial plant, while the drives and farm machinery divisions booked
increases of 20 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.
