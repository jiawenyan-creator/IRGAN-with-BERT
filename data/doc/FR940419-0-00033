 

This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the ``Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The emergency regulations
have been in effect since February 17, 1993. Commercial operators utilizing the Port of Providence have reported
no problems or economic burdens due to these regulations. The volume of commercial traffic utilizing this waterway
is such that the costs incurred due to delays because of one-way traffic or reduced visibility are considered minimal
and are far outweighed by the extra measures of safety provided by the regulations.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the
economic impact of this rule to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implication to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The environmental impact of this rule has been evaluated using the Coast Guard's procedures for implementing the
National Environmental Policy Act (Commandant Instruction M16475.1B). Under Section 2.B.2.(c) of these procedures,
it is concluded that this action is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical
Exclusion Determination is available in the docket.
