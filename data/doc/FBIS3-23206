  [Text] Santiago, 3 Mar (EFE) -- The Latin America and 
Caribbean countries are making progress toward the establishment 
of national authorities that will prevent the production, 
transportation, and trade of chemical weapons in the area. 
  The Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs today released the 
documents produced by the last regional seminar on this subject, 
which was held in Santiago last September. 
  The report stresses that each country must establish a 
national authority that will prohibit in their respective 
territories or in any place under their control the existence of 
chemical weapons, trade in elements for their manufacturing, or 
research to develop this kind of war materiel. 
  The documents point out that countries like Argentina, Cuba, 
Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela are concerned with preventing 
impediments to economic and technological development in the 
area, and with establishing solid bases for trade in chemical 
substances not suitable for war use.
