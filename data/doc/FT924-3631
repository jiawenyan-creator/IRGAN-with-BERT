FT  07 DEC 92 / Marketmakers gain tax relief
MARKETMAKERS on the London International Financial Futures and Options
Exchange will be able to receive business relief on inheritance tax from
next March under rules introduced by the Inland Revenue.
Business relief and the option to pay related inheritance tax in
interest-free instalments are being extended beyond Stock Exchange
marketmakers after an announcement by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury. There will be 100 per cent relief for inheritance
tax for interests in unincorporated business, and holdings above 25 per cent
in unquoted companies and those on the Unlisted Securities Mar-ket.
There will be 50 per cent relief for controlling holdings in quoted
companies, holdings of no more than 25 per cent in unquoted and USM
companies and certain assets owned by partners or controlling shareholders
in their own partnership or company.
