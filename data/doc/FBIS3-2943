  [Text] Belgrade, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Russia today appeared 
to be supporting an agreement reached by Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats by calling on the Bosnian Serbs to "seriously study" the 
accord. 
  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin said during 
a 
meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic here that the 
agreement concluded between Bosnian Muslims and Croats in 
Washington on March 1 to set up a federation could help solve 
the Bosnian conflict. 
  According to the agreement, Bosnian Serbs will be invited to 
join the federation. 
  U.S. Presidential Envoy for Bosnia Charles Redman last week 
met with Churkin in London, asking the latter to persuade the 
Serbs to join the U.S.-sponsored peace plan. 
  Churkin has been shuttling between Zagreb, Sarajevo, Pale 
and 
Belgrade. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev met Monday in 
Vladivoskok to discuss newly-emerging problems between the two 
countries. 
  The two foreign ministers agreed in their talks that the two 
countries should continue to seek cooperation in international 
issues including Bosnia and the Middle East. 
  In another development, UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia 
lieutenant General Michael Rose arrived at the Tuzla airport to 
inspect the work under way to reopen the airport for 
humanitarian relief supplies. 
  The Bosnian Serbs agreed to end the siege of the airport on 
March 1 on condition that Russia sends observers to guarantee 
that the airport only be used for relief supplies. 
  But the date of the airport's reopening has not been set 
yet.
