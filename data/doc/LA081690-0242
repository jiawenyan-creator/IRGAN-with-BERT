WORLD; 
DELAY ON HOSTAGES TIED TO GULF 
A pro-Iranian leader said today that the deployment of U.S. troops in the 
Persian Gulf will delay the release of American hostages in Lebanon. 
"I don't see . . . that the American hostages will be released soon because 
America is in a state of clear aggression against the Islamic nation," Hussein 
Moussawi, a senior member of Hezbollah (Party of God), said. 
"Releasing the American hostages now would be a reward to the Americans for 
their invasion of the gulf," Moussawi said. 
"As for the other European hostages, be they Britons or others, their situation 
is different than that of the Americans," he added. 
A Beirut newspaper reported today that all Western hostages in Lebanon could be 
free by the end of the year. The leftist As-Safir newspaper said secret 
contacts are taking place between Tehran and Lebanese and Palestinian groups 
with links to the hostage-takers.
