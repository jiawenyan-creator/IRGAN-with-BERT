  [Text] Of the 10 Bell-212 helicopters donated by the U.S. 
State Department to the National Police for interdiction 
operations against drug trafficking in the Peruvian jungle, five 
are sitting broken down in Pucallpa. 
  This information was provided by National Police sources, 
who 
indicated that antinarcotics operations in the Upper Huallaga, 
as well as in the mountain ranges of the central jungle, have 
been momentarily suspended because of the absence of these 
helicopters. 
  Experts in the struggle against drug trafficking said that 
the helicopters are a great help in transporting police 
personnel, as land transportation is very difficult in the 
jungle due to ambushes by narcoterrorists. 
  A spokesman for the National Police said that despite this 
inconvenience operations are going on, but not as many.
