SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SAN DIEGO STATE 
Bryan Williams of San Diego State's basketball team was restored to good 
standing by Coach Jim Brandenburg Monday after a one-game suspension, but he 
might not have regained his starting job. 
Williams, senior point guard from St. Bernard High School in Playa del Rey, sat 
out the Air Force game in Colorado Springs last Saturday because he had 
violated curfew in Ft. Collins, Colo., after the Colorado State game two nights 
earlier. BOB WOLF
