Land Disposal Restrictions: Proposed Treatability Variance For Citgo Petroleum 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

Proposed approval of site-specific treatability variance for Citgo Petroleum Facility at Lake Charles, Louisiana.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 
or Agency) is today proposing to grant a site-specific 
treatability variance from the Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) 
treatment standards for F037 and F038 nonwastewaters that are 
contained in, and to be removed from, a 26 acre surface 
impoundment (Surge Pond). The specific waste was generated when 
the Surge Pond filled with water and primary sludge from the 
disposal of process wastewater and stormwater at the Citgo 
Corporation petroleum refinery located outside Lake Charles, 
Louisiana. Approximately 625,000 tons of waste remains in and is 
to be removed from the surface impoundment; this waste was 
subject to a national capacity variance until June 30, 1994. 



If this proposal is finalized, Citgo may complete their 
remediation effort that was approved by the Louisiana Department 
of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and EPA Region VI, provided they 
comply with the alternative treatment standards specified in this 
proposal, and also comply with any other applicable land disposal 
restrictions for this waste as specified in 40 CFR Part 268.
