METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
 DYING CHILD'S WISH: TO MEET PRESIDENT 
When the Make-a-Wish Foundation, an organization that grants wishes for 
terminally ill children, asked cystic fibrosis sufferer Jeffrey Baird what he 
wanted the most in the world, the Van Nuys boy thought it over. He decided 
against trying a stint as a guest DJ or meeting his favorite rock group, Guns 
'n' Roses. 
Instead, Jeffrey, 12, will leave Saturday for Washington, where he is to meet 
President George Bush on Monday. 
"I had a few choices, and I couldn't really decide," Jeffrey said. "I said, 
'Which would be harder to do? Whatever that is would be the best one.' "
