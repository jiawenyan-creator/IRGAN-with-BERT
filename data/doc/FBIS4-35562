BFN 

  [Text] Another two volleys of Katyusha rockets were fired 
over the past hour at the western Galilee and at south Lebanon's 
security zone. This was reported by correspondents Yo'av Aviv 
and Nati Zilberman. The first barrage was launched at the same 
area approximately two hours ago. There were no casualties or 
damage in any of the three barrages. IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] artillery shelled the sites from where the rockets were 
fired. Life continues normally in the western Galilee.
