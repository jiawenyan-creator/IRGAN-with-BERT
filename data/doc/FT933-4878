FT  07 SEP 93 / Housing market recovery picks up
THE SLOW recovery in the housing market is continuing, Department of the
Environment figures released yesterday indicate. They showed that work
started on 47,400 new dwellings in the three months from May to July.
The department said that builders started work on 9 per cent more homes than
in the corresponding three months last year. Completions were 40,300, down 4
per cent from the comparable figure for 1992.
It is estimated that in July 15,300 dwellings were started, compared with
14,200 in July last year.
Seasonally adjusted figures over the three months provide a clearer guide to
the state of the housing market.
These show that season-ally adjusted starts during May, June and July fell 6
per cent compared with the previous three months.
Housebuilders say that sales rose sharply in the early part of this year but
have slowed again in the traditionally quieter summer months, when many
potential customers go on holiday.
In the past few weeks the market has picked up again. Builders are hoping
that sales this month and next will be considerably higher than in the
corresponding months last year, when the housing market virtually died
following the UK's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr David Wilson, chairman of housebuilder Wilson Bowden, said yesterday that
the housing market was recovering slowly.
He expected that many of the sales incentives offered by builders would
disappear in the next few months as the upturn continued.
