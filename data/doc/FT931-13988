FT  20 JAN 93 / IBM reports record Dollars 4.97bn loss as mainframe sales
drop
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday confirmed investors' worst fears
by reporting a net loss of Dollars 4.97bn (Pounds 3.26bn) for 1992, the
biggest annual loss in corporate history, as sales of mainframe computers
dropped sharply in the fourth quarter.
The final quarter was IBM's worst ever. A net loss of Dollars 5.46bn
compared with a loss of Dollars 1.46bn in the same period in 1991. Revenues
declined almost 11 per cent to Dollars 19.56bn from Dollars 21.97bn in the
fourth quarter of 1991.
Mr John Akers, chairman, said that 'difficult problems remain ahead for
IBM'. The outlook for early 1993 remained 'unfavourable', IBM told analysts.
IBM will decide next week whether to reduce its dividend, which now stands
at Dollars 4.84 per share. Last month, Mr Akers said he was unsure of IBM's
ability to maintain the dividend, which analysts now expect to be cut by at
least half. IBM's UK subsidiary was the group's blackest spot. Its operating
losses of Pounds 398m, together with a restructuring charge of Pounds 218m,
added up to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 616m, almost five times the figure in
1991.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, IBM UK chairman, attributed the result to weak demand
for hardware, competitive pressure on margins and currency fluctuations.
Export revenues fell by 6 per cent from Pounds 2.28bn to Pounds 2.14bn,
suggesting a weaker demand in the rest of Europe. IBM's Greenock plant in
Scotland is a main site for personal computer manufacture in Europe.
Total UK revenues fell 6 per cent to Pounds 3.75bn. Mr Nick Temple, the IBM
executive recalled from continental Europe a year ago to return the UK
operation to profitability, said substantial cuts in costs would be sought
in 1993.
Worldwide, IBM reported pre-tax operating income of Dollars 265m, but paid
taxes at the unusually high rate of 117 per cent to produce an after-tax
loss of Dollars 45m or 8 cents per share.
Analysts had been expecting the group to break even in the quarter, based
upon IBM's warnings issued in December.
IBM took pre-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 7.2bn in the fourth
quarter, bringing total charges for the year to Dollars 11.6bn as it
struggled to reduce costs by shedding 40,000 workers and cutting
manufacturing capacity.
Net losses for the year were offset slightly by a gain of Dollars 1.42bn
from a change in accounting for income taxes. Revenues fell 0.4 per cent to
Dollars 64.52bn from Dollars 64.77bn in 1991 when IBM reported a net loss of
Dollars 2.86bn after charges of Dollars 3.7bn.
IBM reported a 'pronounced' decline in sales of mainframe computers and data
storage systems in the fourth quarter. Sales of AS/400 mini-computers, which
had been strong, fell by more than 10 per cent in the final quarter. US and
European sales fell by 'double digit' percentages in the fourth quarter, and
those in Japan by a 'single digit' percentage.
Full-year revenues from non-US operations were Dollars 39.89bn, down 1.1 per
cent. A net loss of Dollars 560m compared with a net profit of Dollars
1.79bn in 1991. Most of the 1992 restructuring costs were charged to US
operations where some 29,000 jobs were cut.
The US operations also carry the bulk of product development costs. In
December, IBM announced plans to cut another 25,000 jobs this year, about
half in Europe.
IBM warned that gross profit margins would remain under pressure. In the
fourth quarter, gross margins declined to 'slightly below 40 per cent' from
49.9 per cent in 1991.
