  [Text] Closed parliamentary hearings on the issue of 
Russo-Georgian relations in connection with the signing of the 
treaty of friendship, good-neighborliness and mutual assistance 
and other issues in Russo-Georgian relations are taking place in 
the State Duma. Our correspondent Yevgeniy Zherebenkov reports: 
  [Zherebenkov] Judging from the information which it has been 
possible to obtain from some of the participants in the 
hearings, the essence of the proposals made by parliamentarians 
boils down to the fact that the recently signed Russian-Georgian 
treaty needs to be substantially amended and in its present form 
virtually stands no chance of being ratified in the Russian 
parliament. This is what I was in told in particular by deputy 
Yevgeniy Ambartsumov: 
  [Begin Ambartsumov recording] This has to do with the 
discussion of the Russo-Georgian treaty and of its consequences, 
especially the hidden consequences. Various points of view on 
this score are being voiced. The fear is being expressed that 
the assistance through this treaty to Shevardnadze and the 
government in order to stabilize the situation in Georgia could 
turn into the destabilization of the situation in Russia itself, 
specifically in the area of the northern Caucasus. For 
instance, the following question arose of what the cost to 
Russia will be of this -- supporting Georgia, equipping military 
bases, military aid, humanitarian aid, well, taking into account 
Russia's grave economic situation. The most important problem 
is relations with the republics of the Northern Caucasus, plus 
Abkhazia, North Ossetia, etc. [end recording]
