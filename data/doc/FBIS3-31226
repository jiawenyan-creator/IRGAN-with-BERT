  [Text] We have received the following communique by fax 
from the Ministry of National Defense: 
  In connection with certain allegations taken from the German 
weekly DER SPIEGEL by the newspaper SLOBODNA SLOVO of 7 February 
1994 -- according to which two ultralight planes and eight [as 
heard] Mi-8 transport helicopters would have crossed Romanian 
territory to help the Muslim troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the 
Press Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense states: 
  These allegations have no real foundation. No foreign planes 
flew over the Romanian territory to bring supplies to any side 
involved in the ongoing conflict in former Yugoslavia. Romania 
strictly observes the embargo imposed by the United Nations. 
The news circulated by these publications is probably part of a 
scenario to brainwash public, the communique reads.
