  [Text] Kazakhstan is as yet the only state in Central Asia 
that has adopted its own military doctrine. The document 
expounds a system of views on preventing war and on the 
development of national armed forces. Specialists consider 
Kazakhstan's military doctrine to be defense oriented and 
propose cooperating with the CIS countries and tackling common 
tasks in the military sphere. Multilateral and bilateral 
intergovernmental agreements and treaties should serve as the 
legal basis for interaction with the CIS countries in the 
defense sphere.
