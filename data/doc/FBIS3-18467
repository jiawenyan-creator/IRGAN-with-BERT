Rabin His `Good Offices' After Hebron Bloodbath"] 
  [Excerpts] Last Saturday [26 February] Prime Minister 
Lubbers extended his condolences about the bloodbath in Hebron 
to his Israeli counterpart Rabin by telephone. Lubbers also 
expressed his concern about the future of the peace process in 
the Middle East. 
  A government information service spokesman said Lubbers had 
offered Rabin "his good offices." But, up to now, no use has 
been made of them by the Israeli Government. The timing of 
Lubbers's gesture, which was made public by Rabin himself on 
Wednesday, caused some surprise in Jerusalem. [passage omitted] 
  For observers in The Hague it comes as no surprise that 
Lubbers has shown himself ready to play a more influential role 
in the peace process. PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat had called for 
this as early as October last year. 'Arafat repeated his call 
for a mediating role for Lubbers during his first official visit 
to the Netherlands in December last year and again when he came 
to The Hague to meet Nelson Mandela last month. 
  In his contacts with The Hague 'Arafat has always shown he 
is 
not just interested in trade and aid relations with the 
Netherlands. The PLO leader also sees a political role for the 
Netherlands as a traditional ally to Israel. 
  He realizes that, thanks to the emotional Netherlands links 
with Israel, Lubbers can make his influence count both in 
Jerusalem and in the European Union. On Wednesday in Jerusalem 
Rabin's spokesman said that an exceptionally good understanding 
had arisen between Lubbers and Rabin since the Israeli prime 
minister's visit to the Netherlands last June.
