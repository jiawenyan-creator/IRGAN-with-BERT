  [Text] Taiwan's information office will stay when Hong 
Kong returns to Chinese rule -- but the name will be different. 
As of yesterday Free China Review (FCR) -- the island's 
Government Information Office (GIO) here, will be known as the 
Kwang Hwa Information and Culture Centre (KHICC). 
  Whether Taiwan will retreat after 1997 has been a concern in 
recent years. Although the ruling Kuomintang Government has 
repeated many times that it will stay, many believed some 
changes would have to take place to pacify the Chinese. 
  Political analysts have said Beijing would not tolerate the 
FCR, which contends the mainland is not free under communist 
rule. But Susie Chiang, director of the FCR and also the KHICC, 
dismissed claims that giving the organisation a new name meant a 
lower profile in the run-up to 1997. She said the centre had 
expanded its size and functions. 
  Originally housed in Central premises of only 300 square 
feet, the two-in-one FCR and KHICC has been relocated to 
expensive Pacific Place, Admiralty, with more than 1,000 square 
feet of accommodation. In addition to providing information, the 
centre now has a gallery, a conference hall and a library. 
  Ms Chiang, also a member of Taiwan's National Assembly, said 
there was resistance to its expansion. "Beijing wants us to 
keep a low profile," she said. "Before we moved to the present 
venue, we had already been functioning as an information and 
cultural centre. The new name is just to cope with our job 
description," she said. 
  At the grand opening yesterday, Ms Chiang vowed to stay 
after 
1997. "We are committed to Hong Kong," she said. "It is the 
meeting point between the two places across the Taiwan Strait, 
and its role will not change in the future." Taiwan's GIO 
Director General, Jason C. Mu, and 16 Taiwan legislators, also 
attended the opening.
