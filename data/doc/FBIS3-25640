  [Text] Walvis Bay Feb 23 SAPA -- About 1,000 looters caused 
damage to property worth R[Rand]500,000 when they ransacked a 
compound in a black township near Walvis Bay on Wednesday [23 
February]. The looting started at Kuisebmond Mill and Salvage 
compound after the crowd, who were apparently looking for a 
place to sleep, overpowered security guards. 
  Joined by compound residents, the mob looted a former hostel 
building of thousands of litres of ice-cream, 12 tons of fish, 
388 beef carcasses, crab meat worth R56,000, eight tons of 
processed mielie meal and R15,000 in cash. The mob then cordoned 
off the building and threw stones at police. 
  Lt Frik Conradie, District Commissioner of the SAP [South 
African Police] in Walvis Bay, said the SAP, accompanied by the 
Namibian police, later brought the situation under control. 
  Businessmen and residents said they were concerned that the 
looting would spill over into the town. No one was arrested.
