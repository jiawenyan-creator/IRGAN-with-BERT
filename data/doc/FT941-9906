FT  11 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
A pause in the wool market rise showed signs of developing at closing sales
last week, and was confirmed at the only two selling centres operating in
Australia this week. Price declines did not go far and the official market
indicator managed to rise one cent to 539 cents a kilogram yesterday, only 7
cents lower than a week before. Of some importance to wool buyers were
interest rates changes which included a rise in the US and a reduction in
the UK. Resulting currency changes put up the cost of most of the
internationally traded wool since the Australian dollar continues to gain
ground against the US dollar itself. The trade is unsure about the immediate
outlook for wool prices, with offerings heavy in Australia but a possibility
that Chinese buying may soon revive after a recent lull.
