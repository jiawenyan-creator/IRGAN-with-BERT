  [Text] The number of Russia's unemployed is rising by 
70,000 a month. The Federal Employment Service [FES] estimates 
that the tendency for unemployment to rise is fairly steady and 
will persist in the near future, Oleg Semenov, head of the FES 
Consolidated Analysis Department, said. 
  Around 1 million Russian citizens today are officially 
ranked 
as unemployed. The service predicts that by the end of the year 
the number of registered unemployed will reach 3 million, or 5 
percent of the working population. According to FES experts, 
the number of jobless and "unofficial" unemployed will reach 12 
million. 
  FES personnel are particularly worried at the increase in 
partial unemployment, i.e. the increase in the number of people 
working part-time or on enforced unpaid leave. 
  O. Semenov hypothesized that by this December there will be 
5-8 million people in partial employment. 
  However he did not agree with the forecast that there will 
be 
an "upsurge" of unemployment in the near future, saying that can 
only happen if "enterprise bankruptcy mechanisms are started up."
