FT  11 MAR 92 / Hexham Tories begin search for candidate
THE HEXHAM Conservative association yesterday set up a selection committee
to start sifting applications from potential parliamentary candidates to
succeed the constituency's MP Mr Alan Amos.
Mr Amos announced late on Monday that he would not fight the Northumberland
seat in the general election. This followed his being cautioned by police
after what he described as an 'incident' in London.
Hexham, where Mr Amos won by an 8,066 majority in 1987, had been considered
the only safe seat of the Conservatives' four constituencies in north-east
England.
Mr David Roberts, Conservative central office agent in the north-east,
yesterday declined to say whether the Hexham association would be able to
select a candidate by the weekend if the prime minister this week calls a
general election for April 9.
