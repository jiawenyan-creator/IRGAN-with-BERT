  [Text] Sanaa, 5 May (AFP) -- Heavy anti-aircraft fire broke 
out here Thursday as at least two southern Yemeni warplanes flew 
low over the city, and one of the aircraft may have been brought 
down, witnesses said. 
  The firing from the rival northern Yemeni guns lit up the 
pre-dawn sky for 45 minutes and a large cloud of smoke billowed 
into the air, they added. 
  Army vehicles criss-crossed the city and Westerners were 
advised to stay at home. 
  A US special envoy, Robert Pelletreau, arrived Wednesday to 
try to defuse the crisis which is pitting forces from the former 
North Yemen, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, against 
those from the old South Yemen, who back Vice-President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. 
  The two have been at loggerheads for months and the dispute 
is threatening to degenerate into a civil war which could split 
the country only four years after they united. 
  Clashes between rival army units broke out late Wednesday at 
Dhamar, south of the capital Sanaa, and in the main southern 
city Aden. 
  Northern radio broadcast an urgent message saying "we have 
done all we could to bring the southerners to their senses and 
now we must rely on our heroic forces." 
  Electricity has been cut off in most parts of Sanaa since 
Wednesday when the fighting broke out in Dhamar, which provides 
much of the capital's power. 
  There was also fighting around Aden airport. 
  Battles last week officially cost 79 lives, although 
independent sources put the death toll at more than 200.
