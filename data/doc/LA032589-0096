METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
FIRE WARNING ISSUED ON INCINERATOR PLANT 
Los Angeles County fire officials have warned that the City of Commerce 
refuse-to-energy plant does not have an adequate firefighting system and that a 
recent blaze could have resulted in serious injury or damage. 
The warning was contained in a letter from county Assistant Fire Chief Michael 
D. Aviani to a City of Commerce official about a fire in the trash pit of the 
plant on March 7. There were no injuries and damage was limited to the 
facility's roof, but it took firefighters about five hours to put out the 
flames. The cause of the fire is unknown. 
The firefighting effort was slowed because the plant is not properly equipped 
with water cannons and the plant's automatic roof vents malfunctioned, Aviani 
said. 
The high-tech incinerator is run by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts 
in conjunction with the City of Commerce. It is capable of burning 420 tons of 
non-hazardous garbage a day to provide electricity to about 20,000 homes.
