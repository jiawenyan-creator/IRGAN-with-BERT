FT  03 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Futures volume rises sharply
in February
Volume on the world's leading financial futures exchanges jumped during
February, reflecting the rush by banks and hedge fund managers to stem
losses in a turbulent world interest rate and foreign currency environment.
Volume in exchange-traded interest rate derivatives soared, with action in
Paris's Notional bond future more than double February 1993, and up 61 per
cent on an active January, at 5.9m contracts.
Liffe saw volume in its bund futures contract rise 53 per cent over January
and 264 per cent over last February to 4.38m contracts, while action in
Chicago's US Treasury bond futures pit was up 30 per cent from last February
and up 15.7 per cent from January at 8.4m contracts.
Chicago's Eurodollar futures, used for short-term interest rate hedging
around the world, traded 9.3m contracts in February, up 43 per cent from
January, and nearly double last February.
Interest rate options trading activity at all exchanges also soared. Foreign
currency futures, available only in Chicago, had volume gains of 8 per cent
over January, at 2.8m contracts.
Even within the derivatives industry, where volumes double every five to
eight years, exchange turnover during January and February has been
remarkable. Traders say the sharp rise in exchange business correlates with
worldwide financial volatility and heavy trading in underlying cash markets.
There was little evidence that fund managers and banks were liquidating
derivatives positions as part of February's heavy turnover. The number of
open positions in Matif's Notional future were up 41.4 per cent over
January, positions in London's bund futures contract rose 60 per cent from
January to February, but there was little change in the number of open
positions Chicago's Eurodollar or US Treasury bond futures.
