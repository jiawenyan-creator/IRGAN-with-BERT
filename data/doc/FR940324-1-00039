SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency is publishing this Notice to afford members of the public an additional 30 days to provide comments on proposed
regulations to amend the Vaccine Injury Table governing the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (hereinafter
``VICP'' or ``Program''). The VICP was established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99660
[42 U.S.C. 300aa10 et seq.] (Act), and provides a system of no-fault compensation for certain individuals
who have been injured by specific childhood vaccines. Petitions for compensation under this Program are filed with
the United States Court of Federal Claims, with a copy served on the Secretary, who is denominated the ``Respondent.''
The Vaccine Injury Table (Table) included in the Act establishes presumptions about causation of certain illnesses
and conditions, which are used by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to adjudicate petitions. 



Under section 312 of the Act, Congress mandated that the Secretary review the scientific literature and other information
on specific adverse consequences of pertussis and rubella vaccines. In accordance with the requirements of that
law, the Secretary entered into a contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to perform this review. The IOM published
on August 27, 1991 a report of its review entitled, ``Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines'' (hereinafter
``IOM Report.'') 

Section 312 also required the Secretary to propose regulations to amend the Table as a result of such findings. Accordingly,
on August 14, 1992, the Assistant Secretary for Health, with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(the Secretary) published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 36878) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend the Table. The NPRM was issued pursuant to section 2114
of the Act, which authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to modify the Table. As required by section 2114(c)
of the Act, the Department provided for a 6-month comment period which closed on February 11, 1993. In addition, on
December 3, 1992, the Department held a public hearing for the purpose of receiving oral testimony on the proposed
rule. 

The Agency analyzed the comments received in preparation for publication of the final rule. During this process,
however, the Agency became aware of the imminent publication of a 10-year follow-up study to the National Childhood
Encephalopathy Study (Madge N., Diamond J., Miller D., Ross E., McManus C., Wadsworth J., Yule W. The National Childhood
Encephalopathy Study: A 10-year follow-up. A report of the medical, social, behavioural and educational outcomes
after serious, acute, neurologic illness in early childhood. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology 1993;
Supplement No. 68;35(7):1118; Miller D.L., Madge N., Diamond J., Wadsworth J., Ross E. Pertussis immunization
and serious acute neurological illness in children. British medical Journal 1993; 307:11711176, hereinafter
``Miller study.''). Because the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) was reviewed initially by the IOM,
and because the Miller study looked specifically at the relationship between vaccine administration and resulting
neurological damage, the Department determined that it should not proceed with publication of the final rule until
there had been a sufficient opportunity to consider the conclusions of the new Miller study. Accordingly, the Department
asked the IOM to convene a Committee for purposes of evaluating the Miller study in light of the conclusions of its initial
report. On March 2, 1994, the Institute of Medicine issued a report entitled ``DPT Vaccine and Chronic Nervous System
Dysfunction: A New Analysis.'' 

The Agency has determined that the public should have an additional 30 days to comment on the conclusions of this report
prior to publication of the final rule. Only those comments addressing the conclusions of this latest IOM report will
be considered. Commenters should address whether the proposed rule should be modified in light of the conclusions
of this latest IOM report. The Department will consider carefully all comments received, and will address these comments
in the preamble to the final rule. 

The Department is not able to reproduce herein the entire study for review by the public. Set forth below, however,
is the Executive Summary of the report containing the IOM's conclusions. Copies of the full report can be obtained
by contacting the National Academy of Sciences, 2101 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 200775576.
