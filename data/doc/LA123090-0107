OUR READERS WROTE LETTERS THROUGHOUT 1990 EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWPOINTS ON A 
VARIETY OF ISSUES. HERE ARE CONDENSED VERSIONS OF SOME OF THOSE LETTERS TO HELP 
US REMEMBER THE EVENTS THAT MATTERED TO ORANGE COUNTY READERS THIS PAST YEAR. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE READERS WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SHARE THEIR VIEWPOINTS 
AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THEM AND OTHERS IN 1991.; 
RON KOVIC AND HIS CLAIM TO LEADERSHIP 
I hope the recent movement by some to import Ron Kovic into our 38th 
Congressional District to oppose Robert K. Dornan fails. Such a confrontation 
might sell newspapers but has no other useful purpose. 
At a time when Dornan can and should be defeated, there are those who would run 
a person who hopefully could not be elected. 
Kovic is a man who apparently grew up with a distorted fantasy of war and a 
thirst for combat. During his second tour of combat in Vietnam, he was gravely 
wounded. Reality would not compromise. His once-beloved fantasies became the 
enemy of his new, distorted view of the world around him. 
Now Kovic wants to come to my district and represent me. He states he has the 
same view on Central American that he had for Vietnam. Like Gen. Benedict 
Arnold before, Kovic has long since used up his leadership status.
