FT  23 MAY 94 / Paternity leave cost 'negligible'
The cost to companies of giving paternity leave to workers is negligible, a
survey by Industrial Relations Services has found.
Allowing a father time off for his child's birth amounts to as little as 23
minutes per worker per year. A poll of 126 companies showed that about 6,000
workers had taken paternity leave during the past year. The average time off
was five days, although some companies grant only one day.
