STATE; 
ASSEMBLY OKS GUN WAITING PERIOD 
The Assembly today approved a bill that would extend to all firearms the 15-day 
waiting period for purchasing handguns. 
The 43-21 vote on AB497 by Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-Sacramento) came after 
the Assembly rejected GOP amendments to order the state to automate the check 
system within 18 months. 
Under the law now, anyone buying a handgun has to wait 15 days, while his or 
her background is checked, before obtaining the weapon. A person with a 
criminal record or who has been found by a court to be mentally incompetent 
cannot buy a handgun. The bill would extend that 15-day waiting period to 
rifles and shotguns. It would also expand the grounds for rejection on mental 
grounds to people who have voluntarily committed themselves or have been 
hospitalized for 72 hours for observation.
