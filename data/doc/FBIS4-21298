  [Text] International media reports coming from Spain have 
linked Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero to 
several ghost companies which are being investigated by the 
Spanish Government as part of the properties owned by the 
wealthy businessman Mariano Rubio. According to this 
information, Cordero has ties with several private firms 
allegedly used to launder money. 
  However, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino 
pointed 
out that those reports are all intended to tarnish the 
Panamanian Government's image. Mulino made those statements at 
a posthumous ceremony honoring former Foreign Minister Julio 
Linares. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] I am sure the report is politically 
motivated and is attempting to damage the government's image 
internally. What they are doing with utter irresponsibility, 
however, is harming our country. The Spanish magazine does not 
highlight anything specific on the deputy foreign minister. It 
only mentions his firm superficially. The problem is a 
different one in Spain. [end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Mulino said Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos 
Cordero will clarify this information in due time.
