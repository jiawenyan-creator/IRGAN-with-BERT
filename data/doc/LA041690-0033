WORLD IN BRIEF; 
ISRAEL; 
U.S. PUBLIC SUPPORT FADING, DOLE WARNS 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, in Jerusalem with a Senate delegation on a 
Middle East tour, urged Israel to move toward peace talks. 
He said American public support for the Jewish state diminishes with every 
report of violence in the two-year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied 
areas. "It's sort of Vietnam all over again. People watch television, they see 
what's happening in the intifada (uprising), they don't like it," Dole said, 
recalling how the media helped turn U.S. public opinion against the Vietnam 
War.
