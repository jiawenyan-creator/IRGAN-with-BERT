FT  06 MAY 92 / PowerGen workers balloted on wages
UNIONS at PowerGen, one of the privatised electricity companies, are
balloting their members on the first local pay package in the electricity
industry.
The 6,500 employees are expected to accept the package, which has been
negotiated over the past year with the five unions representing the majority
of employees.
The last national pay settlement in the electricity supply industry was
negotiated this year, with a 5.5 per cent settlement for 1992-93. Employers
then gave 12 months' notice of their intention to negotiate locally next
year.
PowerGen is believed to be the first of the 19 main employers to have drawn
up an offer.
According to Personnel Today, the specialist magazine, a single document has
been drawn up to replace the three existing agreements for industrial,
engineering and administrative workers.
PowerGen said yesterday the deal proposed harmonisation of terms and
conditions for all employees, with a single pay structure for all staff.
Holiday entitlement, for example, would be harmonised so that entitlement
would be related to the grade an individual was on within a job category. In
addition flexible working and single-table bargaining with the unions were
proposed.
The electricity companies are likely to pursue widely differing strategies
because of their local situations.
