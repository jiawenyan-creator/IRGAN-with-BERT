FT  28 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar drops back from highs
THE DOLLAR took a rest from attacking the DM1.66 barrier yesterday, falling
below DM1.64 before floating back towards its starting level.
'It has not been exactly an exciting market,' said one dealer. 'Most
movement has been to bring the dollar down.'
The US unit drifted below DM1.64 at midsession as traders tried to flush out
some of the longer-term fund buyers they believe to be lurking in the
market.
Confidence in the dollar also faltered following disappointing US weekly
first-time jobless claims (up to 459,000 from 452,000 the previous week,
against market expectations of a 2,000 decline) and the news that January
existing home sales fell 1.5 per cent.
In New York, the dollar opened  3/4 pfennig lower than Wednesday's close of
DM1.6458, and a subsequent rally faded to leave a DM1.6355 finish.
The dollar was slightly quieter against the yen, following heavy
profit-taking above Y130 in recent days and repeated threats of intervention
in Japanese quarters. The intervention hype was maintained yesterday with
finance minister Mr Tsutomu Hata saying his country wanted to reconfirm that
the G7 nations still favour a stronger yen. He added that if the G7 deputy
finance ministers meet today, as reported, they will discuss currencies.
In Tokyo, the US currency had been steady to weaker in late trading, closing
at Y129.01/06, compared with a previous close of Y129.20/30. One dealer
called it the 'Tokyo blues - top-heavy and bottom-solid.'
After steady gains in recent days and its climb to Y130 on Wednesday,
dealers said the dollar was now in a corrective consolidation phase. It
moved in a narrow range in Europe to close at Y129.40, compared with Y129.65
on Wednesday. In New York the dollar ended easier at Y129.15.
The D-Mark held steady after overnight weakness in the dollar gave it a
gentle lift, and it closed up slightly against the lira and the French
franc.
Profit-taking took the peseta off its permitted ceiling against sterling,
and it declined to 5.89 per cent above its pivot against sterling, down from
6.19 per cent on Wednesday night.
It moved off its ceiling of Pta180.59, where it has been for most of the
week, to Pta181.00/10. Traders said the Bank of Spain's 25 basis points rate
cut on Tuesday had finally triggered unwinding of long positions, but the
light reprieve was seen as unlikely to change the timetable for a cut in UK
interest rates
The market seemed unconcerned with poor UK trade deficit figures. 'Frankly
they are irrelevant,' one dealer said. 'We are more interested now in
political indicators.'
Sterling performed strongly against the dollar, opening at Dollars 1.7537,
after a previous close of Dollars 1.7450, and climbing to Dollars 1.7642
before a late slip back to Dollars 1.7550. In New York it improved to
Dollars 1.7640. The pound edged up against the D-Mark in London to DM2.8867
from Wednesday's DM2.8854 finish.
