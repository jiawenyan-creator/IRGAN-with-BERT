ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 
AMBURGEY INVITES KEMP TO DEBATE 
Councilman Orville Amburgey on Thursday challenged Housing and Urban 
Development Secretary Jack Kemp to a friendly debate on the issue of illegal 
aliens but conceded that neither he nor Kemp is likely to change his view on 
the issue. 
Moreover, Amburgey said he will seek an opinion from U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh on Kemp's authority to suspend sections of immigration law that 
require screening of a person's immigration status. 
Amburgey contends that the provisions support his position that the city can 
lawfully require organizations that receive federal money to screen their 
clients. 
"As an elected official, I've sworn an oath to respect the laws of my city, 
state and nation," wrote Amburgey in a letter mailed Thursday to Kemp. The 
letter was in response to a missive from Kemp to Amburgey outlining the 
secretary's opposition to screening out illegals from receiving emergency 
services. 
"Your letter instructs that the line between legal and illegal must be obscured 
when applied to laws governing legal residency in this county. Our city does 
not want to bear the burden of unsafe, unhealthy overcrowding of public 
facilities by those who do not have the legal right to be in this country," the 
letter continued. 
Kemp has said he would agree to meet with Amburgey to discuss the issues but 
could not be reached for comment Thursday on Amburgey's invitation for a 
debate. 
Amburgey and Kemp have engaged in an increasingly lively, though lopsided, 
debate over illegal immigration and what, if anything, local governments can do 
about it. 
The debate stems from the city's attempts a year ago to deny grant money to 
charities and other groups unless they pledged not to serve illegal immigrants. 
The city eventually rescinded the policy when questions were raised about its 
constitutionality. CARLA RIVERA
