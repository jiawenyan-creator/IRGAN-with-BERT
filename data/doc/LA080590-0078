THE PRACTICAL MIND: THE CO-DEPENDENT PARENT FREE YOURSELF BY FREEING YOUR CHILD 
BY BARBARA COTTMAN BECNEL (LOWELL HOUSE: $19.95) 
Used to be, you could get a lot of mileage out of having bad parents. Just 
think: If Eugene O'Neill's parents had known how to do the right thing, he 
might never have had cause to write "Long Day's Journey Into Night." 
Or what if Philip Roth's folks had cleaned up their act? Would he ever have 
written "Goodbye, Columbus"? Would Woody Allen have grown up to be Alan Alda? 
In the old, unenlightened days, people knew how to make the most of mom and 
dad's neuroticism. 
But in the addiction-fest of the last few years, it's become essential, if not 
absolutely trendy, to purge oneself of all problems. And if you don't think you 
have any problems, you probably know, and relate to, someone who does, which 
makes you a co-dependent. 
"The Co-Dependent Parent" starts off with a chilling, if statistically vague, 
suggestion: "Most of us are co-dependent parents to a greater or lesser 
degree," writes Becnel. Even the seemingly well-intentioned mom or dad fits 
into one of her five categories: parents who are too demanding, too critical, 
overprotective, disengaged or ineffective. She presents case studies to 
illustrate each problem, and then offers advice and verbal exercises designed 
to break the behavioral cycle. 
It's all well intentioned and earnest -- Becnel's strongest credential is her 
own experience as the daughter of a gambler father and long-suffering mother -- 
but it's hard to believe that her routinized solutions, which include such 
psychological golden oldies as "I'm OK, You're OK," would suffice if, as she 
asserts, co-dependency is a generations-old pattern people fall into before 
they realize what's happening. 
If a family is smart enough to seek help, "The Co-Dependent Parent" seems too 
elemental; if a family is drowning in mutual self-destruction, it seems too 
slight to offer salvation.
