SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 29, 1994, final regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 for the Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition of Accrediting Agencies (59 FR 22250); State Postsecondary
Education Review Program (59 FR 22286); and Federal Family Education Loan Program (59 FR 22462). The final regulations
for the Endowment Challenge Grant Program were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 23, 1993 at 58 FR 11162. Compliance with the information collection requirements in these regulations
was delayed until those requirements were approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended. OMB
approved the information collection requirements for the Secretary's Procedures and Criteria for Recognition
of Accrediting Agencies and the State Postsecondary Education Review Program on July 1, 1994. The information collection
requirements for the Federal Family Education Loan Program were approved by OMB on June 28, 1994. The Endowment Challenge
Grant Program information collection requirements were approved by OMB on May 25, 1993. 



Section 682.202 was inadvertently listed as containing information collection requirements in the notice of revised
effective date published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33682). This section was determined not to contain information collection requirements and
was correctly removed from the list of sections that contained information collection requirements subject to OMB
approval in the correction notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 8, 1994 (56 FR 29543). 



Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 



In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does
not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that proposed
rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under
5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
