 

(iii) A payment has not been received on the loan in the last year. 

(iv) A judgment has not been entered on the loan against the borrower. 

(2) If the agency fails to meet a fiscal year recovery rate standard under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for
a loan type, and the Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal
interest, the Secretary may require the agency to assign in addition to those loans described in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section, loans in amounts needed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(3)(i) of this
section. 

(i) 

Calculation of fiscal year loan type recovery rate.

 A fiscal year loan type recovery rate for an agency is determined by dividing the amount collected on defaulted loans,
including collections by Federal Income Tax Refund Offset, for each loan program (i.e., the Stafford, PLUS, SLS,
and Consolidation loan programs) by the agency for loans of that program (including payments received by the agency
on loans under 682.401(b)(4) and 682.409 and the amounts of any loans purchased from the guaranty agency
by an eligible lender) during the most recent fiscal year for which data are available by the total of principal and
interest owed to an agency on defaulted loans for each loan program at the beginning of the same fiscal year, less accounts
permanently assigned to the Secretary through the most recent fiscal year. 

(ii) 

Fiscal year loan type recovery rates standards.

 (A) If, in each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the fiscal
year loan type recovery rate for a loan program for an agency is below 80 percent of the average recovery rate of all active
guaranty agencies in each of the same two fiscal years for that program type, and the Secretary determines that additional
assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the agency to make additional
assignments in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. 

(B) In any subsequent fiscal year the loan type recovery rate standard for a loan program must be 90 percent of the average
recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies. 

(iii) 

Non-achievement of loan type recovery rate standards.

 

(A) Unless the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section that protection of the Federal fiscal
interest requires that a lesser amount be assigned, upon notice from the Secretary, an agency with a fiscal year loan
type recovery rate described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must promptly assign to the Secretary a sufficient
amount of defaulted loans, in addition to loans to be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section,
to cause the fiscal year loan type recovery rate of the agency that fiscal year to equal or exceed the average rate of
all agencies described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when recalculated to exclude from the denominator
of the agency's fiscal year loan type recovery rate the amount of these additional loans. 

(B) The Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agency, may require the amount of loans to be assigned under paragraph
(a)(2) of this section to include particular categories of loans that share characteristics that make the performance
of the agency fall below the appropriate percentage of the loan type recovery rate as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)
of this section. 

(iv) 

Calculation of loan type recovery rate standards.

 The Secretary, within 30 days after the date for submission of the second quarterly report from all agencies, makes
available to all agencies a mid-year report, showing the recovery rate for each agency and the average recovery rate
of all active guaranty agencies for each loan type. In addition, the Secretary, within 120 days after the beginning
of each fiscal year, makes available a final report showing those rates and the average rate for each loan type for the
preceding fiscal year. 

(3)(i) 

Determination that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires assignments.

 Upon petition by an agency submitted within 45 days of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section,
the Secretary may determine that protection of the Federal fiscal interest does not require assignment of all loans
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or of loans in the full amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of
this section only after review of the agency's petition. In making this determination, the Secretary considers all
relevant information available to him (including any information and documentation obtained by the Secretary in
reviews of the agency or submitted to the Secretary by the agency) as follows: 

(A) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the Secretary
considers information presented by an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate above the average rate of all
active agencies to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if any amounts of
loans of the loan type required to be assigned to the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are retained
by that agency. For any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary considers information presented by an agency with a
fiscal year recovery rate 10 percent above the average rate of all active agencies. 

(B) The Secretary considers information presented by an agency that is required to assign loans under paragraph (a)(2)
of this section to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if the agency demonstrates
that its compliance with 682.401(b)(4) and 682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal year loan
type recovery rate or rates or if the agency is not required to assign amounts of loans that would otherwise have to be
assigned. 

(C) The information provided by an agency pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section may include,
but is not limited to the following:
