FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco helped by cut in
interest expenses
RJR NABISCO, the US tobacco and food group taken private through a Dollars
25bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, yesterday posted second-quarter profits of
Dollars 87m after-tax, up from Dollars 79m a year earlier.
The gain came from the reduction in interest expenses, partly offset by an
extraordinary loss of the early extinguishing of debt.
Mr Lou Gerstner, RJR's chairman, noted that since the start of 1992, some
Dollars 2bn of high-cost debt, carrying an average coupon of 14 per cent,
had been refinanced at more favourable rates.
Operating profits slipped to Dollars 768m from Dollars 773m, although total
sales were up from Dollars 3.78bn to Dollars 3.98bn.
RJR blamed the tough competitive environment in the consumer goods sector.
It had made significant investment in the domestic tobacco business which
had restrained operating income.
On the tobacco front, RJR saw operating profits of Dollars 580m from
domestic operations, down from Dollars 612m, while international contributed
Dollars 134m. against Dollars 116m. In the food division, operating profits
rose from Dollars 228m to Dollars 240m.
RJR Nabisco made after-tax profits of Dollars 72m in the first six months,
after a Dollars 281m charge for extinguishing debts early. In the same
period a year ago, the after-tax profit was Dollars 84m.
