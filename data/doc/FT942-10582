FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Decisions are for others to make
Sir, In his excellent article 'On the road to procrastination' (May 4),
Adrian Furnham details the six most favoured methods of avoiding decisions,
all of which are important techniques for the up and coming manager.
However, there are three others well worth a try:
The 'Haven't got time/tear jerker' method. Here, the decision-maker will
state plainly that he/she hasn't got time to consider the problem, but
cleverly manages to come up with a reason which makes the requester feel a
schmuck. For example: 'The CEO has just asked for a report. I'm probably
going to have to work the whole weekend as it is.' Absence or resignation of
a key member of staff also works.
Failing any internal excuse to latch on to, a close relation just admitted
to intensive care is usually a winner.
The 'Pass the buck' method. For example: 'Do ask John, he has the latest
figures' or 'that will have to go before the board. Pity you've just missed
the last meeting, next one is in a couple of months.'
The 'I'm glad you called' method, followed by a swift change of subject and
ending with the requester being given something to investigate. The
decision-maker should speak quickly and, where fitted, should turn down
his/her hearing aid. It works best on the telephone so that persistent
requesters can be cut off with, 'I must go, John's just arrived for a
meeting,' or as a last resort, a phone malfunction.
It would be interesting to hear other experiences from your readers.
