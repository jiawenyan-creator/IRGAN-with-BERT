FT  01 JUL 94 / People: Evans picks md from Yorkshire Water
The directors of Evans of Leeds have been on tenterhooks this week. The
property investment company's final results are out next Tuesday and they
are supposed to be in purdah, but gossip was swelling among the business
community that Evans was about to get its first md.
Evans, though quoted, is largely owned by the locally well-known Evans
family and mostly run by vice-chairman Michael Evans, who also has interests
in a boatyard near Nice, where he would like to spend more of his time.
The company and Yorkshire Water decided to come clean yesterday with
simultaneous announcements that John Bell, managing director of Yorkshire
Water Enterprises, is indeed making the transfer, which 'will not be earlier
than October 1'.
Bell, who is 45, is a lawyer. He was a young chief executive of a small
Scottish local council before going into the water business as the old
Yorkshire authority's secretary and solicitor in 1985. He ended up as a main
board director of Yorkshire Water in charge of diversification after
privatisation and was in the news in May setting up a joint venture with
Ogden Corporation in the US water and waste treatment market.
Another diversification, however, was a series of joint ventures with Evans
of Leeds, under the corporate appellation White Rose, to develop spare
Yorkshire Water Land, which is how the property company got to know him.
So did Evans poach him after this extended interview? 'Relationships remain
friendly,' William Gibson, Evans' company secretary, said yesterday. 'They
are not waving a big stick at us. Everything is going ahead in a smooth and
amicable fashion.'
He would have liked to have kept the lid on the news until after next
Tuesday but decided rumour and gossip might be more damaging.
