FT  16 NOV 92 / Takeover protest by Air France
MR Bernard Attali, Air France president, has protested to Sir Leon Brittan
that the EC competition commissioner is operating a double standard,
favouring recent takeover bids by British Airways (BA) to the French
carrier's detriment.
Mr Attali wrote to Sir Leon last week, threatening legal action and warning
that if BA's takeover of Dan Air and its planned half-share in TAT, the
French regional airline, went ahead, state-owned Air France might invoke a
review clause in its own 1990 takeover of another French airline, UTA.
Specifically, Mr Attali has charged the Commission with:
Adopting the wrong approach in clearing BA's takeover of Dan Air. By failing
to include Dan Air's total turnover at the time of the takeover in its
calculation, the EC anti-trust directorate put the deal below the threshold
of mergers to be vetted under the EC merger regulation.
In any case, Air France complains that the BA-Dan Air merger should have
been regarded as an illegal abuse of dominant position, because the two
airlines would have 60 per cent of slots at Gatwick airport and, together
with TAT, 'a total monopoly' of the Gatwick-Charles De Gaulle route.
Failing to prevent BA's purchase of 49.9 per cent of TAT going ahead while
it carried out an investigation. Mr Attali complained that Brussels had
checked Air France acquisitions in UTA and Air Inter for nine months in 1990
while it carried out a similar investigation.
Under that 1990 deal Air France was forced to sell its 35 per cent stake in
TAT and stay out of it for four years, Mr Attali said.
Failing to investigate BA's plan to take a stake in USAir, though it claimed
the right to scrutinise competition implications of other deals extending
beyond the Community.
