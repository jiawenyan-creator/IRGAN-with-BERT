FT  05 APR 94 / People: Unisys attracts computer luminary
Malcolm Coster was in his mid-40s when he sold his share of James Martin
Associates, a brilliantly successful software company, to Texas Instruments
for what he describes as 'drop dead money', writes Alan Cane. It was enough
to live comfortably for the rest of his life and reject all but the most
attractive job offers.
Fortunately for Unisys, Coster (right) was far from ready for retirement.
This month he accepted the job of president of its Europe, Middle East and
Africa division, based in London but with responsibility for more than 7,000
employees in 55 countries.
Now 50, he comes to Unisys via Coopers &amp; Lybrand's management consultancy,
where he headed international business development, ran the UK consultancy
service and looked after strategy and planning. 'It was getting a little
heavy,' he says.
A mathematics graduate from London University, Coster cut his computing
teeth in the 1960s with CEIR, the UK's oldest software house. Later he
became systems and programming manager for Lloyds Register, then creating a
sophisticated management information system.
A further spell with CEIR, newly renamed Scicon and owned by British
Petroleum, led to Coster being given responsibility for BP's systems
worldwide with funding of Pounds 300m a year. Some of that went to the
computer guru James Martin, who in 1983 persuaded Coster to help him launch
James Martin Associates with the aim of building an automated software
development system, now known as the Information Engineering Facility.
Unisys represents a different challenge. Brought back from the dead after
several years of losses by chairman James Unruh, it still has a long way to
go to achieve sustained, profitable growth. That, says Coster, is the
appeal: 'It is the chance to be a hero.'
