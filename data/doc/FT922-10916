FT  29 APR 92 / Argentina introduces tough curbs on technology exports
ARGENTINA has introduced strict new controls on exports of sensitive
technologies, in a further step towards complying with international
pressure to curb development of its nuclear and missile industries.
Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said yesterday the controls would unify
Argentine policy and align it with existing international controls on
weapons of mass destruction, nuclear technology and technologies with dual
civilian and military applications.
He said the loss of existing sales to countries without safeguards would be
replaced by new markets in the US. He added negotiations between an
Argentine company whose nuclear exports to Iran were banned earlier this
year and US companies were 'well advanced'.
Mr di Tella said the new controls would mean that Argentina could be taken
off an international blacklist of 'unreliable' countries, allowing it to
import advanced technologies like supercomputers.
Over the past two years Argentina has responded to intense international
pressure, especially from the US, to halt development of nuclear and missile
technologies that were a centrepiece of the once-powerful
military-industrial complex.
It scrapped the controversial Condor II intermediate-range missile project
and opened its nuclear industry to international inspections.
It intends to sign the 1967 Tlatelolco treaty this year, which bans nuclear
weapons in South America.
Despite the government's evident intention to comply with safeguards, there
is concern over continuing leakage of sensitive technologies through
informal military channels and the emigration of highly trained scientists
to Middle East countries.
