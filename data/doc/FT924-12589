FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Arnotts advises against
Campbell's stake offer
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday said the ADollars
8.80-a-share bid by Campbell Soup to increase its holding from 32.9 to 50.1
per cent, was too low, Reuter reports from Sydney.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts chairman, said: 'It does not reflect the substantial
premiums paid in recent years for food companies by major international
groups, nor does it reflect adequately Arnotts pre-eminent market position,
strong brands, fine products and potential,'
He advised shareholders to take no action over the offer.
The bid values Arnotts at ADollars 1.2bn (Dollars 850m). Its shares closed
at a sharp premium to the offer price at ADollars 9.15, up 5 cents from
Friday's close.
Mr Purdy said Arnotts had yet to receive formal offer documents but the
initial view of its advisers was that the bid was too low. He said Arnotts
was the world's seventh-largest biscuit company and had the technology and
strategy to build its products in Asia.
'Clearly, Arnotts shareholders are entitled to an offer price which reflects
this potential,' Mr Purdy said.
