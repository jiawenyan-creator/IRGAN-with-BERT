FT  03 SEP 93 / D-Mark continues to strengthen
THE D-Mark strengthened sharply against most currencies yesterday, amid
increasing concern about the pace of US economic recovery and a growing
belief that Germany will lower short-term interest rates more slowly than
had been expected.
In recent days, there has been consistent buying of D-Marks in the
international currency market, following the Bundesbank decision last week
not to reduce its discount rate. Yesterday, the pressure on the dollar
intensified, pushing it well below last year's peak for the dollar/ D-Mark
exchange rate.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6490 from a previous DM1.6595, and eased
to DM1.6450 in New York. Dealers have bought the D-Mark and sold the dollar
in the belief that central banks need to do the same to help balance their
reserves after Bundesbank intervention in the exchange rate mechanism last
month.
The French franc dropped from FFr3.507 to close at FFr3.522 against the
D-Mark. The Danish krone dropped from DKr4.11 to DKr4.14. Sterling dropped
from DM2.5025 to DM2.4750. The ERM grid was at its most strained since last
month's widening of the system's bands.
