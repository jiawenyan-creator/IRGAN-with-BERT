FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Donelon Tyson lower at Pounds 1.02m
DONELON TYSON, the Cheshire-based construction group, suffered a 30 per cent
fall in interim pre-tax profits. The company described it as a resilient
performance in the face of the most hostile market conditions in living
memory.
On prospects for the rest of the year the company said that the qualified
optimism expressed on the expected post election recovery had not
materialised and volumes for the full year would be below those of 1991.
In the six months to June 30 pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.02m (Pounds
1.45m) on turnover of Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 42.1m). Earnings per share were
1.55p (2.09p).
