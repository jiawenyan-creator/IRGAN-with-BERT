FT  19 NOV 92 / Observer: Gambling man
The abrupt resignation of Lord Williams from Mirror Group Newspapers means
Lord Hollick is now the Labour party's undisputed standard-bearer in the
City. Will he do a better job than his predecessor, whose association with
the late Robert Maxwell probably explains why he wasn't elected Labour's
leader in the House of Lords this week?
Williams and Hollick are both on the modern wing of the party. But beyond
that, they could hardly be more different.
Not only is Williams a dozen years older, but he used to work at Barings,
captained Oxford at cricket and is married to a Cazenove.
The bearded Hollick went to Nottingham University and is married to a TV
producer. His main claim to business fame is that the company he built, MAI,
is one of the few sizeable financial conglomerates to have survived the
recession.
With Williams gone, it will be up to Hollick to make sure the Daily Mirror
remains the Labour party's most powerful media ally. There's even talk of
his adding the MGN chairmanship to his board seat at troubled British
Aerospace and full-time chieftaincy of MAI which is about to launch its new
TV franchise.
For someone who is also a working peer, that would seem a bit much. Perhaps
if he wants to out-do Williams as a Labour party power-broker, he should
rein himself in somewhat.
