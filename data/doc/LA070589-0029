DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTLAKE BOATERS MARK THE 4TH WITH USUAL BALLOON 
BARRAGE 
The water balloon warriors of Westlake Lake enjoyed their annual pitched battle 
Tuesday, celebrating Independence Day by declaring their independence from a 
rule against their annual ritual. 
Residents of the island in the lake, which straddles the Los Angeles -- Ventura 
County border -- largely ignored a decision by their homeowners association to 
prohibit the Fourth of July tradition, in which revelers in boats exchange 
volleys of water balloons hurled by hand or with special launchers. 
The Westlake Management Assn. said the ban was necessary because of fears that 
someone would be injured. 
"Thank God we live in a democracy," said a breathless and dripping-wet Mary 
Jacobs, who organized a petition drive protesting the ban. Jacobs said two 
security officers hired to prevent water balloon combat gave up after 
half-hearted efforts to enforce the ban. 
"They had the Gestapo out here, but it didn't matter. There's two or three 
hundred people out there throwing water ballons. This is the most wonderful 
birthday party for our nation," she said. 
Rod Hansen, homeowners association president, also expressed satisfaction, 
saying the ban was mainly aimed at powerful, slingshot-type launchers devised 
by some water balloon buffs, and no such launchers were seen this year. 
"It's OK as long as it's within reasonable limits," he said. "Everything seems 
to be under control."
