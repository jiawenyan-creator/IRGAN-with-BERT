FT  03 SEP 93 / Attempt to settle civil rights issue in Chile fails
THE Chilean government has effectively abandoned its attempt to resolve the
nagging issue of human rights abuses during the previous military regime,
after serious splits emerged within the governing Concertacion coalition.
The government has removed the 'fast-track' status of a bill aimed at
speeding up human rights trials, making it unlikely the bill will be passed
before December's presidential elections. The original aim had been to pass
the bill early this month.
The move will be seen as a political defeat for President Patricio Aylwin,
who only last month presented the bill to the nation in an emotional
address. It also threatens to destabilise the electoral campaign of the
Christian Democrat-dominated Concertacion.
The main sticking point of the 'Aylwin law' was the stipulation that trials
of officials accused of human rights abuses during the military government
of General Augusto Pinochet be held in secret. The purpose of the secrecy
was to persuade military officials to present fresh evidence which might
help to locate the bodies of 'disappeared' people.
Around 200 human rights trials are currently bogged down in Chile's courts.
In most cases there is no intention of punishing military officials, who are
protected by an amnesty promulgated in 1978.
Last month, the secrecy clause of the bill was thrown out by the chamber of
deputies after left-wing members of Concertacion voted against it. Mr Aylwin
argued that the law was unworkable without secret trials.
The human rights issue, which has dogged civilian-military relations since
the handover to democracy in 1990, is set to continue to fester. It will be
up to the new president to try to bring the issue to a close.
