BRIEFLY 
GE Cuts Jobs in Massachusetts, Alabama: General Electric Co. said it would cut 
the jobs due to a shrinking military budget. 
GE Aerospace said it would eliminate 650 jobs in Burlington, Mass., by 1992 and 
will close a facility in Huntsville, Ala., by the end of next year. The Alabama 
site employs 400 people, and about half the workers will be offered jobs in 
Daytona Beach, Fla., under a consolidation plan, said a GE spokesman. Products 
at the Burlington plant include automated test equipment for such military 
vehicles as tanks and helicopters. Huntsville has served as a development site 
for an electronic test system for the Navy.
