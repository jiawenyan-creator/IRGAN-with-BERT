 Notice; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is soliciting public comment on whether consumers would benefit from having greater flexibility in waiving
the right of rescission in transactions with new creditors to refinance or consolidate home-secured loans (where
no additional debt is incurred). The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 directs
the Board to make recommendations to the Congress regarding this narrow expansion of the waiver of the right of rescission,
after consulting with the Consumer Advisory Council to the Board, consumers, representatives of consumers, lenders,
and other interested parties. Under present law, consumers may waive the right of rescission in refinancings or consolidations
with new creditors only when a bona fide personal financial emergency exists (whether or not additional debt is incurred).
When a consumer refinances a loan with the same creditor and no additional debt is incurred, the right of rescission
does not apply; if additional debt is undertaken, the right of rescission applies only to the new money advanced.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



The Truth In Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. 16011666j, and Regulation Z, 12 CFR 226.15 and 226.23, provide that
in a consumer credit transaction in which the consumer's principal dwelling secures an extension of credit, the consumer
has three business days in which to rescind the transaction after becoming obligated on the debt. This right of rescission
was created to allow consumers time to reexamine their credit contracts and cost disclosures and to reconsider whether
they want to place an important asset_the home_at risk by offering it as security for credit.
