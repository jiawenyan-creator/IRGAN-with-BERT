BRIEFLY 
Shearson Lehman Sued: Quantum B.V.I., a $2.1-billion stock fund, has sued 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and 103 stock-index futures brokers and traders for 
allegedly defrauding it of $60 million three days after the October, 1987, 
stock market crash. Quantum charged Shearson, three Shearson brokers and up to 
100 traders in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 
futures pit with fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and violations of the 
Commodity Exchange Act, according to the suit filed late last week in the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Quantum is run by money 
manager George Soros.
