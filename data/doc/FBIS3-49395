  [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jan -- President Lech Walesa received 
today heads of defense departments of the Visegrad Group 
countries. The president appealed for working out a joint stand 
of the group on the "main issues." "I hope that whenever 
possible we shall speak with one voice -- we are stronger in 
solidarity," Walesa said. 
  "I hoped that after our victories, when we regained freedom 
and independence, we would create a common Europe more quickly, 
and I still see such a chance," the president said. He added 
that "on many occasions matters have been dealt with in our 
absence." "Time has come for us to participate and to demand the 
creation of systems to make us secure from the great powers of 
this world," he said. The meeting was also attended by Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski. 
  The Czech delegation is led by the first deputy minister of 
national defense. Observers are of the opinion that this is 
connected with a recent declaration by the Czech Government 
announcing independent actions to join NATO. 
  As Antonin Baudys, Czech minister of defense, stated on 
Thursday, the reason for his absence from the Warsaw meeting was 
"a lack of conviction on the need to work out a coordinated 
stand by the Four toward NATO."
