  [Text] Riga April 13 ITAR-TASS -- Negotiations between Riga 
and Moscow will not resume unless Russia repeals Boris Yeltsin's 
order to create military basis on the territory of Latvia, Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs announced on Tuesday night. He said all 
opportunities must be used to achieve more favourable conditions 
for the signing of an accord between the two countries. 
  Birkavs expressed hope that foreign investors would help 
repatriate retired Russian servicemen. The prime ministers of 
Latvia and Estonia will discuss their common stand on the these 
issues at the forthcoming meeting on Friday.
