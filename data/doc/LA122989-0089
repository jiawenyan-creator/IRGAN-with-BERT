Sixteen South Bay players, including seven from 4-A Division runner-up Carson 
High, have been named to All-L.A. City Section football teams by the Amateur

Carson was represented on the 32-player 4-A team by quarterback Armin 
Youngblood, wide receiver Michael Ross, center Raul Nieto, defensive linemen 
Marcus Long and Bob Tuitau, linebacker Nkosi Littleton and defensive back 
Clayvand Thomas. 
The Colts, who finished 10-2 and lost in the championship game to Dorsey, 
26-15, placed the most players on the team. Dorsey and Crenshaw were second 
with six each. 
The only other area player chosen to the 4-A team was Banning linebacker John 
Herrera. 
Junior running back Lamont Warren of Dorsey was named 4-A Player of the Year, 
and Dorsey wide receiver Kevin Copeland, who died of heart failure Oct. 6 in a 
game with San Pedro, was named honorary captain. 
The South Bay was represented by eight players on the 3-A team. Westchester 
topped local selections with three, while Gardena and San Pedro each placed 
two. Narbonne had one. 
Named to the offensive unit were San Pedro quarterback Arnie Madrid and center 
Corey Miller, Westchester tailback Tim Holliday, Gardena wide receiver Manley 
Woods and Narbonne kicker Wilfred Rodriguez.

Record-breaking quarterback Santiago Alvarez (4,119 yards, 52 touchdowns 
passing) of division champion Franklin and Venice's versatile Louis Jones, who 
played virtually every skill position during the season, shared 3-A Player of 
the Year honors.
