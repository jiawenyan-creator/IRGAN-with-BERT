FT  24 JUN 94 / People: Lining up on the starting blocks at Willis Corroon
Max Taylor, 46, is to take over as chief operating officer of Willis Corroon
as part of a sweeping management reorganisation at the insurance broker.
The changes are designed to prepare for the retirements next year of Roger
Elliott and Richard Miller, two men who helped bring about the merger
between Willis Faber and Corroon &amp; Black in 1990.
Willis announced yesterday that Miller, 62, will retire as chief executive
on January 1 next year, and will become vice-chairman.
Elliott, now 61, will take over as executive chairman, focusing on worldwide
business relationships, but it is understood that he will also seek to
retire next year.
Taylor, who has been centrally involved in moves to introduce electronic
trading to the London insurance market, is currently chief executive of
Willis Faber &amp; Dumas, the wholesale and reinsurance broking arm of Willis.
A Willis employee for more than 20 years, he will chair a new executive
management committee which will direct day-to-day operations of the group.
Its members are Richard Dalzell, 53, the group finance director, Brian
Johnson, 51, chief operating officer of Willis Corroon Americas, George
Nixon, 54, chairman and chief executive of Willis Corroon Europe, Donald
Payne, 55, chairman and chief executive officer of Willis Corroon Americas,
and Kenneth Pinkston, 51, who succeeds Miller as chairman of Willis Corroon
Corporation, the group's US holding company.
Payne succeeds Frank White Jr who will remain with the group in another
executive capacity. All appointments take immediate effect. The company also
announced the formation of a nominations committee, which will be
responsible for nominating candidates for the group board. This will be
chaired by William Schreyer, the non-executive director who last year
retired as chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch.
