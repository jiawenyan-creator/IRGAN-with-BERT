SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior by section 2 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Pub.
L. 90542, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1273, 

et seq.

) and upon proper application of the Governor of the State of Arkansas, a 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River and
a 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek in Arkansas are hereby designated as state-administered components of the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System.



The Secretarial designation covers that part of the Cossatot and Brushy Creek within the boundaries of the Cossatot
River Sate Park-Natural Area in Polk and Howard Counties. This action is based on the designation of the river by the
State of Arkansas and the protection offered this river and its immediate environment by and pursuant to applicable
State laws and regulations.
On July 3, 1990, President Clinton, then the Governor of Arkansas, petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add
the above described segments of the Cossatot River to the National System. On April 22, 1992, Congress added the Cossatot
to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (Pub. L. 102275). However, the State is pursuing its original
request for Secretarial designation for the following reasons:
1. To officially classify the State-managed river segments as ``Scenic.''
2. To recognize the State Management Plan for the Cossatot River State Park and Natural Area.
3. To refine the current definition of the State's portion of the scenic river corridor.
In response to the Governor's request, the Secretary, through the National Park Service conducted a complete review
of the State application and documents associated with the designation decision. As a result of that review, the Secretary
has determined that the 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River and a 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek in the State's
application should be designated as a State-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System,
as provided for in section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
The State of Arkansas has fulfilled the requirements of the Act by designating these segments as components of the
Arkansas System of Natural and Scenic Rivers and by adopting a program of action that will adequately protect the river
from adverse State actions. The National Park Service evaluation of the river concluded that these segments of the
Cossatot River and Brushy Creek meet the criteria for the scenic classification under the Act. Accordingly, the following
river segments are classified as scenic pursuant to section 2(b) of the Act to be administered by State government:


Cossatot River: Scenic_

The 10.4-mile segment of the Cossatot River within the boundaries of the Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area just
above the State Highway 246 crossing, at the Ouachita National Forest boundary in Polk County to the crossing at State
Highway 4 in Howard County.


Brushy Creek: Scenic_

The 0.3-mile segment of Brushy Creek within the boundaries of the Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area in Polk County.
This action is taken following public involvement and consultation with the Departments of Agriculture, Army, Energy,
Transportation, the Federal Energy Regulation Commission, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as required
by section 4(c) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. A 45-day period for public comment on the State's application and
river management plan and on the environmental assessment of the proposed national designation was provided from
April 15, 1991, to May 31, 1991. All comments received have been carefully considered.
Notice is hereby given that effective upon this date, the above-described river segments are approved for inclusion
in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to be administered by the State of Arkansas.



Dated: January 14, 1994.
