Dow Corning Corporation; Receipt of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance


Dow Corning Corporation (Dow) of Midland, Michigan has determined that some of its brake fluid fails to comply with
the requirements of 49 CFR 571.116, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 116, ``Hydraulic Brake Fluids,'' and has filed
an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Dow has also petitioned
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act
(15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.
This notice of receipt of a petition is published under section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (15 U.S.C. 1417) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits
of the petition.
Paragraph S5.1.9, Water Tolerance, of Standard No. 116 states that:



At low temperature, after humidification, ``(1) The [brake] fluid shall show no sludging, sedimentation, crystallization,
or stratification; (2) Upon inversion of the centrifuge tube, the air bubble shall travel to the top of the fluid in
not more than 10 seconds; (3) If cloudiness has developed, the wet fluid shall regain its original clarity and fluidity
when warmed to room temperature.''



Between September 4, 1992, and October 29, 1993, Dow produced and sold 11 lots of DOT 5 silicone base brake fluid (SBBF)
that do not comply with the requirements in Paragraph S5.1.9 of Standard No. 116. These 11 lots were broken down into
191 55 gallon drums, 1,112 one gallon retail packages, 11,458 one quart retail packages, and 33,091 12 ounce retail
packages.
At some point near the end of the low temperature portion of the water tolerance test, these lots contained a very small
amount of a soft, slush-like crystallation. The crystallization usually formed around the top of the specimen, where
the SBBF met the vial headspace. The smallest amount of warming made the crystallization flow back into a liquid state.
Dow supports its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:



First, the low temperature portion of the water, tolerance test was designed to [simulate] excessive water in non-SBBF
brake fluids. But as applied to SBBF, the humidification step results in a water content level for test samples that
is nearly double that of in-service SBBF. SBBF test samples clearly do not accurately represent in-service SBBF.
[Dow b]elieves this built-in error results in unrealistic and excess water. During this portion of the test, that
excess water becomes a seed for crystallization of the SBBF itself. Without the humidification step, SBBF does not
crystallize.
Second, the soft, slush-like crystals are identical to the liquid SBBF; that is, 20 centistoke polydimethylsiloxane,
some organic additives, and 350400 [parts per million (ppm)] water. The SBBF crystals should not be considered
as water-based ``ice'' crystals. These SBBF crystals do not exhibit any of the negative safety impacts that result
from ice formation.



Dow also submitted the following additional material: (1) A 1982 petition for rulemaking it filed to amend this portion
of the standard; (2) data to support this petition; (3) test data showing that the subject SBBF would pass the requirements
of S5.1.9 when the humidification step is eliminated; and, (4) a statement by Ron Tecklenberg, Ph.D, a Dow chemist,
supporting Dow's petition. This additional material is available for review in the HNTSA Docket Section.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the petition of Dow, described above.
Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted.
All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the petition is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below.
Comment closing date: April 22, 1994.
