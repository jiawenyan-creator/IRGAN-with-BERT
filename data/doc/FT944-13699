FT  26 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Stock index futures fell for the third session in a row, moving decisively
down through the 3,000 level at one stage in heavy trading volume, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract swung through an arc of 32 points in what
traders described as hectic activity. There were 18,600 contracts, against
5,523 on Monday and an average for last week of less than 13,000.
At the official 4:0 close, the December contract was 3,009, down 21 points.
At this level the premium to the cash market was around 9 points with fair
value premium at 14 points.
Traders said the upsurge in volume reflected the strong swings in the cash
market rather than any real attempt to provide direction. The low point for
the December contract was just after mid-day at 2,081.
Quality of business improved with plenty of two-way business allowing
traders to deal in amounts larger than has been the norm recently.
Traded options activity mirrored index futures volume, roaring ahead to
49,676 lots from 13,951 on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE turnover accounted
for more than 31,000 lots.
British Airways was far and away the most actively dealt individual stock
option turning over 2,840 lots. Tesco (1,600 lots) and British Gas (1,232
lots) were also actively traded.
