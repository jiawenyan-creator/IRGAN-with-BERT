COMMUNITY DIGEST: LOS ALAMITOS; 
'IRREPLACEABLE' SCOUT TROOP FLAG STOLEN FROM CAR 
Members of Boy Scout Troop 671, based in Los Alamitos, are upset about the 
recent theft of a car. But what concerns them more than the loss of the 
vehicle, which was later found stripped in Wilmington, is the loss of an 
American flag and their troop flag that had been temporarily stored in the 
car's back seat. 
"The flags have a lot of sentimental value for all the boys who have been in 
the troop," Scoutmaster Nick Testa said. Of particular value, he said, is the 
red-and-white troop flag, which contains a collection of special ribbons 
signifying various awards the troop has won in its 22-year history. "It is 
irreplaceable," Testa said of the flag, which is used in parades and special 
ceremonies. "Once it's gone, that's it." 
The Scouts' woes began on Jan. 4 when the car, which belongs to the parents of 
one of the troop's 43 members, was stolen from the driveway of their Garden 
Grove home. The flags had been stored in the car for an upcoming event. Two 
days later the car was found in Wilmington, minus the flags. 
"They could have taken them out and just thrown them anywhere, perhaps in Long 
Beach," Testa said. 
Anyone with information on the flags' whereabouts, he said, is asked to call 
him at (714) 894-4941.
