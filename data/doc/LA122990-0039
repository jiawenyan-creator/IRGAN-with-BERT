WHO ARE THEY? 
In "When Gay Means Loss of Revenue" (Calendar, Dec. 22), the brave Steve 
Weinstein describes how the brave ABC network lost $500,000 when the brave 
"thirtysomething" showed an episode including two gay (and undoubtedly brave) 
characters. Weinstein even names gadfly the Rev. Donald Wildmon as the 
(brave/bigoted: choose one) leader of boycotts against advertisers of such 
programs. 
What is missing are the names of the cowards: the advertisers who drop episodes 
with gays, the advertisers who fear Wildmon. Why doesn't Weinstein name them? 
What happened to the first W in reporting? Who are these guys -- and how much 
ad space do they buy in the Los Angeles Times?

 Editor's Note: ABC said its policy is to not identify advertisers who pull out 
of its programs.
