  [Text] Belgrade, 20 Feb (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic, told SIM Radio in Bijeljina 
today that "with the arrival in Sarajevo of 450, and later 
perhaps more, Russian blue helmets--the war in the area will be 
over." 
  "The Serb side is very pleased with the arrival of the 
Russian soldiers, for if it had not been for the Russian 
initiative we would now have certainly found ourselves in a 
dramatic situation," Karadzic added in a statement reported by 
SRNA. 
  Speaking about possible tricks by the Muslim side, similar 
to 
the one in the Sarajevo market, Karadzic said that he had 
reliable information that the Muslims "perhaps even today" are 
preparing a new trick. 
  "We have informed Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's 
special envoy, about this," Karadzic said, and warned that 
"after Sarajevo, Tuzla and Bihac will certainly become the 
arenas for stage-managed massacres." 
  "The Muslim people have found themselves in the most 
difficult possible position due to the policy of its leadership, 
a policy which counts on giving cause for sympathy and 
compassion in the world," Karadzic stressed, noting that no 
people ever gained their own state in such a way.
