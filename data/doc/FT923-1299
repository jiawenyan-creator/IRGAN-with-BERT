FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Clyde Petroleum in the red after
exploration write-off
CLYDE PETROLEUM, the UK independent exploration and production company,
announced a net loss of Pounds 5.48m for the six months to June 30. The
result was after a write-off of Pounds 7.9m from unsuccessful exploration
activities.
Net profits for the first half of 1991 were Pounds 6.3m. However, the
company decided from this year to write off the cost of failed exploration
immediately on its profit and loss account, to give a fairer representation
of its financial position. Successful exploration will continue to be
capitalised and depreciated against eventual production.
Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said this was a 'half-way house'
between full cost accounting, common among smaller oil companies, and
successful efforts accounting, used by leading groups.
Clyde wrote off the Pounds 7.9m costs of the withdrawal from Myanmar, where
it drilled a dry hole.
Mr Gourlay said earnings were in line with expectations given a
'historically low' oil price of Pounds 10.59 per barrel, down from Pounds
11.38 in 1991. Although production increased from 23,651 to 26,170 barrels
of oil equivalent a day, turnover fell from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 43.7m.
Mr Gourlay said that 'robust' cash inflow from operations of Pounds 26.7m
demonstrated Clyde's underlying strength.
Clyde hopes to increase production to about 39,000 b/d through development
of the North Sea Gryphon field, expected to get government approval by the
end of the year. It has also been buoyed by recent discoveries at Rhu,
offshore Malaysia, and a new exploration award in Syria.
Losses per share came through at 1.7p (2p earnings). Clyde confirmed it was
suspending dividends to allow increased exploration spending. Analysts do
not expect resumed pay-outs until Gryphon is well-established, in 1994 or
1995.
