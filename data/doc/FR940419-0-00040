 Final rule; rescission. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 43 CFR part 419 pertains to the payment of claims for actual damages to or loss of property, income, personal injury,
or for death directly resulting from the failure on June 5, 1976, of the Teton Dam of the Lower Teton Division of the Teton
Basin Federal Reclamation Project. There is no need for continuation of this rule because all claims against the United
States resulting from the failure of Teton Dam have been settled, and so it is being removed from the Code of Federal
Regulations.
