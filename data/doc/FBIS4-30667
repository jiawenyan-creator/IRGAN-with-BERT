  [Excerpt] Mr. Khanchit Kantangkun, the assistant managing 
director of the Krung Thai Bank, talked about the plan by 
officials to promulgate a money-laundering law in an effort to 
stop the laundering of "dirty" money. He said that if this law 
actually is promulgated, it will have a great effect on 
financial institutions, particularly commercial bank customers. 
Thus, officials should clearly stipulate the limitations of this 
law so that this does not affect depositors. [passage omitted]
