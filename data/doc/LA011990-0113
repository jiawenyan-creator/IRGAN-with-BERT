RIGHTIST HELD IN SHOOTING OF BLUNT NAGASAKI MAYOR 
Police arrested a reputed leader of a right-wing extremist group Thursday in 
the shooting of Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima of Nagasaki, who had provoked 
nationalist ire and received numerous death threats after remarking 13 months 
ago that Emperor Hirohito was partly responsible for World War II. 
The man under arrest, Kazumi Tajiri, 40, confessed to firing a single pistol 
shot into Motoshima's back as he left the city hall a few hours earlier, a 
police spokesman said. 
Tajiri was arrested in a local hotel and charged with attempted murder after 
fleeing the scene in a rental car, which the police found abandoned less than 
half a mile away. Tajiri had rented the car in his own name, which allowed the 
police to track him down, the spokesman said. 
Motoshima, 67, was reported in stable condition Thursday night at Nagasaki 
Public Hospital after undergoing two hours of surgery. The bullet bounced off a 
rib, pierced the left lung and narrowly missed the mayor's heart before 
emerging from his chest, surgeons were quoted as saying. 
The shooting was decried by political leaders and social commentators as an act 
of terrorism. Some of them warned that free speech in Japan is under attack by 
the right wing. 
"Speech must be refuted only with speech," said Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary 
general of the Japan Socialist Party, who was himself attacked, but not 
injured, by right-wing extremists while delivering a lecture last May. "The use 
of violence cannot be permitted." 
Tajiri was identified by police as a leader of Seiki Juku, a rightist 
organization of 31 members established in Nagasaki in 1981. A man answering the 
telephone at Seiki Juku's office Thursday night said the group had no comment 
on Tajiri's arrest or the attempt on Motoshima's life. 
Controversy erupted in December, 1988, after Motoshima addressed the question 
of the late Emperor Hirohito's wartime responsibility in remarks before the 
Nagasaki City Assembly on the 47th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl 
Harbor. Nagasaki was devastated by a U.S. atomic bomb on Aug. 9, 1945, three 
days after Hiroshima. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15. 
Motoshima's comments broke a clear-cut taboo on criticizing Hirohito, who was 
then on his deathbed suffering from cancer. 
Right-wing groups denounced Motoshima. Japan's hard-core nationalists, many of 
whom allegedly have ties to organized crime, typically glorify the emperor and 
wear military-style uniforms. The groups, which number in the hundreds, are 
generally considered harmless, but violence occasionally erupts.
