FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzis sell US bank for
Dollars 47m
ITALY'S Ferruzzi family, staggering under the financial problems of the
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company it controls, has sold a small
Louisiana bank. The sale is the first of what may be numerous disposals to
raise cash and cut borrowings.
Alerion Bank, based in New Orleans, has been acquired by Louisiana's Premier
Bancorp for Dollars 47m. The deal will bolster the depleted coffers of the
Ferruzzi family and provide a small, but welcome, cash injection into the
debt-laden Ferfin holding company.
Although 75 per cent of the bank is owned by the Ferruzzi family, almost 25
per cent is held by a Ferfin subsidiary.
With total assets of about Dollars 340m, Alerion Bank is the fifth-biggest
financial institution in New Orleans, with nine branches. Formerly called
American Bank and Trust, it first attracted the attention of Mr Serafino
Ferruzzi, the group's founder, in the late 1970s, when he took a stake. In
1988, the Ferruzzis bought full control.
Although agreed by the Ferruzzi family, the sale took place in consultation
with the five-bank committee of leading creditors now guiding Ferfin.
However, negotiations on a sale were believed to have been taking place well
before the group's recent problems came to light.
Premier Bancorp, based in Baton Rouge, is the third-biggest banking group in
Louisiana. It is controlled by the Ohio-based Banc One group, which has been
expanding rapidly through acquisitions in recent years.
Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, is selling its
DEA measuring equipment unit to Brown &amp; Sharpe, the US measuring instruments
maker, in return for a 30 per cent stake in the US company.
