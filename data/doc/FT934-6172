FT  26 NOV 93 / Polish commercial TV plans hit snag
Plans for Poland's first commercial national TV channel have run into
opposition from the military which is unwilling to release the necessary
frequencies.
This emerged shortly before the closing date for applications to run the
channel to compete with the two state TV ones, which will still carry
advertising. Foreign media groups including Bertelsmann, Compagnie
Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion and Time Warner have declared an interest
in running the channel with local partners.
Adml Piotr Kolodziejczyk, defence minister, said the army would be able to
free the frequencies in three years. Frequencies available to private
broadcasters provide access to 40 per cent of Poland.
