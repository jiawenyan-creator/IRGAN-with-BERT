FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU to issue licences covering
Windwards' banana losses
Additional licences for exports of bananas into the European Union market
will be awarded on Monday to companies that ship fruit from the Windward
Islands. The European Commission has agreed that importers can substitute
bananas from other sources to replace fruit in the Caribbean group that was
damaged by September's tropical storm.
The commission has awarded 14,800 extra licences to St Lucia, 2,700 to
Dominique, 5,900 to Guadeloupe and 30,000 to Martinique. These will be
allocated to companies shipping to the EU.
