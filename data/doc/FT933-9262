FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram still in discussions
SPRING Ram said yesterday it was still in discussion with Masco Corporation,
the US building products group which has been considering making a bid for
the bathrooms and kitchens group.
However, the Yorkshire-based company said contacts had been of a preliminary
nature and it was unlikely that any decision or announcement would be made
for some time. Both companies had agreed that they required further detailed
analysis and review before they reviewed their respective positions.
Spring Ram also concluded there would be no merit in pursuing discussions at
this stage with any of the other parties which expressed an interest in the
company.
Mr Roger Regan, who became chairman a fortnight ago, said: 'Regardless of
the outcome of the discussions with Masco, I believe in the strengths of the
company's core businesses which will benefit from the extensive capital
investment made over the last few years.'
Mr Regan has initiated a full operational and financial review which is
expected to be completed before the announcement of interim results on
September 22.
