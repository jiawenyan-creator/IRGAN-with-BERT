A notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 574) announced an extension of the existing visa and exempt certification arrangement between
the Governments of the United States and India through January 31, 1994. In a Memorandum of Understanding dated January
22, 1994 the two governments agreed to further amend and extend their Bilateral Cotton, Wool, Man-Made Fiber, Silk
Blend and Other Vegetable Fiber Textile Agreement of February 6, 1987. The agreement and the visa and exempt certification
arrangement have been extended through December 31, 1995. A directive to Customs implementing the limits for 1994
will be published shortly in a separate notice.
 

The purpose of this notice is to remind the public that the U.S. Customs Service must continue to require visas and exempt
certifications, as previously published, for textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in India
and exported to the United States.
