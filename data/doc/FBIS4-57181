  [Text] Brasilia, 13 May (DPA) -- In a communique released 
in this capital, which is currently hosting the "pro tempore" 
Secretariat of the Group of Rio, a bloc of 13 Latin American and 
Caribbean countries, the group announced today that it will not 
acknowledge the appointment of a provisional president in Haiti. 
  In the communique, the Group of Rio states that "the Haitian 
crisis can be resolved only if unrestricted respect is shown for 
the Governor's Island Agreement which calls for the prompt 
return of Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide to the 
exercise of his constitutional powers in Haiti. The communique 
urges "the de facto authorities who illegally hold power in 
Haiti to submit to the UN and OAS decisions which mirror the 
firm hope of the international community." 
  This Latin American group's reaction came two days after the 
military leaders of Haiti made Emile Jonassaint provisional 
president of Haiti, following the Haitian Parliament's 
declaration that the post was vacant. 
  Jonassaint's rise has been interpreted as a sign that the 
Haitian military is not considering yielding to international 
pressure or sanctions and is not about to fulfill the Governor's 
Island Agreement which acknowledges President Aristide, who was 
overthrown in 1991, as the legitimate leader of Haiti.
