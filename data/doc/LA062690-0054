Cosby Gets Help From 'The Simpsons': NBC won't accept commercials featuring 
characters from "The Simpsons" because it doesn't want to cross-promote a 
program on a competing network. But that doesn't mean that NBC stars can't put 
their commercials on during "The Simpsons." In fact, Bill Cosby, who will go 
head-to-spikey head with Bart Simpson when the animated series moves to 
Thursday night in the fall, was seen Sunday during "The Simpsons" plugging his 
upcoming "Ghost Dad" flick. GREG BRAXTON
