FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: A costly pain in the back
Sir, Your report 'How back pain can make you lose your marbles' (Management,
June 17) provides sensible advice on how to avoid back troubles and who to
go to if you get it.
But in quoting US statistics it ignores how bad the situation has become in
the UK in comparison. In 1990, 60m working days were lost in the UK costing
the country Pounds 3bn, compared with the figures you quote of 93m working
days at a cost of Pounds 7.6bn in the US.
A conference to discuss this issue is to be held in London in October - not
a moment too soon.
