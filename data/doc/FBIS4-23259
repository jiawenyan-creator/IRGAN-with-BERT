  [Text] Brazzaville, 1 Jun (PANA) -- Machine-gun fire was 
heard last night in [words indistinct], who wanted to march 
towards the presidency to demand their integration into the 
National Army. These youth known as the "Aubevillois" [new 
recruits] were given accelerated military training to form the 
private militia of the presidential group -- the ruling 
coalition -- in order to fight the opposition militia. 
  Shooting by the head of state's guards created panic in 
nearby schools where students and teachers hurriedly ended 
classes and fled. The "Aubevillois" responded with machine-gun 
fire last night in the southern Brazzaville districts of Diata 
and Mfilou where most presidential group supporters live. 
Shooting was also heard in Bacongo District, the opposition 
stronghold, and in the "Plateau des 15 Ans" District. 
  The situation has since returned to normal in these 
districts, where people are going about their normal daily 
business. The number of casualties from these incidents is not 
yet known but according to a military source there were no 
casualties. 
  Meanwhile, the Congolese National Assembly last night asked 
the government and the Congolese Armed Forces High Command to 
explain the arms and ammunition theft at the noncommissioned 
officers' school at Gamboma, 325 km north of Brazzaville.
