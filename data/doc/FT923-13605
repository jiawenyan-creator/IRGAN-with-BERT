FT  13 JUL 92 / S African protest campaign speeds up
SOUTH AFRICA'S 'mass action' campaign gathers momentum today when trades
union leaders are due to hold a protest march on government offices in
Pretoria.
Police have given permission for the march, seen as an important test for
both sides in a tense political climate, and in the run-up to the United
Nations Security Council debate this Wednesday.
Labour leaders and their allies will be looking for a turnout that would
give credence to the 'mass action' campaign designed to force President FW
de Klerk to concede an early transfer of power to the country's black
majority. The government will want to show that it can keep control of the
streets while allowing dissent.
The march is organised by the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(Cosatu), the country's most powerful labour federation, and supported by
the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist party
(SACP).
Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president, is in New York, where he and other
political leaders, including Mr Pik Botha, the South African foreign
minister, will address the UN Security Council.
Mr Botha, in a speech over the weekend before flying to New York, said the
government wished to discuss the ANC's grievances. But he went on: 'I hope
they will also realise that without power sharing there will be no peace.'
