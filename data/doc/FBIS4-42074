Criticism of Free Democratic Party"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Following the harsh criticism voiced by 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping 
regarding the Free Democratic Party's [FDP] attitude in the 
presidential election, the SPD is now trying to take the edge 
off the debate. Scharping said a certain cooperation could be 
conceivable, above all with those Free Democrats who voted for 
Johannes Rau. However, coalitions should only be considered 
following the Bundestag elections. But his criticism was not a 
signal for a red-green coalition, Scharping said. Antje 
Vollmer, the leading candidate of the Alliance 90/Greens in 
Hesse, sees good chances for a red-green government alliance 
following the Bundestag elections. She said the Greens had 
"offered themselves to the SPD as a reliable partner in the next 
government." [passage omitted]
