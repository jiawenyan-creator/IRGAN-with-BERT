  [Text] A small group, claiming to represent the Youth 
League of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], today 
displayed a placard at the Nampula airport following the arrival 
of President Joaquim Chissano. The placard said: We want a 
government that recognizes and makes our people feel that 
Mozambique is the fatherland of Mozambicans and not the [words 
indistinct] of Asian traders. The placard displayed by the 
10-member group of demonstrators also demanded that the city of 
Nampula's police force should give up the habit of stealing 
goods from people in public places. 
  Chissano began a working visit to Nampula Province today.
