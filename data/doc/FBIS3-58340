<F P=106> [Report signed "hh": "CSU Chairman Waigel Announces </F>
Initiative for Europe"] 
  [Text] Munich -- In the view of Christian Social Union 
[CSU] Chairman Theo Waigel, the issue of Europe must not be left 
solely to the parties. Speaking to journalists in Munich, 
Waigel announced that he will advocate personally an initiative 
for Europe, in which as many social groups as possible should be 
integrated. The CSU chief cited industry, churches, 
universities, school children, and students, as well as 
associations, such as the VdK [Association of War-Disabled 
Persons] and the National War Graves Commission. His proposal 
"naturally met with approval" at the meeting behind closed doors 
of the CSU land group in Wilbad Kreuth, Waigel said. He will 
contact all conceivable partners and is certain that Bavarian 
Minister President Edmund Stoiber will also support him.
