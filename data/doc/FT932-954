FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Reshuffle at Primerica's
securities division
MR ROBERT Greenhill, a senior investment banker at Morgan Stanley and the
firm's former president, is joining Primerica's Smith Barney Shearson
securities brokerage unit as chairman and chief executive.
The appointment, the most significant move by a senior Wall Street figure in
several years, was part of an important reshuffling of management by Mr
Sanford Weill, chairman of the US financial services group.
Analysts say Mr Greenhill was hired to build an investment banking franchise
to complement Smith Barney Shearson's strengths in equities sales and
broking. Investors cheered the appointment, bidding Primerica stock up
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 48 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Frank Zarb, chairman of Smith Barney before its recent Dollars 1bn merger
with Shearson, was promoted to group chief executive of Primerica, as was Mr
Robert Lipp, former chairman of Primerica's Commercial Credit subsidiary.
The two will be responsible, along with Mr Weill, for running Primerica's
other interests, including asset management, consumer finance and credit
cards, and insurance.
The big news, however, was the arrival of Mr Greenhill, who only stepped
down as president of Morgan Stanley in March. Mr Greenhill revealed he had
bought Dollars 35m of Primerica stock with his own money to underline his
commitment to Smith Barney Shearson.
The company was formed this year with the merger of the retail stockbroking
and asset management side of Shearson Lehman, previously owned by American
Express, with Primerica's Smith Barney. The investment banking arm of
Shearson Lehman, however, was not part of the deal, and stayed with American
Express. This left the new Smith Barney Shearson without an established
investment banking operation.
