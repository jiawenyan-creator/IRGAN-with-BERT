FT  31 MAY 94 / Observer: Talking Prince
Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, has been pilloried by the press
for his private discussions with plants. Perhaps the mystical bent is
inherited. His father, the Duke of Edinburgh, has just won an award from the
United Nations Environment Programme for 'reaching untold millions worldwide
with a conservation message through religious channels'.
As president of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, Prince Philip is being
honoured for bringing together world religious leaders in the Italian town
of Assissi where Saint Francis preached to the birds. Apparently, the
get-together occurred in 1986.
