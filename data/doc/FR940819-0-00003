Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule implements Section 843 of Public Law 102190, ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Years 19921993,'' December 5, 1991. It expands military whistleblower protection to those who make disclosures
to an audit, inspection, investigation or law enforcement organization, as well as to an Inspector General or a Member
of Congress. This rule also specifies that reprisal for whistleblowing is punishable under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice and removes 32 CFR part 98a.

EFFECTIVE DATE:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Due to an administrative oversight the final rule was not previously published.




It has been certified that this rule is not a significant regulation action. The rule does not:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in this Executive Order.

It has been determined that this rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because this rule
does not exert a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This certification is made
based on the fact that the rule merely modifies the current regulation to ensure that policy and procedures with regard
to military whistleblower protection conform with the requirements under 10 U.S.C. 1034. These procedures involve
reporting and investigating allegations of reprisal for protected disclosures made by military members of the armed
forces to appropriate authorities.

It has been certified that 32 CFR parts 92 and 98a do not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35013520).
