FT  15 MAR 94 / Ford increases Aston Martin stake to fund new sports car
Ford, the US carmaker, has injected Pounds 50m of new equity capital into
Aston Martin Lagonda, increasing its stake in the UK luxury sports carmaker
from 75 per cent to 99.5 per cent.
The capital has been provided partly to cover losses but most importantly to
fund the development of the new Aston Martin DB7 sports car, which is
planned to begin production next month.
The launch of the DB7 is set to transform the fortunes of the UK luxury
sports car maker and raise its annual output more than fivefold by 1995-96.
It will provide a successor for the famous DB6, which ceased production in
1971.
Ford initially took a 75 per cent stake in Aston Martin in late 1987. The US
group dominates the UK luxury car sector following its takeover of Jaguar in
1989.
The burden of the DB7 project has pushed Aston Martin into heavy loss. It
suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.87m last year following losses of
Pounds 15.97m in 1992 and Pounds 5.8m in 1991. The DB7 development programme
was previously funded by a Pounds 34m revolving loan from the Ford parent
company which has been paid off following the Pounds 50m equity injection.
