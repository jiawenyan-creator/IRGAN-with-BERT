FT  11 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Cyclical sectors clear stage for
defensive stocks - The biannual ballet spectacle which calls itself
international equity strategy
THE BIANNUAL ballet which calls itself international equity strategy is
playing again this year, as the switch between cyclical and defensive stocks
takes place.
On June 8 there were four consumer durables leaders among the top 10
performers in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index - Volkswagen, Pirelli SpA, Volvo
and Philips - and BMW was running a close 11th. On June 30 all of those had
gone, partly because the move to defensive stocks had already begun.
However, the shift was partly structural. Changes in the Eurotrack
constituents brought a number of new contenders into the ring with effect
from June 22. These included Michelin, top performer eight days later, and a
motor industry supplier; Investor, the Swedish investment company at the
heart of the Wallenberg family industrial empire, which owns Saab-Scania and
stakes in a number of other top Swedish companies; and Pryca, the Spanish
supermarket group.
On the German carmakers Mr Keith Hayes, motor industry analyst at Paribas
Capital Markets, notes that a 12 per cent fall in German car sales for May
caught the domestic equity market by surprise. 'Now', he says, 'the focus
has moved on to costs, particularly for Volkswagen which has very ambitious
volume assumptions and would find a drop in volume a threat to its
productivity targets.'
However, June 30 found Michelin, a tyre company, emphatically in top place.
Why? The answer involves, first, a dramatic reduction in the workforce, 16
to 18 per cent of the total in the past two years, and a big reduction in
costs in other areas.
Secondly, the industry has seen fierce price competition in the last five to
six years, particularly in original equipment for the motor industry. Price
increases, however, began with around 16 per cent in the European
replacement market towards the end of last year; and this year there was a 5
to 6 per cent rise in the US after-market.
Next in the top 10 are Asea and Brown Boveri, the Swedish and Swiss-quoted
manifestations of the ABB Asea Brown Boveri group which merged in 1988. Mr
Hayes's colleague, Mr Francis Woollen, says that recession worries brought
their share prices back in the second half of 1991.
Then, last December, Siemens and GEC Alsthom started convincing analysts
that the prospects for power engineering was excellent; and ABB, says Mr
Woollen, is the purest power engineering play.
Roche, the pharmaceuticals company, has shown marked strength since the end
of 1987. A growth stock. Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs liked it in early
June, measuring a 1992 p/e of 16 against an estimated earnings per share
growth rate of 20 per cent per annum over the next five years.
The leaders also take in Investor, a recovery proposition after a painful
end to 1991; St Gobain, in glass, packaging and abrasives, driven by hopes
of a US recovery and higher glass prices; and Pryca, described as over-rated
by Mr Miguel Olabarri of Schroder Securities.
Atlas Copco, in compressed air machinery, is another cyclical but one where
the effects are seen relatively late; Olivetti, a limited antidote for the
depressed Italian market, was lifted by computer industry recovery hopes and
Digital's plan to take a 10 per cent stake in the company; and Sandoz
combined cyclical recovery prospects in chemicals with the defensive
qualities of its pharmaceutical products.
Six Italian companies feature in the bottom 10, reflecting a six-month fall
of 10.6 per cent in Milan's Comit index over the period against a 4.5 per
cent gain for Europe, excluding the UK, in the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
One of the most painful losers was Stet, the telecommunications group, which
fund managers had seen as a safer way to maintain a stake in Italy when
other avenues, like Fiat, looked distinctly dangerous.
Stet's defensive qualities, however, were little protection when the whole
market became an open wound. It is joined in the bottom 10 by its Spanish
equivalent, Telefonica, which performed well last autumn after bullish
presentations in Tokyo, London and New York; but the move of Telefonica's
pension fund into the Spanish social security system involved a huge
increase in the fund for already retired staff, rises in personnel expenses
for active staff, and the question of how much the company would have to
pay.
This matter has been resolved and most analysts are sure that telecoms will
not feature in the bottom 10 in six months' time. A recent European strategy
note from Baring Securities, pushing defensive stocks as a short term
strategy, has both Stet and Telefonica in its buy list.
Right at the bottom lies Skandia, the Swedish insurance company, a victim of
takeover rivalry between its Nordic neighbours, Uni Storebrand in Sweden and
Hafnia and Denmark, which resulted in stalemate and a potential overhang of
around 43 per cent of the Skandia equity. The free shares have recently
fallen to a 39 per cent discount against estimated net assets.
Last, but not quite least, a Mickey Mouse company. Euro-Disney produced
figures for its first 50 days of trading after a spate of rumours, gave a
profit warning, postponed by a year the opening of a second theme park on
its site near Paris and disclosed admission figures which cast doubt on its
prospectus traffic assumptions.
Traffic, in fact, is a painful word. More recently, French farmers blocked
entry into the Euro Disney park; and French lorry drivers went further,
bringing roads to a standstill and ensuring that tourists would have to be
extremely determined before taking a trip to Euro Disney in early July.
