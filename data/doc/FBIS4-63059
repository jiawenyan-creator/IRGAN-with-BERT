  [Text] "Having urged Russia to recognize the existence of 
"unsettled territorial issues" and to take up the responsibility 
for the damage inflicted by the USSR on the Baltic states after 
1940 and compensate for it, the participants in the recent 
Baltic Assembly embarked on the dangerous path of removing those 
events from the context of historical analysis and fitting them 
into the context of financial, material and other claims to the 
Russian Federation," Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin stated during 
the briefing on Thursday. 
  "Russia does not and will not bear the responsibility for 
Stalin's regime. Neither shall we engage in redrawing the 
borders or even discuss this problem," he said. 
  The results of the Assembly confirmed that the earlier 
expressed fears that the normalization and development of 
Russia's relations with the three Baltic states might not suit 
certain political forces in those countries, he continued. 
Individual Baltic politicians are looking for new pretexts for 
substantiating their anti-Russian policies, instead of giving a 
historical assessment to the dramatic historical events, said 
Karasin.
