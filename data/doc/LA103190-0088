ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: NEWPORT PHARMACEUTICALS SAYS IT'S BACK IN THE PROFITS 
COLUMN 
Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc., the Laguna Hills health-care 
company, reported net income of $17,000, contrasted with a net loss of $793,000 
for the same quarter in 1989. 
Revenue was up 80%, to $15.8 million from $8.8 million. 
For the nine-month period, the company lost $2.8 million, compared with a 
year-earlier loss of $511,000. Revenue rose 57%, to $43.6 million from $27.8 
million. 
Newport Pharmaceuticals attributed a substantial portion of the 1990 
year-to-date operating loss to legal expenses related to a class-action lawsuit 
and non-recurring relocation costs and consulting fees recorded in the second 
quarter. 
Much of the year-to-date net loss consisted of a $1.3-million, non-operating 
charge resulting from an exchange of notes for common stock, the company said.
