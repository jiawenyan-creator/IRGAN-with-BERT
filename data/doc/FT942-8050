FT  23 MAY 94 / Adams accuses Major of delay
The political weakness of Mr John Major, the prime minister, could be
holding up the Northern Ireland peace process, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, said at the weekend.
He said Sinn Fein was giving careful consideration to the British
government's clarification, published last week, of December's Downing
Street Declaration. He was speaking at the Turin book fair where he was
launching the Italian edition of his book of short stories about the
Northern Ireland troubles, The Street and Other Stories.
'John Major is a British prime minister who has great difficulties within
his own party,' he said. 'He is very dependent on his own right wing. That
may explain to some degree why, having addressed certain issues, the
government then slowed and is even now grudging in its commitment to the
peace process.'
During a wide-ranging audience discussion Mr Adams said the peace process
was at a critical phase and confirmed that he was consulting Sinn Fein
colleagues 'to see in what way these clarifications can move the peace
process forward'.
He added: 'The opinion of Sinn Fein is that there is a need for a peace
process. Unionists, including the (Unionist) death squads should be part of
it. We think if the British take a progressive attitude, the Unionists can
be brought round to work on a peace settlement.'
He suggested afterwards that the next steps in the process might not be
taken until after the European parliament elections early next month.
