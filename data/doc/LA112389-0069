CRENSHAW SLIPS PAST SAN FERNANDO, 27-24, IN 4-A PLAYOFFS 
Maybe 75 years of football teaches a school a few tricks. 
San Fernando High, celebrating its 75th season, once was accused of using a 
wider-than-regulation field in the days when future Heisman Trophy candidates 
roamed its offensive backfield. 
So when the San Fernando field appeared to be a little waterlogged before 
Wednesday night's City Section 4-A Division playoff game against Dorsey, more 
than a few people wondered aloud what was up. 
After all, with Crenshaw tailback Kevin Hicks in the game, any edge would help. 
Hicks, however, gained a game-high 137 yards in 23 carries and scored the 
decisive touchdown with 1:19 left as Crenshaw defeated San Fernando, 27-24. 
"If we were gonna water it down, it would be a . . . swamp right now," San 
Fernando defensive coordinator Troy Starr said. 
San Fernando (5-6) trailed, 15-10, after three quarters, but took a 16-15 lead 
when Johnny Carter broke loose from the wishbone set for a 70-yard score with 
9:58 to play. Carter finished with 134 yards in 10 carries and scored two 
touchdowns. 
Crenshaw (7-4) answered on its next possession when fullback Sean Lowery scored 
from one yard on a fourth-and-goal play with 3:21 remaining. It was Lowery's 
lone carry of the game and gave Crenshaw a 21-16 lead. 
Crenshaw appeared to have clinched the victory when Hicks, a senior, scored 
from 35 yards with 1:19 left. But the Tigers drove downfield and scored on a 
three-yard run by Carter with 11 seconds remaining. Quarterback Michael Wynn 
sliced in for a two-point conversion to make it 27-24. San Fernando failed to 
recover the onside kick, however. 
San Fernando took a 10-0 lead in the first half thanks in part to a puzzling 
Crenshaw mistake. On their first possession, the Tigers took a 7-0 lead on 
fullback Vincent Hall's four-yard run up the middle, capping a five-play, 
75-yard drive. Crenshaw's Greg Jones failed to field the ensuing kickoff and 
San Fernando recovered at the Crenshaw 16. A penalty gave San Fernando the ball 
at the seven, and Jamie Ballesteros kicked a field goal for a 10-0 lead.
