SAN DIEGO EARNINGS 
 San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.'s 1988 profits dipped 3%, to $177.6 million. 
Revenue rose to $2.08 billion, up 9%. The utility attributed the results to a 
decision by the California Public Utilities Commission lowering SDG&amp;E's 
return on equity from 13.9% in 1987 to 12.75% in 1988.
