  [Text] The situation is back to normal in the government 
alliance. We are talking about the UCS [Solidarity Civic 
Union]. We have a report from Mario Espinoza: 
  [Begin recording] [Espinoza] Nothing happened, and UCS 
leader 
Max Fernandez, who was meeting with Government Minister German 
Quiroga and Presidential Minister Carlos Sanchez, told reporters 
that everything is fine, that the situation is back to normal. 
  [Fernandez] We have come to a happy ending [words 
indistinct] 
in the search for understanding between the MNR [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Movement] and the UCS. I believe an important 
step has been taken to continue to work together. 
  [Espinoza] Max Fernandez labeled the recent disagreements 
between the UCS and the MNR as a little impasse. He added that 
from now on there will be more coordination between the two 
parties. 
  [Fernandez] Congressional activities will also be 
normalized. 
With this explanation I would therefore like to convey to the 
country that everything is back to normal, that there is no 
longer any speculation, that on the contrary I am convinced that 
from now on we will do better work. 
  [Espinoza] The members of the UCS and the MNR, and all the 
members of the executive branch, are all very happy. But the 
one who was left in a very awkward position was the UCS deputy 
who had accused the MNR of trying to buy UCS deputies. [end
