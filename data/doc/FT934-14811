FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price holds on to gain
after New York surge
GOLD IN London yesterday held on to gains made in late trading in New York
on Tuesday and closed at USDollars 365.75, a troy ounce, up Dollars 5.60.
Traders said speculative buying by New York funds pushed gold through price
levels that generated 'buy' signals to some computerised investment
programmes.
'There was nothing in the way of new news to cause this reaction. It was
purely technical. There has been no change to the fundamental outlook for
gold,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland.
He said that there was no follow-on buying in the Far East or Europe
yesterday after the surge in New York.
In his latest Gold Strike publication, Mr Graham Roberts, head of the mining
team at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Bank Indosuez Group, says it is
critical that physical demand for gold should return in response to lower
prices and seasonal strength 'if confidence in the gold market is to return
and the all important investment buying resumed.
'Equally, in a more cautious gold market, the ghosts of central bank sales
and producer forward selling have yet to be allayed.' Mr Roberts suggests
gold can be expected to trade in a range between Dollars 365 and Dollars 380
an ounce in the near term.
China's State Council has assigned the People's Bank of China and the
Economic and Trade Committee to start researching the establishment of a
national gold market, the China Gold News said, reports Reuter from Beijing.
It said that this was an important step toward gold products entering the
market and the gold industry moving from a planned to a market economy. The
paper, published by the Metallurgy Industry ministry, gave no more details.
