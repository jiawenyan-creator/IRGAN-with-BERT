<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Assessments and Fees on Members</DOCTITLE>



March 8, 1995.




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 25, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
establishing or changing a fee under section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the
Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The NASD is proposing to add new section 45 to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to require that any member named as a
party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department
perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. Below is the text of the proposed rule
change. Proposed new language is italicized.



Part III. Uniform Code of Arbitration



* * *



Member Surcharge





Sec. 45. (a) Each member who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether in a Claim, Counterclaim, Crossclaim
or Third-Party claim, shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects
service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. For each associated person who is named, the surcharge
shall be assessed against the member or members which employed the associated person at the time of the events which
gave rise to the dispute, claim or controversy. No member shall be assessed more than a single surcharge in any arbitration
proceeding. The surcharge shall not be subject to reimbursement under Subsection 43(c) of the Code.

(B) For the purposes of this Section, service is perfected when the Director of Arbitration properly serves the Respondents
to such proceeding under Subsection 25(a) of the Code.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing to add new section 45 to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to provide that any member named as a
party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department
perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. In addition, any firm whose associated
persons are named in an arbitration proceeding will be assessed the surcharge.

Historically, the revenue-to-expense ratio of the NASD's arbitration service has resulted in a deficit, which has
been subsidized by other revenues of the Association. Although the deficit has declined in 1992, the NASD has determined
in a recent review of the arbitration process that the deficit will begin to rise in the immediate future as a result
of significantly increased resourcing needs. The NASD anticipates such needs to be ongoing. The increased resourcing
needs result from a number of factors, including case growth, more selective arbitrator recruitment, increased
arbitrator training, increased arbitrator compensation, and the anticipated overhaul of the arbitration administrative
systems. The NASD determined that the time frame within which to initiate cost recovery for impending resourcing
needs should be the immediate future, and that cost recovery should be directed at those member firms using the NASD's
arbitration service.


Proposed new subsection (a) would require each member who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether
in a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim or third-party claim, to be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the
Arbitration Department perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. This fee would
be in addition to fees assessed pursuant to section 43
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and 44
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 of the Code. The fee applies both to members who file as Claimants and to members who are served by the Arbitration Department
as Respondents. Therefore, in claims brought by members, the $200 fee would be assessed in addition to the $500 claim
filing fee described in the current fee schedule. For an associated person who is named as a party to an arbitration
proceeding, the fee would be assessed against the member firm or firms which employed the associated person at the
time of the events which gave rise to the claim. However, no member will be assessed more than a single charge in any arbitration
proceeding. Finally, subsection (a) clarifies that the surcharge is not subject to reimbursement under subsection
43(c) of the Code.
