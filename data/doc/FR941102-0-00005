<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This final rule has been determined to be exempt from the requirements of Executive Order 12866 because it has no adverse
impact on FmHA borrowers or other members of the public and it involves only internal Agency management. It is the policy
of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts shall be published
for comments notwithstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 533 with respect to such rules. This action, however, is not
published for proposed rulemaking since it involves only internal Agency management and publication for comment
is unnecessary.




Environmental Impact Statement



This document has been reviewed according to 7 CFR, Part 1940, Subpart G, ``Environmental program.'' It is the determination
of FmHA that the proposed action consisting only of accounting changes, does not constitute a major Federal Action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and according to the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969, Public Law 91190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.





Intergovernmental Review



This program/activity is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials.

These changes affect the following FmHA program as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under number:




10.415Rural Rental Housing Loans



Discussion



Section 1951.506 is being amended to change the distribution of Form FmHA 19449A to only those borrowers who
are delinquent and/or have late fees. This change in the distribution was requested by FmHA field office personnel
in order to save FmHA money.
