 

By maintaining the maximum annual fee for small entities at $1,800, the annual fee for many small entities will be reduced
while at the same time materials licensees, including small entities, pay for most of the FY 1994 costs ($33.3 million
of the total $38.6 million) attributable to them. Therefore, the NRC is continuing, for FY 1994, the maximum annual
fee (base annual fee plus surcharge) for certain small entities at $1,800 for each fee category covered by each license
issued to a small entity. Note that the costs not recovered from small entities are allocated to other materials licensees
and to operating power reactors. 
While reducing the impact on many small entities, the Commission agrees that the current maximum annual fee of $1,800
for small entities, when added to the Part 170 license and inspection fees, may continue to have a significant impact
on materials licensees with annual gross receipts in the thousands of dollars. Therefore, as in FY 1992 and FY 1993,
the NRC will continue the lower-tier small entity annual fee of $400 for small entities with relatively low gross annual
receipts for FY 1994. This lower-tier small entity fee was established in the final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 17, 1992 (57 FR 13625). 
In establishing the annual fee for lower tier small entities, the NRC continues to retain a balance between the objectives
of the RFA and OBRA90. This balance can be measured by (1) the amount of costs attributable to small entities
that is transferred to larger entities (the small entity subsidy); (2) the total annual fee small entities pay, relative
to this subsidy; and (3) how much the annual fee is for a lower tier small entity. Nuclear gauge users were used to measure
the reduction in fees because they represent about 40 percent of the materials licensees and most likely would include
a larger percentage of lower tier small entities than would other classes of materials licensees. The Commission
is continuing an annual fee of $400 for the lower tier small entities to ensure that the lower tier small entities receive
a reduction (75 percent for small gauge users) substantial enough to mitigate any severe impact. Although other reduced
fees would result in lower subsidies, the Commission believes that the amount of the associated annual fees, when
added to the license and inspection fees, would still be considerable for small businesses and organizations with
gross receipts of less than $250,000 or for governmental entities in jurisdictions with a population of less than
20,000. 


III. Summary 


The NRC has determined the annual fee significantly impacts a substantial number of small entities. A maximum fee
for small entities strikes a balance between the requirement to collect 100 percent of the NRC budget and the requirement
to consider means of reducing the impact of the proposed fee on small entities. On the basis of its regulatory flexibility
analyses, the NRC concludes that a maximum annual fee of $1,800 for small entities and a lower tier small entity annual
fee of $400 for small businesses and non-profit organizations with gross annual receipts of less than $250,000, and
small governmental entities with a population of less than 20,000, will reduce the impact on small entities. At the
same time, these reduced annual fees are consistent with the objectives of OBRA90. Thus, the revised fees for
small entities maintain a balance between the objectives of OBRA90 and the RFA. The NRC has used the methodology
and procedures developed for the FY 1991, the FY 1992, and the FY 1993 fee rules in this final rule establishing the FY
1994 fees. Therefore, the analysis and conclusions established in the FY 1991, the FY 1992, and the FY 1993 rules remain
valid for this final rule for FY 1994.
