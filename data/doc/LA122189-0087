WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD; 
RECYCLING PROGRAM BEGINS 
West Hollywood has begun the first part of a long-awaited recycling program, 
with the second phase scheduled to begin shortly after New Year's Day. 
The city has placed six large bins in central areas where residents can drop 
off aluminum, glass, paper and soft plastic containers for recycling. In 
addition, single-family homes will be able to set out recyclable material for 
curbside pickup after the new year. 
The City Council worked for years on the issue, and some members hope a 
successful program will pave the way for an even more comprehensive approach. 
"The step I am anxious to take is a little more difficult. I hope the next 
stage will include on-site pickup at apartments and condominiums as well," said 
Councilman Paul Koretz. 
Koretz said the council will wait to see how the new program works before 
expanding it. 
Under the program, only single-family homes are included in curbside pickup on 
garbage collection days. The majority of West Hollywood residents live in 
multiple-unit buildings and will be able to use the centrally located 
collection bins. 
The bins are located in the parking lot at 8878 Sunset Blvd.; West Hollywood 
Park; the Center for Early Education at 563 N. Alfred St.; Plummer Park; City 
Hall, 8611 Santa Monica Blvd., and at the ARCO gasoline station, 8020 Santa 
Monica Blvd.
