CRUISE SHIP KILLER GETS REDUCTION OF SENTENCE IN CANADA 
An American who beat his elderly employer to death with a whiskey bottle while 
the two were on a cruise ship near here was sentenced Thursday to life 
imprisonment on a reduced charge of second-degree murder. 
Robert Frisbee, 62, will not be eligible for parole for 10 years, the minimum 
for second-degree murder, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled. 
Frisbee was convicted in January, 1987, of first-degree murder and sentenced to 
life without eligibility for parole for 25 years in the slaying of Muriel 
Barnett, 80, of San Francisco. 
At Frisbee's trial, the British Columbia Supreme Court judge did not give the 
jury "adequate direction on the question of whether there was proof of planning 
and deliberation as distinct from intent," Appeal Court Justice W.E. Esson 
wrote in reducing the charge. 
Barnett's body was found Aug. 19, 1985, in the $2,000-a-day stateroom she 
shared with Frisbee, her traveling companion. Prosecutors argued that Frisbee 
killed Barnett because she was going to cut him out of her $3.7-million will.
