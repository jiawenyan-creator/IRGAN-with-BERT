 

II. Proposed Amendment


By letter dated March 18, 1994, Colorado submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. CO604). Colorado submitted a proposed MOU in response to a letter dated April 7, 1993 (administrative
record No. CO539), that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c). The provisions of the MOU that
Colorado proposed to revise pertain to the respective responsibilities of DMG and WQCD regarding coal mining activities
as they impact the hydrologic balance.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the April 7, 1994, 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 16578), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. CO606). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period closed on May 9, 1994.

During its review of the proposed MOU, OSM identified concerns relating to (1) the provisions of item No. 2 of the Enforcement
section of the proposed MOU, which appeared to be contradicted by an August 28, 1990, memorandum of agreement between
WQCD and the Mined Land Reclamation Board (the regulatory board of the Mined Land Reclamation Division that has been
reorganized as DMG) and (2) referenced 2 Code of Colorado Regulations 407.2, Rule 4.05, which does not serve as an adequate
basis for ensuring protection of the hydrologic balance. OSM notified Colorado of the concerns by letter dated June
16, 1994 (administrative record No. CO627). Colorado responded in a letter dated June 23, 1994, by submitting
additional explanatory information (administrative record No. CO629).


Based upon the additional explanatory information for the proposed program amendment submitted by Colorado, OSM
reopened the public comment period in the July 29, 1994, 

Federal Register 

(59 FR 38575; administrative record No. CO637). The public comment period ended on August 15, 1994.
During its review of the additional explanatory information for the proposed MOU, OSM identified concerns relating
to (1) enforcement of effluent standards and the division of responsibility between DMG and WQCD, and (2) standards
for effluent limits. OSM notified Colorado of the concerns by letter dated September 16, 1994 (administrative record
No. CO646). Colorado responded in a letter dated December 7, 1994, by submitting additional explanatory information
(administrative record No. CO651).
Colorado proposes additional explanatory information indicating that, because WQCD has primacy for Colorado's
Discharge Permit System program, DMG will enforce Federal, but not State, water quality discharge standards under
the proposed MOU. Colorado has also provided an opinion by the State's attorney general's office that DMG has authority
to enforce the Federal effluent limitation standards at 40 CFR Part 434. Lastly, Colorado also proposes additional
explanatory information indicating that if WQCD approves fundamentally different factors or variances under an
approved National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program, the State will propose to revise the MOU in a proposed
amendment.



III. Public Comment Procedures



OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Colorado program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Colorado
program.
