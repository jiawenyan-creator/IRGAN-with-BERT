FT  02 NOV 94 / Airline smoking ban agreed
The US, Canada and Australia signed an agreement yesterday to ban smoking on
flights operated by their airlines among the three countries. The ban
applies to non-stop flights and will come into force in 120 days.
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said it would 'reduce a health hazard
to passengers and enhance safety. . . We expect this action to encourage
other countries to ban smoking on international flights.' He said the accord
was an important first step toward the goal of banning smoking on all
international flights by July 1996.
The agreement does not apply to flights operated via an intermediate point
in a country not a signatory to the pact or to flights chartered by a
person, company or organisation and which are not operated for paying
passengers.
