  [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The members of the 
home- visiting group of students of Korean university under the 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) led 
by Ku Tae-sok, staying in the socialist homeland, Wednesday met 
with Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will. 
  Referring to the harsh torture by the enemy in South Korea, 
he said he, however, refused to be converted and fought the 
enemy to the end, believing in only the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Noting that the great leader and the dear leader have shown 
all deep loving care for him, he said he would remain a loyal 
subject believing in and following them till the last moments of 
his life. 
  The members of the visiting group said though they live in 
an 
alien land, they would always firmly believe in only the dear 
leader marshal Kim Chong-il throughout their life like Yi In-mo 
and work with all devotion for the socialist homeland.
