FT  14 JUL 93 / People: Smout moves up at the Bank
Clifford Smout, who is just 36, is being promoted to the position of deputy
head of the Bank of England's supervision division, in charge of supervisory
policy; he replaces Richard Farrant, the new chief executive of the
Securities and Futures Authority. A decade younger than the other three
deputies, he will report to Michael Foot, who is to take over from Roger
Barnes.
An economics graduate from Clare College, Cambridge, Smout joined the Bank
in 1978, initially in the international division, concentrating on economic
forecasting. His next port of call was money markets, and, following the
implementation of the Financial Services Act, he became involved in setting
up the division supervising wholesale money markets. Between 1987 and 1989
he was private secretary to the then deputy governor Sir George Blunden. He
moved on to the foreign exchange side, and then into his most recent job -
manager in the supervision division in charge of North American banks.
