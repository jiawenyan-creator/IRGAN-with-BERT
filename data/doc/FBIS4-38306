  [Text] Sanaa, 29 Jun (INA) -- President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih today issued a decree naming Mr. Taha Ahmad Ghanim new 
governor for Aden. He replaces Salih Munassar al-Siyayli, one 
of the secessionist leaders. 
  It is to be recalled that, except for Crater, al-Mu'alla, 
and 
al-Tawahi, where the secessionists are entrenched, the Yemeni 
legitimate forces are now in control of all of Aden's suburbs.
