FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mazda seeks Ford Europe link
MAZDA, the Japanese carmaker, is still pursuing a possible joint project in
Europe with Ford, Mr Yoshihiro Wada, Mazda president, said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
A joint venture with Ford of Europe remained a top priority, he said.
Mazda is the only leading Japanese carmaker that has not yet announced plans
for production in Europe, despite negotiations with Ford of Europe that have
lasted for nearly four years.
Mr Wada said Mazda was also 'studying alternative projects in Europe with
other European makers but it is not the time to disclose their names as we
first have to make a decision on a possible joint project with Ford'.
Mazda is owned 24.5 per cent by Ford.
The Japanese carmaker said it was also studying the feasibility of exporting
cars from its US plant to Europe, following in the wake of Toyota, Honda and
Mitsubishi Motors. No decision had yet been made on volumes or timing.
Mazda again reduced its parent company pre-tax profit forecast yesterday to
Y6bn from the earlier forecast of Y7bn for the year to the end of March.
Pre-tax profits totalled Y19.7bn a year ago.
