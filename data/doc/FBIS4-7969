  [Text] Serb officials have refused to let three 
representatives of Swedish human rights organizations travel to 
the Kosovo Province of Yugoslavia to check on the status of 
ethnic Albanians. The visas were denied to representatives from 
the Swedish Helsinki Committee, the International Commission of 
Lawyers, and the Association of Swedish Authors and Writers. 
The three wanted to do research on human rights in Kosovo and a 
follow-up report on Albanians who have been denied asylum in 
Sweden and sent back to Kosovo. Meanwhile, 60 Swedish aid 
workers scheduled to transport food and help build emergency 
housing in Bosnia are still waiting for visas from Serb 
authorities. The Swedes were to relieve a group of Swedish 
convoy workers who returned from Bosnia last week.
