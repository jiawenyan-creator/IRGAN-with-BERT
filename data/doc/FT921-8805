FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: Placer Pacific improves in spite
of higher tax charge
PLACER Pacific, the Australia and Papua New Guinea gold mining group, has
shrugged off a substantially higher tax charge to record a modest rise in
earnings in 1991, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The company yesterday announced a 5 per cent improvement in net profits to
ADollars 67.3m (USDollars 50.7m) from ADollars 63.9m following a 20 per cent
advance in sales revenue to ADollars 579.8m from ADollars 485.0m. This came
in spite of a big turnround in the company's tax position from a ADollars
3.5m credit to a ADollars 56.5m charge. This reflected the introduction of
tax on gold earnings in Australia and higher tax in Papua New Guinea.
The important element in the rise in earnings was record gold production
from Placer's five managed mines - Porgera and Misima in Papua New Guinea,
and Kidston, Granny Smith and Big Bell in Australia.
Gold production from the mines almost doubled to 2.07m oz from 1.15m oz,
with Placer's share rising to 946,611 oz from 687,936 oz.
The directors said the average cash gold production cost for the period was
ADollars 227 per oz against an average selling price of ADollars 521 per oz,
but higher production brought a steep rise in costs.
The company's total cost of sales rose 32 per cent to ADollars 271.5m from
ADollars 205.6m. Depreciation was up to ADollars 133.8m from ADollars
102.4m, but interest expenses eased to ADollars 18.9m from ADollars 27.8m.
Kidston Gold Mines, Placer's listed offshoot, announced a 72 per cent fall
in earnings to ADollars 16.3m from ADollars 58.9m in 1991, reflecting higher
costs and a 19 per cent slide in sales revenue to ADollars 104.8m.
