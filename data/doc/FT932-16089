FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: PepsiCo to increase its
investment in Poland
PEPSICO Foods International, which bought a controlling share in Poland's
Wedel confectionery plant two years ago, is to increase its initial
five-year investment commitment by 25 per cent, Mr Peter Robinson, Wedel
chairman, told shareholders yesterday.
PFI originally paid Dollars 25m for the Wedel company and promised to invest
Dollars 56m by the end of 1996 to modernise and expand the confectionery
business. The programme, now to be increased to Dollars 70m, includes
construction of a new salty snacks plant outside Warsaw.
Last year, Wedel saw sales increase by 52 per cent to 1,583bn zlotys
(Dollars 95.8m) and reported net profit 48 per cent up at 240.7bn zlotys,
due partly to a tax holiday.
The shareholders approved an 8,000 zlotys-a-share dividend.
