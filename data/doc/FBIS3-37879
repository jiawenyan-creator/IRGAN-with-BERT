<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Kazak: "Democratic Forces Are Uniting </F>
in Order To Win"] 
  [Text] Democratic and patriotic forces of the Republic of 
Belarus held a consultative conference on 21 February. The 
conference discussed the possibilities for uniting all 
democratic forces in the Republic and coordinating their 
activities with regard to the upcoming presidential elections. 
  The representatives of parties which participated in the 
conference almost unanimously spoke in favor of dismissing the 
government and holding early elections, as well as for the need 
to unify democratic forces of Belarus. 
  According to the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly, if 
the united democratic forces can put forward one common 
candidate for the post of president, they will have a far better 
chance of winning in a coalition than if they campaign one by 
one or compete with each other. 
  The proposal was made to create a staff for supporting the 
common candidate, as well as to begin raising funds for the 
election campaign since, according to parties participating in 
the conference, all information media are almost entirely under 
government control. This opinion was also shared by Stanislav 
Shushkevich, who participated in the conference. The former 
Supreme Soviet chairman appealed to democratic forces to find a 
joint position with regard to three issues -- statehood, 
democracy, and commitment to market reforms. The specific date 
of the future elections -- 1 May 1994 -- was also mentioned at 
the conference. 
  The participants in the consultative conference agreed to 
meet in two weeks to discuss the principles of the alliance in a 
narrow circle.
