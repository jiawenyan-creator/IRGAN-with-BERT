JESSE JACKSON'S HALF BROTHER GETS 10-YEAR SENTENCE 
Chicago millionaire Noah Robinson was sentenced to the maximum 10 years in 
prison Saturday after being convicted of a felony in connection with the 
attempted murder of a woman who witnessed a slaying. 
The jury convicted Robinson, half brother of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a 
Greenville native, of accessory after the fact of assault and battery with 
intent to kill, in connection with the attempted murder of Janice Denise 
Rosemond. 
Robinson also was charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of Leroy 
(Hambone) Barber, but state Circuit Judge James Moore declared a mistrial on 
those counts when the jury failed to reach a verdict. 
Victim Survives 
Robinson, 45, was accused of hiring someone to kill Rosemond, who witnessed the 
1986 murder of Barber. Rosemond survived a stabbing attack. 
Robinson was led away in handcuffs to the Greenville County Detention Center. 
Moore declared a mistrial for the charges of murder and conspiracy to commit 
murder in the Barber slaying and criminal conspiracy and accessory before the 
fact of assault and battery with intent to kill in connection with the Rosemond 
attack. 
Solicitor Joe Watson, the prosecutor, said Robinson will face another trial on 
those charges. 
Robinson was accused of hiring members of the El Rukn gang of Chicago to come 
to Greenville to kill Barber, a former employee and childhood friend. 
Robinson and Jackson have the same father but grew up in separate Greenville 
homes. Jackson has refused to comment on his half brother's legal troubles.
