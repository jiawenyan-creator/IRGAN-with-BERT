 

This proposed AD would allow pilots to perform all the required checks. This action does not require special training
beyond that already incurred by pilots of the aircraft having affected engines, or the use of tools or special measuring
equipment, or reference to technical data. Accordingly, the FAA has determined that pilots may perform all the checks
required by this proposed rule as an exception to 43.3 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 43.3) regarding
the performance of maintenance.

The FAA estimates that 160 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that
it would take approximately 0.2 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $8,000 per engine. Based on an assumed utilization
rate and an assumed modification rate, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators over the five year
compliance period is estimated to be $3,101,600.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

The Proposed Amendment



Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:



PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.



39.13

 [Amended]



2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 398745 (58 FR 63061, November 30, 1993) and by adding a new
airworthiness directive to read as follows:






Turbomeca:

 Docket No. 94ANE08. Supersedes AD 932309, Amendment 398745.






Applicability:

 Turbomeca Arriel turboshaft engines Models 1B that do have modification TU 76 but do not have modification TU 197 or
TU 202; Arriel Models 1D and 1D1 that do not have modification TU 197 or TU 202; Arriel Models 1A, 1A1, 1A2 that have had
modification TU 76 but do not have modification TU 197 or TU 202; and Arriel Models 1C, 1C1, and 1C2 that do not have TU
197 or TU 202. These engines are installed on but not limited to Aerospatiale Models AS350B, SA365, and AS565 helicopters.



Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.

To prevent engine failure due to rubbing of the 2nd stage turbine disk on the 2nd stage turbine nozzle guide vane, which
could result in engine failure and damage to the aircraft, accomplish the following:
