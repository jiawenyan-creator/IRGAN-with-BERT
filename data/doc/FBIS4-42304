  [Text] This is the text of the letter, undated, purporting 
to be from a disaffected member of staff at the Foreign Office. 
  ``TO ALL PEOPLE that still have a `voice' within the Western 
World's Democracies &amp; the United Nations (U.N.), that feel 
that 
`EVIL' must be opposed, please read these documents by the 
so-called `civilised' leaders of the UK. 
  ``I myself have served this &amp; the previous government 
over 
many years, but I feel that I must leak this document to those 
that will listen due to its pure evil contents in the context of 
the world situation today. 
  ``If the country that I serve &amp; love &amp; that used to 
stand for 
the highest values of decency &amp; morality has now not only 
been 
betrayed by its leaders but has been bought to the very gutter 
of the international communities values, then I cannot stay 
quiet any longer! 
  ``PLEASE READ these documents &amp; if you can make them 
public 
in order that the ordinary person whom I know to still be decent 
realise how evil our present leaders are, please do so. Please 
oppose their policies which are causing rape, murder &amp; worse. 
  ``What is happening in the world today is pure evil for 
powerful groups &amp; states that care nothing for the suffering 
they are inflicting on other peoples &amp; states. 
  ``Please copy &amp; publish these documents from our 
so-called 
leaders in order to show the world how debased &amp; evil our 
leadership is. 
  ``A sympathizer in the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office.''
