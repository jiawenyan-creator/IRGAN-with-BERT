FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Flotations provide stronger swimmers -
Christopher Price analyses the themes to emerge from a bumper year for new
issues
A volatile year for new issues ended with a seemingly familiar refrain - a
profits warning from a recently floated company. Yet Thursday's admission
from Canadian Pizza, which came to the market little over a year ago, and
other headline-grabbing incidents have been the exception rather than the
norm, and have spoiled an otherwise sound performance by the rest of the new
issues market.
The picture is confirmed by research from James Capel and UBS, the
stockbrokers, and mirrors analysis by the Financial Times in October,
showing new issues overall outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. Even
where new issues have underperformed the index, they have usually
outperformed their sectors.
Privatisations aside, it was a bumper year for flotations in terms of the
money raised and the number joining the market.
According to Capel, which surveyed companies with a flotation value of more
than Pounds 25m (excluding investment trusts and international offerings),
68 companies floated between January 1 and November 30, with a collective
market capitalisation of Pounds 8.7bn. In 1993 there were 58 new issues for
a total of Pounds 5bn.
Over the past two years, new issues have outperformed the All-Share by 3.1
per cent and their sectors by 8 per cent, according to Capel. The larger UBS
report, which surveyed all debutantes capitalised at more than Pounds 10m,
found an average outperformance of 4.6 per cent against the All-Share.
The most hectic period came in the last quarter of last year and the first
quarter of 1994, with the period either side also very active. Institutional
investors, sensing an economic revival and keen to invest in fast-growing
'recovery' stocks, turned to the new issues market with enthusiasm.
The result was a rush to the market by private companies, encouraged by City
financiers and assured of a warm reception from fund managers.
Critics say the stampede produced overpricing of some issues and encouraged
some companies to float which would not normally have done so.
While this bears some truth, the volatile and generally downward performance
of the stock market during 1994 has been as significant. This has thrown the
underperformance of many new issue stocks into perspective.
Beazer Homes, for example, which came to the market in March, has seen its
shares drop by 17 per cent against their issue price and underperform the
All-Share by 15 per cent, using Capel figures. Yet the stock has
outperformed the building and construction sector by 12 per cent.
Among other issues highlighted in the reports, are the underperformance of
the high- tech sectors, and the generally strong showing by management
buy-outs.
The falling market, some spectacular flops and a lack of funds have driven
investors away from new issues. While there were 52 flotations in the first
half of the year, only 16 came in the second, according to Capel, with
dozens of others pulled as prices plummeted.
'The flotation frenzy of the last two years is over,' said Mr Tom Attwood, a
director at Capel. 'The market will not support anything other than top
quality issues. And even then they will haggle over the price.'
Of last year's winners and losers there is a fairly sombre view of the
vagaries of the stock market.
DRS Data, the scanning equipment manufacturer, came to the market in May and
issued a profits warning in September. It was this year's second worst
performer.
Mr Malcolm Brighton, managing director, said: 'This has been the most
damaging six months of my career. I was not prepared for the astonishing
level of cynicism from City analysts and institutions.'
He said the group was a victim of circumstances beyond its control. 'People
just think we are trying to pull a fast one,' he said. 'Trying to convince
them of what has actually happened has been awful.'
He did not think the process of flotation had been at fault, nor the group's
pricing. 'We listened to our advisers,' he said.
Aerostructures Hamble is the name synonymous with the bad publicity rained
on new issues during the past year. It floated in June and had issued two
profits warnings by November. Mr David Ring, acting chief executive, said
the company had no complaints about its flotation, nor the hostile reaction
from the City.
'It was a rigorous and fair process. Some things happen to companies which
can't be seen. But we have no bitterness towards the City - the market set
the price then and is setting the price now. We are concentrating our
efforts on getting the business back on track.'
Unforeseen circumstances were also cited by Mr Garth Riley, chief executive
of Telspec, in denying that the shares had been underpriced. The telecoms
equipment manufacturer was the best performer since December 1993.
'The price was struck against certain market conditions. It could not take
into account business we were fortunate enough to subsequently win.'
