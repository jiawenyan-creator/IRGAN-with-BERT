SHORT TAKES; 
CBS'S N.Y. STAGEHANDS STRIKE 
About 200 members of a stagehands' union local went on strike against CBS on 
Thursday after "last-ditch" contract talks ended in failure, a union 
spokeswoman said. 
The strike by members of Local 1 of the International Alliance of Theatrical 
and Stage Employees is only against CBS' New York facilities. 
The network's Los Angeles studios have separate contracts with the union. 
The walkout, called after negotiations broke down Wednesday, is the first 
against CBS since about 300 Writers Guild members struck CBS News for seven 
weeks in 1987. 
Members of the union had been working without a contract since Dec. 31, said 
union spokeswoman Deborah Friedman. She said the strike also is against 
CBS-owned WCBS-TV here. 
"We don't expect that it's going to affect our day-to-day operations," said CBS 
spokeswoman Ann Morfogen.
