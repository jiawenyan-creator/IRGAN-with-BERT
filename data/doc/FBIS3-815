  [Text] Conservative Party [CP] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg 
says the registration of General Constand Viljoen's Freedom 
Front is a political mistake. 
  Addressing about 250 people at a public meeting in 
Nelspruit, 
Dr. Hartzenberg said he had great respect for Gen. Viljoen on 
military matters, but he said the fact that the general had 
offered his Freedom Front to the Inkatha Freedom Party and 
Bophuthatswana to take part in the election, ensured 
participation in the election and not support for a volkstaat 
[homeland]. Dr. Hartzenberg reiterated his view that 
participation would lend credibility to the election, and his 
party would therefore not take part in it. 
  [Begin Hartzenberg recording, in Afrikaans -- in progress] 
In 
this case the constitutional principle -- that a nation must 
have the right to self-determination, to have the right to 
choose its own government -- is being cast aside completely. 
Here our people do not choose our government, other nations 
collectively choose a government for South Africa, and that 
constitutional principle becomes completely crushed. [end
