FT  19 NOV 94 / Beans' rundown of Tipton factory ironic
It is ironic that Beans' rundown Tipton factory shares space with Advanced
Engineering Systems, a Unipart subsidiary whose managing director, Mr Frank
Burns, controls both AES and its sister operation, Premier Exhausts - 1993's
'factory of the year', John Griffiths writes.
Even more ironically, Beans itself sold AES to Unipart two years ago - with
potentially life-saving trial contracts to supply motor components to
Toyota's Burnaston car plant in Derbyshire.
Machined castings and other parts for Toyota and Honda provide most of the
turnover at AES, which Unipart regards - with Premier - as its lean
manufacturing 'flagships'.
Mr Burns acknowledges that Unipart bought AES from Beans - which prior to
the sale also reconditioned engines for Unipart - solely because of the
Toyota contracts and the chance to start a long-term relationship with
Japan's largest carmaker.
