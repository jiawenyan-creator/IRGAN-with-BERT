FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Move to clarify exchange law
AN ADVISORY committee to Japan's Ministry of Finance announced in an interim
report this week that the law which prohibits stock price manipulation
should not be revised, but standards for its application should be
clarified, writes Emiko Terazono.
Criticism that the present Article 125 of the Securities and Exchange Law
was not sufficient to prove stock manipulation had prompted a review by the
committee last year.
