FT  07 AUG 92 / Hurd hits out at Euro-sceptics
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, made an uncharacteristically robust
attack yesterday on Britain's Euro-sceptics, arguing that opponents of the
Maastricht treaty offered 'no convincing alternative'.
His speech to Scottish Conservatives in Cuminestown, Aberdeenshire,
acknowledged that the European Community had 'caused our national hackles to
rise' on occasions, but also said that Britain could claim important
successes in changing the course of the EC.
Mr Hurd was at pains to point out that it was Baroness Thatcher who had
helped to create the Single European Act - enabling the single market, which
is increasingly criticised by Euro-sceptics.
He argued that under Mr John Major's leadership, provisions negotiated by
the UK at Maastricht were, for the first time, decentralising EC
decision-making and ensuring legislation could be enforced by the European
Court.
It was the UK's intention to conclude its six-month-long presidency with
negotiating mandates in place for the accession to the Community of Austria,
Sweden and Finland.
'On the single market, on the rule of law, on the principle of minimum
interference, on enlargement and on keeping co-operation against crime and
on foreign policy intergovernmental, it is British ideas which are carrying
the day,' he claimed. In a clear swipe at backbench critics, Mr Hurd added
that this 'impressive record' ran counter to the 'neurotic drip-feed of
Brussels horror stories retailed in certain quarters'.
