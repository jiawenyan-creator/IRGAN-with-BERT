FT  03 JUN 94 / Yeltsin seeks nuclear-free Korea
President Boris Yeltsin, in another display of Russia's newly assertive
foreign policy, yesterday called for an international conference to make the
Korean peninsula nuclear-free before attempts to impose sanctions on North
Korea.
The Russian leader said that if such a conference failed to make North
Korea, a former ally of the old Soviet Union, comply with the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty it had signed, Russia and the world would have no
choice but to turn to sanctions.
'Today, when no decision has been taken to convene an international
conference, it is too early to talk about sanctions,' he told a joint news
conference with South Korea's visiting President Kim Young-sam. 'If it got
to the point where North Korea sought to undo the non-proliferation treaty,
Russia will be forced to gradually begin to solve the problem: first to
issue warnings (to North Korea) and then the world community must decide
whether to impose sanctions on North Korea.'
The crisis over North Korea's refusal to permit inspection of nuclear
facilities deepened yesterday as Pyongyang threatened to scrap previous
pledges and warned that sanctions against it could have devastating results.
But Mr Yeltsin said it was too early to talk of sanctions as long as a
conference gathering North and South Korea, Russia, the US, Japan and China
had not been convened. He said he would try to talk to President Bill
Clinton, now on a tour of Europe.
In Rome Mr Clinton said he would press for international economic sanctions
against North Korea if the International Atomic Energy Agency found
Pyongyang violated nuclear safeguards accords.
The IAEA wants to inspect spent fuel rods being removed from a reactor to
ensure the North has not diverted nuclear material for weapons purposes.
