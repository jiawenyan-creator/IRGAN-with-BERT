FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: Failings, and their relevance to what we do
Sir, So the prime minister considers that a minister's keeping or breaking
of marriage vows has 'nothing to do' with his conduct of departmental duties
('PM backs Mellor's media review role', July 21), nor presumably with the
likelihood of his breaking political and electoral promises.
Likewise, Joe Rogaly ('Fat chance of privacy', July 21) agrees, and suggests
that Mr Mellor made a mistake in issuing a statement. The experience of
Governor Bill Clinton in the US would suggest, however, that public
confession and restitution wins support from voters because of its honesty
and stops sensationalist reporting in its tracks.
Contrary to Mr Rogaly, we do not need a climate of opinion that 'responds to
news about (politicians') private lives with a definitive Gallic shrug', but
one which recognises that while we all have failings, these are not always
irrelevant to what we do.
