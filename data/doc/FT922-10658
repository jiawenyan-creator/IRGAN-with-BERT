FT  30 APR 92 / Letter: Rate cut is the cure for Germany
Sir, If economists will disregard textbook theory and look at the empirical
evidence they will realise that high interest rates are causing the big
increase in the money supply in Germany, not curing it.
It appears that the endowment effect is particularly strong in Germany and
increased interest rates have caused bank profits to leap. Profits attract
capital, and capital provides the base for the expansion of credit. One
German bank has already announced a huge rights issue and the effect of that
is inevitable.
No doubt intensive marketing of credit will overcome any borrower resistance
that higher rates of interest might engender.
We have seen this process occur several times in Britain. One example is
enough: the huge Barclays Bank rights issue in 1988 was used as a base to
increase the credit supply by Pounds 41bn by the end of 1989.
If the credit explosion gets out of hand, the result is bankruptcies and
recession as we in Britain well know. Excessive increases in bank capital
wherever they take place bring nearer the likelihood of a 1929-style
calamity.
Textbook theorists claim that it was the lowering of interest rates in May
1988 that precipitated the credit explosion. The evidence suggests
otherwise. Lending for acquisitions and mergers - the main cause of the
asset price inflation - was at its highest in the third quarter of 1989 when
base rates were 14 per cent.
The Bundesbank will save Germany and the world a lot of grief if it sharply
reduces its discount rate.
