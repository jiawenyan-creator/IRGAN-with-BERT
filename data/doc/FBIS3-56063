  [Text] Kiev -- As Borys Bazylevskyy, head of the Supreme 
Council Foreign Affairs Commission Secretariat, told a UNIAN 
correspondent on 12 January, "the meeting between the presidents 
of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia should be ponderable, 
but the decision reached could contradict a decision by the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council. Everything depends on whether the 
United States will have an understanding attitude to Ukraine's 
position and its economic situation. In Ukraine the attitude to 
this meeting is not unequivocal." 
  Borys Bazylevskyy added that today members of the commission 
are working on the ratification of conventions and international 
agreements that will be discussed at the next session.
