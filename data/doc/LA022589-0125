BOYS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS; 
MISSION VIEJO PICKS OFF CERRITOS EARLY, OFTEN 
The Mission Viejo High School boys' soccer team defeated Cerritos, 7-1, in a 
Southern Section 3-A quarterfinal match Friday at Mission Viejo, but coaches of 
both teams said it was over by the time the score was 2-0 early in the second 
half. 
"When the second goal hit them, they knew they were in trouble," Mission Viejo 
Coach Cal Foster said. 
Cerritos Coach Ron Flores agreed: "Oh yeah, it fell apart after the second and 
third goals. I just started looking at my watch, hoping the time would pass." 
The Diablos (24-3), who will play St. Francis in Tuesday's semifinals, led, 
1-0, at halftime on senior forward Jim Eddow's breakaway goal with 4 minutes 
remaining in the half. Eddow was rewarded by being taken out of the game in the 
second half. 
"We put in two faster forwards at the half (Jeff Jurgemeyer and Mark Gaw) 
because we knew we could get outside because we were faster," Foster said. 
The move to speed paid quick dividends for Mission Viejo as Gaw scored from 
point-blank range just 4 minutes into the second half after he gained control 
of Andy Wortrich's blocked shot. 
Two minutes later, center Joe-Max Moore scored the first of his two goals on a 
35-footer to put Mission Viejo ahead, 3-0. Moore also scored 31 minutes into 
the second half when he split two defenders to the right of the goal and 
left-footed a cross shot from 15 feet out. 
Wortrich, Todd Patrick and Steve Vanderweide also scored for Mission Viejo. 
Eddie Soto scored Cerritos' goal.
