FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Chairman of JP Morgan hails
'exceptional' result
A SECOND consecutive quarter of bumper profits from trading in financial
markets pushed second-quarter net income at JP Morgan up by a third, to
Dollars 431m, compared with the same period in 1992.
Trading income of Dollars 989m in the first half, much of it from successful
positioning by the bank for falls in European interest rates, exceeded
trading revenues of Dollars 959m earned in the whole of last year. The
company's shares climbed by nearly Dollars 1 to Dollars 70 3/4 in New York,
before easing back to Dollars 70 1/4 before the close, as analysts rushed to
upgrade estimates for 1993 and 1994 earnings.
Describing second-quarter results as 'exceptional', Sir Dennis Weatherstone,
chairman, said: 'Trading performance stood out, with substantial gains in
trading of debt instruments and strong results in swaps and other derivative
instruments'. The company added that 'efforts to increase distribution and
market-making activities positioned us well for declining European interest
rates and appreciating values in emerging markets.'
JP Morgan, which has become one of the biggest equity and bond underwriters
in the US, also benefited from continuing high levels of capital-raising by
US companies. Corporate finance income reached Dollars 115m, up from Dollars
110m in the same period in 1992.
Also for the second quarter in a row, JP Morgan made no additions to
provisions for credit losses, an unusual record among US banks. Total
provisions amount to more than four times the bank's non-performing loans of
Dollars 291m. 'These reserves will be recaptured - it's just a question of
when,' said Mr Thomas Hanley, banking analyst at First Boston.
Trading profits pushed non-interest income up to Dollars 1,116m, from
Dollars 839m in the second quarter of 1992 and Dollars 1,051m in the first
three months of this year. There were also strong gains in investment
management fees, up to Dollars 112m from Dollars 92m a year ago, and fees
from operational services such as clearing and custody, up from Dollars 99m
to Dollars 121m.
Net interest income, by contrast, fell to Dollars 424m from Dollars 434m,
reflecting a shift towards trading-related activities. This was partially
offset by gains from trading interest rate products, the bank said. Earnings
per share, at Dollars 2.12, were slightly down from the first quarter's
Dollars 2.16 (Dollars 1.47 after the effect of accounting changes).
