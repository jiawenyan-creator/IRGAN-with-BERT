AUTO WORKERS, GM REMAIN AT THE BARGAINING TABLE 
The United Auto Workers and General Motors continued to bargain Saturday toward 
a new contract covering 300,000 active workers in 33 states, after setting 
aside a strike deadline that passed at midnight Friday. 
The pact would cover 3,500 Californians, including 3,200 in Van Nuys. 
Negotiators were hoping to reach an agreement before a scheduled meeting Monday 
of the union's 300-member GM bargaining council, called to vote on any new 
pact. Workers were told to report to work as usual "until further notice." Only 
one plant, in Bowling Green, Ky., had been slated to operate this weekend. 
Although Canadian Auto Workers struck Ford of Canada at midnight Friday, 
bargaining continued Saturday and no work was halted because none of Ford's 
Canadian plants had scheduled weekend operations. 
Ford says a Canadian strike would begin crippling up to eight U.S. assembly 
plants within a week. Ford of Canada is the sole source of engines for the 
Lincoln Continental and base engine for the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury 
Cougar, for example. It also makes all of the windshields for Ford's F-series 
pickup truck, the nation's biggest selling vehicle. 
Affected would be plants in Atlanta; Chicago; Detroit; St. Paul, Minn.; Wixom, 
Mich.; Lorraine, Ohio; Norfolk, Va., and Kansas City.
