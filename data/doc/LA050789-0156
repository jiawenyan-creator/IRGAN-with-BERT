3 CHARGED IN ROOF-COATING SCHEME 
Three men were charged with 18 felonies, including robbery, burglary and grand 
theft, in connection with a home-repair scam that bilked mostly seniors, 
authorities said Saturday. 
Two of the suspects, James Monroe, 46, of Lakewood, and Bill Thompson, 36, of 
Norwalk, were fugitives and being sought on warrants, Sheriff's Deputy Pat 
Hunter said. The third suspect, Bob Tillis, 32, of Norwalk, faces arraignment 
May 24, Hunter said. 
The three "allegedly duped several elderly homeowners into paying up to $7,500 
for having their roofs sprayed with a substance that the suspects claimed would 
seal the roofs against the elements for up to 20 years," Hunter said. The roof 
treatment, a concoction of gasoline, aluminum paint and a sticky tar-like 
material, "is useless as a sealant and is equivalent of painting the roof with 
a thin coating of aluminum paint," Hunter said. 
When they were arrested the men had $4,000 in cash, stolen property and false 
certificates guaranteeing their roofing jobs, authorities said.
