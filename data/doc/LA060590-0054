METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD CONSIDERS ELIMINATING 1,300 
JOBS 
Facing its biggest financial crisis in a decade, the Los Angeles school board 
is considering eliminating 1,300 positions -- including more than 600 teaching 
jobs -- as it tries to trim $220 million from next year's budget. 
The board already has approved $119 million in cuts, including eliminating 635 
clerical and administrative jobs. 
But the district's chief financial officer, Robert Booker, said another $101 
million in cuts are needed to meet state requirements. Booker blamed the 
shortfall on lower-than-expected revenue from the state, sharply rising program 
costs and the 8% salary increase the board gave to nearly every employee. 
The board will hold public hearings on the proposed cuts next week and vote on 
the cuts in two weeks.
