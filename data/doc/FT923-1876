FT  21 SEP 92 / No intervention, UN chief insists
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, said at the
weekend that there was no question of the UN intervening unasked in
conflicts, unless they were the result of an aggression by one country
against another.
He told the Financial Times he rejected the growing view that the UN should
be allowed to intervene in some internal conflicts without the consent of
all the participants, if the threat to peace and security was particularly
serious.
'Like it or not, that is the reality,' he said. 'Unless all the protagonists
in an internal dispute ask for our intervention, we will not intervene,
except in the case of an aggression.'
He particularly lamented the fact that the UN could do nothing to help the
Middle East peace process because Israel was opposed to such a step. He said
he had offered his services to Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin, and his
predecessor Yitzhak Shamir. 'They said okay, we'll think about it, but they
have not given their agreement. I'm doing my best to persuade them that it's
in their own interests, but I cannot impose myself or the UN if they don't
want to have us. That is one of the basic rules of our organisation.'
Referring to the recent decision to send more UN peace-keeping troops to
Yugoslavia to ensure the delivery of international humanitarian aid, Mr
Boutros Ghali said reports that the rules of engagement had been modified to
enable the UN troops to use their arms if they were impeded from carrying
out their task, were incorrect.
'The rules of engagement remain the same as for previous peace-keeping
operations. They already have the right to fire back in self-defence. But a
new Security Council resolution would be needed to allow them to use their
arms in any other circumstances.'
