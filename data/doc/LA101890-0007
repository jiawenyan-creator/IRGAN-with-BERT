DAVID DUKE'S STRONG SHOWING IN LOUISIANA VOTE 
The Times fluffs off Duke's demand for a colorblind society. A colorblind 
society is what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lived and died for. 
Just for starters, it would be nice to have a colorblind Supreme Court. Or on 
the local level it would be nice to have admission to the University of 
California not based on color.
