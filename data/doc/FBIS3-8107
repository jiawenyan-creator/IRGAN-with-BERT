  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 3 Mar (TANJUG) -- The Democratic Party 
[DP] will not take part in the new republican government which 
Mirko Marjanovic is to form, Democratic Party Chairman Zoran 
Djindjic said today in TANJUG's guest interview. 
  "We will not enter the government because we believe that 
conditions for that are not ripe," Djindjic explained. He said 
that the Democratic Party's attitude to the government would be 
one of good will and that its vote would depend on the program 
presented by the prime minister-designate. 
  "It is not ruled out that we might vote for the government, 
and it is not ruled out either that we might abstain, but it is 
unlikely that we will vote against the government," Djindjic 
noted. 
  The Democratic Party leader noted that the idea of a 
government of national unity, advocated by his party, has been 
abandoned. [passage omitted]
