FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: Extrovert with reputation for
deal-making
THE RESIGNATION of Mr John Clegg, 33, as chief executive of Wace Group
brings a sudden and mysterious halt to the career of one of Britain's most
successful young businessmen.
Mr Clegg was just 26 when he was appointed, becoming the youngest chief
executive of a listed company and promising 'aggressive development and
youthful enthusiasm'.
The extrovert young man soon established a reputation as a deal-maker.
A rapid series of acquisitions helped make Wace the world's largest
pre-press printing specialist, with companies in Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and the United States.
Born in Nice, he was brought up in Sheffield and studied law at the London
School of Economics.
He trained as a solicitor with Nabarro Nathanson in London between 1979-83
and then worked in the City for a year as corporate finance executive with
Minster Trust before moving to Wace.
In spite of his title of managing director for the group, Mr Clegg has been
spending most of his time recently in the United States, where Wace is
facing very depressed markets.
He has also been taking a less active role in operational issues since
extensive management changes at the beginning of last year.
Mr Clegg no longer has a home in London and stays with relatives when
visiting the UK.
Wace said yesterday that Mr Clegg was anxious to return to his wife and baby
in America as soon as possible.
