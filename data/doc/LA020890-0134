SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
NACK RAISES $10,698 
According to semiannual campaign reports filed at the end of last month, only 
Pasadena City Director Kathryn Nack reported any substantial campaign 
activities during the last half of 1989. 
The 6th District director held a mid-September fund-raiser and collected 
$10,698 in cash contributions. 
Of that, $4,503 was spent to mail newsletters bearing her picture to all 
households in her district. Nack said newsletter restrictions under state 
Proposition 73 made the fund-raiser necessary. According to her campaign 
report, she has $6,349 on hand that she said she will use for future mailers. 
Other directors reported no fund raising and merely carried over existing 
campaign funds. Amounts reported by the other city directors were $87 for Rick 
Cole, $1,208 for Chris Holden, $3,501 for Jess Hughston, $288 for William 
Paparian and $3,700 for Mayor William Thomson. John Crowley filed no campaign 
papers because he said he had no contributions, expenditures or campaign funds.
