FT  26 JAN 94 / ITN negotiates cuts in pay
ITN, the television news company, has negotiated a pay cut for 26 engineers
responsible for news links and five other employees. Supervisors earning
Pounds 44,000 a year will have their pay reduced to Pounds 36,000 over three
years. Engineers pay is going down from rates approaching Pounds 40,000 to
Pounds 33,000. In return they will be getting a one-off Pounds 6,000 payment
in this month's pay packets.
The deal was agreed by Bectu, the broadcasting union, as an alternative to
the loss of two jobs planned in ITN's redundancy programme.
Reuters Television, the company formed after the Reuters takeover of the
Visnews agency, is planning to derecognise Bectu when it relocates within
London in March.
