FT  17 NOV 92 / Criminals used by army to smear ANC
A JUDICIAL inquiry into political violence in South Africa yesterday found
that the army had used a convicted murderer to try to discredit the African
National Congress (ANC), providing the most damaging evidence disclosed so
far of state involvement in political unrest.
Yesterday's statement from Judge Richard Goldstone, who heads a commission
of inquiry set up by Pretoria to probe political violence, goes well beyond
any previous official report on security force complicity in violence. Judge
Goldstone said the commission had seized army documents showing that top
military officers had last year sanctioned the use of criminals to discredit
the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe.
The report could do severe political damage to Mr F W de Klerk's government,
already under serious pressure after a spate of allegations of state
involvement in political assassinations.
Mr Justice Goldstone stopped short of declaring that the evidence proved the
existence of an orchestrated campaign to undermine the ANC and foment
violence, but he conceded that the documents provided 'some evidence' of
such activity.
Yesterday's revelations cast serious doubts on President de Klerk's frequent
protestations - repeated yesterday in a BBC interview - that the government
is innocent of involvement in violence.
The documents seized by the Goldstone commission, on the contrary, show that
the army's top intelligence officer, Gen Rudolf Badenhorst, had employed a
convicted double murderer, Mr Ferdi Barnard, to 'compromise' ANC guerrillas
by involving them in crime.
'For that purpose use would be made inter alia of prostitutes, homosexuals,
shebeen (illegal bar) owners and drug dealers,' the inquiry statement said.
Documents revealing the operation were seized when the commission raided a
military intelligence unit.
