FT  18 MAR 93 / After The Budget: Stamp duty move will aid most first-time
buyers
TWO THIRDS of first-time buyers are likely to benefit from the doubling of
the stamp duty threshold announced in the Budget, according to a study
published yesterday.
James R. Adams, research consultants, estimate that 45 per cent of
purchasers would gain from the decision to raise the threshold for stamp
duty from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000.
People would benefit most in regions where house prices were lowest. In
Yorkshire 55 per cent of all purchasers would gain from raising the
threshold but only 28 per cent of London house buyers.
Housebuilders, estate agents and building societies are pleased that
measures announced in the Budget have done nothing to impede the fragile
recovery in the housing market.
They say gains from raising the stamp duty threshold will more than offset
reductions in mortgage tax relief, also announced in the Budget, but which
will not take place until next year.
Government plans to raise private finance for three of the country's biggest
rail projects, Heathrow Express, the Channel Tunnel link and London's
Crossrail, have received a more muted response from the construction
industry.
Companies welcomed the government's renewed commitment to raising private
finance for infrastructure but were concerned that there was still a gap
between political rhetoric and schemes getting approved, and that a gulf
remained between the Treasury and private investors over what constituted a
reasonable balance between risk and reward.
The general feeling was that the three projects were a long way from
receiving final approval and involved complex financial and environmental
issues which could delay the start of construction until the next century in
some cases.
Civil engineers were also concerned that the Crossrail link between London's
Paddington and Liverpool Street stations was now expected to require private
finance.
Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotels group which
built the privately financed Dartford road bridge across the River Thames,
said: 'The industry has been looking for this kind of commitment to joint
private/public sector projects. But this is only the beginning. It is
important that these projects go forward as quickly as possible for the sake
of the economy.'
