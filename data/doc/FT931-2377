FT  20 MAR 93 / Welsh pub referendum to be abolished
THE WETS have won in Wales. The government intends to abolish the referendum
that is held every seven years on Sunday pub opening, Roland Adburgham
writes.
This process has steadily reduced the number of Welsh areas where pubs are
closed on a Sunday to just one. The Welsh Office is proposing that the next
poll, due in 1996, should be the last. Only legislation would then be able
to change its result.
Sir Wyn Roberts, minister for Wales, said: 'Since the inception of Sunday
opening referenda in 1961 there has been a steady decline in turnout which
was less than 9 per cent of the electorate at the last poll, held in
November 1989.'
The diehard district was Dwyfor in north Wales, where the turnout was 47 per
cent. A majority of nearly 1,500 voted to stay dry. Mr Dennis Roberts, the
district council secretary, said yesterday: 'Sunday opening is an issue
locally. It was a vote for the old way of life.'
