  [Text] Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the Electronic 
Industries Association of Japan, commented at a news conference 
on 18 March on the U.S. electronic industry's report which 
forecast the share of foreign-made semiconductors in the 
Japanese market will reach 25-28 percent by 1996. 
  He stressed: "I am strongly concerned about the possibility 
that such a figure may get beyond our control." 
  The 1993 market share calculated by the U.S. method did not 
reach the "annual average of 20 percent" demanded by the U.S. 
Government when the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord was 
concluded. 
  Therefore, Sekimoto's remark is meant to preempt the 
possibility that the figures in the U.S. report become the new 
"numerical target."
