LA JOLLA MAN ARRESTED AFTER WIFE FOUND BURIED 
Police on Friday unearthed the skeletal remains of a woman buried behind a 
Canoga Park home early Friday, and later arrested her husband, a La Jolla man, 
for murder. 
Acting on a tip, authorities uncovered the remains from a 3-foot deep pit in 
the backyard of a single-family residence in the 20600 block of Sherman Way. 
Swanston said authorities believe the remains are those of Deborah Lynn Hardy, 
31, who lived at the residence with her husband and two daughters until her 
death, estimated as either late 1985 or early 1986. 
Jeffrey Hardy, 46, was taken into custody without incident late Friday at a La 
Jolla apartment he shared with the couple's two children. He was booked without 
bail on suspicion of murder and was transported back to Los Angeles to face 
charges, detective Rick Swanston said. 
Authorities said they believe Hardy beat his wife to death with a flashlight 
during a domestic dispute. 
Hardy never filed a missing person's report on his wife and instead told those 
who inquired that his wife had abandoned the family. 
Swanston said Hardy's 22-year-old daughter apparently learned of the slaying 
sometime after the death. Charges were not being sought against her, although 
she did not notify police of the killing, Swanston said. 
Tests should be able to positively identify the remains within the next two 
weeks, he said. 
"The Coroner's Office will positively identify the skeleton, but it is our 
belief they are most likely the remains of Deborah Lynn Hardy," the detective 
said.
