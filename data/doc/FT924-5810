FT  25 NOV 92 / New partnerships made easier
PARTNERSHIPS will be able to admit new members more easily under rules
announced this week.
An extra-statutory concession from the Inland Revenue makes it simpler to
waive the general requirement that, if membership changes, a new partnership
must be created for tax purposes, under the 1988 Income and Corporation
Taxes Act. Under existing regulations, partners can waive that requirement
only if every partner approves within two years.
Under the concession, which applies to partnerships with at least 50 members
or at least 20 not resident in the UK, a partnership can simply ask the
Revenue to treat it as continuing until notified otherwise.
