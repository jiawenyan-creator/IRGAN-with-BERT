FT  27 OCT 93 / Centrist party to mount challenge
MR ARKADY VOLSKY, head of Russia's Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, announced yesterday he would head a revived 'centrist'
alliance in the country's parliamentary elections.
The party, to be called Civic Union for Stability, Justice and Progress,
represents a powerful new force to challenge the main government-sponsored
alliance, Russia's Choice.
It is promising both to promote free enterprise and to increase the
'manageability' of the state-owned economy.
Other candidates on the party's electoral list include leading
industrialists such as Mr Nikolai Bekh, head of Kamaz, the country's biggest
truck manufacturer.
According to the party's programme released yesterday, Russia's problems
stem not from enemies within, but from 'stupidity, incompetence and
dishonesty' at the top,
For this reason, Mr Volsky said, it could co-operate with forces as varied
as the Agrarian party, which represents the state farm lobby, and Mr Grigory
Yevlinsky, the prominent economist, who wants more effective economic reform
and a strong federal state.
He suggested that his group might even endorse Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, who was being shunned by radicals in Russia's Choice.
Meanwhile, in a further attempt to distance himself from the cabinet, Mr
Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister and head of the Russian Unity and
Accord party, said yesterday he was giving up his government salary. He also
attacked the government's privatisation programme.
Mr Volsky's new party title, replacing the shorter Civic Union, is an
attempt to shake off previous associations with disgraced former
vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, one of the leaders of the recent
parliamentary rebellion.
