FT  07 FEB 92 / International Bonds: BankAmerica awakens sector
A Dollars 200m issue of floating-rate notes for BankAmerica marked the
reopening of a dormant sector yesterday. The floating-rate note market led
activity in the Eurobond market during the early 1980s. But in 1986, the
perpetual FRN market crashed, burying the perpetual market, and reducing the
flow of other bank floating-rate notes to a mere trickle.
The last FRN for a US bank holding company, once a leading sector of the
market, was a Mellon Bank deal in 1989.
The reopening of the market yesterday reflects the improving credit
performance of some areas of the US banking industry. US banks have been
returning to their domestic fixed-rate bond market, which BankAmerica itself
tapped last week.
Dealers said there is some room in the FRN market for US bank issues, but
demand, mainly from banks, will be very selective.
BankAmerica, which is set to merge with Security Pacific, has been perceived
as an improving credit since its rationalisation, according to traders. A
number of other US banks, still regarded as declining credits, would find it
much harder to access the market.
The notes were considered fairly priced at a discounted margin of 50 basis
points above the London interbank offered rate, according to lead manager
Kidder Peabody.
The deal will also provide a fillip for the secondary market, where bank
FRNs are still traded, though spreads between bid and offer prices have
widened, and the number of market makers has shrunk.
In the Ecu sector, Osterreichische Kontrollbank added Ecu50m to an
outstanding Ecu150m of three-year bonds, via Paribas.
Salomon Brothers was joint lead and Bear Stearns was co-lead manager of
Swiss Bank Corporation's Italy strip transaction earlier this week.
