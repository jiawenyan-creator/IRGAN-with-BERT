FT  08 APR 94 / Spain cuts mobile phone tariffs
Spain yesterday cut mobile telephone tariffs by 15 per cent, and delayed the
award of a licence to a private cellular operator in move which will boost
the market share of the state-owned telephone monopoly ahead of
deregulation. The cheaper rates and a 60 per cent cut in subscription
charges should boost sales of the analogue TMA cellular service offered by
Telefonica, which is 32 per cent government owned, in advance of the
introduction of the more modern GSM mobile telephony under a deregulation
package. The government had originally promised to seek tenders for two GSM
licences - one reserved for Telefonica and the other for a private operator
 -last year but the bidding terms have now been delayed indefinitely.
