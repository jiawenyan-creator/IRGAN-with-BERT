FT  06 DEC 94 / Former prime minister resigns
Mr VP Singh, former Indian prime minister, resigned from parliament
yesterday amid what his aides called frustration at political corruption and
a big rift in his centrist Janata Dal party over economic reforms. But the
62-year-old Mr Singh, who led a minority government for 11 months after the
1989 elections, told a news conference he was quitting for personal reasons.
Janata Dal aides said he was frustrated by parliament's handling of a
financial scandal and frequent defections by his group's deputies, some of
whom have crossed over to Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's Congress party.
Mr Singh is regarded as a supporter of sweeping free-market reforms that
began in 1991 under Mr Narasimha Rao. He is seen as having carefully
concealed his objections to the anti-liberalisation stance of his Janata Dal
and Left Front partners.
