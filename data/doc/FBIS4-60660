  [Text] Responsible security sources and eyewitnesses in the 
capital of Aden have stated that shrapnel from one of the two 
surface-to-surface missiles launched by the bloody gang of the 
al-Ahmar clan on the city this morning, which our ground defense 
forces were able to detonate, injured 12 people who were 
subsequently taken to the hospital.
