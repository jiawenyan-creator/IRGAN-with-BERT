 

(c) National filing system. 

 The filing of federal tax liens is to be governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to any other federal
law that may establish a national system for filing liens and encumbrances against a particular type of personal property.
Thus, for example, the Service is not subject to the requirements established by the Federal Aviation Agency for filing
liens against civil aircraft in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Example 5.

 The law of State F provides that notices of lien affecting personal property are to be filed with the clerk of the circuit
court in the county in which the personal property is located. State F has conformed state law to federal law to provide
that all instruments affecting title to an interest in any civil aircraft of the United States must be recorded in the
Office of the Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On July 1, 1990, a tax lien arises against
ABC airline, which owns aircraft situated in State F. The Internal Revenue Service files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien
with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the aircraft is located but does not file the notice with the
FAA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Because the FAA system adopted by State F does not constitute a second place of filing
pursuant to section 6323(f), the federal tax lien is validly filed. 



Example 6.

 Assume the same facts as 

Example 5 

except that State F did not reenact or conform state law to the FAA requirements. The result is the same because the filing
of federal tax liens is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code, and is not subject to any other national filing
system.
