FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Go-ahead for Courtaulds venture
Courtaulds, the chemicals group, is to take a 72.5 per cent stake in the
viscose and acrylic fibres joint venture with Hoechst of Germany, announced
last May.
The final agreement, which had been awaiting approval by the competition
authorities, includes put and call options exercisable after five years on
Hoechst's 27.5 per cent stake. The joint venture becomes operational
immediately.
Courtaulds is contributing 57 per cent of the joint venture's assets of
Pounds 105m and 64 per cent of its annual turnover of Pounds 360m.
The joint venture will be the second largest producer in the European fibre
industry, which has been suffering from overcapacity and Asian imports.
It will have about 30 per cent of the total viscose and 25 per cent of the
total acrylic staple fibre capacity in Europe.
With its Courtelle brand name, Courtaulds is market leader in producer-dyed
acrylic fibre in Europe.
The venture, which has a workforce of 2,450, takes in Courtaulds' viscose
and acrylic fibre operations at Grimsby and Bradford in the UK and acrylic
fibre operations at Barcelona together with Hoechst's viscose and acrylic
fibre operations at Kelheim, Germany.
The joint venture will be headed by Mr Patrick White as chief executive.
