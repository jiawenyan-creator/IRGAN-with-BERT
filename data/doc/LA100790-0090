COLUMN ON SHERIFF GATES CAME AS BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
Dana Parsons' column on Brad Gates ("For Sheriff Who Would Be Sun King, It's 
All Too Shady," Sept. 30) was like a breath of fresh air to my Sunday morning. 
I'm glad to learn that I'm not the only human being in Orange County who 
believes that Gates' lease has run out, that it's time for the people to 
repossess that office he so ungraciously occupies. 
As one who recovered damages for Gates' unlawful conduct (in 1987, four others 
and I received $375,000 due to Gates' unwarranted investigations and 
harassments), I know that a settlement or a verdict always brings ambivalent 
feelings. 
First, one is gratified to be shown to have been right -- right guys do not pay 
wrong guys $375,000 (or any other greater or lesser sum) to settle cases. 
However, one then realizes that the money comes from the pockets of the 
taxpayers, whose only error was in electing the likes of Gates, and the victory 
is not as sweet as it should have been. 
I suggest that in the case of the Ritter brothers, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors has been presented a golden opportunity to dispense a little real 
justice. The board can refuse to pay any portion of any punitive-damages 
judgment that is rendered against the sheriff. 
Make Brad pay every dime from that $1.6 million worth of real estate he's 
acquired while sheriff, or borrow it from some of those guys he gave gun 
permits to. After all, it was not the taxpayers who created, nurtured and 
benefited from the "Gates Gun Club." So, why shouldn't Gates pony up the 
damages, handle the downside as well as he has obviously handled the upside? 
The board, as ramrod straight as wet spaghetti where the sheriff is concerned, 
will have to be prompted and nudged by the voters on an issue like this, but 
even less courageous politicians have been moved to do even braver things by 
the voice of the people.
