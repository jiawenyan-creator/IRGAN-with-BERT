  [Text] Moscow, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Russia and China have 
established new relationships based on normal cooperation, said 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Vladimirovich Kozyrev today. 
  Kozyrev made the remarks in an interview with the ITAR-TASS 
News Agency when he was flying home Sunday [30 January] morning 
from an official visit to China, during which he held talks with 
his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen on the development of 
bilateral relations. 
  He said the relations between the two nations are now more 
than normal, as border trade and cooperation in economy, 
military technology and other areas are making headway. 
  But still there are new areas to be tapped for bilateral 
cooperation, the Russian minister noted. 
  Kozyrev also said it is possible for the two powers to 
coordinate their interests in Asia and worldwide.
