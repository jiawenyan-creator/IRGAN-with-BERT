FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: National Express offer oversubscribed
Strong interest from private investors has led to an oversubscription of the
offer for sale of shares in National Express, Britain's biggest coach
company.
Details of the allocation will be announced today, but it is likely that
some applications, particularly the larger ones, will have to be scaled
down.
Dealings in the shares begin on Thursday December 10.
