  [Text] While Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] threatens 
to pursue its attacks against Israel to avenge the Hebron 
massacre, some of its senior members in the Gaza Strip have been 
maintaining a secret channel of communications with senior IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] officers. 
  Over the weekend, IDF sources disclosed that the meetings 
were being held as part of the talks officers have been holding 
with all factions in the Gaza Strip, including the rejectionist 
organizations, in a bid to ascertain the local mood on the eve 
of the IDF's pullout. 
  One such meeting was held last Friday between 45-year-old 
Ahmad Bakr, a prominent Hamas member, and Brigadier General 
Doron Almog, commander of IDF troops in the Gaza Strip. The 
meeting took place a few hours before the murderous attack in 
'Afula. Bakr, a resident of Gaza's al-Shaykh Radwan 
neighborhood, is the director of the Islamic Society in the Gaza 
Strip, a Hamas ideologue, and was one of the 400-odd men 
deported to Lebanon. 
  Bakr told Brig. Gen. Almog that although Hamas opposes the 
autonomy it will not attack it and may even cooperate with its 
elected representatives. Bakr added that Hamas does not plan to 
attack the Palestinian policemen. "They are our brothers and 
cousins, and we will not hurt them," he said. 
  [A report by Fayiz 'Abbas on page 11 of the same paper notes 
that on 9 April the family of Fadiya Shalbi, an Israeli Arab 
woman from the village of Iksal who was killed in the 'Afula 
attack, got a phone call. On the line was a man, who said: "I 
am speaking from Hamas headquarters in the Gaza Strip. I would 
like to express my sorrow and condolences and to apologize to 
you." When asked to identify himself, the man hung up.]
