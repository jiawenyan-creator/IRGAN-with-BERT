FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann warns of decline
MANNESMANN, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday reported a 1
per cent improvement in group sales to DM24.1bn (Dollars 14.6bn) and said
profits for 1991 did not reach the same level as in the previous year.
It gave no indication of the scale of the profits fall, saying only that the
group had suffered from the impact of weaker economic conditions worldwide
on the demand for capital goods and because of the costs associated with the
development of its D2 mobile telephone network - estimated by some brokers
to be as much as DM350m last year.
The statement was the latest in a series of gloomy announcements from the
company, which reported a 27 per cent drop in after-tax profits after six
months of 1991 and a further fall after nine months. Analysts expect
earnings per share to fall to DM16 in 1991 from DM25.5 in 1990, when net
profit was DM464m.
The group blamed the profits fall on the costs of developing the D2 system,
plus the effects of a general fall in demand for mechanical engineering
products (which hit the Rexroth hydraulics and linear motion engineering in
particular) and development costs in its auto-components subsidiary.
It said profits actually rose at the parent company level (again by an
unquantified amount) and that orders for 1991 at DM25.29bn were virtually
the same as in the previous year.
