FT  18 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Sweden
Sweden takes a leaf out of the UK's book this week with its first auction of
index-linked government bonds. It is tempting to conclude that the fashion
is spreading, although previous attempts by Canada and Australia to get
index-linked markets going have not met with conspicuous success. Sweden has
spent some time preparing its issue, but the suspicion remains that the
timing is determined by a combination of the high cost of fixed-rate
borrowing and a heavy funding requirement. The budget deficit is more than
11 per cent of GDP; after last year's heavy recourse to overseas markets,
the authorities are now focusing more on domestic investors.
Since Swedish inflation is below 2 per cent and the yield on 10-year bonds
is more than 8 per cent, the government may consider index-linked borrowing
is attractive. The issue is in some ways a statement of defiance. It can be
seen as a signal that the markets are wrong to mistrust the authorities'
determination to keep inflation down.
The chances are that the SKr20bn of 20-year paper on offer will find a home
among domestic buyers, including institutions seeking to match their
longer-term liabilities. Lack of liquidity may deter international buyers,
even though there is a theoretical trading appeal. Since the Swedish paper
will carry no coupon, its value will be particularly geared to changes in
real interest rates. And since real yields in Sweden have risen strongly in
the recent bond market shake-out, the chances are that they will soon be
coming down.
