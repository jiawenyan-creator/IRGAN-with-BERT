The Milwaukee Brewers and six other major league baseball teams will 
participate this year in a study to determine the health effects of smokeless 
tobacco. 
The Brewers also were involved last year in the study, which is part of a 
three-year effort by researchers at UC San Francisco. 
Paul Jacobs, the Brewers' physician, said baseball players make good guinea 
pigs because they are among the most prolific users of chewing tobacco and 
snuff.
