NBC TOP NETWORK LAST SEASON; 'ROSEANNE' TIES 'COSBY' AS NO. 1 SERIES; 
TELEVISION: FIGURES SHOW A MYSTERIOUS DROP-OFF IN NUMBER OF HOMES TUNING INTO 
BIG 3. 
NBC was the top network for the 1989-90 television season, it was a split 
decision between "The Cosby Show" and "Roseanne" for No. 1 series, and there 
was a mysterious drop-off in general television viewing, according to 
end-of-season figures released Tuesday. 
The 30-week prime time season ended Sunday with NBC way out in front, posting 
its fifth consecutive win with a 14.6 rating and a 24 share, according to the 
A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC was second with a 12.9 rating and a 21 share, and CBS was 
third with a 12.2 and a 20 share. 
In evening news, ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings was the new 
champ, with a 10.9 rating, with "CBS Evening News" with Dan Rather demoted to 
second with a 10.0 rating. "NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw was third with a 
9.9 rating. 
The question of which show was on top of the list was a matter of whether or 
not you counted a "Roseanne" episode broadcast outside of its regular time 
period. NBC and ABC called the win for ABC's "Roseanne," while CBS gave it to 
NBC's "The Cosby Show." 
"It's no surprise," said Bob Niles, NBC vice president of research, in 
announcing the season-end statistics at a news conference. 
The three-network share of homes using television -- HUT levels -- was down 
from the 1988-89 figure of 67%. 
David Poltrack, CBS senior vice president of planning and research called the 
decline "unprecedented and unexplained" and said CBS was pressing Nielsen for 
more data. 
The top new program for the season that aired six or more times was ABC's 
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which had a 20.9 rating and a 32 share. 
"Twin Peaks" on ABC won as most-watched made-for-television movie. Top 
miniseries of two or more parts was ABC's "Small Sacrifices." The most-watched 
theatrical movie was "Lethal Weapon" on NBC. The Academy Awards on ABC won as 
top entertainment special. 
Outside of prime time, CBS was the daytime winner, with "The Young and the 
Restless" topping the chart. In morning programming, ABC's "Good Morning 
America" was top-rated, with NBC's "Today" show falling off after Deborah 
Norville replaced Jane Pauley. CBS was third.
