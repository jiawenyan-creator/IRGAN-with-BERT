  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan's first civilian 
anti-narcotics group was established in Taipei Saturday [14 May] 
with Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou witnessing the kick-off 
ceremony. 
  At the ceremony inaugurating the Republic of China [ROC] 
Anti-Drug Promotion Group, Ma said that the work against 
narcotics should be deeply rooted in people's minds, and that it 
depends on both government and civilian efforts. 
  He said the anti-drug movement must be jointly pushed by 
both 
government and people, since the moet powerful weapons against 
illegal drugs are in the hands of citizens themselves. 
  Executive director of the newly-established group Liu 
Chang-luen said he and group members will take concrete actions 
over a long period of time in line with Premier Lien Chan's 
policy of combining government and civilian efforts in a war 
against drugs. 
  Those attending the inauguration ceremony at the Taipei 
international convention center included Vice Justice Minister 
Lin Hsi-hu, Legislator Rau Ying-chi, and National Assemblyman 
Tsai Chung-chi.
