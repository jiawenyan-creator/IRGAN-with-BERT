Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese on 8 February publishes on page 8 a 180-word 
unattributed article on an operation conducted on 5 February in 
Parana State, where the Federal Police seized 54 kg of pure 
cocaine, "the largest seizure ever in this state." It notes 
that the drugs were smuggled into Brazil by plane from Pedro 
Juan Caballero, Paraguay. The article adds that the police 
seized the drugs, bound for Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do 
Sul, as the Cessna aircraft landed at a clandestine airstrip in 
Mangueirinha, 360 km from Curitiba, and arrested drug 
traffickers Oscar Anibal Santa Cruz, 30, a Paraguayan; and the 
Brazilians Rubens Gonzales Benitez, 34, William Moreira de 
Oliveira, 36, and Domiciano Alves de Oliveira Neto, 22.
