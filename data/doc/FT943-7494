FT  23 AUG 94 / Technology: Drugs prices pressure
Companies that pioneer new pharmaceutical products are being caught up much
more quickly by their competitors than in previous years, according to a
report* by Datamonitor.
To try to offset this declining exclusivity, they are developing drugs more
quickly. Zeneca of the UK, for example, is consistently achieving its target
of administering drugs to human volunteers within 14 months of synthesis,
compared with 30 months previously.
In the days when there was more time before the arrival of 'me-too'
products, SmithKline Beecham's anti-ulcer drug Tagamet was on the market for
eight years before the launch of Glaxo's Zantac. But Glaxo's anti-nausea
compound Zofran was on the market for only a year before SmithKline Beecham
launched its rival Kytril.
The increased competition has put more rapid pressure on prices, says
Datamonitor, which expects only sluggish volume growth in the market for the
rest of this decade.
This pressure will be accentuated by increased exposure to non-patented
generic competition. By December 1997, there will be Dollars 10bn (Pounds
6.4bn) worth of sales within the portfolios of 14 US pharmaceuticals
companies subject to generic competition.
More than half the top 50 drugs in the US will lose patent protection over
the next four years.
Prices can fall as much as 70 per cent within 18 months of patent expiry.
Those categories most exposed to generic competition are anti-
hypertensives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories for arthritis and pain;
anxiolytics; and B-2 stimulants for asthma.
Companies will try to offset patent expiries, when they can, by launching
over-the-counter, non-prescription versions.
