FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Reynolds warns on deals with
Unionists
MR ALBERT Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said yesterday that he would
be 'very concerned' if efforts to renew the political talks process in
Northern Ireland were to be undermined by any deals done at Westminster
between the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionist party, Tim Coone writes.
Last week, the Unionists backtracked on a general election pledge and voted
with the government on the social chapter vote, leading most observers to
conclude - in spite of official denials - that a deal had been done
involving a proposal to establish a Northern Ireland select committee at
Westminster.
Mr Reynolds emphasised that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement gives the Irish
government the right to be consulted on Northern Ireland matters.
He said that Dublin would view any unilateral moves by the British
government on the future governance of the province as a breach of the
agreement.
But he said also that he accepted a assurances that no deal had been done.
