FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Compaq suffers parts shortage
COMPAQ Computer, the US personal computer maker, said in a filing with the
US Securities and Exchange Commission it expects its third-quarter revenues
and profits to be hurt by parts shortages for some of its products, Reuter
reports.
Compaq introduced several notebook, desktop and server products in June and
said the initial response has been 'excellent.'
Compaq said the lower prices for the products will substantially lower the
company's average unit selling price.
