Docket Number: 

94051. 

Applicant: 

University of Maryland, Institute for Plasma Research, College Park, MD 20742. 

Instrument: 

Glass Tubes with Coated Tin Oxide Thin Film Inside. 

Manufacturer: 

Beijing Vacuum Electronics Institute, China. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for studies of a glass tube coated with thin film of resistive material inside. An electron
beam passing through such a tube is subject to longitudinal instability. The instrument measures the spacial growth
rate of the instability and allows study of the beam quality deterioration. In addition, the instrument will be used
in the course ``Theory and Design of Charged Particle Beams'' to train Ph.D's. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

April 19, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94052. 

Applicant: 

The University of Texas Health Science Center, Medical School Building, 6431 Fannin Street, Houston, TX 77030. 

Instrument: 

Manipulators, Ball Joints, and Magnetic Stands. 

Manufacturer: 

Narishige, Japan. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for studies of the marine mollusc, 

Tritonia diomedea. 

During these studies: (1) the clamps will be used for positioning of a fiber optic light source and positioning a meta
barrier between microelectrodes, (2) the ball joints will be used to hold a suction apparatus and hold a fine thermistor
for measurement of the bath temperature and (3) the magnetic bases will be used for securing the clamps.

Docket Number: 

94053. 

Applicant: 

University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1675 University Blvd., Birmingham, AL 35249. 

Instrument: 

Mass Spectrometer, Model Optima. 

Manufacturer: 

Fisons Instruments, United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to analyze biological samples for deuterium and oxygen-18 enrichment in experiments
conducted to understand the role of energy expenditure and physical activity in weight gain using several models
of weight gain. The instrument will also be used for educational purposes by training Ph.D students, postdoctoral
research fellows, clinical nutrition fellows, and other faculty in the techniques of isotope ratio mass spectrometry
and doubly labeled water. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

April 19, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94058. 

Applicant: 

US EPA, EMSL Cincinnati, 26 Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45268. 

Instrument: 

Electrothermal Vaporization Unit and Interface Upgrade. 

Manufacturer: 

Fisons Instruments, United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to evaluate background or inherent metal concentrations in environmental samples (river,
estuarine and open ocean), where it is difficult to access the impact of trace metal pollution because of the dilution.
Experiments will focus on collecting data that will determine the appropriate analytical configuration to be used
in determining the analyte for environmental monitoring. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

April 26, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94059. 

Applicant: 

Louisiana Tech University, Institute for Micromanufacturing, Corner of Arizona  College Street, Ruston,
LA 71272. 

Instrument: 

Deep X-ray Lithography Scanner. 

Manufacturer: 

Jenotik, GmbH, Germany. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to study deep x-ray lithography using PMMA resists in order to develop the necessary processes
for fabrication of microstructures using x-ray radiation. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

April 29, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94060. 

Applicant: 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139. 

Instrument: 

Triaxial Deformation Apparatus for testing rocks at high temperature and pressure. 

Manufacturer: 

Paterson Instruments Pty, Ltd., Australia. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for research in earth sciences for measuring a variety of physical properties in rocks
7-15 mm in diameter, up to 40 mm in length, at 1400
&cir;C and with confining pressures and pore fluid pressure independently maintained up to 700 MPa. Specific research
projects include:


(1) Quantitative Observation of the Micromechanics of the Brittle-Ductile Transition in Rocks,


 (2) Brittle-Ductile Transition in Serpentinite and Peridotite Rocks,


 (3) Permeability Changes in Silicate Rocks,


 (4) Effects of Deformation on Ar Retention in Minerals and


 (5) Strength Variations Along Faults with Fluids.

Docket Number: 

94061. 

Applicant: 

Saint Louis University, Department of Earth  Atmospheric Sciences, 3507 Laclede Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63103.


Instrument: 

Two Seismometers, Model STS-2. 

Manufacturer: 

G. Streckeisen, Switzerland. 

Intended Use: 

The instruments will be used for continuous monitoring of earthquake activity in the central United States and around
the world. Experiments will be conducted to record earthquakes and to deduce from those recordings the source characteristics
of those earthquakes and to study the properties of the earth through which seismic waves pass. In addition, the instruments
will be used in the course GEO-A472: Seismological Instrumentation in which students will learn about the operation
of seismograph systems in order to understand the data they produce. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs:

Instrument: 

Fluorometer, Model Aquatracka. 

Manufacturer: 

Chelsea Instruments, Ltd., United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for spatial and temporal surveys of microscopic algae in the coastal waters off New Jersey.
