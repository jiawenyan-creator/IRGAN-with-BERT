FT  30 SEP 93 / West country finds a united trade voice
A PARTNERSHIP of the public and private sectors in Devon and Cornwall was
launched yesterday to promote the economic interests of south-west England.
The Westcountry Development Corporation, whose chief executive is Mr Mike
Boxall, aims to provide a forum for a co-ordinated economic strategy. A
similar body, the Western Development Partnership, was set up this summer
for the county of Avon. The two groups reflect a growing belief among
business and political leaders in south-west England that the region has
suffered from the lack of a united voice.
Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of the WDC and managing director of Dartington
Crystal, said the WDC's aim was 'to generate long-term sustainable
prosperity'. It sought to create jobs, increase income levels, promote
established industries and attract inward investment.
The WDC will also pump-prime projects designed to stimulate the local
economy and lobby the government and European Commission on such issues as
regional aid.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said yesterday he would announce within
the next few weeks the UK government's proposed new map for EC structural
funds. 'It could mean good news for the two counties,' he said.
Devon and Cornwall have suffered from declining trends in agriculture,
fishing, tourism and the defence industry. Cornwall in particular has a high
unemployment rate and the gross domestic product per head is only 76 per
cent of the UK average.
