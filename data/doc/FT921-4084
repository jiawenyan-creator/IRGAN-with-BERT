FT  11 MAR 92 / Greenspan ready to pay intereston reserves
MR ALAN GREENSPAN, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, yesterday urged
Congress to give the US central bank the authority to pay interest on the
reserves that banks must hold at the Fed.
Mr Greenspan's request, expressed in a letter to Mr Steve Neal, chairman of
the House of Representatives subcommittee on domestic monetary policy, comes
just a few weeks after the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement
for banks from 12 to 10 per cent of their balances.
Although a technical matter, the treatment of reserve requirements is seen
by analysts as a tool that Mr Greenspan can use to help banks o bolster bank
profitability at a time when the crisis in commercial real estate has caused
heavy bad debt provisions at many banks.
The Fed chief argued yesterday that paying interest to banks on what are
known as 'sterile reserves' would benefit the US banking system. Mr
Greenspan said if the Fed had been able to pay interest on such balances it
would not have been necessary last month to lower the reserve requirement to
10 per cent.
'It would have been preferable to have kept the reserve ratio at 12 per cent
and to pay interest on required reserve balances than to take the ratio to
10 per cent without paying interest,' Mr Greenspan said.
The lower reserve requirement could induce 'undesirable volatility' in the
Federal funds market if the required balances were to fall too low, he said.
