FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Continental Air calls for 10%
pay reductions
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the largest of the US carriers operating under the
protection of the US bankruptcy courts, confirmed yesterday that it is
asking employees to take an average 10 per cent pay cut.
The debt-burdened carrier said the reductions would take effect around June
30.
Continental blamed the cuts on the domestic fare wars in April and May,
suggesting the airline industry's revenues overall would be about Dollars
4bn lower this year as a result. Continental claims the pay reductions would
prune over Dollars 100m from its annual expense bill.
