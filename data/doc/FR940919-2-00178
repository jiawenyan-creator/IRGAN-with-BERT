 

As required by 49 CFR section 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that BMW has provided adequate reasons for its belief
that the modified antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information BMW provided
on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests conducted by BMW for the
antitheft device and its components. 

49 CFR section 543.9(h)(2)(ii) permits the agency to establish an effective date for the modification of the antitheft
device earlier than ``the model year following the model year in which NHTSA issued the modification decision'' upon
a showing of good cause by the manufacturer that an earlier effective date for modifying its exemption is consistent
with the public interest and purposes of 49 U.S.C. section 33106. In its petition, BMW stated that making the modification
of its antitheft system effective beginning with MY 1995 is in the public interest since it would permit expeditious
manufacture and sale of vehicles with the modified antitheft system as standard equipment. BMW stated the 1989 theft
data published by NHTSA in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 7444, February 22, 1991) show that the BMW 7 Car line had a theft rate of 3.9505 per thousand vehicles stolen, somewhat
above the 1983/84 median theft rate of 3.2712. BMW stated its belief that the antitheft device proposed for the MY 1995
7 Car line, with improvements that enhance the effectiveness of the antitheft system, will lower the 7 Car line's theft
rate. NHTSA has reviewed this showing of ``good cause'' and finds that making the modification of BMW's petition effective
beginning with the 1995 model year is consistent with the public interest and 49 U.S.C. section 33106. 

For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the BMW 7 Car line that is the subject of this notice, in whole,
from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541. 

If, in the future, BMW decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it should formally
notify the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements under
49 CFR section 541.5 and section 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts). 

The agency notes that the limited and apparently conflicting data on the effectiveness of the pre-standard parts
marking programs continue to make it difficult to compare the effectiveness of an antitheft device with the effectiveness
of compliance with the theft prevention standard. The statute clearly invites such a comparison, which the agency
has made on the basis of the limited data available. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft
Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates more probative data upon which comparisons may be made. 

NHTSA notes that if BMW wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company may have
to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Part 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to vehicles
that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption
is based. Further, section 543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit
the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.'' 

The agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which section 543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted vehicle
manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification
petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes
could be 

de minimis. 

Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be
characterized as 

de minimis,

 it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to modify.
