  [Text] Bucharest, February 16 (XINHUA) -- Romania and 
Croatia today urged the international community and warring 
sides in Bosnia to continue their efforts of peace to solve the 
conflict in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  This call was made by Romanian President Ion Iliescu and his 
Croat counterpart Franjo Tudjman at a joint press conference 
here. 
  The two leaders said they do not want to see the NATO plan 
for air strikes on Bosnian Serbs become a reality. 
  Iliescu said resorting to force could not help solve any 
problem and, on the contrary, will befoul the political 
atmosphere and hinder efforts to solve the problem. 
  Tudjman said air strikes will result in more casualties and 
escalate the conflict. He hoped Romania will play an important 
role in seeking a political solution. 
  Tudjman ended his three-day visit here on Wednesday. During 
the visit, the two countries signed a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation and one on trucking and scientific research 
cooperations.
