FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Perpetual trebles to Pounds 16.5m
Pre-tax profits at Perpetual, the unit trust management group, trebled to
Pounds 16.5m for the half year to March 31, compared with Pounds 5.09m.
The company benefited from the good performance of world stock markets in
the last quarter of 1993, accompanied by strong unit trust sales.
Funds under management increased to Pounds 2.87bn, against Pounds 2.03bn,
after an inflow of about Pounds 700m of net new money.
Earnings per share rose from 13.28p to 43.6p, or 39.24p fully diluted, while
the interim dividend is 10p (1.8p) - the total for the full year to
September 1993 was 15p.
'With increased funds under management, fees in the second half will, in the
absence of a serious setback, be significantly higher than in the first
half', said Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman.
Marketing expenditure was increased during the half year, in order to
increase market share, but Mr Arbib said that no further rise in marketing
expenditure was planned. Although this might lead to a downturn in sales
volume, it should be possible to match the first half results in the second
period, he said.
The company, based in Henley-on-Thames, is considering acquiring larger
offices to give space for further development.
