FT  07 SEP 93 / France's economy stays on course for recovery
HOPES that 1994 will be a year of recovery for the troubled French economy
were strengthened yesterday by confirmation from the government that it
expects growth of 1.4 per cent in gross domestic product next year.
The Economy Ministry, which is finalising plans for the 1994 budget due to
be completed by September 22, is sticking to the growth forecast it made in
June. However, this 1.4 per cent figure conceals changes in the underlying
state of the economy.
Consumer expenditure is expected to rise more slowly than initially forecast
because the recent reductions in interest rates have been too slight to
restore consumer confidence. By contrast, the ministry has upgraded its
forecast for exports to 3.2 per cent growth due to the recent fall in the
value of the French franc.
The ministry's cautious confidence was reinforced by the publication of a
small business survey by La Tribune, the economic newspaper, which showed
that France's small and medium-sized companies, which have borne the brunt
of the recession, are less pessimistic about the economic out-look.
More than half of the companies surveyed believed that the economic
situation had stabilised, against just 5 per cent in a previous study made
in April. Only 42 per cent said that the climate had worsened, compared with
81 per cent in April.
Meanwhile, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday agreed to link
a possible reduction in overall working hours more closely with provisions
to make labour patterns more flexible, in order to make the government's
proposed five-year employment programme more palatable to the unions.
The draft law will go to parliament later this month.
At the end of a nine-hour meeting with unions and employers yesterday, Mr
Balladur stressed his desire for the two sides of industry 'to negotiate
wherever possible, rather than to have rules imposed on them'.
