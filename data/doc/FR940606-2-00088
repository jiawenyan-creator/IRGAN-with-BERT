I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



As provided in Exchange Rule 24.2, ``Designation of the Index,''
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 the CBOE proposes to list for trading options on the Israeli Index (``Index''). The text of the proposed rule change
is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. 



<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
Exchange Rule 24.2 provides, in part, that the Commission must approve a particular index upon which options are traded.


</FOOTNOTE>


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled, European-style
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 index options on the Israeli Index (``Index''). The Index will initially consist of fourteen stocks issued by Israeli
companies, and one American Depositary Receipt (``ADR'')
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 overlying an Israeli company.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 According to the Exchange, no proxy for the performance of the Israeli economy is currently available in the U.S. derivative
markets. Therefore, the Exchange believes, options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating
in the performance of the Israeli economy or to hedge against the risk of investing in that economy. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
European-style options can only be exercised during a specified period before the options expire. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
An American Depositary Receipt is a negotiable receipt which is issued by a depositary, generally a bank, representing
shares of a foreign issuer that have been deposited and are held, on behalf of holders of the ADRs, at a custodian bank
in the foreign issuer's home country. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The component securities of the Index are: Biotechnology General Corp.; Comverse Technology Inc.; Fourth Dimension
Software Ltd.; ECI Telecom Ltd.; Elbit Ltd.; Elron Electronic Industries Ltd.; Geotek Industries Inc.; IIS Intelligent
Information Systems Ltd.; Lannet Data Communications Ltd.; Orbotech Ltd.; Scitex Corp. Ltd.; Sapiens International
Corp.; Tadiran Ltd.; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (ADR); and Teledata Communication Ltd. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Index Design 



One of the components of the Index currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange and fourteen (including one ADR representing
11.37% of the weight of the Index as of March 31, 1994) currently are National Market securities traded through the
facilities of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System (``NASDAQ''). The
14 nonADR components of the Index are listed for trading only in the United States, and for the ADR component,
more than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for the ADR and the underlying security occurs in the U.S. through
NASDAQ.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Exchange believes that options on the Index should not raise the types of surveillance concerns
that may be raised by options on an index of non-U.S. traded stocks.
