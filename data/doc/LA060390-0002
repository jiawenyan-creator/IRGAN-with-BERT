OUTTAKES: DOUBLE DOORS 
When Oliver Stone's "The Doors" wraps late this month, Val Kilmer may not be 
turning in the black leather pants he wears as lead singer Jim Morrison. The 
reason: Kilmer and the rest of the "group" may reprise their roles -- as 
supporting characters -- if "Wild Child" (formerly "Wonderland Avenue") begins 
filming this summer. 
That's the word from a source close to "Wild Child," which details a young 
man's coming-of-age in the frenzied rock world. Stone, executive producer of 
"Wild Child" for Carolco Pictures, didn't want to comment on the double 
casting. "He feels it's too premature. They haven't even signed a director," 
says a spokeswoman. 
But we're tipped that shooting is expected to begin when "The Doors" wraps, 
with Doors "members" Kilmer, Kyle MacLachlan, Kevin Dillon and Frank Whaley -- 
and Meg Ryan (who plays Morrison's common-law wife) -- back in character. 
Written by Desmond Nakano, "Wild Child" is based on the autobiographical tome 
by Danny Sugerman, who was 13 when he began hanging out at the Doors' L.A. 
office. Pat H. Broeske
