  [Text] Zhengzhou, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Central China's 
Henan Province has opened its doors wider to the outside, in a 
bid to attract overseas investment and technology. 
  Now, it has opened 25 cities and 88 counties and established 
ties with over 140 countries and regions. 
  In 1993, the province received over 5,400 foreign guests 
from 
some 60 countries, such as the United States, Japan and Republic 
of Korea. Among them, 220 were important officials who came to 
investigate the investment environment. 
  For example, during his visit, Goh Keng Swee, former 
vice-premier of Singapore, reached tentative agreement with 
relevant departments on several projects involving foodstuffs, 
power and housing industries. 
  So far, 17 cities in the province have sister counterparts 
in 
six countries and regions, such as Australia, Romania and 
Kazakhstan. 
  Their friendly relations are mainly based on economic 
cooperation.
