MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Days of Thunderous Hype: Tom Cruise isn't slowing down in his quest to pump 
some box-office gas into his "Days of Thunder" film. He appeared Sunday on 
"Hangin' With Hollywood," a national teen radio show on KIIS-FM (102.7) hosted 
by Hollywood Hamilton. 
Cruise, who reportedly had not done many radio interviews in hyping his 
previous films, is turning to the medium more and more to publicize the film, 
which is receiving a less-than-thunderous reception from audiences and critics. 
The star talked extensively with Hamilton, but refused to discuss his breakup 
with wife Mimi Rogers or his current involvement with "Days" co-star Nicole 
Kidman. Cruise told how he deals with fans who follow him around while he's 
driving in his black Porsche: "I either pull over and give them the autograph, 
or I lose them." GREG BRAXTON
