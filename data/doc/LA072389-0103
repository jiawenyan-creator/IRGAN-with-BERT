MAN ARRESTED IN KILLING OF COLLEGE TENNIS PLAYER 
A Highland Park man suspected in the killing of college tennis player David 
Young and seriously injuring another man, was arrested Saturday and a gun 
believed to have been the murder weapon was recovered, officers said. 
Eric Beauchamp, 21, was booked into the Pasadena city jail on suspicion of 
killing Young and wounding Young's friend, Alan Harlan, both 21 years old. 
Young and Harlan were riding a motorcycle through Pasadena about 1 a.m. 
Wednesday when they were followed by a gunman in an automobile who shot them 
and then escaped. 
Young, of San Marino, was the top-seed tennis player last year at Grossmont 
College in San Diego.
