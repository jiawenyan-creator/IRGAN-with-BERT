  [Text] Ukraine's Justice Ministry has published a statement 
on the latest developments in Crimea. The document stresses 
that Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov continues to take illegal 
actions. In particular, he issued decrees dismissing the head of 
the Crimean Security Service, General (Kolomyytsev) and Minister 
of Internal Affairs General Plyuta, and replaced them with 
others as acting officials. 
  Such actions by the president of the Republic of Crimea, the 
statement says, are not only a gross violation of Ukraine's 
legislation, international norms, and human rights, but also of 
the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea on which Yuriy 
Meshkov recently swore a presidential oath. The fundamental law 
of Crimea entitles the president only to nominate a candidate 
for the head of the security service before the autonomy's 
Supreme Council. The appointment, as well as dismissal of this 
official, is executed by the head of the Security Service of 
Ukraine. 
  As for the minister of internal affairs, this official can 
be 
appointed or dismissed by the president of the Republic of 
Crimea only with the consent of the Supreme Council of Crimea, 
stresses the statement.
