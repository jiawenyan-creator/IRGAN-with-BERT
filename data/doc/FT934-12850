FT  25 OCT 93 / Welsh business confidence grows
WELSH BUSINESSES remain optimistic in spite of clear signs that the recovery
is 'both fragile and modest', the Institute of Directors says today in its
latest bi-annual survey of the principality.
Mr Meirion Lewis, director of the institute in Wales, said: 'Although
conditions in Wales remain tight, the survey offers some glimpse of improved
company performance in Wales compared with the previous survey.
'There is some increase in profitability, a small rise in optimism and only
one in six are reporting company performance as unsatisfactory.'
The survey, which covers more than 100 companies in the principality, found
that the proportion showing a rise in business volume in the past six months
has risen sharply, with the increase most marked in manufacturing - up from
a third to 54 per cent. But nearly a third of manufacturers reported a
decline.
The number of companies reporting increased profits has almost doubled since
the previous survey, with profitability in the service sector showing
virtually no change.
Mr Lewis said that only one in eight of Welsh directors was less optimistic
than a year ago, and almost half of the directors surveyed expected improved
performance in the next six months. Half of the exporting companies were
more optimistic than they were a year ago.
There were also better prospects for employment, with 38 per cent of
manufacturers and 52 per cent of service-sector companies expecting to
increase staffing by 2 per cent during the next six months. There was a
substantial fall in the proportion of companies working at very low levels
of capacity.
