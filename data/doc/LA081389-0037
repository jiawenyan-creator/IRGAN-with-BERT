THE BARGAIN CORNER: TRANSPORTATION CARDS FOR AUSTRIA AND GREECE 
Greece and Austria have launched discount transportation cards for travelers. 
The Greek card, which must be bought in Greece, covers both rail and bus 
travel. It is good for 10, 20 or 30 days. 
During this consecutive-day time span you get unlimited second-class travel on 
the rail system and on the bus network. Passes are available for one to five 
persons. 
Based on the current value of the dollar, rates for one person are $40 for 10 
days, $60 for 20 days and $89 for 30 days. The cost for two, three or four 
persons is based on the single rate. For example, the cost of a 10-day pass for 
two people would be $80. 
For a group of five, however, the cost is $100 for 10 days, $125 for 20 days 
and $195 for 30 days. 
Overall, the discount off regular rail and bus prices is about 45%, according 
to the Greek National Tourist Organization. 
Greece also is a member of Eurail, with this pass good for unlimited rail 
travel in Greece as well as 16 other European countries. The Eurailpass also 
offers various bonuses, including ferry rides to some of the Greek islands.

The Austrian Railway Network has introduced a Rabbit Card that allows travelers 
to choose any four days out of a 10-day period for unlimited travel on its 
system. The Rabbit Card also is valid for boat trips on Lake St. Wolfgang and 
narrow-gauge trains throughout Austria. 
The pass also provides a 50% discount for boat trips on Lake Constance, and on 
all scheduled boat service on the Danube River within Austria. 
The cost of the pass is approximately $99 first-class and $68 second-class. 
Until the age of 26 you can get a junior version of the Rabbit Card for $53 
first-class and $38 second-class. 
The Rabbit Card can't be bought in the United States, but can be at major train 
stations and travel agencies in Western Europe. Payment would have to be in the 
currency of that country. 
Meanwhile, Austrian Railways has dropped its nine- and 16-day rail passes that 
were on a consecutive-day basis. You can still buy a 30-day pass, allowing 
unlimited rail travel within that period, for about $538 first-class and $238 
second-class. Austria is also part of the Eurail system.
