FT  25 JUN 94 / Premiers confident over work towards Ulster deal
The British and Irish prime ministers last night reported solid progress
towards an agreement next month on the framework for a new political
settlement in Northern Ireland.
After talks at the European Union summit in Corfu Mr John Major and Mr
Albert Reynolds offered an upbeat assessment that the outline accord would
be agreed at a summit pencilled in for around July 20.
The two prime ministers were joined at their meetings by high-ranking
officials from the Northern Ireland Office and the Irish Foreign Affairs
Ministry. Both men rejected any suggestion that Sinn Fein could secure a
place at the negotiating table by announcing a temporary ceasefire. Mr
Reynolds said: 'I want a permanent cessation of violence from both
(republican and loyalist) sides. That is what the people want and that is
what the governments want.'
Officials said the leaders had still to resolve differences over the
language in the statement on the proposed amendment of Dublin's
constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and on the establishment of new
institutions to enhance north-south co-operation.
But Mr Reynolds appeared to back away from comments earlier this week that
he was insisting that the new cross-border institutions should have
'executive powers'.
He left open the possibility that the precise powers of new all-Ireland
boards to co-ordinate policy in transport, energy, tourism and
communications could be defined in talks between Ulster's constitutional
parties.
As British and Irish officials continued drafting work on the framework
document last night Mr Major appeared to accept that the Irish government
could not scrap entirely articles two and three of its constitution.
Instead, Dublin would offer to amend the articles embodying its claim to the
North if the constitutional parties in the province reached an overall
settlement.
