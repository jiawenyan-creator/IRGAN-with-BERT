FT  13 AUG 92 / Pitfalls of putting a price on coal: Juliet Sychrava looks
at what may prove to be the most complex privatisation yet
AS THE government prepares to sell British Coal, it is becoming clear that
making money from the privatisation is not, for once, the main priority.
That is partly because British Coal is virtually impossible to value
accurately and partly because the approximate valuations look depressingly
low.
Analysts have suggested figures of less than Pounds 1bn.
British Coal has fixed assets - including 50 coal mines and plant and
machinery valued at Pounds 1.68bn - but it has Pounds 2.6bn of liabilities.
It made a profit of Pounds 170m in the year to March this year, but that
figure says virtually nothing about future profitability.
At the moment the corporation earns almost all its money by selling 65m
tonnes of coal a year to the electricity generators at special high prices
which are enshrined in the contracts put into place by the government before
the electricity industry was privatised two years ago.
Those contracts expire in March next year. The new contracts, which are
being negotiated now, are expected to be much tougher on British Coal.
The price it receives will fall from Pounds 1.85 a gigajoule - the unit of
energy from coal - to about Pounds 1.50 a gigajoule. According to estimates
from McCloskey Coal Information, the coal consultancy, had British Coal had
to sell at that price last year, it would have lost Pounds 456m.
The volume of coal in the contracts is expected to be 45m tonnes in the
first year, declining to 30m in the third year and possibly less thereafter.
British Coal has indicated that if that happens it will have to start
closing pits soon after the contracts are signed.
McCloskey estimates that might lead to nearly 30 pits closing immediately
unless the corporation can reduce its deep-mine costs further.
More pits may close to match the declining volumes in the contract.
According to one observer, only the 12 pits shortlisted last year by NM
Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government on the privatisation,
would be viable.
The new contracts will force British Coal to write down its assets, perhaps
to about Pounds 500m, because it will not be able to service them from
future income.
In addition to the difficulty of valuing British Coal while its asset and
cashflow value decline, the government faces pressing practical and
political headaches.
Closing mines is politically uncomfortable. Since the end of the 1984-85
miners' strike, 119 pits have closed and 130,000 miners have lost their
jobs.
Both the government and British Coal have said they would like to sell the
largest possible economic coal industry. If that is true, and the
corporation does not simply close all but 12 mines after the new contracts
are signed, it will have a hard time finding a trade buyer for the others.
Some mines may improve their performance given time, but a large chunk of
British Coal's deep-mine production will never be profitable. Even if
loss-making mines are sold bundled up with more profitable opencast or
surface mines, a private-sector purchaser would not carry them for long.
At the same time, the government does not want to fragment the industry too
much - British Coal needs critical mass to negotiate with the electricity
generators.
Although the present board would like British Coal to be sold intact, a
suitable, adequately large buyer would be hard to find. Picking an
international company may anger the many small British coal companies that
would like a slice of the business. Offering them, and the miners
themselves, parts of the corporation would smooth the privatisation.
There are more obscure issues that may make it hard to sell the corporation
safely. Resolving those issues is at least as important for the government
as maximising proceeds.
The first practical question is who will own the mines themselves. British
Coal owns the UK's coal reserves and leases some reserves to small mining
companies, which pay it a 'rent' or royalty.
If the government sells British Coal freehold, so that the purchaser owns
the land on which it mines coal, it will have to allow other coal companies
the option to buy their freehold. If it sells it leasehold, it will have to
decide on the value of the lease.
Then it may face the same arguments over what the royalty should be that
British Coal has faced for many years. The royalty is theoretically linked
to the value of the coal assets, and when the coal price falls, small mining
companies fight for a lower royalty.
If the government keeps the freehold, British Coal will lose the royalty of
about 40p a tonne from private deep mines and Pounds 4.50 to Pounds 5 a
tonne from opencast mines it collects today - a revenue of Pounds 14m. It
would have to pay a royalty itself, and the government would have to set up
a body to grant licences to other lessors.
The royalty question needs to be settled quickly. Small, private mining
companies are already finding it hard to plan, because they have no idea how
much future royalties will be.
Another issue is British Coal's pension funds, worth a total of about Pounds
13bn - Pounds 6.5bn each for the miners' fund and the staff fund. They have
surpluses of about Pounds 1.4bn each that would allow a future owner to take
a pension holiday worth about Pounds 100m a year.
The government will want to ensure that the funds are safe for existing
employees, which might mean closing them off or taking them over. Deciding
how to administer the funds may take time and negotiation with the miners'
unions.
British Coal's biggest liability is concessionary coal - its historical
obligation to supply miners, working or retired, with about 5 tonnes a year.
This costs it Pounds 1.62bn.
Like the pension funds, the liability could be taken on by the government
and managed separately - the corporation already gets a government grant to
cover the annual liability. But finding a body to administer the liability
might take even more time and money.
British Coal also has provisions for damage to hearing, amounting to Pounds
273m. Those could also be taken out of the company and managed, but the
question of a cut-off point arises. What happens to claims that arise after
the company is privatised, but possibly relate to earlier injuries?
The same question arises for the liability - Pounds 219m - relating to
subsidence and surface damage caused by mining. Managing that may mean
setting up another quango with an almost indefinite life.
Before the government can value or sell British Coal, it has to resolve all
those issues. All that, and the seemingly intractable matter of getting the
electricity industry to sign contracts with the company, must make it one of
the most complex privatisations ever.
