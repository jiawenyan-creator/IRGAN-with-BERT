For those satiated with pock, pock, thirtay, fortay, the Tour de France
offers wonderful relief: a long-distance bicycle race, ridden in teams,
where strategy is more important than tactics, and stamina more significant
than technique, it could hardly contrast more vividly with Wimbledon.
Channel 4's pillion coverage, helicopter shots, analysis and background is
usually spot on (8.30).
'Sharing the experience of being face to face with a rare animal wins
people's hearts for conservation,' we are assured by the makers of In The
Wild. Timothy Dalton (one of Sean Connery's locums in the Bond movies) sets
out to find a wild North American wolf. He flies to Alaska, meets eskimo
hunters, fails to see a wolf, but finally, 1,000 miles into the Arctic,
comes across an entire pack (9.00 ITV).
Panorama considers the pickle that the Roman Catholic Church finds itself in
now that so many priests are leaving to get married, fathering children
without leaving, or becoming involved in a variety of other scandals (9.30
BBC1). The Last Laugh is a tribute to the late Les Dawson, a standup
comedian capable of poetry (10.10 BBC1).
