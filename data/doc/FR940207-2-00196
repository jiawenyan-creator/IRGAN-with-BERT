Notice of Intent.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that a Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a
proposed transportation project in Kern County, California. The Tier 1 EIS is intended to satisfy requirements for
environmental evaluation of route location and right-of-way acquisition for corridor protection. Prior to facility
construction, Tier 2 project-specific environmental document(s) will be prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), will prepare a Tier 1 Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) to identify a route and protect a corridor for Route 58 between Interstate 5 and State Route
99, a distance of 32.2 kilometers (20 miles), in Kern County and the City of Bakersfield. Existing Route 58 within the
project limits is a two-lane conventional highway from I5 to Allen Road, a four-lane conventional highway
from Allen Road to SR 99, and a four-lane freeway east of SR 99. Existing development along the present roadway alignment
constrains opportunities to upgrade to freeway standards and to accommodate additional travel modes. The existing
facility operates at Level of Service (LOS) C to E, and is expected to decline to LOS D to F by year 2010. Additional capacity
is needed to meet future travel demand in the transportation corridor.





Alternatives under consideration are: (1) The ``No-Project'' alternative; (2) a Transportation Systems Management
alternative providing low cost, incremental improvements; (3) a Mass Transit Alternative providing commuter/light
rail and or bus transit; (4) the Seventh Standard alternative, a 32.2 kilometer (20 mile) corridor parallel to Seventh
Standard Road; (5) the Rosedale Highway alternative, a 29 kilometer (18 mile) corridor primarily parallel to and
approximately 0.4 kilometer (one-fourth mile) from Rosedale Highway; and (6) the Kern River alternative, a 24.1
kilometer (15 mile) corridor north of the Kern River and Stockdale Highway. The roadway alternative used for route
planning purposes and right-of-way corridor definition consists of an eight-lane freeway with an 18.3 meter (60-foot)
median and 3.1 meter (10-foot) shoulder. This corridor width would also accommodate a six-lane freeway with capacity
for a transit or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) facility. Access control and interchanges with existing highways and
local streets are included in determining the corridor examined.
