  [Text] Taipei, April 13 (CNA) -- Four Taiwan legislators 
left for the Netherlands Wednesday [13 April] to sue the United 
Nations in the International Court of Justice in the Hague for 
refusing Taiwan entry into the world body. 
  The four-member group, headed by Chen Tze-nan, deputy 
convener of the legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic 
Progressive Party [DPP], will also visit Geneva, where they will 
ask the UN Commission on Hunan Rights to condemn Beijing for its 
callous handling of the Qiandao Lake disaster in southeastern 
China, in which 24 Taiwan tourists died. 
  The three other members in the group are [first name 
indistinct] Chang and [first name indistinct] Chen of the DPP 
and Tsai Chung-han of the ruling Kuomintang. 
  Chen said prior to his departure that the group will ask the 
Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, which is based 
at the Hague, an "alternative United Nations" founded in the 
Netherlands in 1991 by ethnic minorities and peoples seeking 
independence, to file the lawsuit in the international court on 
behalf of Taiwan. 
  "It is a fact that Taiwan is a sovereign country, and it is 
unreasonable for the United Nations to keep us out," Chen 
explained. 
  Mainland China took Taiwan's UN seat in 1971 and has since 
blocked Taipei's attempts to regain membership in the world 
organization. Last September, the UN General Assembly, under 
pressure from Beijing, rejected a proposal by 10 Central 
American countries to have the body discuss UN membership for 
Taiwan. 
  "Our move mainly aims to arouse the attention of 
international news media to how unreasonably Beijing has blocked 
Taiwan's movements on the world stage," Chen stressed.
