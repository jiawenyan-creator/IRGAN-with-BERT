  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 27 May (INA) -- Two Iraqi newspapers 
have lashed out vehemently at the anti-Iraq fabrications made by 
the servant of the Jews and Americans, the vile and obtuse King 
Fahd, while addressing pilgrims last Tuesday [24 May]. 
  The two papers agreed that Fahd's history is a natural 
outcome of the bad manners of his family and that his statements 
reflect the dirty Saudi behavior that is smeared in the mud of 
collusion with the Americans. 
  In its editorial today, AL-THAWRAH, speaking for the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party, says: It is not strange that King Fahd 
should fabricate lies against Iraq and its people, since this is 
only part of the conduct of the Saudi family and what is known 
of its history as an agent of U.S. imperialism since it was 
brought to occupy Najd and Hejaz in suspect circumstances. 
  The paper notes the latest treasonous stand that exposes 
Fahd, namely his hostility to Yemen's unity since its 
establishment and his efforts to divide the ranks of the 
Yemenis. Fahd sought, through his ambassador in Washington, to 
internationalize the crisis in this fraternal country in a 
pro-separatist attempt. This shows Fahd's inveterate grudge 
against the nation's unity and his endeavor to strike at the new 
Yemeni awakening. [passage omitted] 
  In its editorial today, AL-'IRAQ says the speech of the 
feeble-minded Fahd should be pitied. The Iraqis are an 
experienced, hard-working people who are known for heroism and 
courage in the battlefield. They are leading the faithful to 
win the satisfaction of God and his prophet. The discordant 
voice coming from the land of Najd and Hejaz is not the voice of 
the son of the land of holy places that has a glorious history 
and civilization. It is the voice of the Americans and Zionists 
whose flag is fluttering over the holy land thanks to this 
discordant voice. [passage omitted]
