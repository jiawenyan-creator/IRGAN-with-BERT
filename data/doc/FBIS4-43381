  [Text] The cease-fire agreement for Rwanda was formally 
announced a moment ago during the closing ceremony of the OAU 
summit in Tunis. The agreement envisions dialogue and 
negotiation as the means to settle the conflict between the 
[Rwandan] Patriotic Front and the interim government. It should 
have taken effect immediately yesterday evening, but it appears 
that the fighting is continuing in Kigali. 
  Paris has taken note of this latest cease-fire agreement and 
expressed satisfaction with it, but the French Government 
condemned the massacre which took place in a church in the 
Rwandan capital, Kigali, which is reported to have resulted in 
30-40 deaths, according to the United Nations.
