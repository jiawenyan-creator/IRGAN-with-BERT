FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Moving story
I AM ENGLISH and a taxpayer in the UK but wish to move to Australia. I am
investing in a personal equity plan with a view to building up an income
stream.
Would this income still be tax-free if brought into Australia?
As soon as you cease to be resident (and ordinarily resident) in the UK for
tax purposes, you must stop putting money into your Pep.
This rule is to be found in regulation 7 of the Personal Equity Plan
Regulations 1989, as amended.
On the other hand, by virtue of regulation 8, you can retain your existing
plan benefits after you cease to be resident in the UK.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR58 (going to work abroad). You
might also like to ask for booklets IR6 (double taxation relief) and IR20
(residents and non-residents - liability to tax in the UK).
Since our Q&amp;A Briefcase advisory service is limited to the laws of the UK,
we cannot give you any guidance on your prospective tax liability in
Australia.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
