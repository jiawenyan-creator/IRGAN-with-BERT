10-MILE ROUTE SET FOR PADDLE BOAT REGATTA 
The Sea Festival begins Saturday with an oar and paddle regatta that will 
include canoes, kayaks, surf skis and gondolas. 
The regatta, modeled after a similar tradition in Italy, will start at 9:30 
a.m. in Alamitos Bay at the Gondola Get-Away, 5437 E. Ocean Blvd. 
Boats will follow a 10-mile course past three Long Beach oil islands and finish 
at the Belmont Pier. All boaters who complete the course will get a diploma. 
Organizers expect the event to attract about 150 boats, said Mike O'Toole, a 
director of the event and co-owner of the Gondola Get-Away, which takes 
visitors on tours around the Naples Island area on gondolas. 
The regatta is open to racing and recreational boaters, O'Toole said. 
Other Sea Festival events this weekend include a junior volleyball tournament, 
three-on-three basketball and a sabot regatta, which is for sailboats. 
The Sea Festival, sponsored by the Long Beach Parks and Recreation Department, 
runs through Aug. 13.
