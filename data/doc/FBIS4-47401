  [Abstract] The ICO-84 and ICO-103 monoclonal antibodies 
(Mab) (developed at the Laboratory of Clinical Radioimmunology 
of the ONTs [expansion not given] of the Russian Academy of 
Medical Sciences) were studied to determine their reactivity 
spectrum with tumors of various histogenesis, to compare results 
of histological and cytological studies, and to evaluate the 
possibility of using these antibodies in oncocytology to label 
malignant cells. Epithelial and nonepithelial tumors were used 
to study Mab reactivity. Detailed information on tissue types 
and reactivity is given in the table. Sample handling is 
described in detail. Mab ICO-84 exhibited a broad spectrum of 
interaction with human malignant neoplasm cells. The strongest 
reactions were noted for colorectal carcinoma, lung, breast, 
stomach and esophageal cancers. Mab ICO-103 also reacted to a 
wide range of epithelial tumors. Most intense reactions were 
noted for breast, uterine, and thyroid tumors. Less frequent but 
equally intense reactions were found for ovarian, lung, and 
kidney tumors. Reaction types are categorized. Immunochemical 
reactivity in cytological specimens agrees well with findings 
for histological sections. Mabs ICO-103 and ICO-84 may be used 
to mark epithelial tumors and to determine the epithelial nature 
of malignant cells. They may also be used with other antibodies 
for differential diagnosis of metastatic poorly differentiated 
tumors and lymphoproliferative diseases. Figures 4; table 1;
