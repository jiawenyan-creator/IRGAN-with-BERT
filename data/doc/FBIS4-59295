  [Text] In a meeting last night with Japanese Government 
officials and industrialists in Tokyo, our country's oil 
minister said: The Islamic Republic of Iran gives special 
priority to meeting Japan's oil and gas needs and it welcomes 
investment in and help toward the development of gas and oil 
fields by foreign companies, including Japanese ones, within the 
framework of the country's second development plan. 
  Mr. Gholamreza Aqazadeh added: The Islamic Republic of Iran 
is, undoubtedly, an important gateway to activity in Central 
Asia and, with this in mind and in view of Iran's exceptional 
geographic position, the cooperation of Japanese companies in 
production in Iran with the aim of exporting to Central Asia and 
to Persian Gulf littoral countries is one of the interesting 
possibilities worth considering in the framework of cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  Our country's oil minister and his accompanying delegation 
will leave Tokyo today for Seoul for a four-day visit to South 
Korea.
