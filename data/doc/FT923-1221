FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Porsche says Bohn is to leave
the group
SPECULATION about the future direction of Porsche, the troubled German
sports car manufacturer, intensified yesterday after the company announced
that Mr Arno Bohn would step down as chief executive at the end of the
month.
The Stuttgart-based company said Mr Bohn, 45, was leaving by mutual
agreement because of differences of opinion over business policy. His
successor will be Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, the 40-year-old main board director
responsible for production.
The move comes several months after a dispute between Mr Bohn and the
supervisory board. The board at first failed to confirm him in office, going
so far as to line up an outside successor. But in February it renewed his
contract for three years after he threatened to resign.
With sales down to less than half the level of the mid-1980s, the company is
struggling to find its way forward in the leaner 1990s. In the first half of
the year to July 31, pre-tax profits fell 97 per cent to DM2m (Pounds
780,000) on sales of DM1.1bn.
Analysts suggested that a possible explanation for Mr Bohn's departure was
that the company was heading towards a loss for the whole of 1992. Mr Bohn
forecast earlier this year that Porsche would make a profit in spite of dire
conditions in international markets for the group's cars and the likelihood
of a 25 per cent drop in sales to DM2.5bn.
His resignation could also be the inevitable result of the boardroom fracas
earlier this year, when the Porsche and Piech families which control the
company and dominate the supervisory board, made plain their lack of
confidence in Mr Bohn. Another is that his departure signals the end of the
company's independence, although there was no hint of a sale in yesterday's
statement. Some industry observers speculate that Mr Wiedeking might to be a
caretaker pending the sale of the company.
