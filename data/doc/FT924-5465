FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dorbyl down 21% to R92m
LOSSES in the contracting and trading divisions caused earnings at Dorbyl,
the engineering and industrial group in South Africa's Rembrandt group, to
fall by 21 per cent in the year to September.
Turnover rose marginally to R2.98bn (Dollars 597m) from R2.90bn, but
operating income was 19 per cent lower at R141.1m, compared with R173.2m.
Higher borrowings increased interest charges by 12 per cent, but a lower
effective tax rate, mainly due to export incentives, resulted in a reduced
tax charge. Attributable earnings fell by 21 per cent to R92.3m from
R116.5m.
Mr David Mostert, chief executive, described this performance as
'satisfactory' given a 'marked decline in activity' in most sectors.
