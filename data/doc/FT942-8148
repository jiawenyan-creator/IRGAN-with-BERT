FT  21 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Defeating the object . . .
Next year, my husband is likely to realise a capital gain from share options
in excess of his personal allowance. As well as transferring shares to me,
so that I can use my capital gains allowance, is it possible similarly to
transfer shares to our children?
As a general principle, gifts are treated as sales at market value, as you
will see from the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction)
which is obtainable from tax offices. So, if your husband transfers shares
to your children (or anyone else other than yourself), he would be treated
as if he had sold them at market value. This defeats the object of the
exercise.
