Medical Facility Construction and Modernization; Requirements for Provision of Services to Persons Unable To Pay

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes revisions to the rules currently governing how certain health care facilities, assisted under
titles VI and XVI of the Public Health Service Act, fulfill the assurance given in their applications for assistance
that they would provide a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay. Public comment on the current rules
and operational experience with them have indicated the need to revise the current requirements with respect to nursing
homes, many of which are unable under current requirements to meet their obligation to provide such services. The
intended effect of this action is to permit qualified facilities to satisfy their uncompensated services assurance.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments must be received on or before June 3, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Secretary of Health and Human Services proposes an amendment to the rules governing what is popularly known as
the Hill-Burton uncompensated services program. Health care facilities covered by the program received construction
assistance under two titles of the Public Health Service Act, title VI (the ``Hill-Burton Act,'' 42 U.S.C. 291, 

et seq.

) and title XVI (42 U.S.C. 300q, 

et seq.

). Under both titles, facilities receiving such construction assistance have been required, as a condition of receiving
the construction assistance, to provide an assurance that ``there will be available in the facility or portion thereof
to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor ***.''
42 U.S.C. 291c(e). See also 42 U.S.C. 300s1(b)(1)(K)(ii). This assurance is known as the ``uncompensated
services assurance.''



Regulations governing compliance with the uncompensated services assurance were first issued in 1947, and have
been revised several times. On May 18, 1979, comprehensive regulations governing compliance with the assurance
were issued at 44 FR 29372. Among other things, the 1979 regulations: Established a minimum level of uncompensated
services which facilities were required to provide; set an annual compliance level of uncompensated services to
be provided and required facilities to make up any deficit in meeting the annual compliance level through provision
of more uncompensated services in later years; required facilities to allocate their uncompensated services either
under a plan meeting certain requirements or on a first-requested, first-served basis; required facilities to notify
the public of the existence of their uncompensated services programs through public notice and provision of personal
notice to individuals served by the facilities; and required facilities to keep records documenting compliance
and to periodically report concerning compliance. The 1979 regulations also for the first time established national
eligibility criteria, based on income: Individuals whose annual income was at or below the poverty level (known as
``Category A individuals'') were automatically eligible for uncompensated services; individuals whose annual
income was at or below two times the poverty level (known as ``Category B individuals'') were also eligible for uncompensated
services, unless the facility decided to limit its services to Category A individuals only. The 1979 regulations
also provided that amounts to which an individual was entitled under a third-party insurance or governmental program
could not be credited towards a facility's uncompensated services quota.

On December 3, 1987, the Secretary revised the 1979 regulations at 52 FR 46022. As pertinent here, the 1987 regulations
effected a technical revision of the 1979 regulations, making explicit what had formerly been implicit in those regulations;


i.e., 

that coverage of an indigent under a third-party insurance or governmental program precludes eligibility for uncompensated
services. 42 CFR 124.505(a)(1) (1988). This policy simply reflects the long-standing Department view of the uncompensated
services program as a program of last resort, designed to serve persons who have no source of payment, such as Medicaid
or private insurance, for medical care. 

This policy has created major compliance problems for many Hill-Burton-obligated nursing homes. HHS has determined
that, of the 287 nursing homes with outstanding uncompensated services obligations under the general compliance
standards of the regulations, 243 have deficits; the majority of these have received no uncompensated services credit.
These deficits persist despite many attempts by HHS to provide technical assistance to nursing homes to bring them
into compliance. The fundamental problem is that, in most of these nursing homes, the only individuals who meet the
income-eligibility requirements for receipt of uncompensated services are also covered by their State's Medicaid
program; hence, they are by definition ineligible for uncompensated services under 124.505(a)(1). Thus,
in States in which the Medicaid eligibility limits exceed the Hill-Burton eligibility limits and which cover most
or all medical services, nursing homes are in the unenviable position of being chronically unable to fulfill their
uncompensated services obligations.
