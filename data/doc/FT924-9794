FT  04 NOV 92 / Kohl and partners agree cuts in budget
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition last night agreed on budget cuts
totalling DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.29bn), and reallocated another DM2.5bn in social
spending, in an effort to reduce a gaping deficit in 1993 government
spending.
The measures fall far short of the estimated DM20bn shortfall forecast by Mr
Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, estimating the likely shortfall in
next year's tax revenues, and additional needs for both east Germany, and
unemployment benefits.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, is proposing to cover the revenue
shortfall - estimated at around DM6bn for the central exchequer - by
increasing the net borrowing requirement in the budget from DM38bn to
DM44bn.
The extent of new spending needs in the east is still uncertain, with a
cabinet debate scheduled for today now postponed until next week.
The cuts agreed last night by the Christian Democrats (CDU), Christian
Social Union (CSU) and Free Democrats (FDP), the three parties in the
coalition, will fall most heavily on the defence and transport ministries,
and on programmes to clean up environmental damage in east Germany.
The defence budget will be cut by DM540m, and the transport budget by
DM450m, without any indication of the precise areas of saving.
Another DM200m will be saved from the programme to repair the ravages of
Soviet uranium mining in the former East Germany. There will also be
spending cuts on cleaning up military bases after the departure of Soviet
troops.
A further DM400m is to be cut from the budget to fund government property
purchases in Berlin, suggesting a delay in the programme to transfer the
German government and parliament from Bonn to Berlin.
Mr Waigel's savings package seems certain to be condemned by the opposition.
