NATION; 
5 FIRES AT RUTGERS FRATERNITIES 
Separate suspicious fires erupted within minutes of each other in five 
buildings occupied by Rutgers University fraternities, fire officials said 
today. 
No one was injured, but 21 students were left homeless by the blazes, all of 
which were reported between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. Monday, said Deputy Fire 
Chief James Riley. 
"These were very suspicious fires," Riley said. "They were practically 
simultaneous. We don't have any idea who lit them yet. . . . " 
All the fires were out by 1 a.m. today, although campus authorities ordered the 
fraternities to appoint students to stay up all night and guard the houses, 
said Teresa Loser, dean of fraternity and sorority affairs at Rutgers.
