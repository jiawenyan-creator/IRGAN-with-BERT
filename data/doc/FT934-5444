FT  30 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Views sought on simplifying trust
rules - Legal Briefs
The Law Commission has issued a consultation paper on simplifying the
English law of trusts, almost 30 years after Parliament last had a go at it.
The paper asks whether the time has come to change the complex rules - 'the
rule against perpetuities' and 'the rule against excessive accumulations' -
that effectively limit the period for which a trust may last.
Among the questions being considered are: Should we seek to curb the 'dead
hand control' of former owners, reaching out to control their property
beyond the grave? Do other provisions, such as inheritance tax, exert enough
pressure to stop trusts lasting too long? If an estate is tied up a long
time, does it unreasonably hamper development or discourage economic use of
land? And would accumulating money for a long time damagingly concentrate
wealth in the hands of only a few people?
Law commissioner Trevor Aldridge says it is clear the present law is
'convoluted, obscure and capricious. If it is still important to keep
control of trusts in this way, the rules should be easier to understand and
simpler to apply. On the other hand, if we need no controls, the rules
should be scrapped.'
