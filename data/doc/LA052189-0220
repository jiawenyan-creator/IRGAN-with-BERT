BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK. 
The final vote is expected Monday on a Newport Beach ordinance that will move 
the curfew on city beaches an hour earlier to 11 p.m. The move is to help 
reduce noise and traffic that oceanfront residents blame on late-night 
beach-goers. All 6 miles of city-owned beach now close at midnight.
