FT  23 FEB 94 / Peru soldiers jailed
A military tribunal has sentenced nine members of Peru's armed forces to up
to 20 years in prison for their role in the July 1992 'La Cantuta' massacre.
Two majors received the most severe penalties, for commanding the patrol
which abducted and killed nine students and a university professor suspected
of guerrilla activity from La Cantuta university.
Four enlisted men who carried out the killings were sentenced to 15 years in
prison, while a general, a colonel and a captain were sentenced to from one
to five years for their involvement.
For almost a year the case has pitted the military against Peru's congress,
human rights courts and the civilian judiciary.
Two weeks ago, the government pushed through a bill, sending the case for
trial by secret military, rather than civilian, court. The move unleashed a
flood of criticism.
