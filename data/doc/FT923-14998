FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Adidas future uncertain as
Jaggi's DM1bn buy-out offer lapses
THE FUTURE ownership of Adidas, the German sports shoe and clothing company
remained uncertain yesterday after the lapsing this week of the management
buy-out offer made by Rene Jaggi, the chief executive, and a group of
investors.
The offer, worth nearly DM1bn (Dollars 645m) and including a capital
injection as well as the purchase price, was put on June 26 to Mr Bernard
Tapie, the French financier who bought Adidas two years ago. But no response
was received from his company, Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), and the offer
lapsed after its deadline of last Tuesday had been extended a day.
The buy-out proposal, headed by Charterhouse Development Fund of the UK,
included several institutional investors who are thought to remain
interested in the German company. It was put together by Botts, a small
London-based investment bank. Adidas had no comment.
In Paris, BTF also declined to comment about Mr Jaggi's offer.
The company, which is about to clear its short term debt on the FFr2.2bn
(Dollars 432m) acquisition of Adidas but is still burdened by long term
borrowings, claimed this week it had received two other offers for Adidas as
well as the management package.
Under the terms of BTF's agreement with Adidas' other shareholders, they not
only have pre-emptive rights over its controlling 55 per cent stake in the
company but can also demand that any offer for that holding be extended to
them.
Pentland, the UK consumer products company which holds 20 per cent of
Adidas, has made no secret of its hopes of taking control, but has stressed
it would only do so 'at the right price'.
