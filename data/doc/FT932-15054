FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Yule Catto edges ahead to Pounds
22m
YULE CATTO, the industrial chemicals and building products group, yesterday
reported a slight rise in 1992 profits and an improvement in earnings for
the 12th successive year.
The earnings record sets Yule Catto apart from most other chemical companies
which have not sufficiently controlled costs during the recession.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 22.2m on sales up 1 per
cent at Pounds 267.4m. Earnings per share rose from 16.1p to 16.4p and the
company is proposing a final dividend of 3.4p, giving a total of 5.9p - up
9.3 per cent.
Profits in the speciality chemicals division rose 5.6 per cent to Pounds
18.8m and were poised to benefit any cyclical upturn that emerges, according
to Mr Allister McLeish, finance director.
The company is likely to benefit from the decline of sterling and from a
strong position in Malaysia, further strengthened by two acquisitions.
Profits in the building materials side, however, fell 11.8 per cent to
Pounds 7.5m. Improvements in the UK companies were offset by weakness in the
Netherlands and France. Half of the divisions's sales are in the UK and half
in continental Europe. The company sells products specified by architects,
like office space glazing and roof lighting, and is not exposed to the
domestic house building market.
In spite of the weakening German market, Yule Catto's companies were doing
reasonably well and would continue to benefit from exposure in the eastern
part of the country.
Mr McLeish said the company would obviously benefit from any increase in
sales that might emerge from the improved sentiment. But it had succeeded in
maintaining earnings growth through the introduction of new products which
enjoyed higher margins.
Net debt over the year fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 10m, bringing
gearing down to 20 per cent and leaving interest more than 11 times covered.
