FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic to shed fewer jobs
than first feared
BELL ATLANTIC, one of the 'Baby Bell' US regional telephone companies,
yesterday said it would reduce its workforce less dramatically than it had
announced previously.
Bell Atlantic now expects to cut 3,450 jobs by the end of the year, below
its April estimates of 4,000 to 6,000.
Mr Charlie Crist, vice-president of human resources at Bell Atlantic, said:
'To date we've accomplished downsizing via voluntary means, and we will make
every effort to continue to use voluntary means in the future.'
The company, which employs about 75,700 workers, is reducing its workforce
to remain competitive. 'The Bell Atlantic telephone companies face
competition in every phase of our business except residential dial tone -
and competition for dial tone is coming in short order,' said Mr Crist.
Bell Atlantic said it would include 'specific mechanisms' for accomplishing
the job reductions in its contract negotiations with the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
which began in June. The existing contracts expire at midnight on August 8.
