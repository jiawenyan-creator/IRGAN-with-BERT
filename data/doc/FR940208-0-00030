 

The Director finds that these proposed revisions, unless specifically discussed below, are no less effective than
the Federal regulations and is approving them.



2. Provisions Not Discussed That Are Substantively the Same as the Counterpart Federal Regulations



Iowa proposes revisions to rules that contain language that is the same or similar to the counterpart Federal regulations,
replace Federal references and terms with appropriate State references and terms, or add specificity without adversely
affecting other aspects of the program regulation. The Director, therefore, finds that these proposed revisions
to Iowa's regulations are no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations. These
revisions are as follows (Federal regulation counterparts are indicated in brackets): IAC 2740.4(207) and
40.4(6), concerning the permanent regulatory program and the exemption for coal extraction incidental to the extraction
of other minerals [30 CFR Part 702]; IAC 2740.4(7)(f)(2), concerning the impact of a request for administrative
review by persons adversely affected on an exemption determination [30 CFR 702.11(f)(2)]; IAC 2740.4(8)(3),
concerning the impact of a petition for administrative review on a decision to revoke an exemption [30 CFR 702.17(c)(3)];
IAC 2740.31(15), concerning a permittee's right to appeal for administrative review [30 CFR 773.21(c)];
IAC 2740.33(1) and (2), concerning general content requirements for permit applications [30 CFR 777.11(a)(3)
and 777.14(a)]; IAC 2740.35(1) and (3), Vegetation information and land use [30 CFR 779.19(a) and (b)]; IAC
2740.35(9), Climatological information [30 CFR 779.18]; IAC 2740.35(13), Identification of public
roads [30 CFR 779.24(h)]; IAC 2740.51(5), concerning soil productivity levels required for release of performance
bonds on prime farmlands [30 CFR 800.40(c)(2)]; IAC 2740.73(2)g, concerning notification of owners and controllers
of a permit upon issuance of a cessation order [30 CFR 843.11(g)]; IAC 2740.74(6), concerning procedures to
prepare a request for a hearing on a violation [30 CFR 845.19]; IAC 2740.74(7), concerning procedures for determining
final assessment of a violation [30 CFR 845.20]; and IAC 2740.75(3), concerning final order and opportunity
for review of a penalty assessment [30 CFR 846.17(b)(1)].



3. Iowa Code Chapter 207



In the letter dated July 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA383), submitting revised language for the proposed
amendment in response to OSM concerns, Iowa notified OSM that the Iowa Code has been reorganized in an attempt to achieve
more logical groupings by agency and function in the Code. Therefore, Iowa Code chapter 83 is now Iowa Code chapter
207. Iowa indicated that no substantive changes were made to the statute. All references to Iowa Code chapter 83 in
the Iowa Administrative Code have been revised to read Iowa Code chapter 207. OSM approves the recodification based
upon its understanding that no substantive changes were made to the statute.



4. Provisions Adopting Suspended Federal Regulations



Iowa proposes to adopt by reference several Federal regulations or portions thereof that are suspended. In its cover
letter dated July 8, 1993, Iowa indicated it's intention to adopt the suspension rule announcements located at the
end of the sub-Parts to the Federal regulations as published in the Code of Federal Regulations. Accordingly, the
Director considers any proposed Iowa rule adopting a suspended Federal regulation noted in the 30 CFR as of July 1,
1992, to also be suspended in the State program. Therefore, the Director finds that with this clarification, these
proposed State rules are no less effective than the Federal counterpart regulations and is approving them. The following
is a list of the proposed Iowa rules adopting suspended Federal regulations as noted in the July 1, 1992, 30 CFR and the


Federal Register

 notices that explain the Federal suspensions.
