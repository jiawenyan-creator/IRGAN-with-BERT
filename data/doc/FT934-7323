FT  20 NOV 93 / Industrial output falls in France
A DROP in car and consumer goods sales led to a 0.3 per cent decline in
French industrial output in September from the level of the previous two
months, according to Insee, the official statistics agency. However, Insee
revised upward its initial estimate of zero growth in gross domestic product
in the second quarter to an increase of 0.3 per cent.
The economy ministry, commenting on the output figure, said the fact that
the overall level in July-September was 0.45 per cent higher than in the
previous quarter convinced it that France was on the road to recovery.
