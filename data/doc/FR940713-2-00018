 

Specifically, Columbia Gulf proposes to construct and operate approximately 1.2 miles of 30-inch pipeline crossing
the Mississippi River replacing approximately 1.2 miles of duel 24-inch crossing which ruptured in 1993 in East Carroll
Parish, Louisiana. Columbia Gulf states that this river crossing is part of Columbia Gulf's Mainline 200 30-inch
pipeline. Columbia Gulf further states that the Mainline 200 operates as part of a looped system in conjunction with
Columbia Gulf's Mainline 100 30-inch and Mainline 300 36-inch extending from southern Louisiana to northeastern
Kentucky. Columbia Gulf states that the proposed crossing, when operated as part of Columbia Gulf's looped pipeline
system, will have equivalent designed delivery capacity to that of the facilities being replaced. 

Columbia Gulf states that the estimated cost of the proposed construction is $5,747,000. Columbia Gulf states that
it will finance the construction with funds generated from internal sources. 

Columbia Gulf requests that this application be processed pursuant to section 385.802 of the Commission's Rules
of Practice and Procedure and hereby waives oral hearing and the opportunity for filing exceptions to the decision
of the Commission and requests the Commission to omit the intermediate decision procedure.
