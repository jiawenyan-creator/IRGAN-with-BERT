FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: First dividend cut at Nomura
since 1975
NOMURA Securities, the leading Japanese securities house, plans to cut its
annual dividend to Y10 from Y15 a year earlier. It is the first reduction
since 1975 and a sign of the pressure on the broking industry.
The dividend announcement follows a forecast that the broker would report a
pre-tax profit of zero for the year ending last month on revenue of Y345bn
(Dollars 3.1bn), down from Y421bn in the previous year.
Yamaichi Securities, another member of Japan's Big Four brokers, said that
its annual dividend would be cut from Y5 to Y2.5. The other two, Daiwa
Securities and Nikko Securities, have yet to make a dividend announcement.
None of the four is expecting a pre-tax profit for the year just ended and
only Nomura is expecting a slim Y2bn net profit. Nomura announced that
unrealised losses on securities holdings in March were Y12.1bn, less than
the expected Y15bn.
Japanese brokers were badly bruised by the generally weak turnover and
prices on the Tokyo market last year.
