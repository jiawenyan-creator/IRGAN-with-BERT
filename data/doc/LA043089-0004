"The Wonder Years" is a wonderful program. I hope ABC does not discontinue it. 
When the network advertised the premiere of "Have Faith," I was afraid it was 
scheduled to replace "The Wonder Years." Fortunately, it did not. That was when 
I decided to write. I don't want to feel guilty for not telling someone that 
the high quality of "The Wonder Years" is appreciated.
