STOP-SMOKING FIRM READY TO CASH IN ON BAN; 
AIRLINES: A LAGUNA HILLS COMPANY IS AMONG THE BUSINESSES SEEKING TO CAPITALIZE 
ON THE ALMOST TOTAL BAN ON SMOKING ON AIRPLANES THAT BEGINS SUNDAY. 
The skies will become anything but friendly to smokers Sunday, and Charles 
Sleichter couldn't be happier. 
Like an air-conditioning salesman sensing a summer heat wave, Sleichter 
predicts that sales of his company's "smoking alternative" chewing gum will 
take off when a smoking ban on almost all U.S. airline flights takes effect 
Sunday. 
The potential is "phenomenal," said Sleichter, president of Advantage Life 
Products Inc. in Laguna Hills. "If you look at all the smoking bans, this one 
gives (smokers) no way out." 
Already, Advantage is moving to capitalize on the ban. It has wooed a chain of 
airport gift shops to stock its CigArrest chewing gum and has plans for a 
$4-million advertising campaign later this year. 
The Laguna Hills firm has set up displays in department stores, pharmacies and 
airport gift shops featuring a new slogan: "Help Me Make It Through the 
Flight." 
The business prospects brought about by the ban have not been lost on 
Advantage's competitors in the growing $285-million stop-smoking industry, a 
market expected to grow by 17% annually through 1995, according to a study by 
MarketData Enterprises, a Lynwood, N.Y., market research firm. 
Dep Corp., the Rancho Dominguez distributor of Ban-Tron stop-smoking pills, 
says it is trying to negotiate a deal with some airlines in which its gum would 
be offered to passengers. 
Schick Laboratories, one of the largest stop-smoking clinic chains in the 
nation, is braced for a new onslaught of customers in the wake of the ban. The 
company is cutting its fees and sponsoring a television special that will 
highlight the need to stop smoking in light of the airline ban, said Schick 
spokesman Ed Butler. 
The new law bans smoking on all flights within the United States except for a 
few that last six hours or longer to or from Hawaii or Alaska. Congress passed 
the law last year to replace a 1988 smoking ban on domestic fights of two hours 
or less. 
But since the ban has received relatively little press attention since it was 
passed, the president of an anti-smoking lobbying group believes that firms 
have been slow on the uptake. 
"I think there has been very little publicity and very little public 
controversy (now that) the ban is going into effect," said John F. Banzhaf III, 
executive director of Action on Smoking and Health in Washington. "I think the 
reality of it is that it has yet to hit the smokers. But once it does, I would 
expect that companies would capitalize on it." 
But not every company in the stop-smoking industry views the ban as a major 
opportunity. 
Merrell Dow Inc., the Kansas City-based maker of the Nicorette chewing gum, is 
not planning any special promotions. Product Manager Jim Dawson said the 
nicotine-laced Nicorette is sold only by prescription as part of a medically 
supervised program to stop smoking. He said a promotional campaign to call 
attention to the airline smoking ban would encourage use of the gum as a 
temporary aid, rather than part of a permanent solution to a smoker's habit. 
Unlike CigArrest or Ban-Tron, Nicorette is recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration as a proven aid to alleviate the smoking urge. By contrast, the 
key ingredient in CigArrest and Ban-Tron -- lobeline sulfate, a non-addictive 
derivative of Indian tobacco -- is considered "unproven" though "possibly 
helpful" to smokers trying to kick their habit, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said. 
Dawson would not comment on the success of Nicorette, but one private marketing 
study found that sales have more doubled since the product hit the 
pharmaceutical shelves in 1984. It ranked 89th on a list of the 200 most 
frequently prescribed drugs in the nation last year. 
Advantage's CigArrest does not contain nicotine and can be bought without a 
prescription, making it easier to market to air travelers trying to survive a 
flight without lighting up, Sleichter said. 
Sleichter has had his share of ups and downs so far in his effort to win the 
hearts of smoking air travelers. CigArrest is now stocked in gift shops at 
about six major airports and the firm is talking with other major operators of 
airport gift shops as well, he said. 
But CigArrest has failed to ignite much interest from the airlines on its offer 
to let flight attendants hand out free samples of the product to frustrated 
smokers. To alleviate airline officials' concerns that passengers will stick 
wads of gum on airline seats, Sleichter has gone so far as to demonstrate how 
the gum can be tucked back into the packaging foil. 
If that doesn't work, Sleichter has another solution: a new version of 
CigArrest in throat lozenge form. 
Hoping that the airline-smoking ban will help sales, Sleichter predicts that 
his publicly traded company's sales will increase to $12 million when its 
current fiscal year ends in April, up from $5.5 million in 1989 and $1 million 
in 1988. 
Founded in 1986 as Advantage Entertainment -- a distributor of exercise 
cassette tapes -- the company changed its name to Advantage Life Products to 
reflect its move into stop-smoking products. Advantage claims to have 10,000 
letters of endorsement from customers. And Sleichter proudly notes that there 
is only a 2% return rate on the product's money-back guarantee. 
"If this was totally worthless, you would have a higher return," he said. 
The average smoker doesn't kick the habit on the first or even second try, 
Sleichter said, which means that a single customer may try CigArrest several 
times. The product is also pitched to ex-smokers to "curb the urge to smoke." 
He said the company is careful in its claims about CigArrest. "We're not saying 
it's going to help you stop smoking, just help with the withdrawal."
