FILM REVIEWS; 
'REVERIES' SERIES AT MELNITZ HALL 
"Reveries" is the umbrella title given to four UCLA student films screening on 
campus tonight at 7:30 and 9:30, and it's a good choice. Though quite different 
in tone, ranging from childlike whimsy to grown-up doom 'n' gloom, all four 
feature protagonists who are profoundly alone in one way or another, given to 
daydreaming or wishes that can't come true. It's a lonely ol' night in Melnitz 
Hall. 
The best and most haunting of these is Bruce Muller's "Caruthers," which puts a 
severe, almost cruel spin on its theme of unrequited longing by making its hero 
a limping, disabled lounge drummer and the object of his affection a beautiful 
woman who leads him on and spurns him in equally potent doses. Set in two 
different desert towns, Muller's astonishing, aching mood piece isn't big on 
story but contains two great characterizations -- of yearning from Tom McCray, 
who beguiles with a smile both compassionate and nervous, and teasing from 
looker Audrey Wells, who suggests tragic pain beneath the uncaring mood swings. 
Also recommended are Suzanne Smith's "One Book, One Summer," about a schoolgirl 
in love with a book about pioneers, and Keping Qiu's "Au Pair," about a Chinese 
student working for an elderly Beverly Hills man. Robert Castle's "The Water 
Man" completes the bill. Famed director Robert Wise ("West Side Story") will 
speak as part of tonight's program.
