ON THE SIDELINES; 
ITALIAN GOLD OPENS WORLD GAMES 
Diana Bianchedi of Italy won the first gold medal of the World University Games 
today, and fencing teammate Giovanna Trillini added a bronze in the women's 
foil. 
In the only other event of the opening day, Yugoslavia began the defense of its 
men's basketball title with a 93-52 trouncing of Greece. No other basketball 
matches were scheduled today. 
The University Games, shifted to Duisburg from Sao Paulo five months ago when 
the Brazilian city pulled out for lack of money, have been scaled down to four 
sports -- fencing, basketball, rowing and track and field.
