  [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Boris Yeltsin regards "with 
understanding" the doubts expressed in the State Duma, the lower 
house of the Russian parliament, about the advisability of the 
first-ever Russian-U.S. staff exercises which were planned to be 
held in the Orenburg region. 
  The president recommended that the Defence Ministry hold 
additional consultations with the U.S. side and consider the 
matter again "with due regard for both the stance of the Russian 
lawmakers and comments made in this connection by the general 
public," the presidential press service announced.
