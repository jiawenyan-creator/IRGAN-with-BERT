  [Text] In Khan Yunus this morning, two terrorists were 
killed and an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officer was lightly 
wounded in clashes. The attack occurred when the terrorists 
opened fire with automatic weapons on an IDF patrol. Soldiers 
returned the fire, killing the two terrorists. One of those 
killed has been identified as a wanted member of Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] who is suspected of carrying out attacks 
against security forces and residents in the Gaza Strip. The 
area has been closed and an IDF investigation is under way. 
  Yesterday, security forces arrested five wanted members of 
the PLO's Fatah. In clashes in the territories yesterday, one 
Palestinian was killed and 37 wounded. 
  Meanwhile, a Jewish settler from Har Hevron was arrested 
last 
night after opening fire and overturning stalls at a junction 
outside Hebron. He opened fire after coming under a hail of 
stones. Several hours later, two more Jewish settlers opened 
fire in the same area after being stoned.
