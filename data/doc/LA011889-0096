BRIEFLY 
Marriott Corp. and Huntsman Chemical Corp. have agreed to provide and package 
meals for passengers of the Soviet airline Aeroflot. Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. 
Dubinin held a joint news conference with the heads of the two U.S. companies, 
J.W. Marriott Jr. of Washington and Jon Huntsman of Salt Lake City, to give 
details of the joint ventures set up without pubic announcement in Moscow last 
month. Aeroflot already has contracts with Marriott to provide meals on its 
airplanes at several airports outside the Soviet Union.
