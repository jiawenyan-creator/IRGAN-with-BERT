FT  20 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI bucks trend
Chemicals giant ICI bucked a lacklustre trend in London after a strong
performance in New York on Thursday night and encouraging comments from some
sector analysts.
Smith New Court reiterated a buy recommendation, arguing that ICI was not
saddled with the same problems that bedevilled other leaders in the sector.
Mr Charles Lambert, of Smiths, said: 'The message coming out of ICI
contrasts with that of BOC and Courtaulds - the steadily improving trend
appears to be still there.' UBS was also said to be recommending the stock.
The shares had risen  1/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 late on Thursday and picked up
10 in London to 686p yesterday. Meanwhile BOC rallied 6 to 618p after a
sharp slide earlier in the week. Courtaulds recovered 3 to 433p.
