  [Text] Belgrade, June 17 (TANJUG) -- Zoran Djindjic, 
president of the opposition Democratic Party (DS) in the 
Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, said Friday that the preliminary 
version of the map for territorial division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was unacceptable for the Bosnian Serbs. 
Djindjic told a press conference in Belgrade that political 
entities created after Bosnia-Herzegovina's division had to be 
viable and connected territorially. "The preliminary version 
takes into consideration only the Moslem-Croat territorial 
entity while the Serb entity is discriminated," he said. 
  The contact group for Bosnia -- which includes 
representatives of the United States, Russia and the European 
Union -- is preparing a plan for Bosnia's division granting 51 
percent of the territory to the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 
percent to the Srpska republic. 
  When the proposal is adopted by the foreign ministers of the 
countries represented on the contact group, it will be presented 
to the warring sides as an ultimatum. 
  It is strategically important that the cease-fire hold, said 
the DS president. 
  The truce shows that the international community has chosen 
to begin a territorial delineation, he said and added that this 
was not irrelevant because two concepts had been on the table so 
far -- the Serb, proposing a territorial demarcation, and the 
Moslem, proposing a unitary Bosnia. The one-month cease-fire 
agreement, signed in Geneva last week, took effect on June 10.
