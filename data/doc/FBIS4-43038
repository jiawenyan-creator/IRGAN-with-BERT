  [Text] Several soldiers and civilians were injured in a 
mortar bomb attack on a security forces checkpoint outside 
Crossmaglen, south Armagh today. 
  Police said the checkpoint, half a mile from the town centre 
on the Blaney Road, was manned by both police and troops. 
  A spokesman said the number and extent of the casulties was 
not known. No members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] 
were thought to have been hurt and first reports indicated no 
one was killed. 
  A single Mark 15 IRA mortar appeared to have been fired at 
the checkpoint from a VW van stopped a short distance down the 
road, said the spokesman. The mortar is said to have missed the 
checkpoint but to have exploded nearby. The checkpoint is part 
of the huge security cordon the Army and police have thrown 
around the area in recent weeks to protect construction workers 
strengthening the fortifications around the frequently attacked 
security base in Crossmaglen. 
  The Army said three soldiers had been injured and taken to 
Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry. Their injuries were not life 
threatening. 
  One civilian was treated by a local doctor, said police. 
  The mortar, which the IRA admitted firing, just missed the 
VCP [vehicle checkpoint] and caused damage to a nearby house. 
  Police said later up to four civilians suffered minor 
injuries. A police spokesman said there was no warning about the 
attack. "The attack was carried out by vicious and ruthless men 
who care nothing for the life and limb of any individual."
