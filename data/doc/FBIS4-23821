BFN 

  [Excerpt] Angola National Bank [BNA] intends to set the 
dollar rate at 115,000 new kwanzas to bring it closer to the 
black market rate. Meanwhile, Planning and Economic 
Coordination Minister Jose Pedro de Morais has acknowledged that 
the new foreign exchange regulations have fallen short of the 
expectations. 
  [Begin Morais recording] That is due to a considerable 
increase in fixed expenses and the service of Angola's debt. 
So, the sale of foreign currency by commercial banks has not 
had an impact yet. That is due to two reasons. One is the small 
amounts of cash [preceding word in English] sold by the central 
bank. The other has to do with difficulties we are facing with 
credit lines which are drawn on the BNA, though they ought to be 
endorsed by commercial banks. [end recording] 
  Cruz Neto, head of BNA's management and reserves department, 
says the regular devaluations of the currency are designed to 
meet the goals set by the socioeconomic program. [passage
