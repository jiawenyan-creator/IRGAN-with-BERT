METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE ORDERED TO PAY TRIAL COST OF $2.1 
MILLION 
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Monday added $2.1 million in attorneys 
fees and trial expenses to the $5.5-million civil verdict that the city of 
Torrance was ordered to pay in September when a jury found that six of the 
city's police officers covered up for a colleague after a fatal traffic 
accident. 
Judge Abby Soven ordered Torrance to pay $329,000 in expenses and $1.8 million 
in attorneys fees to the firm of Greene, Broillet, Paul, Simon &amp; Wheeler, 
which represented John Rastello of San Pedro. Rastello's 19-year-old son, 
Kelly, died in a collision with off-duty Torrance Police Sgt. Rollo Green in 
1984. 
A jury awarded the judgment against Torrance and its officers after finding 
that the Police Department had protected Green as part of a "custom and policy" 
of whitewashing police misconduct. Jurors found that John Rastello's civil 
right to meaningful access to the courts was infringed because Torrance police 
officers did not thoroughly investigate the crash or order a blood-alcohol test 
for Green, who admitted that he had been drinking before the crash.
