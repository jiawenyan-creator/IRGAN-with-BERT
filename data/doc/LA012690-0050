THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER 
Moving from well-known scenes of Chicano life into the realm of baroque fantasy 
is a somewhat bumpy journey for John Valadez. But you have to admire the sheer 
courage and operatic vigor of recent pastels grouped under the title 
"Condenados" (The Damned). 
The better pieces retain some link with modern times and the artist's own style 
but use Old Master images as a flavorful seasoning. 
On a grand scale, the show's title work presents a vision of Spanish 
colonization and religious tyranny of the New World's native peoples. Dusky, 
fleshy nudes cower below a hulking figure with a sword, elaborate headdress and 
swollen blue tongue; tiny scenes of brutality and the subservient treatment of 
Indians by the Catholic clergy trail across the sky. Valadez's own voice seems 
to be smothered by the weight of art history in this piece as well as "Fall of 
Babel," a painting that apes Baroque models. 
Much fresher is the intimate image of "Mad Manny," a middle-aged man in deluxe 
surroundings who is stopped in mid-gesture by an angel painted in a wonderfully 
unreal lacy style (perhaps taken from an old engraving?). The conjunction of 
old and new, everyday and otherworldly makes a fine bouquet. (Saxon-Lee
