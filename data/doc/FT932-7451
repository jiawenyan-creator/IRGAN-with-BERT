FT  24 MAY 93 / Effect of recession expected to linger
MANY MANUFACTURERS of consumer products believe the lingering impact of the
recession will continue to affect their businesses for at least the next six
months, a survey says.
The survey, conducted last month by Datamonitor, covered 394 marketing
executives in 60 consumer-goods sectors. In most sectors three quarters of
respondents said it would be at least six months before the negative effects
of recession ended. About half expected it to take a year or longer.
The most bullish sectors were household and leisure goods, where a fifth and
a quarter respectively of those polled said the impact of the recession had
already worn off. In personal care and hygiene, by contrast, none of the
respondents reported any improvement.
Almost all the executives said recession had made consumers more
price-sensitive, and most said switching between competing brands had become
more common.
