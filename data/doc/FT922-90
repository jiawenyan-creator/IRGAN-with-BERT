Republican Party after being charged with corruption by a Lyons court,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris
Mr Leotard, 50, was seen as a future candidate for the French presidency.
He has been charged with having allegedly underpaid for a piece of land at
Porte-Frejus in his constituency. He said he would stand for office again
when his name was cleared.
