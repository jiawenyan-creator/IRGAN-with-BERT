FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T acquires Alaska phone group
for Dollars 365m
Pacific Telecom, an 87 per cent owned unit of PacifiCorp, is selling its
Alascom long distance phone company to AT&amp;T for Dollars 365m, Reuter
reports.
Alascom provides Alaska with interstate and intrastate long-distance,
private line and other communications services.
Pacific Telecom is to use the proceeds to fund its local telephone exchange
acquisition programme, including purchases of lines from US West in Colorado
and Oregon for Dollars 380m.
In 1993 Alascom contributed Dollars 338m in operating revenue and Dollars
59m in operating income to Pacific Telecom's consolidated operations. For
the first half of 1994 the figures were Dollars 160m and Dollars 31m
respectively.
'The decision to sell Alascom was based in part on the expectation that
operating revenues and operating income would decline as the result of
implementing a final Federal Communications Commission order relating to the
restructuring of the Alaska long distance market,' said Mr Fred Buckman,
chief executive of PacifiCorp.
