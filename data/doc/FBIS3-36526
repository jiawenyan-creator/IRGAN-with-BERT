<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Security-Internal Affairs </F>
Ministry To Be Set Up"] 
  [Text] According to reports received by MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS from reliable sources, the presidential 
administration is preparing yet another reform of special 
services. This time it will be about setting up, not 
dissolving, a structure that would take over all state security 
units and law-enforcement agencies. 
  It is planned to organize "a security service community" 
that 
would include chiefs of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, 
the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Agency of 
Government Communications and Information, the Main Security 
Administration, the presidential security service (all former 
KGB services), and also the Main Intelligence Administration of 
the Defense Ministry General Staff. In addition, the community 
will include chiefs of services to be set up on the basis of the 
reorganized Internal Affairs Ministry. It is not yet clear who 
will head the new structure. To all appearances, it will be 
subordinate directly to the president, and its meetings will be 
chaired either by the Russian Federation Security Council's 
secretary or by the president's national security adviser.
