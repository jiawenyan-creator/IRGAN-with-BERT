  [Abstract] The practical difficulties inherent in using 
hybridization with an oligonucleotide matrix (SHOM), a new DNA 
sequencing method developed by the authors three years ago, have 
been overcome by a procedure that obviates the problems 
associated with the different stabilities of the AT- and GC-rich 
hybrids. First, a 10-30-m layer of 8% cross-linked 
polyacrylamide gel is applied to a glass plate. The 
oligonucleotide is then immobilized throughout the entire cell, 
which is a 50 to 1000-m gel square halved by a large divider 
of hydrophobized glass. By making the capacity of the carrier 
very large, the oligonucleotide concentration amounts to 1 to 90 
m. Finally, the quantity of DNA fragment is selected so that 
1/100 of the binding sites are occupied during complete 
hybridization. It was found that the effect of varying any 
parameter on the ``washing-out'' temperature, Tw, 
depended on the enthalpy of the process. An overall increase in 
the stability of all the oligonucleotide matrix duplexes 
inevitably ``narrowed'' the Tw range, which could 
compromise the sensitivity of the method. Tw was 
insignificantly affected by _D_T between 5 and 20C. An 
increase in washing-out time results in a higher Tw. 
Tw also depends on oligonucleotide concentration; 
generally, the concentration of oligonucleotides that form less 
stable duplexes should be increased to a greater degree than 
those forming less stable duplexes. Finally, lengthening the DNA 
fragment results in a slight increase in Tw. This 
knowledge makes it possible to calculate Tw with 
sufficient accuracy. This study was commissioned by the Russian 
National HUMAN GENOME Program. Figures 2, tables 4; references
