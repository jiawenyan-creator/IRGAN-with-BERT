FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Daiichibo considers sale of
factory
DAIICHIBO, an Osaka textile company struggling to recover from the collapse
of a trading offshoot and an ill-fated expansion into commercial property,
has raised with its creditors the possible sale of its main factory.
Such a move would be extremely unusual for a Japanese manufacturing company.
Daiichibo stressed yesterday the sale was only one option for restructuring
under discussion with the lenders.
Nonetheless, it illustrates the harshness of choices facing many
medium-sized Japanese companies as the consequences of a more than two-year
property and equity price slide take hold.
Daiichibo, with annual sales of about Y60bn (Dollars 480m), fell into a net
loss of Y22.2bn for the year to March, from modest post-tax profits of Y219m
the year before. It passed its dividend, blaming extraordinary losses on
uncollectable accounts.
Then this month Ichibo Shoji, a subsidiary, was put into liquidation after
its main customer went bankrupt. Daiichibo, faced with a negative net worth
because of its responsibilities to this debt, has been trying unsuccessfully
to sell a shopping centre in the Osaka region.
Its shares on the second section of the Osaka Stock Exchange, meanwhile,
have been sliding; the price halved last week and closed yesterday at Y115,
down Y4, to value the company at some Y2.3bn.
In talks this week with creditors, led by Sakura Bank, Daiichibo sought a
deferral of Y2bn in interest payments due this year.
Japanese commercial banks are coming under strain from increasing numbers of
such requests, and the country's financial authorities have begun signalling
that meeting these is not always justified.
