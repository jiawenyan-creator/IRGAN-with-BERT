FT  28 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Group plans clearing house
for forex trades
A consortium of eight large North American banks and the world's largest
derivatives clearing house have applied for regulatory approval to launch a
clearing house for foreign exchange transactions.
If they succeed, the resulting Multinet International Bank would be the
world's first multilateral clearing organisation for over-the-counter
currency transactions.
Despite the sheer size of the foreign exchange markets, foreign currency
trades traditionally are cleared on a bank-to-bank basis.
Multinet, which has been operating since 1992 as a bilateral clearing
mechanism, will be owned by First National Bank of Chicago, Chase Manhattan
Bank and six leading Canadian banks, including the Bank of Montreal, the
Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank.
It will be operated by International Clearing Systems, a subsidiary of the
Options Clearing Corporation.
The system will initially clear spot and forward transactions in Canadian
and US dollars, but eventually will clear other leading currencies.
Its supporters claim the clearing house will reduce the counterparty credit
risks and costs of banks' foreign exchange dealings.
'We're building a safety net under today's Dollars 1,000bn daily currency
market,' said Mr Garrett Glass, senior vice-president at First National Bank
of Chicago.
Multinet's operation must be approved by the Federal Reserve Board and the
State of New York Banking Department.
