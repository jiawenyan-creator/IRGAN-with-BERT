FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: African sales surge behind rise at Paterson
Zochonis
STRONG GROWTH in Africa, which outstripped adverse currency movements, drove
up pre-tax profits at Paterson Zochonis, the soap and detergents group, by
11.3 per cent from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.9m in the six months to
November 30.
Associates'contributions increased by 68 per cent to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds
1.21m) thanks to a surge in sales in Nigeria - the group's biggest African
market - and in Kenya and Ghana. Core operating profits were ahead slightly
at Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 6.03m).
Mr Alan Whittaker, finance director, said the African growth was strong
enough to offset the effect of a decline in the value of the Nigerian naira
which has repeatedly held back group profits in recent years.
The weakness of sterling actually yielded a rare exchange rate benefit in
the latter part of last year, Mr Whittaker said, but this had since been
reversed by a 20 per cent tumble in the naira's value against the pound in
the last two months.
He expected full year profits to be slightly ahead of last year's Pounds
26.6m.
Paterson - best known for its Cussons range of soap and toiletries - said
there was no recurrence of the boost it received in the second half of last
year when the Nigerian authorities settled Pounds 7.3m in outstanding debts
to the company.
Nor did it anticipate any further settlement in the second half this year.
Paterson originally set aside Pounds 10m to cover unpaid debts.
First half turnover rose 7 per cent to Pounds 121.8m (Pounds 113.8m). Mr
Whittaker said Paterson retained its 20 per cent UK soap market share.
Investment income was up from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 7.87m, reflecting
Paterson's continued accumulation of a large cash hoard, which Mr Whittaker
said stood at Pounds 160m.
Earnings per share increased from 14.22p to 16.24p. The interim dividend is
raised to 2.35p (2.25p).
