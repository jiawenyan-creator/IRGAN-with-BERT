FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: PizzaExpress ready for the market
PIZZAEXPRESS, the pizza restaurant chain founded by Mr Peter Boizot, is
coming to market through a reverse takeover by Star Computer Group.
As expected, Star Computer, the shares of which were suspended at 47p just
before Christmas, plans to acquire PizzaExpress and G&amp;F Group, its largest
franchisee, in a cash, shares and loan note deal worth a total of Pounds
14.63m. The acquisitions are subject to shareholder approval.
The deal, which includes Pounds 11.24m for PizzaExpress itself, has already
received an enthusiastic response from institutional shareholders, according
to the brokers to the deal, Greig Middleton. They claimed that a placing of
24.45m new shares at 40p-a-share to raise Pounds 9.8m to help fund the
acquisition had been ten-times oversubscribed.
Under the terms of the deal Pounds 4.54m of the acquisition price will be
satisfied by issuing new shares to the vendors at 40p a share. The cash and
loan note element of the acquisition price will be financed out of the
proceeds of the 24.45m share placing of which 19m shares will take the form
of a vendor placing.
A further Pounds 4.1m will be raised by a 10.3m share 3-for-2 rights issue
undewritten by Hill Samuel. The proceeds will be used to pay expenses and
repay borrowings of the enlarged group which will be renamed PizzaExpress.
Mr Boizot will be chairman of the enlarged group and hold a personal 14.9
per cent equity stake. He and his partners set up the first PizzaExpress
restaurant in London in 1965. Since then the group has become one of the
most popular pizza restaurant chains in the UK, with 13 owned restaurants
and 52 franchised outlets. In the year to June 28 it made an operating
profit from continuing activities of Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds
16.3m.
The G&amp;F Group, which is being acquired for Pounds 3.04m, operates nine
PizzaExpress restaurants and is run by Mr David Page who will become
managing director of the enlarged group. Turnover for 1991 was Pounds 4.72m
and generated operating profits of Pounds 760,000. In the nine months to
September 27 it recorded Pounds 510,000 operating profits on sales of Pounds
3.47m.
On an historic pro forma basis, the enlarged PizzaExpress group, which will
also include Star Computer's operations as a self-contained subsidiary,
generated operating profits on continuing activities of Pounds 2.4m on
Pounds 28.4m sales.
Star Computer, which supplies software and services to specialist markets,
also reported its interim results and a return to profitability yesterday.
The company posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 240,000 loss) in
the six months to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 3.79m (Pounds 3.47m).
