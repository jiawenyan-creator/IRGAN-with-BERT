LAWYER WHO CRASHED IN OCEAN INDICTED ON 33 FEDERAL CHARGES 
Thomas Root, the lawyer who ditched his plane in the Atlantic Ocean last 
summer, was indicted Wednesday on 33 counts of fraud and other crimes involving 
radio stations that he was representing before a federal agency. 
The federal grand jury indictment accuses the 37-year-old Root of defrauding 
the federal government and five clients in Federal Communications Commission 
proceedings on permits to construct FM radio stations throughout the United 
States. 
If convicted of all charges against him, Root would face a maximum 200 years in 
prison and an $8-million fine. 
Root burst onto the public scene last July when his single-engine plane ran out 
of gas and plunged into the Atlantic off the Bahamas after a six-hour, 800-mile 
flight that began near Washington, D.C. 
Doubts about Root's story began to surface almost immediately. He told 
authorities that he had been unconscious for most of the odyssey, but Navy 
fighter pilots flying alongside the plane reported seeing him moving in the 
cockpit. 
U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens told a news conference that a mysterious gunshot 
wound that Root suffered during the flight was part of an ongoing 
investigation. 
Stephens said Wednesday that Root had been aware of the inquiry, which began in 
April, 1989. He said 31 of the 33 counts in the indictment involved activities 
that took place before Root's July 13 plane flight.
