MALCOLM X DEATH SITE TO BECOME A MUSEUM 
The site of the assassination of Malcolm X will be preserved as a museum and 
memorial to the black leader. Under an agreement announced Wednesday, Columbia 
University will also use half of the building as a biotechnology center. 
The university had wanted to tear down the Audubon Ballroom in Washington 
Heights, where Malcolm X was slain 25 years ago, but agreed to the compromise 
under pressure from a citywide coalition of black activists.
