FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Puma deficit deepens to DM69m
Losses at Puma, the German-based sports goods manufacturer which has been
reorganised, more than quintupled last year to DM68.8m (Dollars 39m)
compared with a DM12m loss in 1992.
The group blamed the costs of rationalisation measures. These gave rise to
extraordinary restructuring charges of DM60.5m at the parent company level.
Excluding licence income, turnover dropped by 11 per cent last year to
DM457.6m following DM512.8m in 1992. Including licence revenue, group
turnover rose by 1 per cent to DM1.18bn.
