FT  07 JUL 93 / Receiverships fall by 30% in quarter
THE NUMBER of receiverships in England, Wales and Scotland fell more than 30
per cent to 663 in the second quarter of the year, making the third
consecutive quarterly decline, according to figures published yesterday by
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
The details corroborate figures on administration and receivership
appointments circulated by Touche Ross this week, which show an average of
55 each week for the three months to June, half the rate for 1991.
