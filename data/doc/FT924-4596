FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Puerto Rico's fears about Nafta eased
PUERTO RICAN fears that the island's export markets in the US will be
damaged by Mexico's participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta) have been eased significantly.
Instead, there are clear indications that the impending trade pact could
bring significant benefit to the island.
Puerto Rico sold goods to the US last year valued at about Dollars 17bn
(Pounds 11.1bn), accounting for 85 per cent of its total exports. But
government officials and economists in the US Caribbean possession had
feared that earnings would be reduced because of direct competition from a
more cost-efficient Mexico in Nafta.
A study commissioned by the island's development bank, however, has
concluded that, if Nafta were to be implemented, Puerto Rico would have a
clear advantage over Mexico in the US and Canadian markets in
pharmaceuticals, electronic components and accessories, professional
instruments, electronic computing and rum distilling.
This conclusion, said the study by US consultants KPMG Peat Marwick, is
based on comparisons of the return on investments in Mexico and Puerto Rico.
'In pharmaceuticals, the estimated rate of return to a Puerto Rican
investment. . . . is about 65 per cent, whereas after Nafta the rate of
return to an investment in Mexico making the same product for the US market
is about 32 per cent,' said the study.
It suggested, however, that Puerto Rico would be hard put to compete
successfully with Mexico in some sectors. In clothing, for example, the rate
of return on investments in Mexico would be 50 per cent with the
implementation of Nafta, while the rate in Puerto Rico would be 30 per cent.
There would be similar disadvantages for textile, tuna and leather footwear
industries.
