FT  13 JAN 94 / Clark happy with the way he was treated at Scott inquiry
Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister and an important witness at the
Scott inquiry yesterday, distanced himself from Lord Howe's comments by
saying he had been treated 'fairly and with great courtesy' during his
testimony last month, Peter Marsh writes. He added that his spell giving
evidence had been 'exhausting but not in any way disagreeable'. Refusing to
say whether Lord Howe had spoken to him before making his comments, Mr Clark
said he wanted to leave any general remarks about the investigation until it
had ended.
