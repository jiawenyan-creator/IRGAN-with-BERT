FT  31 MAR 94 / Guatemala and rebels in rights accord
Guatemala's government and leftist rebels have signed a human rights accord
which boosts hopes of ending 33 years of civil war by the end of this year,
Reuter reports from Mexico City.
Under the accord, a UN human rights mission will be set up inside Guatemala
as soon as possible and will visit any part of the country and demand
information at any time from the army and the government.
The agreement, reached in Mexico City on Tuesday after five days of talks,
ends almost three years of talks aimed at improving Guatemala's human rights
record, one of the worst in Latin America.
More than 100,000 people have been killed and another 40,000 'disappeared'
since the war began in the early 1960s.
'This is a huge advance. It is the first major agreement signed in the peace
process,' said Mr Marrack Goulding, the UN under-secretary-general for
political affairs.
He said the United Nations would send down a preliminary team to prepare the
ground for the mission.
Guatemala's warring sides also agreed on a broad agenda for talks aiming at
definitive peace accords by December.
