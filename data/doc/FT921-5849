FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Net profits at Rabobank advance
to Fl 1bn
RABOBANK, the Dutch co-operative bank, posted a 4.2 per cent rise in net
profit last year, about half the rate of growth seen in 1990.
Net profits increased to slightly more than Fl 1bn (Dollars 312.5m) from Fl
971m in 1990, when profit had shown an 8.1 per cent rise.
The Netherlands' second-largest bank, which is not listed on the Amsterdam
bourse, said that it was likely to register some profit growth in 1992,
despite an expected lower rate of lending which was caused by the slowdown
in the economy.
Gross profits in 1991 were up 8 per cent at Fl 2.18bn.
Higher taxes and a bigger allocation to general provisions against risks
accounted for the slower rate of growth at the net profit level.
Rabobank described 1991 as a satisfactory year on balance, noting that
banking activity and lending were barely affected by the less favourable
performance of the Dutch economy.
Lending to the private sector showed a 9.6 per cent rise in 1991, down only
slightly from the 10.2 per cent increase in 1990.
However, Rabobank's costs rose faster than revenue, due mainly to higher pay
awards in the Netherlands' banking sector.
Total costs were up 13.8 per cent at Fl 4.39bn while total revenue posted an
11.8 per cent gain to Fl 6.57bn.
Rabobank, which is pursuing a cost-cutting programme, said costs were
expected to show a slower rate of growth in 1992 than in 1991.
