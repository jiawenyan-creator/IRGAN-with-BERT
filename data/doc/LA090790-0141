TONIGHT'S FEATURED GAMES; 
TROY VS. RANCHO ALAMITOS 
1989 RECORDS -- Troy 7-4, Rancho Alamitos 4-6. 
SITE -- Fullerton High School. 
TROY UPDATE -- Offense, offense and more offense. Troy has Greg Windle, the top 
quarterback in the Freeway League, and Steve Friedrich, one of the top 
receivers. 
Two other targets for Windle will be Chad Hartford and Ryan Russell, both 
all-league second-team receivers last season. Chad Brasington, a 6-1, 195-pound 
senior, will give Troy a solid rushing attack, running behind an offensive line 
that returns five starters. In all, Troy returns 15 starters. 
RANCHO ALAMITOS UPDATE -- Like Troy, Rancho Alamitos also returns a solid 
nucleus, with nine offensive and eight defensive players back. But the Vaqueros 
will sorely miss running back Dana Riddle, a workhorse who carried the ball 381 
times last season. All-league players Tim Starke (linebacker) and Leonard Sims 
(offensive tackle) also offer support. The Vaqueros will be inexperienced at 
quarterback with Chris Singletary, who broke his leg on the first game of the 
season last year. College scouts tab Singletary as a prospect at linebacker, 
though. 
KEY TO THE GAME -- Rancho Alamitos' secondary will be run ragged by Windle's 
strong arm and the quick Troy receivers. Rancho Alamitos' lack of depth (only 
32 players on varsity) could produce some tired players in the fourth quarter. 
CONSENSUS -- Is Troy a contender or a pretender? The Warriors want to challenge 
Sunny Hills for the Freeway League title (again) this year, and a victory in 
the season opener will get them off on the right foot.
