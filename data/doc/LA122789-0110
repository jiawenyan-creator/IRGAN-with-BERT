WORLD; 
NICARAGUA TO DELAY U.S. SUPPLIES 
Protesting about U.S. conduct toward its citizens and interests in Panama, 
Nicaragua has decided to delay delivery of supplies to the U.S. Embassy in 
Managua, the Foreign Ministry said today. 
It said Nicaragua will not allow a U.S. plane that supplies the embassy in 
Managua every month to land until Jan. 19, delaying its arrival from Jan. 11. 
It added that if more than 165 Nicaraguans wanting to leave Panama have not 
left the country by tonight, the supply plane will not land in Nicaragua until 
Jan. 26.
