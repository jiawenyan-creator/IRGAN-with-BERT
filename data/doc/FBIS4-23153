<F P=106> [Interview with Constitutional Assembly Chairman and ANC </F>
General Secretary Cyril Ramaphosa by RAPPORT correspondent 
Hanlie Retief in the "Hanlie Retief's People" column] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Retief] When you recently did 
not get the post of deputy president, and later decided not to 
accept a cabinet post as minister of foreign affairs, it sent 
shockwaves through the country. Did you realize what the 
consequences would be? 
  [Ramaphosa] I think people did not really consider what is 
important for the organization. They wanted me to be in the 
cabinet. I went further than that, and now I have two posts 
that I will try to balance. 
  [Retief] Will you be able to do that? 
  [Ramaphosa] I think I will be successful. 
  [Retief] So what you are saying to me is: I was big enough 
to further party interests and not Cyril Ramaphosa's. 
  [Ramaphosa] Yes, the party's. [passage omitted] 
  [Retief] When you sat there on Tuesday morning before the 
biggest gathering of political forces in the country, and as 
chairman of that gathering, it must have been a good feeling. 
  [Ramaphosa] Yes, it made me feel wonderful. It is also an 
enormous challenge -- an extremely big challenge. 
  [Retief] And does it compensate for the defeat in the race 
for deputy president? 
  [Ramaphosa] Was it ever a race? 
<H5>  True Story </H5>
  [Retief] So tell me the true story ... 
  [Ramaphosa] In the end President Mandela decided for 
himself. 
There is work for us on various fronts, inside the cabinet, 
inside parliament, and outside. I naturally wanted to create a 
good balance. Now I am in parliament as chairman of the 
Constitutional Assembly, but I am also outside parliament as 
secretary general of the ANC. 
  [Retief] Come now. You must have been disappointed when you 
did not get the post? 
  [Ramaphosa] Well...disappointment is not the issue. Rather, 
it is a question of where the organization wants to use you. 
  [Retief] But Mr. Ramaphosa, you have lots of ambition.... 
  [Ramaphosa] You see, even as far as ambition is concerned in 
an organization like the ANC it rather becomes a question of 
application. You are used for a specific task. 
  [Retief] So you are telling me that you do not even possess 
a 
little personal ambition? 
  [Ramaphosa] Of course I have, but in this case because it is 
in the best interest of the country you focus more on how you 
can best be used in the service of the country. 
  [Retief] Some say you just took a calculated risk in saying 
no to a cabinet post and that you are not completely out of the 
running for president.... 
  [Ramaphosa] That is speculation. 
  [Retief] And what do you say about this speculation? 
  [Ramaphosa] I only serve the movement -- I serve the people. 
I will do whatever they ask of me. The ANC caucus unanimously 
decided that I should be chairman of the Constitutional 
Assembly. They even applauded this. That was the wish of the 
people. 
  [Retief] But you are excluded from cabinet -- from cabinet 
decisions ... 
  [Ramaphosa] No, no, I do not have to be there. In any case, 
I would have been severely limited. Now things are nicely 
balanced. I can now work in the ANC office, be in parliament, 
and in the Constitutional Assembly. 
<H5>  Leadership </H5>
  [passage omitted] [Retief] Now, about the Constitutional 
Assembly: In a sense the chairman is prevented from actively 
participating in the debates. Will this limit you? 
  [Ramaphosa] No, absolutely not. I am an ANC man. I will 
further ANC policy. I will obviously be fair to all people as 
chairman. So...this man's mouth will not be silenced. 
  [Retief] Will the new constitution differ greatly from the 
present one in your opinion? What is your comment? 
  [Ramaphosa] One cannot speak for the Constitutional 
Assembly. 
  [Retief] But your opinion? 
  [Ramaphosa] It is a very important body. The two houses will 
come together to write the constitution and, in that sense, one 
cannot predict what will happen. It is a gathering of big 
talent, divergent views. Everything must flow smoothly. 
  [Retief] But what aspects would you like to see changed? 
  [Ramaphosa] There are a few, like the way in which 
provincial 
governments function. It is a new field for all of us but we 
must explore it. I think the Human Rights Charter must be 
strengthened. The functions of cabinet should also be reviewed. 
<H5>  Constitution </H5>
  [Ramaphosa] We are going to tackle it as if we are writing a 
whole new constitution. We are going to start from the 
beginning. We are going to look at the important aspects, and 
the ANC will not run over other groups. We have two years at 
our disposal. I think it can be done within a year. 
  [Retief] Parties like the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and 
the 
NP [National Party] would still like to see strong federal 
concepts in the new constitution. How do you feel about this? 
  [Ramaphosa] They should not be scared to state their views. 
They should not hesitate. We are looking for really good debate 
in the Assembly. In the end, certainly, we will have a 
constitution with federal characteristics as well as unitary 
characteristics. 
  [Retief] Good, but what is your view on a strengthening of 
federalism? 
  [Ramaphosa] I am not a federalist, neither am I in favor of 
applying only unitary policies. I am in favor of a combination 
of the two. To the extent to which one needs strong federal 
government -- I support federal characteristics. To the extent 
where at central level you have to ensure that you can 
coordinate matters effectively -- well then, I am in favor of 
unitary policies. 
  [Retief] Would you like to see the concept of a government 
of 
national unity continuing in the new constitution? 
  [Ramaphosa] From an ANC point of view, no. Definitely not. 
We must have a democratic election so that leaders who have 
majority support will hold cabinet portfolios. 
  [Retief] Will the functions of the Constitutional Assembly 
not be just a repetition of the negotiating council with the 
planning committee as its driving force? 
  [Ramaphosa] No, we will have continuous consultations on a 
formal level, something the negotiating council did not make 
provision for. One of my chief tasks will be to ensure that the 
constitution writing process is not only legal, right from the 
very beginning, but to see that it is also representative. I 
want divergent views from all our community structures to be 
placed on the table -- open and transparent. People should feel 
that the constitution belongs to them -- it is theirs. That is 
what we have to do. [passage omitted]
