Longshoring and Marine Terminals



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Labor.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; notice of informal public hearings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28594) to revise its Safety
and Health Regulations for Longshoring and, to a far lesser extent, to amend its Safety and Health Regulations for
Marine Terminals. The proposed rule covers cargo handling and related activities conducted aboard vessels and at
Marine Terminals. The proposed amendments to the Marine Terminals standard are intended primarily to provide regulatory
consistency with the proposed Longshoring ship-board rules.



The June 2, 1994 notice and subsequent correction notice on June 13, 1994 (59 FR 30389) announced the cities and dates
for three informal rulemaking hearings that will be held on all issues raised by the proposal. The dates of these hearings
have been changed. This notice sets the new dates and specific locations of the informal public hearings to be held
as part of the rulemaking process. In addition, it extends the original date for the submission of Notices of Intention
to Appear by three weeks and reduces the time frame for the submission of documentary evidence and the text of lengthy
testimony from 21 days to 14 days prior to the date of the hearing where the evidence will be presented.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Written comments on the standard must be postmarked on or before September 23, 1994.



Notices of intention to appear at the informal public hearings must be postmarked by September 14, 1994.

The hearings will begin at 9:30 a.m. and be held in the following cities, beginning on the following dates:

Charleston, South Carolina on October 4, 5 and 6, 1994.

Seattle, Washington on October 19, 20 and 21, 1994.

New Orleans, Louisiana on November 15, 16 and 17, 1994.

prior to the date of the hearing to be attended as follows:

Charleston, South Carolina: postmarked by September 20, 1994;
