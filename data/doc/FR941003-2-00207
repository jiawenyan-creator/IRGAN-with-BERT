Notice.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 303 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, as amended, USTR is required to publish annually the National
Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE). With this notice, the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC)
is requesting interested parties to assist it in identifying significant barriers to U.S. exports of goods, services
and overseas direct investment for inclusion in the NTE. Particularly important are impediments materially affecting
the actual and potential financial performance of an industry sector. The TPSC invites written comments which provide
views relevant to the issues to be examined in preparing the NTE.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Public comments are due at USTR not later than noon on November 1, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Submissions should contain descriptions of any or all of the following nine categories of foreign trade barriers:



(1) import policies (e.g., tariffs and other import charges, quantitative restrictions, import licensing, and
customs barriers); 

(2) standards, testing, labeling, and certification (including unnecessarily restrictive application of phytosanitary
standards, refusal to accept U.S. manufacturers' self-certification of conformance to foreign product standards,
and environmental restrictions); 

(3) discriminatory government procurement practices (e.g., ``buy national'' policies and closed bidding); 

(4) export subsidies (e.g., export financing on preferential terms and agricultural export subsidies that displace
U.S. exports in third country markets); 

(5) lack of intellectual property protection (e.g., inadequate patent, copyright, and trademark regimes); 

(6) services barriers (e.g., limits on the range of financial services offered by foreign financial institutions,
regulation of international data flows, restrictions on the use of data processing, and quotas on imports of foreign
films); 

(7) investment barriers (e.g., limitations on foreign equity participation and on access to foreign government-funded
RD consortia, local content, technology transfer and export requirements, and restrictions on repatriation
of earnings, capital, fees and royalties); 

(8) anticompetitive practices tolerated by foreign governments (including anticompetitive activities of both
state-owned and private firms which apply to services or to goods and which restrict the sale of U.S. products to any
firm, not just to the foreign firms that perpetuate the practices); and 

(9) other barriers (i.e., barriers that encompass more than one category listed above or that affect a single sector).


In comparison with last year's report, this year we are adding a new category, anti-competitive practices, to the
NTE. In addition, the standards category will now encompass restrictive foreign environmental practices, and the
investment category will cover restrictions on U.S. access to foreign government-funded research and development
(RD) consortia. 

Submissions should contain estimates of the potential increase in exports that would result from the removal of the
barrier, as well as a clear discussion of the method(s) by which the estimates were computed. Estimates should fall
within the following value ranges: less than $5 million; $5 to $25 million; $25 million to $50 million; $50 million
to $100 million; $100 million to $500 million; or over $500 million.

Please note that interested parties discussing barriers in more than one country should provide a separate submission
for each country.
