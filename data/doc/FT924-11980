FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: 'Acceptable' buyer sought for Cherry
Blossom
Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade, has accepted
undertakings from Sara Lee Corporation and Sara Lee Household &amp; Personal
Care that it will sell the Cherry Blossom shoe polish brand to an
'acceptable' buyer within 12 months, writes Peter Pearse.
Sara Lee already owned the Kiwi brand and acquired Cherry Blossom and other
brands from Reckitt &amp; Colman in October 1991. The MMC concluded that owning
both the dominant brands would create adverse effects on competition.
The MMC was particularly concerned with the 'self-selection' market saying
that the Cherry Blossom acquisition had lifted Sara Lee's share of that
market segment from 44 to 74 per cent.
This could provide the group with scope to increase prices substantially
before putting its high market share at risk, it suggested.
