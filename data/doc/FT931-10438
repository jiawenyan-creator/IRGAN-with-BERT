FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Setback for ABSA as executive
departs
AMALGAMATED Banks of South Africa (ABSA), South Africa's largest bank,
yesterday suffered a severe setback with the announcement that the services
of one of its most senior executives, Mr Bob Aldworth, had been 'terminated
with immediate effect'.
A terse announcement from ABSA said 'this action is the result of
investigations into certain irregularities within the ABSA group'. Mr
Aldworth has also been stripped of his ABSA group directorships.
Industry analysts were unable last night to explain Mr Aldworth's fate. He
had only recently been appointed the executive director, marketing, for the
corporate banking division, making him one of the four most senior
executives in the group.
The loss is a double blow to ABSA as his banking skills were not only rare
in a group where many senior executives have a building society background,
but he had the important task of increasing ABSA's share of the corporate
market which badly lags its overall market share.
Following the recent retirement of another senior ABSA executive, Mr Piet
Liebenberg, Mr Aldworth's departure will fuel speculation as to whether ABSA
now has the managerial acumen to complete the ambitious rationalisation
programme set in train following a series of mergers in 1991 and 1992.
This is not the first occasion that Mr Aldworth has been forced to step down
from a senior executive position. In 1982, when managing director of the
then Barclays Bank operation in South Africa (now First National Bank), Mr
Aldworth resigned following allegations about his private life.
ABSA's last published results - for the six months ended September 1992 -
showed a 14 per cent advance in net profits to R293.8m (Dollars 94.2m).
