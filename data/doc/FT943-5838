FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swedish mortgage group to
de-mutualise
Stadshypotek, Sweden's largest mortgage credit institute, yesterday launched
a SKr3bn share issue to convert it from a co-operative organisation into a
profit-orientated listed company.
The offer, one of the biggest de-mutualisation projects carried out in
Sweden, is being made to 760,000 Stadshypotek borrowers who will be allowed
to waive subscription rights in favour of domestic and international
institutions.
Borrowers will be eligible, according to the size of their mortgages, to
subscribe for shares at a price of SKr80 per share. They will also receive
one matching share free for every share they buy from Stadshypotekskassan
(the Urban Mortgage Bank), the trustee fund which currently owns 100 per
cent of Stadshypotek.
The shares are expected to have a pro forma net asset value of about SKr125.
Stadshypotek can also issue a further 4.5m shares at market prices to
Swedish and foreign institutions if the initial offer is a success.
The subscription period for the initial offer starts on September 26.
If fully taken up, the offer to borrowers will leave UMB with a 36.2 stake
in Stadshypotek. Under current legislation, UMB's holding is due to be wound
up by the year 2002.
