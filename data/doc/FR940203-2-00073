ACTION:

 Extension of the public comment period for scoping on an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS); Wild and Scenic River
Study, Squirrel River, Alaska. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Kobuk District Office, Alaska, is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement
for the study of the Squirrel River for possible inclusion in the national wild and scenic rivers system. The Notice
of Intent to proceed with the EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 29, 1993. Because of a delay for communities in northwestern Alaska receiving notice of the comment period
for scoping on the EIS, the period for public comment is extended until 30 days from the publication of this Notice.
These comments and others will be used in preparation of a draft EIS. An additional opportunity for public comment
will be held after the draft EIS is published. 



The Squirrel River study was authorized by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of December 2, 1980
(ANILCA, Pub. L. 96487). The Squirrel River, a tributary of the Kobuk River in northwest Alaska, was studied
in 1985 by the National Park Service (NPS) for possible inclusion in the national wild and scenic river system. After
publication of a draft EIS, further action by NPS was deferred for several reasons. One of these reasons included the
delegation of authority to BLM to conduct wild and scenic river studies on rivers under its management. 

The proposed action in the NPS study called for designation of the federally-administered portion of the Squirrel
River, plus the lower 6 miles of the river's North Fork and the lower 15 miles of the Omar River. BLM is now proceeding
at the scoping level in order to obtain maximum public input on the study. Preliminary review of the draft EIS published
by NPS in 1985 indicates potential issues may now include mineral development in the region, identification of transportation
corridors, and subsistence lifeways in the area. Information received as a result of current scoping on this action
will be used to update the NPS draft EIS and produce a new Squirrel River draft EIS.
