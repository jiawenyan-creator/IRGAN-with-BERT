FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - At a
Glance
Five years ago on Monday, the world's stock markets collapsed. It was
perhaps the day when the 1980s free-market dream turned sour. Could it all
happen again? Now that the world economy has gone through its recent
traumas, the crash of '87 can be reassessed. Its causes, its place in
economic history and the lessons to be drawn from it receive special
attention in the autumn issue of the FT Quarterly Review of Personal
Finance, to be published with next Friday's paper and repeated with
Saturday's. The Review also includes a survey on Unit Trusts.
