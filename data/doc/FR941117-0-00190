 

(1) The obligated person concept.

 The Proposed Amendments defined a significant obligor as ``any person who, directly or indirectly, is the source
of 20 percent or more of the cash flow servicing the obligations on the municipal security.'' The proposed definition
generated a significant amount of comment, including concerns that it could be interpreted to include significant
taxpayers and customers,

60

 credit enhancers (including banks that are letter of credit providers and insurers providing bond insurance),

61

 providers of guaranteed investment contracts,

62

 as well as state and federal governments that provide revenue sharing, grant, state and local aid and other cofinancing
arrangements.

63

 Commenters raised technical concerns as to the appropriate percentage of repayment obligation necessary to trigger
inclusion in the definition of significant obligor,

64

 and when the percentages were to be measured.

65

 Some commenters also expressed concern that, in the bond pool context, the definition of significant obligor may
not have permitted sufficient flexibility in determining which obligors in a pool would be the subject of the requirement
to provide information on an ongoing basis.

Commenters suggested a number of modifications to the significant obligor concept. First, a number of commenters
indicated that the definition of significant obligor should include a requirement that a contractual relationship
exist between the obligor and the repayment of the obligation before a continuing information obligation is imposed.

67

 Second, commenters recommended modifying the definition to include different percentages of cash flow, ranging
from a low of no threshold to a high of 50% of cash flow.

68

 Third, some commenters suggested replacing the entire definition of significant obligor with the concept of materiality,
in which the issuer and the other offering participants would determine, on a continuing basis, whose information
would be provided.

between the entity making payments and the financing, customers and taxpayers, having no connection to or responsibility
in connection with the financing would not inadvertently be swept within the scope of the definition.

As suggested by a number of commenters, the amendments eliminate the reference to significant obligor.

70

 Instead, the amendments include a definition of ``obligated person,'' which means a person (including an issuer
of separate securities) that is committed by contract or other arrangement structured to support payment of all or
part of the obligations on the municipal securities.

71

 By including a nexus to the financing through a commitment that is structured to support the payment obligations,
the amendments address concerns raised by many commenters that the term ``source of cash flow'' in the definition
of significant obligor was overbroad and could encompass persons with no relationship to the financing.

72

 The requirement for a contractual or other arrangement will assist Participating Underwriters in identifying the
persons for which information should be provided pursuant to an undertaking.

Some commenters recommended that the commitment with respect to payment of the obligation on the securities consist
of a contractual obligation to and enforceable by bondholders.

73

 Instead, the definition includes a broader notion of a contract or arrangement that is structured to ``support payment,''
without specifying that it run to bondholders. The definition is intended to include contracts or arrangements where
payments are made either to bondholders, to issuers to be used to pay obligations on municipal securities, or through
conduit structures.

74

 Similarly, the reference to ``obligations on municipal securities'' is intended to be broad enough to cover debt
obligations, lease payments and any other repayment obligation on or resulting from the municipal securities.

For example, if all or a portion of a project financed by bonds is used by a party that has committed, by contract or other
arrangement (written or oral) to pay for such use, and such payments support payment of debt service on the bonds (as
structured at the time of issuance), continuing information on the party would be appropriate. Accordingly, parties
that support debt service through payments under a lease, loan, installment sale agreement, or other contract relating
to use of a project are included in the definition, regardless of whether the financing is a conduit arrangement (such
as a non-recourse loan to a manufacturer to finance acquisition of a new facility or to a hospital to acquire equipment)
or system or project financing (such as a lease to a particular carrier of a terminal in an airport system or sale of the
output of a facility pursuant to a take-or-pay (or take-and-pay) contract). Major customers purchasing power from
a municipal light department that, in turn, is under a take-or-pay contract with a joint action public power agency
would not be included in the definition, although the municipal light department would likely be included in the definition.
Similarly, major taxpayers in a municipal general obligation issue would not be included in the definition; however,
an undertaking covering a developer that is the sole landowner in a development district assessment financing in
which the future collection of assessments to service the borrowing is dependent upon the developer as part of the
structure of the financing may be appropriate. 

</FOOTNOTE>


As was the case with the proposed significant obligor concept, the term ``obligated persons'' includes, but is broader
than, the concept of issuers of separate securities under Rule 131 pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities
Act'')

75

 and Exchange Act Rule 3b5.

76

 Also, in response to comments raised that the terms ``issuer'' or ``significant obligor'' do not sufficiently address
financings in which the source of repayment is not a separate person or entity, but a dedicated revenue stream from
a specified project, segregated tax revenues or other enterprise, fund or account,

77

 the definition includes persons which are obligated generally, such as with full recourse to the person, or, in a more
limited manner, such as through an enterprise, fund or account of such person, including a dedicated revenue stream.
As noted above, the obligation to provide information must cover all such enterprises, funds or accounts, whether
or not there is a separate entity. In such a case, the information undertaking could be provided by the governmental
unit or financing authority of which the enterprise, fund or account is a part.

78

 For example, a Participating Underwriter could accept an information undertaking from a state issuing bonds secured
solely by funds collected under a special tax, to report financial information relating to the special tax; for issues
supported both by contracts of assistance of separate authorities or funds in addition to the issuer's own revenues,
undertakings from the separate authorities, as well as the issuer could be provided. Accordingly, although the definition
of significant obligor has been eliminated, that modification does not reflect a change in the Commission's assessment
of the importance of ongoing information concerning the ultimate sources of payment on the securities.
