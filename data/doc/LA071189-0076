WALSH REPLACES OLSEN AS NBC FOOTBALL ANALYST 
Merlin Olsen is out as NBC's top football commentator and Bill Walsh, who has 
no broadcasting experience, will replace him. 
NBC made the surprising announcement Monday night after word came out of San 
Francisco that Walsh would resign as executive vice president of the San 
Francisco 49ers to take the NBC job. 
Friends of Olsen have said recently that the former Ram was tired of his 
commentating job and was looking to devote more time to an acting career. 
Also, Terry O'Neil, the new executive producer of NBC Sports, had been critical 
of Olsen in the past, when O'Neil was at CBS. 
What is most surprising about NBC's announcement is that the inexperienced 
Walsh, who last season coached the 49ers to a Super Bowl title, would 
immediately become NBC's No. 1 analyst. 
Walsh will be teamed with Dick Enberg. 
NBC had planned to announce the change at a news conference Saturday in Los 
Angeles. 
Walsh, 57, led the 49ers to three Super Bowl championships before quitting as 
head coach last January. 
He moved into the front office and was replaced as coach by George Seifert. 
Walsh's business manager, Stefan Kay, in an interview with San Francisco TV 
station KGO Monday, said: "Bill needs a challenge and missed coaching." 
Walsh's relationship with 49er owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. began to sour in 1987 
when Walsh was stripped of his title of team president after the 49ers lost in 
the first round of the playoffs for the third consecutive season. 
Walsh's record with the 49ers was 102-63-1. He also was head coach at Stanford 
and an assistant with the Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and San Diego 
Chargers. 
Walsh, DeBartolo and Olsen were unavailable for comment Monday night.
