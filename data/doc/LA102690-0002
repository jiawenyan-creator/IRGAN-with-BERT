JOSEPHSON ON ETHICS OF YOUTH 
It must be nice to sit in an office in Marina del Rey pontificating about 
what's wrong with the world while engaging in sanctimonious hyperbole about the 
decay of an entire generation of American youth. 
Josephson does not even identify what his role as a harbinger of ethical 
platitudes is. 
Is he a parent, a teacher, a worker, a manager or a business leader? Or is he 
just a brow-beater of the first order, ready in theory but lacking in 
implementation? 
Perhaps Josephson ought to spend more time in the front lines of life acting as 
a role model for my misguided generation. Then maybe he would look twice at 
himself before attacking people he doesn't even know or care to know.
