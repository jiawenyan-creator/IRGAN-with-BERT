FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: National Semi flat at Dollars
59m for quarter
National Semiconductor, the US chip maker, reported flat first
quarter-results, in spite of growth in sales of its core analog and mixed
signal products.
Net income of Dollars 59m, or 42 cents a share, compared with Dollars 52.2m,
or 37 cents, before an accounting change in the same period last year. Sales
declined to Dollars 553.8m from Dollars 558.9m.
In the first fiscal quarter last year, National reported an additional
one-time gain of Dollars 4.9m, or 4 cents a share, due to a change in
inventory accounting.
'Although overall results for the quarter were essentially flat with the
previous year, we continued to show good performance in our core analog and
mixed signal businesses which now represent more than half of our total
sales and are the focus for our future growth,' said Mr Gilbert Amelio,
president and chief executive.
Analog and mixed signal chips (which incorporate both digital and analog
circuits) are widely used in consumer electronics, automotive,
telecommunications and computer applications.
Mr Amelio said first-quarter results reflected a summer slowdown in orders,
amplified by lower demand for products such as bipolar logic, used in
desktop computers and large computer systems.
Sales of bipolar logic declined to 8 per cent of total sales, compared with
13 per cent for the first quarter of the previous fiscal year.
