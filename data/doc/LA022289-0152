P.M. BRIEFING; 
SAMMY DAVIS JR. COOKS UP SIDELINE 
Sammy Davis Jr., who stars with Gregory Hines in the current movie "Tap," is 
starting a new line -- a line of food products. 
Davis will hit supermarket shelves in April with his own brand of barbecue 
sauce, chili and mustard. The products will appear first in Pennsylvania and 
Ohio, then go national in the fall. "The mustard is tangy, but not too hot," 
said Davis. "The sauce has a nice little twang to it, but not too much, enough 
so that you can taste it." Davis' venture into cuisine follows a similar move 
by actor Paul Newman, whose face appears on his popcorn, spaghetti sauce, 
lemonade and salad dressing.
