FOR THE RECORD 
Si Frumkin -- A display quote was incorrectly attributed in Thursday's View 
section. 
It was Zev Yaroslavsky who said, "The problem (with the Jewish Establishment) 
was not fear of our actions' effect on Jews in the Soviet Union. It was ego, 
turf and bureaucracy. We were making news."
