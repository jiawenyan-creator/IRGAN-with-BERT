FT  17 DEC 94 / Berkshire opposes shake-up proposal
Berkshire County Council's policy committee yesterday decided to seek
judicial review of the proposal to split the county into five unitary
authorities.
The council had previously worked with the county's districts on a plan to
split it into four unitary authorities - which combine the functions of
districts and counties.
But councillors say that the plan for five unitary authorities would be too
expensive. The Local Government Commission, which announced the plan on
Thursday, estimated that its proposed structure would create extra
administrative costs of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 7m.
Berkshire wants residents to be canvassed on whether to retain the status
quo.
Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission, described previous attempts by
counties to seek judicial review as a 'waste of public money', and none of
his recommendations has yet been overturned by the courts.
