FT  25 MAR 94 / China 'rethink'
The Clinton administration sent new signals yesterday that it would consider
ending what has become an annual battle with China over human rights and
trade, Reuter reports from Washington. But it stressed this could not happen
unless China met minimum US demands for 'significant progress' on human
rights before President Bill Clinton decides on June 3 whether to extend
most favoured nation (MFN) trade benefits.
Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state, told a Senate foreign
relations panel: 'In the future we hope the annual debate on MFN would be
less central to our China policy.'
