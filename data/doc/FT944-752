FT  23 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: US link talk lifts C&amp;W
Bolstered by talk of a possible deal with US telecoms giant AT&amp;T, shares in
Cable and Wireless continued to improve, moving forward 5 to 381p in 6.7m
turnover.
Speculation suggests that the group's hard pressed Mercury subsidiary has
become the focus of AT&amp;T's expansion plans following this week's granting of
a licence allowing the US group to offer a full range of telephone services
in the UK.
Past link-up talks between the two groups have foundered. But the severe
price and volume squeeze under way at Mercury, which is widely estimated to
face a 10 per cent fall in operating profits in 1995, is said to be putting
urgent impetus behind the present discussions.
According to one whisper, C&amp;W is about to split Mercury into two companies -
services and network - and that AT&amp;T is prepared to buy up to 30 per cent of
Mercury's network operations. These, according to Nomura Securities, have a
basic value of around Dollars 1.2bn.
This week C&amp;W has outperformed the market, having lagged behind by around a
fifth on a 12-month view.
