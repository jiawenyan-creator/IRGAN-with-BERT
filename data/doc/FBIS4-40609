  [Text] Bonn June 17 TASS -- "The Russian-German military- 
technical cooperation should not lag behind the interstate 
relations," Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin told a news 
conference here today after meeting German Defence Minister 
Volker Ruehe. 
  "It was a saturated and constructive conversation to state 
we 
are almost ready to discuss the conclusion of a Russian-German 
intergovernmental agreement on termination of dangerous military 
activities whose draft has been prepared," said the speaker. 
  I have invited Volker Ruehe to visit a military settlement 
in 
my hometown of Volgograd together with Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev. The settlement is housing officers and soldiers 
of the 8th Guard Army, the former 62th Army of Marshal V. 
Chuikov. It is being built with participation of German firms. 
I am glad to say they are working well. The army was not 
withdrawn without proper accommodation. It is a good example of 
Russian-German fruitful cooperation." 
  In his turn, the German defence minister told the news 
conference he has accepted the invitation to visit Volgograd 
with pleasure. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about his attitude to the upcoming 
Russian 
signing of the Partnership for Peace program in Brussels on 
Wednesday, the minister said he is very glad this will be done. 
  Describing the NATO-Russian relations, he said that European 
stability cannot be achieved without Russia. This country 
cannot be treated as Albania or Tajikistan, he said. The 
minister noted the upcoming Russian-German naval exercises in 
the Baltic Sea and other exercises scheduled for future. He 
said none would believe this is possible two years ago. 
  On the same day the State Duma delegation met Bundesrat head 
Klaus Wedemeier and State Minister in the German Foreign 
Ministry Helmut Schaefer.
