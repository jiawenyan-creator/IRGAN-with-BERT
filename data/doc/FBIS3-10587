  [Text] Aruba can remain part of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands after 1 January 1996. But the Lower Chamber does 
want the island to take a number of measures in order to greatly 
improve the standard of government. 
  Minister Hirsch Ballin (Netherlands Antilles and Aruban 
affairs) was pleased yesterday evening by Parliament's response. 
"The protracted mock battle on possible independence is no 
solution to the problems which Aruba is currently facing." 
  CDA [Christian Democrat Appeal] deputy Bijleveld-Schouten 
yesterday summarized the position: "Sound and honest government 
in Aruba is of the utmost importance. Also with regard to the 
situation in the Netherlands Antilles." 
  The date for independence of 1 January 1996 was laid down in 
the Kingdom statutes when Aruba broke away from the Netherlands 
Antilles in 1986 and achieved separate status. Aruba does not 
now want independence as the island fears that it will cause 
foreign investors to pull out. Next week the Upper House must 
decide whether Aruba will be allowed to remain within the 
Kingdom.
