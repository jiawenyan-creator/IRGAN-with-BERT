  [Text] Tehran, June 22, IRNA -- A morning English daily 
here Wednesday [22 June] criticized the support of some of the 
Western governments for the terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq 
Organization (MKO) and argued that the said countries were as 
much responsible for the last Monday's tragedy in Mashhad as the 
MKO themselves. 
  The `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial referred to the tragedy 
of bombing in Imam Reza (as) [expansion unknown] mausoleum in 
Khorasan Province, committed by the MKO, and noted that the 
terrorist group has always been enjoying the support of the 
Western governments. 
  The ironic aspect of the case, it added, was that Iran has 
constantly been accused by the Western countries and their 
regional allies of supporting the terrorist groups. 
  The Islamic Republic has often been the target of terrorist 
acts by MKO and has offered many martyrs from among the 
government authorities and the commom people in connection with 
blind acts of terrorism committed by the MKO who now have been 
forced to deny their involvement due to the horrible extent of 
the recent crime, added the paper. 
  Thus the present occasion would seem to be a proper moment 
to 
ask the Western countries and their allies "whether their blind 
support for this terrorist group accords with the principle of 
justice." 
  The Western governments have not only condoned the terrorist 
acts of MKO, but they have persisted in calling the Islamic 
Republic the supporter of terrorist groups, said the paper. 
  It noted in conclusion that as the crime was the most 
obvious 
form of violation of the human rights by MKO, the Westerners, as 
the self-styled advocates of the human rights, should revise 
their past hypocritical approach (towards Iran) and deliver the 
culprits to the Iranian nation.
