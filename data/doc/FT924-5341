FT  27 NOV 92 / Judges seek curb on search orders
COURT ORDERS which direct defendants to allow plaintiffs to enter their
premises to search and seize documents and other evidence, known as Anton
Piller orders, should be placed on a statutory footing, a committee of
senior judges said yesterday.
The committee, set up by the Judges' Council to look at how the orders
operate, recommends they should still be available provided there are proper
safeguards.
The committee was set up following widespread concern that the procedure was
being abused. Anton Piller orders, first granted in 1974 but named after the
1976 case of Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Process, have acquired a body
of case law defining how and when they should be granted.
The judges say that at their best they protect plaintiffs' rights and so
promote the interests of justice. At their worst they can be oppressive and
prejudicial to defendants, whose businesses may be blighted and whose
privacy may be invaded without notice.
The complexity of obtaining the orders has also made them expensive for
plaintiffs. The judges are keen that any safeguards for defendants built
into the legislation should not make them more costly.
The committee, chaired by Lord Justice Staughton, recommends a number of
practical safeguards for defendants. These cover the making of an
application for an order, the execution of it, and the 'return date' on
which defendants can challenge the order in court.
