ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; 
SCHOOL BOARD VOTES TO HIRE AN AUDITOR 
The Orange Unified School District, still dogged by the shadow of a 
multimillion-dollar bid-rigging scandal uncovered several years ago, decided 
Thursday night to hire an internal auditor to investigate any allegations of 
wrongdoing in the district. 
The school board authorized spending up to $80,000 on the independent auditor. 
The auditor will report directly to the seven-member school board and not to 
the superintendent, an arrangement designed to try to restore credibility to 
the district, according to board president Sandy Englander. 
She said the auditor's duties will not be limited to investigating fiscal 
irregularities. 
"They will look into anything we (board members) want," Englander said. 
Three board members were accused by the 1986-87 Orange County Grand Jury of 
failing to supervise school district business adequately, thus allowing a 
contract bid-rigging scandal to take place in the early 1980s. 
The three are Joe Cherry, Ruth Evans and Robert J. Elliott. Their case is 
pending before Superior Court. The other four trustees, including Englander, 
were not on the board at the time. 
According to the grand jury and court documents, a school district employee in 
the early 1980s set up a scheme to rig school repair and construction 
contracts. The court documents alleged that millions of dollars in contracts 
went to selected contractors, who in turn gave kickbacks and other favors to 
the employee and his wife. MARIA NEWMAN
