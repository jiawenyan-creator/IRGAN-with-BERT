  [Text] Mito, March 14 KYODO -- Former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, under arrest for suspected bribery, 
told a city mayor to suspend a municipal project to build an 
education center, saying he should have been consulted first, 
informed sources said Monday [14 March]. 
  Nakamura, arrested last Friday after the Diet voted to lift 
his immunity, summoned Hiroshi Kanbayashi, mayor of Mitsukaido 
in Ibaraki Prefecture, to his political office and expressed 
anger at the project, the sources said. 
  The incident occurred last October 3 even though Nakamura 
had 
lost his cabinet place in the defeat of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) government in elections in August. 
  The city lies within the Ibaraki No. 3 constituency for 
which 
he sits in the House of Representatives. 
  Kanbayashi told KYODO NEWS SERVICE, "Although the project to 
build the center falls under the jurisdication of the city 
government, I could not refute his criticism as he abruptly 
forced his conclusion on me." 
  The sources quoted Nakamura as telling the mayor in an 
apparent expression of his disapproval, "Why did you decide to 
go ahead with such an important project without consulting me 
beforehand?" 
  Nakamura was apparantly angered at the news that the city 
government had picked a general contractor as the winning bidder 
for the 3.1 billion yen project without consulting him in 
advance, the sources said. 
  Kanbayashi asked for time to reconsider the matter. 
  In a session in September of the Mitsukaido Municipal 
Assembly, a questioner asked city officials why the city 
government had so quickly selected the contractor. 
  The project calls for completing the community center on the 
6,550-square-meter site in the year ending in March 1996. It is 
an exceptionally large project for the city, whose annual budget 
stands at around 13 billion yen.
