FT  23 DEC 94 / Oil spill in Mississippi River
A barge carrying crude oil hit an underwater object in the Mississippi
River, ripping a hole in one tank and spilling up to 21,000 gallons of crude
into the water. The oil spread about 6 miles downriver and reached shore at
various points as far as Meraux to Braithwaite, about 10 miles south of New
Orleans. Clean-up crews worked to contain the spill about a half mile
downriver of the ferry landing not far from the New Orleans-Chalmette city
limits. The Coast Guard closed the busy stretch of river to all marine
traffic.
