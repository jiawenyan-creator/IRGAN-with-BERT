FT  13 FEB 93 / Game boys and girls go out to play: Retailers cannot afford
to ignore the recession-proof teenage market
The generation that spent the 1960s and 1970s confounding and appalling its
elders now faces the embarrassment of not knowing the answer to this
question: what do the youth of today really want?
This week, the music industry, home to many a former flower child, admitted
that young customers were slipping away. Music suppliers' and distributors'
revenues dropped 2.4 per cent to Pounds 692.5m last year - the first fall
since 1980.
While music companies were not short of new compilations of old hits by Cher
and Pink Floyd, they said they had found little to enthuse today's
teenagers.
Some marketing experts admit to being mystified by teenagers' tastes. Mr
Richard Hyman, chairman of Verdict Research, a retail consultancy, says:
'One of the striking things about people of this age is they're a million
miles from being a homogenous group. The difference between a 14 and a
17-year-old is as big as the difference between a 17 and a 30-year-old.'
Yet the teenage market is not one that retailers and providers of leisure
goods can afford to ignore, not least because its spending power appears
unaffected either by the recession or the fall in the young population.
Research carried out late last year for EMAP, which publishes several
magazines for teenagers, including Smash Hits and Just 17, found that while
the number of young people aged 11-20 fell from 8.7m in 1986 to 7.3m last
year, their total disposable income had never been higher.
The EMAP survey found that the 11-20 age group had Pounds 9.4bn to spend -
19 per cent higher in real terms than in 1988. This did not include living
expenses such as rent and utilities, on which they spent an additional
Pounds 6.5bn.
EMAP's interviews with 532 under-20s found that they were leaving their
parents' homes later than in the 1980s. The company's research report said:
'This could be one of the ironies of the recession. It may well be that the
very reason kids have so much more disposable income is because they live at
home longer - and they live at home longer because they cannot afford to
move out.'
A more puzzling finding was that their recession-hit parents were giving
them more money. Average pocket money rose from Pounds 2.86 a week in 1988
to Pounds 10.10 last year. Girls did better with Pounds 11.20 a week,
compared with boys who got Pounds 9.10.
Miss Delyth Chapman, the author of the EMAP report, says she is not sure why
pocket money has proved so recession-resistant. 'Maybe kids have got a
little better at getting money out of their parents,' she says.
Miss Chapman says the biggest change in the past four years has been the
number of under-20s being paid by their parents to do odd jobs such as
washing the car. 'Chore money is now huge. It didn't exist four years ago.
During a recession, parents are more aware of the value of money, and they
are passing that attitude on to their children.'
The average 11-20 year-old has income from all sources of Pounds 46.50 a
week, of which Pounds 24.65 goes towards discretionary consumer spending,
according to the EMAP research. The rest goes on savings, living expenses or
contributions to the household.
So what do the young spend their money on? Much of it still goes on music,
despite the industry's current travails. Mr Simon Burke, managing director
of the retail arm of the Virgin group, says that young spenders still
account for half the music industry's turnover. He says: 'While it's fair to
say that the market has moved away from that age group in the past five
years, they are vital to us and they always will be.'
Much of the money that used to go on music is now spent on computer games.
Music retailers such as Virgin and W H Smith have been able to devote more
of their store space to computer games because of the decline of vinyl
records and their replacement by smaller compact discs. Mr Nigel Kenyon
Jones, general manager of music and computer games at W H Smith Retail,
says: 'It was a happy coincidence.'
Miss Chapman says that while the under-20s are big readers of magazines and
newspapers, books are not a high priority. 'I don't think book-reading has
been a major leisure occupation for some years,' she says.
Mrs Sally Brummitt, product group manager for children's books at W H Smith,
says girls read more than boys. Horror stories are popular, accounting for
15 of the company's top 20 teenage paperbacks.
'They're very similar to adult horror fiction - the covers have knives
sticking in doors - but they're not as violent or graphic. The protagonists
are teenagers and they're about ghost themes and being stalked,' she says.
Some teenagers move on to adult crime novels by Agatha Christie and Ruth
Rendell. W H Smith has found that even young teenagers didn't want to be
seen in the children's books section. 'We had to hide because Stevie and the
gang arrived,' one 13-year old said.
