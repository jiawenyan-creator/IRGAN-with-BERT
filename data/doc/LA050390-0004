FINDING COMMON GROUND TO END MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS 
The article by Cynthia Ozick on the story of two Jewish cousins who will never 
meet makes me sad (Op-Ed Page, April 17). She tells of anti-Semitism in Russia 
and by the Arabs. 
It sounds hopeless. Then I think about a Beyond War Award ceremony I attended 
last fall. One of the recipients was a village in Israel. In this village 
Palestinians and Jews are living together, working together, cooperating and 
relating to each other as very good friends. It was astounding to see how the 
Jewish and the Arab representatives of the village spoke of their respect and 
love for each other. 
If people are given half a chance they will work together. They will solve 
their mutual problems. I think that the best way that we can help people to 
work together is to provide the framework for nations to work together. We now 
try to solve things unilaterally. We should instead work to strengthen the 
United Nations. Then problems that cannot be resolved by individual people and 
nations would at least have a legal framework for doing so.
