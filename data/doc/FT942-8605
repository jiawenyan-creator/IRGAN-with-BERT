FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: CSM plans US purchase as profits
rise 12%
CSM, the Dutch-based food group, reported a 12.2 per cent rise in first-half
net profit and announced an agreement in principle to acquire a US company
to strengthen its ingredients sector.
Net profit rose to Fl 75.3m (Dollars 40.3m) in the six months to March 31
from Fl 67.1m in the first half of 1992-93. Sales in the period advanced by
9.1 per cent to Fl 1.31bn, with much of the increase due to the full
consolidation for the first time of Westco Products, market leader in
supplying ingredients to bakeries on the west coast of the US.
In the previous reporting period, Westco contributed to results for only
three months.
CSM's acquisition is Henry &amp; Henry of New York state, which sells fillings,
icings and other speciality products to the bakery industry.
The US company, which has a workforce of 100, posted an undisclosed profit
on sales of Dollars 31m last year.
In addition to Westco, CSM also owns American Ingredients, which makes
ingredients for industrial bakers, and QA Products, also of the US, which
sells decorations in the form of sugar vermicelli to the baking and
ice-cream industries.
