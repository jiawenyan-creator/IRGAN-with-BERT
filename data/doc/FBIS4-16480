<F P=106> [Lyudmila Pivovarova report: "New Moscow Criminal </F>
Investigation Administration Chief Urges Criminal Code Be 
Tightened"] 
  [Text] Vasiliy Kuptsov has been appointed the new chief of 
the Moscow Criminal Investigations Administration. Mr. Kuptsov 
has said in his first brief interview that the country's 
Criminal Code is outdated and still rooted in socialism, whereas 
society has long been trying to adopt a capitalist way of life. 
The new Moscow Criminal Investigation Administration chief is 
certain that many provisions of the Criminal Code should be 
tightened and that crime should be combated not by one single 
agency, but by "the entire community," while his subordinates 
"are ready to combat crime and to defend the law."
