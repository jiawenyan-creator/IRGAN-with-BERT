Triplex Lloyd, the industrial engineering group, has raised Dollars 35m

The placement is in two tranches, both at fixed interest rates. The first is
for Dollars 25m and carries an interest rate of 7.35 per cent with maturity
after seven years. The second is for Dollars 10m at an interest rate of 8.21
per cent and a maturity of 10 years.
