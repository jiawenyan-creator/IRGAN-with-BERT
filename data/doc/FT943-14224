FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Talks over Wembley refinancing
A syndicate of 22 banks owed Pounds 152m by Wembley, yesterday said that
they had begun discussing plans to refinance the debt-burdened stadium and
greyhound tracks operator.
The banks, led by Barclays and Schroders, are expected to scrutinise
proposals made to the Wembley board by three investor groups.
The groups are: Apollo Advisers, a US investment group led by Mr Leon Black;
Allied Entertainments, the promotions business controlled by Mr Harvey
Goldsmith; and Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Hugh Osmond, who are City
entrepreneurs.
All three proposals envisage an injection of new equity while retaining the
current management.
Although the banks are not expected to decide on a prefered package for some
weeks, the Wembley board is said to have indicated that it favours the
proposal drawn up by Mr Johnson and Mr Osmond.
Wembley has been made aware of possible conflicts with concert organisers if
Mr Goldsmith's promotions company is chosen to refinance the group.
Concern has also been raised over a possible shareholder backlash if the
stadium - widely regarded as the home of English football - is seen to be
refinanced by US investors.
Officials acting for Mr Johnson and Mr Osmond, whose previous deals included
the successful reverse takeover of PizzaExpress, have already begun due
diligence at Wembley.
Their plans are thought to centre on a debt-for-equity swap and rescue
rights issue.
