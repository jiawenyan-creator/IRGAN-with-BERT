FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gloomy prospects for tungsten
foreseen
GOVERNMENT and industry experts are predicting another difficult year for
the tungsten market in 1993 and no recovery in depressed tungsten prices.
The experts, from 23 countries and the International Tungsten Industry
Association, have been meeting in Geneva this week under the auspices of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to review the current
market situation and outlook.
Demand for tungsten has been weakened by lingering world recession. It has
deeply affected key tungsten-using sectors such as the tool-making, motor
vehicle, and defence industries.
Meanwhile, high levels of stocks, competition between tungsten materials and
substitution by other products are adding to the downward pressure on
prices.
Unctad estimates that world tungsten consumption last year amounted to
39,881 tonnes, a 12 per cent drop from 1990.
World production fell further, by 14 per cent to 37,007 tonnes last year.
However, stockpiles in 1991 amounted to more than 40,000 tonnes, with 34,634
tonnes held by the US government as a strategic reserve.
