SANTA ANA VALLEY, CORONA SETTLE FOR TIE 
After a half of big plays and another of botched plays, Santa Ana Valley and 
Corona high schools fought to a 14-14 tie Friday night at Santa Ana Stadium. 
All of the scoring came in the first half, when Corona took a 14-0 lead 
courtesy of a pair of touchdown receptions by Doug McDaniel. 
McDaniel's second score came on a 68-yard pass play from quarterback Steve 
Bernier with 4 minutes 13 seconds remaining in the half. 
On the ensuing kickoff, Santa Ana Valley's James Barclay fumbled, picked up the 
ball at the eight-yard line and bolted 92 yards for the Falcons' first score. 
Santa Ana Valley tied the score on a one-yard quarterback sneak by Gary Graves, 
following a 46-yard pass to Mike Castleberry. 
In the second half, both teams fumbled once inside their opponent's 10-yard 
line. 
"We had this game, but we made a couple of key mistakes, like that fumble," 
Santa Ana Valley Coach Dan Castanon said. 
Corona Coach Stu Horn echoed Castanon's feelings, adding, "Valley is so 
explosive, they can hit you with a big play any time." 
Corona could have attempted a 52-yard field goal with five seconds remaining in 
the game, but the Panthers went for a touchdown. Castleberry sacked Bernier at 
the 40-yard line. 
"The reason we didn't go for the field goal was that I didn't want to give 
Valley the ball for even one second," Horn said.
