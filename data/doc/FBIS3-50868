  [Text] The national government will not acknowledge a 
constitutional amparo on the value-added tax [IVA], as an amparo 
is a legal instrument that only benefits the individual who 
submits it. Therefore, it cannot have a collective nature or 
effects. 
  As for the claims by lawyer Rafael Bayed on the lack of 
information in applying the IVA, Finance Minister Carlos Rafael 
Silva feels that an appropriate campaign was conducted in 
implementing it. 
  [Begin Silva recording] The government has complied with the 
constitutional provision that compels it to publish in the 
official gazette of the Republic of Venezuela the laws that -- 
in this case -- were discussed and promulgated. [indistinct 
questions by several reporters] 
  In addition, you all know very well that the national 
government has made a tremendous effort to publicize the IVA in 
all media. This has been published in every newspaper in the 
country, in addition to having been reported by all audio and 
visual media which have emphasized exceptions made for food and 
medications, in addition to several services. [end recording]
