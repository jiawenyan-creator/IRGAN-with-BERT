<F P=106> [Report signed "spu": "Fasslabend: Contacts With NATO Will </F>
Be Intensified"] 
  [Text] Austria is to intensify its existing contacts with 
NATO and the Western European Union [WEU]. This was announced 
by Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend in an interview with 
SALZBURGER NACHRICHTEN on Tuesday [25 October]. 
  Already at this point, a military attache is working at the 
Austrian mission in Brussels. In the future, a liaison officer 
will also be sent there, Fasslabend stated. However, it is not 
yet clear whether this liaison officer will only be responsible 
for NATO contacts or also for contacts with the WEU. 
  For Austria, the Partnership for Peace offer is less 
significant than for those states of the former Warsaw Pact that 
are interested in NATO membership. However, with a view to 
peacekeeping missions and disaster relief operations, the 
contacts with NATO will assume increasing importance. Thus, as 
early as the end of 1993, an international exercise took place 
near Wiener Neustadt. 
  There is a growing possibility that the United Nations or 
European bodies might ask NATO to carry out such missions. If 
Austria wants to participate, close contact with NATO at a 
technical level is unavoidable, the defense minister pointed 
out. Yet this also requires more personnel.
