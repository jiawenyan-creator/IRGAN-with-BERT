WORLD; 
U.S. RICE FAILS JAPANESE TEST 
Tests on rice grown in the United States conducted for a Japanese consumer 
group found levels of pesticides that exceed limits set by Japan, a laboratory 
official said today. 
Tests by the Environmental Monitoring Laboratory in Osaka showed that a sample 
of rice from Texas contained 0.16 parts per million of sulfadiazine, while a 
sample of rice from California had 0.11 ppm of malathion, he said. Both states 
have been pressing to sell rice to Japan.
