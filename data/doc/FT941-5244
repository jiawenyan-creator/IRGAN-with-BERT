FT  08 MAR 94 / Change planned on unit trust errors
New minimum standards on how unit trust managers should deal with pricing
errors and compensate investors significantly affected were proposed
yesterday by financial watchdogs.
The proposals seek to mitigate the cost and complexity for the unit trust
industry of rectifying mistakes made in pricing units, for example as a
result of doing calculations on the basis of the wrong stocks or at the
wrong prices.
Under present regulations, no matter how small the error, the unit trust
manager must go back and re-price the units for every day since the original
mistake occurred, and establish which investors need to be compensated for
the wrong pricing during the time before the error was uncovered, no matter
how slight the disadvantage.
Yesterday's consultative document is published jointly by Imro, the
self-regulating organisation for the fund management industry, and the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator.
It aims to enable managers to disregard the smallest mistakes, provided they
have proper control systems in place to try to prevent errors.
Managers would have to correct the error from when it was discovered and for
the future, rather than having to go back and re-price units for every day
since the mistake occurred.
The new rules would also introduce a de minimis rule, so that where the
disadvantage to an investor was less than Pounds 10, the unit trust manager
would not necessarily have to provide compensation. Current best practice is
to round up such small sums to Pounds 10.
