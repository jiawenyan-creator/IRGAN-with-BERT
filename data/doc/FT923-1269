FT  24 SEP 92 / Iran and UAE seek to defuse island dispute
IRAN and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to hold talks over the island
of Abu Musa in an attempt to defuse a tense dispute over control of the
territory, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent.
Senior Foreign Ministry officials from both countries are due to meet in Abu
Dhabi on Sunday in the first direct attempt to conciliate in a row which
broke in April when the UAE accused Iran of annexing the island.
The UAE also accused Tehran of expelling hundreds of the emirates' nationals
from the island and said it was in breach of a 1971 agreement under which
Sharjah claimed sovereignty over the island, on which Tehran was permitted
to station a garrison.
The island, with a population of less than 2,000, commands the Gulf's main
shipping lanes between the coast of Iran and Sharjah.
Iran said on September 10 it was the sole owner of the island. The
declaration prompted condemnations of Tehran's 'aggression' from the Arab
League and the Gulf Co-operation Council, comprising Saudi Arabia, UAE,
Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
