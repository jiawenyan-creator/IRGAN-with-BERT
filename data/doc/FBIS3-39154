  [Text] Ankara -- Indicating that Azerbaijan is an 
independent state, the Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev said: 
"I will neither close nor open the door for the Russian troops. 
We cannot know what the future might bring." 
  In reply to questions by a group of reporters, Aliyev said 
the route of the oil pipeline will be finalized only after the 
signing of a protocol with the foreign firms in Baku. 
  In firmly rejecting the claims that he is Moscow's man, 
Aliyev said such accusations are lies disseminated by Elchibey 
and his supporters with whom the Turkish press sympathizes. 
  Bulent Ecevit, the leader of Democratic Left Party, visited 
Aliyev. In a statement after the meeting, Ecevit said it is 
highly important for Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan to be connected. 
He added that Turkey's stance on the issue has been 
insufficient and passive.
