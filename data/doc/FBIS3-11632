  [Text] The surrenders and their negotiations have prompted 
a controversy over the attorney general's actions. These 
surrenders have made the North Americans furious, and the 
problem is going from bad to worse. 
  A top-level meeting to discuss the problem was held at the 
Presidential Palace this morning. At the end of the meeting, 
one of the participants, the government minister, played down 
the importance of the controversy. 
  [Begin recording] [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] It 
was 
a working meeting, just like the others we have been holding in 
recent weeks, to coordinate among the Executive Branch, the 
Prosecutor's Office, and the Attorney General's Office the 
implementation of the surrender policy to benefit justice in the 
country and to use it as a tool to end impunity. 
  [Reporter] I imagine that the prosecutor general versus the 
U.S. Congress topic was discussed at the meeting. 
  [Villegas] We discussed, among other topics, the 
international effects of disagreements over the surrender 
policy. I hope that the drug-consuming nations in general and 
the international community will continue and even step up the 
efforts made so far to support Colombia's struggle against drug 
trafficking. [end recording]
