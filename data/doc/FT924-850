FT  22 DEC 92 / US warns China on HK deals
US commerce secretary Barbara Franklin told China yesterday not to
invalidate contracts in Hong Kong as part of Beijing's war of words on wider
democracy in the UK colony's final five years, Reuter reports from Hong
Kong. Washington would protect US companies if Beijing's promised voiding of
contracts stood to harm US interests after Hong Kong's transition to Chinese
rule in 1997, she said.
