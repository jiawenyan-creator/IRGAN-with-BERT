FT  16 JUL 94 / London paper launch next week
Tonight, the new London evening newspaper being set up by a Yorkshire
businessman, plans to launch next Thursday.
The paper, which will be distributed free to central London commuters on
weekdays, will represent the first competition for the Evening Standard
since 1987, when Lord Rothermere closed the Evening News.
