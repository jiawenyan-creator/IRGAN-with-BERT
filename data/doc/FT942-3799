FT  13 JUN 94 / The Markets: California dreaming of recovery - Global
Investor
The US is not so much a single economy but an agglomeration of regional ones
with their own, varied business cycles, and for the past three years
California, the biggest single state economy, has been sunk in recession,
badly trailing the national recovery in business activity.
Now, however, California is showing the first glimmerings of an economic
upturn, with a fragile recovery in housing and a modest increase in
employment from the trough of late 1993. Is the 'golden state,' which lost
its image of boundless opportunity during the recession, about to regain it
once more ? And if so, how can investors benefit?
A report out this week from a well known research group, the cumbrously
named Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy (CCSCE),
points out that venture capital fundings in Silicon Valley reached record
levels in 1993 and the first quarter of this year: evidence, it says, that
the state's recession was not caused by a broad based, permanent loss of
strength.
California, it argues, still has strong long-term growth potential -
provided the politicians are prepared to put money into critical investments
in education and infrastructure.
The group points to the strength of the state's high technology industries,
its excellent position for trading with the fast-growing nations of Latin
America and the Pacific Rim, and its strong population growth. This, it
predicts, will produce a 27 per cent increase in employment between 1993 and
2005, well ahead of a 17.5 per cent national average.
Long-term, this argument looks plausible. But it should not not obscure the
short-term problems which suggest that California's economic recovery will
be a slow one.
Two factors have made the recession here particularly long-lasting: the
bursting of a property bubble, and a sharp drop in both US defence spending
and the global civil aerospace business.
Both are heavily concentrated in the south of the state, and, indeed, it is
probably more correct to call the recession a Southern California
phenomenon. More than 70 per cent of the state's job losses have occurred in
one southern county - Los Angeles. The north of the state, led by a buoyant
Silicon Valley, has largely tracked the national recovery.
In the south, however, the contraction of the defence industry is permanent,
and may yet have some way to go, while the civilian aerospace side is barely
out of its cyclical trough.
It remains uncertain that commercial real estate values have touched bottom.
Some large Japanese corporate investors, who bought at the top of the cycle,
are rumoured to be on the point of selling.
The area also faces formidable problems of traffic congestion, crime,
environmental degradation, and racial tension, as well as the aftermath of
January's earthquake.
Nor do the obvious stock market plays on a Californian recovery look
particularly generously priced. Among the banks, BankAmerica, with flat
earnings for the past 13 quarters, has a price/earnings ratio broadly in
line with the super-regional universe, while Wells Fargo, which has enjoyed
a surprisingly strong share price over the past two years, is discounting a
fair amount of good news.
In telecommunications, Pacific Telesis, the state's phone company, faces
increasing competition from newcomers wanting to break its monopoly and
large capital outlays.
It recently spun off its fast growing wireless business into a newly quoted
company known as AirTouch. This has a strong spread of cellular and paging
interests not just in California, but in other parts of the US and Europe.
It has a good track record and more than Dollars 1.5bn of flotation cash in
its pocket. The shares are not cheap, but they represent a means of riding
recovery on both the West Coast and in Europe, as well as a stake in the
explosive worldwide growth of wireless communications.
Fed policy
Global markets are likely to be influenced strongly this week by a cluster
of US economic statistics which could significantly affect the timing of the
next tightening by the Federal Reserve.
For much of the past month US bond prices have rallied on the hope that the
Fed's half a point tightening in May will be sufficient to slow the US
growth rate and thus the threat of inflation.
But growing doubts about this optimistic picture emerged last week, with
statistics suggesting that the loss in momentum might not be as great as
Wall Street is hoping, and a continuing surge in the price of industrial
commodities.
Last week's statistics were relatively minor, but those due out this week
are not. And any that emerge worse than the Wall Street consensus could
knock bonds hard, since that would increase raise the prospect of further
tightening by the Fed at its policy making meeting on July 5-6 .
That still seems unlikely. Various Fed governors have been quoted over the
past week as saying that inflation is under control. Even Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, said at a London conference that price data had been
'clearly restrained,' though he added the rider that this was historical
data.
Yet as Mr Lawrence Lindsey, another Fed governor, points out, the Fed funds
rate is still only about 1 1/2 percentage points above inflation, compared
to an historical average closer to 2. A truly neutral Fed policy implies
more tightening before the year is out, and there is a distinct possibility
of a summer move - the FOMC also meets on August 16 - if growth remains
robust. The rally of the past fortnight may be no more than a bounce in a
bear market.
