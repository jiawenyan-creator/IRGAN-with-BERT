METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPERTY OWNERS WARNED ABOUT TAX BILLING 
ERRORS 
Los Angeles County property taxpayers who erroneously received tax delinquency 
notices this week are being asked to write, call or visit the county 
treasurer-tax collector's office to clear up the problem. 
Hundreds of taxpayers got the notices because of computer processing errors. 
The errors appear to have occurred on fewer than 1% of the 290,000 delinquent 
notices mailed out Monday, said Assistant Treasurer-Tax Collector David 
Collins. 
Those who believe they have received notices by mistake can call a message 
number at 974-2111 and leave their name and property parcel number. Property 
owners can also mail copies of the front and back of their canceled checks with 
a copy of the bill to Treasurer &amp; Tax Collector, P.O. Box 2838, Los Angeles 
90012.
