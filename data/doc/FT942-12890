FT  27 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil flows from Ecuadorean
Amazon field
Maxus, the US oil company, has started production in the first of a series
of new oil fields in Ecuador's Amazon region. The Tivacuno and surrounding
fields have estimated reserves of 1.4bn barrels, of which Maxus expects to
extract about 200m.
As of yet the wells are being tested for their actual production capacity,
but Maxus expects to be producing 30,000 barrels a day within a month,
compared with the current 15,000 b/d.
Total investment for the exploration and exploitation of the area under
concession from Ecuador's state company PetroEcuador amounts to USDollars
800m. According to Mr William Hutton, general manager of Maxus Ecuador, it
is the largest heavy crude oil exploitation project now being developed
anywhere in the world.
With a crude oil density between 14.5 and 22 API, Maxus is the first oil
company in Ecuador to produce large quantities of heavy crude. To enable the
transportation of the oil it is first being heated and then mixed with
lighter crude before being pumped through the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline
across the Andes to the Pacific Coast.
The nearby Bogi-Capiron field, with crude oil averaging an API of 18, will
come on stream within the next couple of months. The total production Maxus
expects to reach is 60,000 b/d. The production cost per barrel is put at
USDollars 3.30.
Mr Francisco Acosta, the minister of energy, said the country was entering a
new era of petroleum production. He emphasised the advanced technologies
employed to protect the environment. The use of clustered well sites,
synthetic road materials, and advanced water-oil separators among other
measures are to guarantee a minimal environmental impact.
Maxus enters the production phase more than eight years after the
five-member consortium it belongs to signed the exploratory contract with
PetroEcuador.
