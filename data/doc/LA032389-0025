SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
FUNERAL FOR RETIRED PRINCIPAL 
Funeral services will be held at 9:30 a.m. today for Andrew Deliman, a retired 
Redondo Beach school principal. He was a candidate for the local school board 
earlier this month. The services, following a Rosary Wednesday night, are at 
St. James Catholic Church in Redondo Beach, with burial at Green Hills Memorial 
Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
Deliman, 68, died, apparently of a heart attack, while playing golf Monday at 
Victoria Park in Carson. Howard Huizing, his friend and golfing partner of 
nearly 30 years -- and the school trustee to whom he lost his March 7 election 
bid by nine votes -- said Deliman collapsed without warning at the 16th hole. 
Helen Deliman said her husband had a heart condition, which had not prevented 
him from leading an active life in his retirement years. 
A Pennsylvania native, Deliman taught in Ohio and Hawaii before coming to the 
Redondo Beach City School District in 1956. He served the district for 29 
years, as principal of the Beryl Heights, Franklin, Patterson and Alta Vista 
elementary schools. He retired in 1985, and after some traveling, worked as a 
substitute teacher in the Torrance Unified School District. 
"Andy's goal was to keep involved, especially in education, because he always 
loved to work with children and their parents and teachers," Helen Deliman 
said. "The election campaign, walking door-to-door, gave him a chance to meet 
many of his former pupils who are now of voting age." 
Besides his wife, Deliman is survived by his daughter, Janet, who lives in the 
family's Redondo Beach home, and two brothers, Albert of Tennessee and Edward 
of Pennsylvania.
