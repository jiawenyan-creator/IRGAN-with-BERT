Loan) Program to add the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers to certain sections of the Standards,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 1, 1994, final Standards, Criteria, and Procedures were published in the 

Federal Register

 governing the repayment and consolidation of loans under the Federal Direct Student Loan (Direct Loan) Program in
the academic year beginning July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34278). Compliance with information collection requirements in 34
CFR 685.209, 685.213, 685.214, and 685.215 was delayed until those requirements were approved by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980. On September 23, 1994 OMB approved those information collection requirements under that Act;
therefore affected parties must now comply with those requirements. 


Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 


In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does
not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed
rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under
5 U.S.C 553(d)(3).
