  [Excerpt] The Defense Ministry has denied a report carried 
by a Hungarian daily contending that Hungary requested a modern 
American antiaircraft missile system because of the growing 
tension in our region. According to a ministry spokesman, no 
talks were held on buying Patriot missiles; what is more, no 
measures have been taken in connection with the UN ultimatum, 
which is to expire soon, and a possible NATO air strike in 
Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]
