FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Davenport Vernon to raise Pounds 6.4m for
expansion
WITH ITS interim figures, which show an 11 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, Davenport Vernon is calling for Pounds 6.4m net to continue its
expansion and reduce gearing.
Shareholders in this multi-franchised motor dealer are offered 5.36m shares
on a 2-for-5 basis at 125p each. Yesterday the shares fell 5p to 142p.
Mr Ralph Denne, chairman, said the group had expanded rapidly since the
beginning of 1992 and now operated from 22 dealerships. The new operations
were progressing well.
There had been 'particularly encouraging' results from two of the three
Nissan outlets. There were still opportunities to make additional
acquisitions at good value and a number of proposals were being reviewed, he
said.
For the six months ended March 31 1993 turnover rose from Pounds 50.7m to
Pounds 69.5m, to which acquisition and new developments contributed Pounds
2.48m (Pounds 540,000). Pre-tax profit came to Pounds 895,000 (Pounds
805,000).
Mr Denne said new car sales rose by 29.7 per cent, with existing businesses
accounting for 17 per cent of that. Improvement in earnings also came from
used cars and generally better operating standards.
Earnings per share worked through at 4.4p (4.1p) and the interim dividend is
again 1.5p.
At March 31 borrowings were Pounds 11.9m, excluding new vehicle stocking
finance, for gearing of 56 per cent.
Directors and certain other shareholders are selling their rights to
subscribe for 53.7 per cent of the issue. NatWest Wood Mackenzie, the
underwriter, will find institutional placees for them.
