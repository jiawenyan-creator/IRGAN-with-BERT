QINTEX IN RECEIVERSHIP WITH $1.6-BILLION DEBT; 
FINANCES: THE AUSTRALIAN FIRM, TRYING TO STAVE OFF A BREAKUP, IS EXPECTED TO 
SELL ITS VERY VALUABLE MONARCH BEACH PROPERTY IN ORANGE COUNTY. 
Qintex Australia Ltd., the media and property empire built by entrepreneur 
Christopher Skase, went into receivership Tuesday in an effort to ward off 
complete liquidation. 
The cash-starved company, which has been in a downward spiral since its 
proposed buyout of the MGM/United Artists movie studio collapsed in October, 
asked an Australian court to place it in receivership to prevent the group's 
foreign and Australian banks from breaking up the company. 
The court appointed chartered accountants David Crawford and John Allpass from 
KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords as receivers and managers of Qintex Australia and 
28 associated companies, stripping Skase of an operational role in the company. 
Qintex's debts now total $1.6 billion, and the company is expected to sell all 
its resort and property assets -- including a highly priced, 230-acre 
ocean-front parcel in Orange County -- while retaining its television network 
and perhaps its local television stations. 
Qintex purchased the 232-acre Monarch Beach property from the Christopher B. 
Hemmetter and the Stein-Brief partnership last July for $132 million and at the 
same time took an option to buy the neighboring 115-acre Dana Headlands 
property for $115 million. 
Local real estate experts considered the price extremely high, but Skase said 
he would be able to build a profitable luxury resort on the two properties. He 
expected to spend $1 billion developing the resort. 
But Qintex earlier this month forfeited its right to the Headlands property 
when it missed an installment payment, and it now appears that the Monarch 
Beach property will be put on the block. 
"What is certain now is that all the resorts will go, and all the land will 
go," said Bryan Madden, director of research at Prudential Bache in Australia. 
Qintex owns two luxury resorts in Australia and the Princeville resort in 
Hawaii. Princeville announced Monday that the extensive renovation work under 
way at the site had been suspended. 
Crawford and Allpass were given wide powers, including the right to hire and 
fire, sell Qintex assets and borrow money. 
Peter Buchanan, a lawyer representing Qintex, told the Supreme Court in 
Victoria state that a receivership was necessary because it would enable Seven 
Network and other Qintex television stations to continue operating and thus 
retain their broadcasting licenses. 
Madden said the receivership was akin to a Chapter 11 filing in the United 
States. The banks wanted to avoid a liquidation, he said, because a sale of all 
Qintex assets would cover only a bit more than half of the outstanding debts. 
A spokesman for Qintex Entertainment Inc., a Beverly Hills firm that is 43% 
owned by Qintex Australia and has been in Chapter 11 since the parent company 
refused to advance needed cash following the aborted MGM/UA deal, said the firm 
now had "little contact" with Qintex Australia and still hoped to emerge from 
Chapter 11.
