 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 450 producers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions under the marketing order and approximately
35 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onion producers and handlers may
be classified as small entities. 

The budget of expenses for the 199495 fiscal period was prepared by the Idaho-Eastern Oregon Onion Committee,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions. They are familiar with the
Committee's needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate
an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons
have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. 

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a
rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 

The Committee met on March 22, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 199495 budget of $1,020,039, $10,161 less
than the previous year. Increases in expenditures, which include $154 for research and $18,500 for promotion and
advertising, will be offset by decreases of $18,495 for salary expenses and $10,320 for travel and office expenses.
Major expense items include $113,785 for salary expenses, $57,600 for travel and office expenses, $60,154 for research,
$668,500 for promotion and advertising, $60,000 for export, and $50,000 for contingencies. 

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per hundredweight, the same as last season.
This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 8,000,000 hundredweight, will yield $800,000 in assessment
income. This, along with $30,000 in interest income and $190,039 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be
adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 199495 fiscal period, estimated
at $898,928, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal period's expenses. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which
was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past
years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.
