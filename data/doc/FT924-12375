FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: STC awarded Dollars 370m order for sea
cable
STC, the UK telecommunications manufacturer bought two years ago by Canada's
Northern Telecom, has won a Dollars 370m (Pounds 215m) contract to build the
first fibre-optic cable linking Canada and Europe.
The undersea cable, due to be completed in 1994, has been commissioned by a
group of international telecommunications carriers led by Teleglobe of
Canada. The other purchasers are British Telecommunications, Germany's
Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Denmark and PTT of Iceland. The cable will land in
each of their countries.
It will enable Teleglobe to send voice, data and video traffic direct to
Europe instead of routing much of it through the US, as now. The cable will
carry the equivalent of 30,000 telephone calls simultaneously down each of
two pairs of optical fibres, four times as much as is carried by the current
generation of technology. Average cost of a transatlantic circuit will be
substantially lower than before.
STC said it was the only manufacturer able to supply this technology. The
cable will be made at STC's plants in Southampton, and Portland, Oregon. The
electronics will be made in Greenwich, London.
