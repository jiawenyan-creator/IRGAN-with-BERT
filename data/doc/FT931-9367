FT  15 FEB 93 / Rushdie speaks out
Salman Rushdie condemned the Iranian death edict against him as a 'terrorist
threat' during a surprise appearance at a service in Kings College chapel,
Cambridge, as Iran called again for the four-year-old fatwa to be carried
out. The Foreign Office stressed that Britain would continue to support all
efforts to resolve the issue.
