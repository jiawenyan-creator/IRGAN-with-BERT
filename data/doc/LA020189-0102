COUNTY MAY TIE FUNDS TO TRAFFIC LIGHT COORDINATION 
Los Angeles County supervisors sought Tuesday to put some political muscle 
behind efforts to control traffic congestion, voting to explore a proposal to 
withhold county road funds from local cities unless they agree to synchronize 
their traffic signals. 
The move, which could affect $10 million that the county distributes each year 
to cities, won the unanimous backing of supervisors and reflected the 
frustrations of county officials who must deal with myriad communities in 
trying to coordinate traffic signals. The county Department of Public Works is 
already involved in some 13 traffic projects and has identified 80 major routes 
for traffic synchronization, said director Thomas A. Tidemanson. 
As an example, he cited a boulevard that has 75 traffic signals in nine 
different cities. But when Tidemanson told supervisors that some cities have 
been reluctant to work with the county in coordinating traffic, the board 
proposed withholding the dollars as "a big stick" approach aimed at persuading 
cities to cooperate. 
"I think it's time we send the message to these cities that they no longer will 
get this money from the county without any strings," said Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Ed Edelman. "We have tremendous traffic and gridlock in this county, 
and we can't widen the streets as we once did because we don't have the funds 
we once did, so we have to use advanced techniques to move traffic using 
existing signals." 
Tidemanson said the money the county distributes to cities comes from its 
percentage of gasoline tax revenue. The funds are distributed based on a 
population and street mileage formula, he said. In addition, the supervisors 
agreed to seek additional money for the synchronization program by turning over 
operation of the county's freeway call box system to the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. The commission is seeking to acquire the call box 
system as part of a new program for improved handling of freeway emergencies. 
The county has been requesting $2 million for the call box system, but thus 
far, the commission has offered only $1.1 million. On Tuesday, the Board of 
Supervisors agreed to urge its appointees on the commission to push for the 
high figure.
