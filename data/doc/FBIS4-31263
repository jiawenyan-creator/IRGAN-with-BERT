  [Excerpts] Geneva, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Bilateral 
consultations between Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy for 
former Yugoslavia, and the heads of the warring Bosnian sides' 
delegations resumed in Geneva today. [passage omitted] 
  At about noon Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Muslim-Croat 
Federation, told reporters at the Palais des Nations that his 
delegation "insists on a one-month cease-fire." This means he 
does not accept the proposal for a four-month cessation of 
hostilities outlined by the contact group in its declaration 
issued on 13 May. 
  The delegation of the Srpska republic, headed by President 
Radovan Karadzic, met with Yasushi Akashi in the Palais des 
Nations. There have been no reports about the details of their 
consultations.
