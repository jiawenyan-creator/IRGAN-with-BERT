FT  09 SEP 92 / Yeltsin speeds up troop pull-out from Lithuania
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday agreed to withdraw 20,500 troops stationed
in the Baltic republic of Lithuania by next August, writes Leyla Boulton in
Moscow. This is despite a shortage of housing for them back home.
An agreement signed yesterday follows persistent clamouring by the three
newly independent Baltic states for an instant withdrawal of former Red Army
troops on their territory. Lithuania which has been the most generous in its
treatment of Russian minorities on its soil is the first republic to win
such a promise. Estonia and Latvia, which have much bigger Russian
minorities, have placed tough restrictions on which Russians can acquire
local citizenship.
