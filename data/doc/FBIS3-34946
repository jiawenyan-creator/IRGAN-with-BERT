  [Text] Desertions have been on the increase lately. More 
soldiers are refusing to continue their military service, 
particularly in southern and northern Iraq. Saddam's regime has 
tried frantically to contain this phenomenon. It has allocated 
a reward of 3,000 dinars to anyone who provides information 
about a deserter from military service. If the informer guides 
the authorities to the deserter's location the reward becomes 
10,000 dinars. The regime's measures follow attempts to control 
desertion that failed despite its seizing the movable and 
immovable properties of deserters and punishing the families 
that give them refuge.
