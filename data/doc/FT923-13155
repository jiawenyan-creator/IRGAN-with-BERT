FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Visa's US sales climb 11.5% in
first quarter
VISA, one of the leading US credit card companies, said its first-quarter
results showed an 11.5 per cent increase in domestic sales volume.
The San Francisco-based company claimed this was better than the average 10
per cent growth rate for other large credit card companies during the first
three months of 1992.
The rise came in the face of what most economists see as continued weak US
consumer confidence during the opening months of the year.
Visa said it recorded Dollars 40.7bn in card transactions for the quarter
ended on March 31. The number of Visa cards in circulation in the US rose by
4.5 per cent to 143m cards.
