KAN. WOMAN WINS PANCAKE RACE 
A 30-year-old Liberal housewife ran 415 yards with a pancake in a skillet today 
to win the 41st annual international pancake race pitting the women of Liberal 
against the women of Olney, England. 
Carla Patterson ran the traditional Shrove Tuesday pancake race in 67.56 
seconds to even the annual race against the English women at 20-20-1. 
In a tradition dating to 1445, 21 women in Olney, a tiny English village 55 
miles northwest of London, dress in skirts, aprons and head scarfs and run 415 
yards from the marketplace to St. Peter and Paul Church carrying pancakes in 
skillets. 
And in a tradition dating to 1950, they compete against women running the same 
race in Kansas.
