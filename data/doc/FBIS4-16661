  [Text] The total reduction in the population of North 
Siberia through migration will be over 600,000 by early 1996 and 
over 550,000 over 1996-2000. That is the forecast of a group of 
Novosibirsk scientists. 
  The migration is caused primarily by the reduction in the 
demand for manpower in connection with the reduction in oil and 
gas extraction and a marked reduction in capital investments in 
the extracting sectors. Among those leaving the North a 
considerable proportion are citizens of nearby foreign parts 
returning home. The intensive departure of highly qualified 
specialists and young people has been noted. 
  The migration of the population from northern regions also 
has positive consequences. People's departure is lowering the 
level of unemployment and reducing the load on the socioconsumer 
infrastructure. But scientists note that spontaneous migration 
will not radically resolve the question of the overpopulation of 
North Siberia. A considered state policy is needed in this 
process.
