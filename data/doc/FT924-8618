FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: French truck maker set to shed
2,500 jobs
RENAULT Vehicules Industriels (RVI), the French truck maker, is expected
shortly to announce up to 2,500 job losses, nearly 15 per cent of the
workforce, according to a letter from trade unions to the government owner.
RVI is heading for around a FFr1bn (Dollars 185m) loss this year, a sharp
turnround from the FFr23m net profit it made in 1991, says the letter from
the CFE-CGC white collar union, which appeals to the ministers of labour and
industry for other solutions to the problem.
The exact size and timing of the job losses, the latest indication of the
depth of recession in the world truck industry, will be announced by RVI
management in the next few weeks, possibly at the next staff council on
November 16.
An RVI official yesterday confirmed that job losses were on the way, in
response to a steep decline in orders. French truck sales alone are expected
to fall by 25 per cent this year, according to the union letter. RVI, which
announced just over 1,000 job losses last year, has already introduced
temporary lay-offs, averaging seven days per month.
But these are inadequate in the absence of any signs of recovery in sales,
said the official. If the latest job losses are confirmed, RVI will have
lost 30 per cent of its workforce over the past two years.
This news will be all the more unwelcome to the government, which must vet
the plans, at a time when unemployment continues to rise, up 1 per cent to
2.9m in September, or 10.3 per cent of the workforce.
Until recently, the public sector has been able to shed jobs with little
union opposition, but feelings have begun to heat up, with the recent
announcement of a 24-hour strike by Air France employees, in protest against
1,500 job losses at the state airline.
