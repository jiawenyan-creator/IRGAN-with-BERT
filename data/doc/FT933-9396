FT  10 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disputes threaten nickel
producer
GREECE'S LARCO, which formerly produced 4 per cent of the world's nickel,
could go bankrupt and close within months, Reuter reports from Athens.
'If Larco is not privatised soon then it is condemned to closure,' a Larco
official said.
The company has a serious cash shortage and has been hit by strikes and
payment disputes with the state power corporation. It lost Dr9.6bn (Pounds
26m) in 1992, following Dr7.7bn in 1991. Turnover was Dr19.5bn in 1992, down
from Dr24.5bn the previous year.
Larco, whose customers are Europe's major steelmakers, has capacity to
produce 17,000 tonnes of contained nickel a year. Production rose to 1,030
tonnes in July from about 700 tonnes a month in November 1992 when an
eight-month survival plan was introduced. That involved temporarily halving
both output and working hours. The arrangement ended in July.
The output target for the rest of 1993 is 1,200-1,300 tonnes a month, a
mainly dictated by the Greek government's reluctance to order redundancies.
Workers protesting against management's refusal to award a pay rise for 1992
and 1993 are staging one four-hour stoppage a week until August 31.
Mr Yannis Zournadzis, the managing director, has cut the workforce by 18 per
cent since 1990 with employment at Larco's plant, mines and headquarters
dropping to 1,580 from 1,930. 'We have achieved about 40 voluntary
redundancies recently but cannot afford to pay more severance,' he said.
In another dispute, Larco and the Public Power Corporation are trying to
agree on electricity discounts for 1993.
Under the 1992 agreement, Larco pays a base Dr6.026 per kWh, a charge that
rises in line with the London Metal Exchange's three-month nickel price and
month-on-month Greek inflation.
The PPC is believed to be owed Dr1.4bn by Larco, which confirmed that
'several months' of bills were unpaid.
