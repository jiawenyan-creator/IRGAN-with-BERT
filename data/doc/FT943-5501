FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pearson rises 50% to Pounds 96.3m and plans
sale - Shares fall 31p to 628p on caution over second half
The shares of Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the
Financial Times, fell by 4.7 per cent yesterday, in spite of a 50 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 46.3m to Pounds 69.3m for the six
months to June 30.
The 31p drop to 628p, the worst percentage performance by a FT-SE 100
company yesterday, reflected disappointing results from the book publishing
division, a modest interim dividend increase and fears of increased pressure
in the second half which will not benefit from special factors that boosted
the first half.
Lord Blakenham, Pearson chairman, admitted that 'progress will be harder
during the rest of the year.'
Pearson also formally marked the end of its transition from conglomerate to
media company by saying it planned to sell its remaining 41 per cent stake
in Camco International, the oil services company. The sale of 59 per cent of
Camco at the end of last year raised nearly Dollars 230m (Pounds 149m).
Pearson's operating profit rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 67.6m (Pounds
51.5m) on turnover down by 21 per cent to Pounds 648.8m (824.4m) Earnings
per share rose by 48 per cent to 9.2p (6.2p) and the interim dividend is up
7 per cent to 5.75p (5.375p).
Direct comparisons with the first half of 1993 are difficult to make because
the intervening period has seen the demerger of Royal Doulton china, the
sale of the Camco majority stake, and the receipt of Pounds 52m from British
Sky Broadcasting in partial repayment of loans.
There was also a strong contribution from Thames Television with an
operating profit of Pounds 10.4m - its first contribution to a Pearson first
half year - and earnings from Extel, the electronic information business.
Newspapers led the way in profit growth with a 66 per cent increase in
operating profit to Pounds 36.8m. The Financial Times was up 91 per cent at
Pounds 22.5m, although an associate company Les Echos faced a difficult
market in France.
The book division came under pressure, particularly in the school and
college market in the US and operating profit at Longman fell by 82 per cent
from Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.1m. Despite record deliveries of Penguin books,
the division had an overall loss of Pounds 7m compared with a Pounds 1.7m
profit in the 1993 first half. Most profits from book publishing are earned
in the second half.
Profits from visitor attractions such as Tussauds Group more than doubled to
Pounds 5.5m but attributable profit from investment banking fell from Pounds
16.4m to Pounds 13.7m mainly because of pressure on New York business.
Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson managing director, confirmed that the company would
launch two channels of satellite television with the BBC in Europe early
next year and was looking at other ventures with the Corporation. He also
confirmed that talks to buy a 10 per cent stake in TVB, the Hong Kong
broadcaster, had broken down on price some weeks ago. Lord Blakenham said
organic growth and acquisitions would be supplemented by a series of
alliances with other companies.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, maintained his
full-year pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 235m.
