FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: Slimmer Aga lifts profit 11% on
improved sales
Aga, the newly-streamlined Swedish industrial gas group, has reported
profits after financial items up by 11 per cent in the first half, to
SKr785m (Dollars 99.5m) from SKr709m in the same period last year.
The company, which ranks fifth among the world's commercial gas suppliers,
recently spun off its subsidiary Frigoscandia - the world's biggest cold
storage chain - as a wholly-independent listed company to concentrate on
industrial gas operations.
Its half-year results, fully adjusted to exclude Frigoscandia, showed sales
ahead 12 per cent at SKr6.08bn, compared with SKr5.45bn in 1993. It cited an
upturn in the Nordic and US economies as the main reason. However, demand in
continental Europe was weak while the economy of Venezuela, another
important Aga market, deteriorated.
Aga said it anticipated a similar performance in the second half, and
forecast an improvement in pre-tax profits after financial items over the
full year. Last year the figure was SKr1.36bn, excluding Frigoscandia.
Frigoscandia, given away to Aga shareholders in July, earlier reported a
fall in first-half profits after financial items to SKr10m from SKr57m last
time. Sales were down to SKr2bn from SKr2.09bn. However, the company
forecast a stronger second half, taking expected full-year profits to around
SKr150m, against SKr204m last year.
Aga is investing heavily in eastern Europe, and said it now owned 85 per
cent of Balashiha Kislorodny Zavod (BKZ), one of Russia's two biggest
industrial gas groups, which it first bought into in June. BKZ, with 360
employees and annual sales of SKr45m, is the largest gas supplier in the
Moscow area. Aga already has gas companies in Kaliningrad and St Petersburg.
Mr Marcus Storch, chief executive, said although the purchase price of BKZ
was small, the investment commitment by Aga was high.
