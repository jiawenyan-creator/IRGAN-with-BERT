FT  03 NOV 92 / Kazakhs forge links with Iran
PRESIDENT Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Iran's President Hashemi
Rafsanjani yesterday signed oil, transport and finance agreements, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said, AP reports from Nicosia.
Secular Turkey and fundamentalist Iran, both Moslem states, are locked in
fierce competition to gain political and economic influence in
Moslem-populated former Soviet republics.
The agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Mr Rafsanjani as saying speedy
progress in talks between the two countries showed their eagerness to work
together.
The agreements called for creation of a joint commission for co-operation in
the fields of economy, transport and culture. Letters of understanding also
were signed for oil, energy and banking collaboration. No further details
were given.
The Kazakh leader earlier met Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, who stressed that Iran 'supports the idea of the unity of Asian
countries', the agency said.
Mr Nazarbayev had been welcomed by Mr Rafsanjani when he arrived in Tehran
on Saturday from the Ankara summit of five former Soviet republics with
large Moslem populations and close ethnic and linguistic links to Turkey.
Mr Nazarbayev's visit to Tehran immediately after the Ankara meeting was
seen as an indication he did not want to be seen as favouring either Turkey
or Iran as they struggle for influence in the region.
Mr Rafsanjani was quoted as saying yesterday: 'The world should know that
co-operation among Moslem countries is not something for them to worry
about, because Islam is the religion of logic and reasoning and so does not
need to be offensive.'
The Iraq-based Mujahideen Khalq, the main Iranian opposition group, says
Kazakhstan has sold several nuclear warheads to Iran.
Iran and Kazakhstan, the only Central Asian republic known to possess
nuclear weapons, have denied the allegation.
US intelligence reports also have said there has been no evidence of such a
sale.
