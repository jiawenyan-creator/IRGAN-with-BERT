  [Text] Nigeria's head of state, General Sani Abacha, has 
assured Britain that the current program for the transfer of 
power to a democratically elected government in Nigeria would 
yield positive results. Gen. Abacha gave the assurance in 
Pretoria yesterday [10 May], during a meeting with the British 
foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd. Mr. Hurd had told Gen. 
Abacha that Britain looked forward to the full restoration of 
democracy in Nigeria in no distant future. The Nigerian head of 
state also had talks with President Nelson Mandela, during which 
he reaffirmed Nigeria's commitment to sound economic and 
political relations with South Africa. 
  Other dignitaries whom Gen. Abacha had discussions with in 
Pretoria included the U.S. vice president, Mr. Al Gore, and the 
Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip. 
  General Abacha is expected back home today.
