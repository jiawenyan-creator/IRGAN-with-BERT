FT  04 JAN 92 / G7 finance ministers to meet
Finance ministers and central bank governors from the seven richest
industrialised countries have tentatively agreed on a meeting at the end of
this month to discuss the world economy, Peter Marsh writes.
The meeting would be part of a series of top-level contacts involving the
US, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Britain and Canada. New York is the most
likely venue, with a date of January 25-26 pencilled in.
