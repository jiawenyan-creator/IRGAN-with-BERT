FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: LTV steel division remains in
the red
LTV, the US steel group operating for five years under the protection of
bankruptcy courts, has reported a sharp rise in second-quarter net income,
thanks to a gain from the sale of a business. But its core steel operations
remained mired in red ink.
LTV's income was Dollars 138.6m, or 95 cents a share, compared with Dollars
13.4m, or 5 cents, in the same period of last year. However, this was due to
a Dollars 150m net gain on the sale of its AM General vehicle manufacturing
business; without this it would have lost Dollars 11.4m. Sales totalled
Dollars 1.53bn, down from Dollars 1.56bn.
The company said the results mainly reflected lower quarter-to-quarter steel
selling prices and a decline in aerospace and defence operating income due
to the AM sale, partly offset by higher missiles division sales and a higher
volume of steel shipments.
The steel division had an operating loss of Dollars 28.4m, against Dollars
23.4m in the same period of last year. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 947m
and shipments were 8 per cent ahead at 1.88m tons.
The company said the loss was due to lower selling prices and higher
employment costs, mainly from a new union contract.
The group's aerospace and defence business reported income of Dollars 22.4m,
down from Dollars 37.4m, while energy products lost Dollars 2.9m, up from
Dollars 2.5m.
For the six months LTV reported net income of Dollars 95.3m, or 62 cents a
share, against a net loss of Dollars 32.9m, or 39 cents, while sales dipped
from Dollars 2.99bn to Dollars 2.92bn.
