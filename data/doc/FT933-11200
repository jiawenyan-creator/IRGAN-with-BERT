FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ADT raising Dollars 144m to help refinance
debt
ADT, the Bermuda-based security services and car auction company, is raising
Dollars 144m via a public offer in the US of 18m shares at Dollars 8 apiece.
The shares rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 1/4 .
The proceeds will help ADT refinance Dollars 1.3bn of debt and meet
preference share obligations. First Boston Corporation and Merrill Lynch are
managing underwriters for the public offering. After the refinancing, ADT's
gearing will still be more than 100 per cent.
ADT also confirmed the rescheduling of Dollars 600m of debt through a public
offering of Dollars 250m of 8.25 per cent senior notes 2000 and Dollars 350m
of 9.25 per cent notes 2003. Merrill Lynch and First Boston were also
managing underwriters for the offerings.
In addition, ADT has syndicated with a group of US and international banks a
six-year Dollars 500m credit facility, subject to final documentation. This
transaction was arranged by Chemical Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia and will
become effective simultaneously with the closing of the equity and public
debt offerings.
ADT said it would use the proceeds of the public offerings, together with
cash on hand, to repay all indebtedness outstanding under ADT's two
principal existing credit facilities.
