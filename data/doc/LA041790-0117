'BIGGEST BABY SHOWER' TARGETS SMOKING 
Later this spring, the American Lung Assn.'s Los Angeles chapter again will 
sponsor the "World's Biggest Baby Shower" to alert young pregnant women to 
smoking's dangers. 
"It's a creative approach," says Ron Arias of the ALA. 
"You're dealing with a very hard-to-reach group. It's an economic and 
educational problem more than anything." 
Statistics bear that out: 20% to 40% of all women who become pregnant are 
smokers and only about 25% stop during pregnancy, experts say. The potential 
health consequences for these women and their babies are severe: 
* According to a 1989 Swedish study, women who smoke during pregnancy increase 
the risk of a late miscarriage by 40%. 
* Smoking while pregnant appears to increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death 
Syndrome. More than 2,500 deaths of infants under the age of 1 could be 
attributed to smoking by the mother, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control. 
* A pregnant women who smokes two packs a day reduces the oxygen supply to her 
fetus by 25%, the lung association reports. 
According to Dr. Kenneth Kizer of the State Department of Health Services, 
however, pregnant women who stop smoking early in the pregnancy have a good 
chance to stay off cigarettes. SHARI ROAN
