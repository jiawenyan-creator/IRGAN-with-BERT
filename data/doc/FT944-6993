FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: NW Water rises
Shares in North West Water reversed an early retreat and powered ahead
gaining 9 to 529p, in trade of 2.5m, as the market gave a favourable welcome
to the group's new partnership with US construction services group Bechtel
and favourable interim results.
The deal, designed to boost NWW's international water and waste operations,
also involves the sale of the group's engineering subsidiary and
transferring the management of its five-year capital investment programme to
its new US partner.
NWW also reported an 8 per cent increase in interim profits to Pounds
176.4m, in figures brought forward from next week to tie in with the
partnership announcement. But the 8.9 per cent increase in the dividend to
8.35p was said to have fallen a 'little short' of market expectations.
Mr Richard Alderman at NatWest Securities one of the group's brokers who
remained upbeat, saying: 'There are obvious long-term benefits of a tie-up
with Bechtel. Even if today's dividend is on the low side, the company has
reiterated its long-term stance that dividend growth will be at least 6 per
cent (real) for the next four years.'
Aside from the North West excitement, the mood was dampened by half-year
results from Welsh Water below market expectations. The group reported a
profit of Pounds 49.4m after exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds
28.5m. One observer said: 'Welsh has been forced to write off more than
twice the purchase price of Acer since its acquisition two years ago. That
takes some doing.' Many brokers said they would be downgrading full-year
expectations.
