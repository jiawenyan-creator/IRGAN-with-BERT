SUMMARY:

 On September 13, 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a 

Federal Register

with class I substances. These waivers were granted to the Upjohn Company (Upjohn) and E.I. DuPont de Nemours 
Company (Dupont). Within the notice of September 13, 1994, two technical errors were made, one each in the Upjohn and
Dupont discussions. The purpose of today's action is to correct these technical errors. The corrections are discussed

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background



On February 11, 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the final labeling regulations implementing
section 611 (58 FR 8136) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. The regulations
include a section that permits a manufacturer to petition EPA to temporarily exempt a product manufactured with a
class I substance from the labeling requirements. 



This Action




When transcribing information from the Upjohn petition for exemption, to the September 13, 1994 notice, EPA inadvertently
listed the wrong chemical as an actual alternative for the use of CFC12 as a stabilizer for Upjohn's sterilization
process. The chemical Spectinomycin Hydrochloride was stated as the replacement for the use of CFC12 in this
process. The notice should have stated on page 47049 in the second column that Upjohn submitted a petition to the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve the modification of its use of a CFC12/Ethylene Oxide (ETO) mixture
in the sterilization process to 100% Ethylene Oxide. Therefore, the notice of September 13, 1994, is corrected to
state that the alternative chemical submitted by Upjohn to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval is
ethylene oxide (ETO).
