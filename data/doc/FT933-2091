FT  21 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Enterprising launch for
new magazine - In a Nutshell
The small business market has proved a difficult one for magazine
publishers. A big obstacle has been the refusal of business owners to see
themselves as part of a small firms 'community'. Most define themselves in
terms of their sector of activity - as wine bar owners, software businesses,
and the like.
The latest attempt to break into this market comes in the shape of
Enterprise, a monthly costing Pounds 2. Subjects in the first issue include
raising finance, getting paid on time, and the value of market research.
