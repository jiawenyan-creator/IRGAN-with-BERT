  [Text] In an exclusive interview with the Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation, British High Commissioner David Madden 
said the British bases in Cyprus are a force of stability in the 
island and offer military advantages to Britain and significant 
financial benefits to Cyprus. Madden described the bases as a 
significant military capital for his country and the West, 
adding that the operation of the bases contributes 100 million 
pounds to the Cypriot economy. Commenting on an observation that 
the bases did not offer safety to Cyprus during the Turkish 
invasion in 1974, Madden said that 1974 is history. 
  The British high commissioner reiterated his country's 
position that, based on the 1960 agreements, Britain owes 
nothing to Cyprus for the operation of the bases. Asked about 
the British imports of goods from the occupied areas, Madden 
said this trade is neither a political action nor does it 
constitute a recognition of the occupied areas. He said: This 
stance is in line with Article 5 of the agreement linking Cyprus 
with the European Union. He added that his country expressed 
its views at the European Court, which is expected to make a 
decision. Madden said: Through trade, Britain is trying to 
achieve an intercommunal balance.
