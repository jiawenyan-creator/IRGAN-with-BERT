FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: EFM new Japan trust raises half of target
EDINBURGH FUND Managers yesterday announced that the launch of its new Japan
investment trust had raised Pounds 10m.
This was much lower than the original target of Pounds 20m, but the company
said that it was still satisfied with the launch, organised by James Capel,
because it had found that many investors were still nervous about the
Japanese market.
Mr Iain Watt, managing director of EFM, said: 'I'm just delighted that we've
got the trust away. I don't think there's been a trust launched before when
the market has looked such good value.'
He also took heart from the fact that the combined price of shares and
warrants, which started trading on Friday, was at a premium of about 3 per
cent to the trust's net asset value. EFM attributed this to interest in the
shares from private investors, which had been reported by several private
client stockbrokers.
However, the bulk of the placement was made with institutions, which
accounted for about 70 per cent of the shares.
Mr Watt said: 'The question now is where does Japan go from here? In the
longer term I'm quite confident, and I think this was a good opportunity to
buy.'
Yesterday the price of ordinary shares dropped a penny to 96p while the
warrants rose a penny to 33p.
