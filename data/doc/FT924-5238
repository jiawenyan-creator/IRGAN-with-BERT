FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Recession dents Castings
CASTINGS, the West Midlands-based iron castings producer, announced a fall
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.59m in the six months to
September 30, as the depth of the recession dented its long record of solid
profits growth.
Turnover fell to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 16.9m), and tightening margins reduced
operating profit to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.45m).
Mr Brian Cooke, chairman, said 'good cash management' led to an increase in
other income to Pounds 282,704 (Pounds 246,137), which would have been
higher if not for lower interest rates.
Castings' foundries were operating at an average of 70 to 75 per cent of
full capacity. The group shed about 10 per cent of its 1,000-strong
workforce in the half-year as costs were cut.
The interim dividend is held at 1.3p, against a drop in earnings per share
from 5.5p to 5.05p.
