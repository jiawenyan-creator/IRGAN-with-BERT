assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (MTA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.


Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
