BFN 

  [Text] The fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear plant 
accident eight years ago is still evident in Finland. A survey 
covering southern Finland carried out by plane a few weeks ago 
revealed regions where radioactivity in the area is still 
surprisingly high. In addition, there were smaller regions, 
including Myrskylae and Kuhmoinen, where cesium 137 was found in 
quantities of 200 kilo- becquerels per square kilometer. These 
amounts are not dangerous for humans even though they are 
conspicuously high. Levels of 560 kilo-becquerels would demand 
protective measures.
