FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (2): Some employers are sceptical
 -Around the world, the MBA provokes a variety of reactions
BRASH yuppy in red braces, with the passport to a megabucks salary? Or the
experienced international executive, endowed with the most respected and
widely recognised management qualification?
There is some evidence that the unflattering image of the MBA is being laid
to rest. But this high-profile product of a still growing number of North
American, British and continental European business schools still provokes
sceptical reactions from certain employers.
The MBA market is at an important juncture. Following three years of hectic
growth in the numbers joining MBA courses in the UK, it looks as though
1993, at least, will be something of a disappointment. The prestigious
schools still have many more good applicants than places, but research by
the London-based Association of MBAs (Amba) suggests that, overall, the
recent trend has been reversed.
Amba's preliminary findings show that students joining UK courses this year
 -more than 90 - are down by 10-15 per cent. And the funds allocated to
would-be MBAs under the association's loan scheme have fallen by one third.
'My gut feeling is that this is the effect of the recession finally coming
through,' says Mr Roger McCormick, director general of Amba. 'There is a
general view that it takes two years for an MBA candidate to get to the
starting gate. It takes time to get a spouse or partner on side, to quit a
job, to find the necessary funds, and to apply to a good business school.'
Mr McCormick believes that next year will probably be flat, but that growth
should resume thereafter. 'At least there is far less witless talk of
indefinite expansion, and more of a willingness to go back to basics and
address what the market and industry really want,' he says.
Professor Jim Ellert, MBA faculty co-ordinator at the International
Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne, Switzerland,
acknowledges that there has been a 'flattening out' in the number of
applicants for IMD's MBA course, and that this pattern is probably reflected
elsewhere on the continent.
'Is it temporary, due to the state of the economy and the greater risks of
leaving a safe job? Or is it a secular trend? My feeling is that it is the
cycle, but not everyone here agrees. It will be three to five years before
we know for sure,' Professor Ellert says.
At the London Business School, where numbers this autumn are likely to be
down after a record 200 plus intake last October, Catherine Hastings says:
'For many schools it's a choice between reducing the size of the class or
letting the quality slip.'
In the US the situation is rather different. The total number of MBA
graduates each year has reached a plateau at about 70,000 - but this is a
very high number: three times the UK output on a population adjusted basis.
Besides coming to terms with a more competitive market place many of the top
business schools - Harvard, Wharton, the LBS, for instance - have trying
hard to tailor curricula better to the needs of industry. 'On a lot of
courses there is less of the tidy boxes with, say, marketing, finance and
human resources taught at different times of the day, and more integration
and project work demonstrating how messy things are in the real world,' says
one commentator.
The practical emphasis is particularly notable in the US, where
'internationalisation' is now in vogue. But many European schools claim to
have the edge; they suspect that some of their North American counterparts
believe it is enough to demonstrate that 10 per cent of their class members
come from the Far East.
Internationalisation is not just about participant mix - although
enthusiasts stress that the benefits of being in an MBA class with students
from 30 or 40 other countries, and seeing problems from so many different
points of view, are incalculable. Equally important is the course content
and faculty approach.
Research conducted this year by Hay Management Consultants, based on more
than 2,200 respondents* indicates that about 30 per cent of UK MBA graduates
end up in consultancy or finance. A significant proportion is employed by
manufacturing industries, while 10 per cent plump for education or other
parts of the public sector.
LBS says it has recently noted a new bias towards manufacturing, and growing
interest from multinationals attracted by an MBA's internationally
transferable skills. Others note a trend for MBAs to move from larger to
smaller companies.
The Hay survey probably provides the most detailed picture of the current
British MBA.
It shows that the most important motivation for pursuing an MBA is to change
an individual's career path; closely followed by a desire for improved job
opportunities. Increasing salary was more likely to be mentioned by those
graduating in the late 1980s than in the early 1990s.
The survey nevertheless demonstrates that MBAs can expect a reasonable
salary increase on qualification. In 1991 the figure for those changing
their employer immediately after graduation was 34 per cent, representing a
16.5 per cent increase on top of the average earnings index during the
course of their studies. The premium, though, was lower than that gained
during the 1980s, and may be lower now.
An important conclusion of the research is the shift towards part-time
courses with employer backing. Of those who had all their fees paid by their
employer, more than 72 per cent stayed loyal for at least a year after
graduation.
The findings of the survey are encouraging, but there are still many
unresolved issues facing the MBA 'industry'. Are there not too many business
schools offering this qualification in the UK? Should not mergers be
considered, as a way of improving standards and recruiting better faculty?
Why is it that, while Anglo-Saxon economies have MBAs coming out of their
ears, MBA graduates are so few in Germany and Japan?
As Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
put it in a lecture earlier this year, there are other systems for
guaranteeing a supply of competent, trained managers. The MBA should be
seen, he said, 'as just one aspect of a manager's development, rather than
as an elegant capstone to the 5-21 education of a select few.'
The MBA has its place, but it will always have to try hard to be relevant
and viable.
