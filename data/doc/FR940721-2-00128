or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The PHLX has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the reduced-value long-term XOC options will benefit investors by providing
them with a valuable hedging and investing vehicle that should reflect accurately the overall movement of the OTC
market and provide investors with additional means to hedge portfolios against long-term market risk at a reduce
cost. The Commission believes that the lower cost of the reduced-value XOC options should allow investors to hedge
their portfolios with a smaller outlay of capital and may facilitate investor participation in the market for XOC
options, which should, in turn, help to maintain the depth and liquidity of the market for XOC options, thereby protecting
investors and the public interest.

The Commission believes that trading in the reduced-value XOC options will not have an adverse market impact or be
susceptible to manipulation.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission has determined previously that the full-value XOC is a broad-based index
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and does not believe that dividing the XOC by ten changes this determination. The reduced-value XOC index will contain
the same stocks with the same weightings as the XOC and will be calculated in the same manner as the XOC (with the exception
of being one-tenth the value of the XOC). Accordingly, the Commission finds that the reduced-value XOC is a broad-based
index. Moreover, the Commission believes that any potential manipulation concerns raised by the reduced-value
XOC options are minimized by the fact that positions in the reduced-value XOC options and full-value XOC options will
be aggregated for position and exercise limit purposes.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Commission notes that the same Exchange surveillance procedures applied to full-value XOC options
will be used for the reduced-value XOC options.

The Commission notes that, prior to listing long-term reduced-value XOC options, the PHLX will be required to provide
written representations that both the Exchange and OPRA have the necessary systems capacity to support the new series
of long-term reduced-value XOC options.

In this regard, it is reasonable for the PHLX to count ten reduced-value XOC option contract as equivalent to one full-value
XOC contract for position and exercise limit purposes because the underlying value of one XOC contract is equal to
the underlying value of ten reduced-value XOC contracts.

</FOOTNOTE>


Because the Exchange's existing rules applicable to stock index options, including, among others, sales practice
rules, margin requirements, and position and exercise limits, will apply to the reduced-value XOC options, the Commission
believes that the market for the reduced-value XOC options should be fair and orderly and does not raise any new customer
protection concerns.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposal and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. In light of the fact that the Commission has approved proposals by other exchanges to list reduced-value options
on existing indexes, and in light of PHLX rule 1101A(b)(iii), which allows the PHLX to list series of long term options
on stock indexes, the Commission believes that the proposal to list long term reduced-value XOC options presents
no new regulatory issues. In addition, the Commission believes that Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 clarify and strengthen
the Exchange's proposal. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with the Act to approve the proposal
and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 on an accelerated basis.
