FT  08 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wm Low advisers served shareholder
interests well
Sir, Your Lex column Tesco/Wm Low (August 4) surely misses the point - in
encouraging advisers to think of their reputations rather than of the best
interests of their clients.
Tesco's original offer (one Tesco share for each Wm Low share) was put
forward after two quite separate bouts of negotiation, and was judged likely
to be the best available now - in the absence of a competing offer.
The Wm Low directors could see, sadly, that one Tesco share was a better
investment, both short-term and long-term, than one Wm Low share. It would
have been irresponsible, although tempting, to deny shareholders that
opportunity - which was only available if recommended by the Wm Low board.
Wm Low and its advisers also correctly judged that, with no strategic stakes
pledged to Tesco, there was plenty of time for the other obvious candidates
to come forward. Sounding these out privately was not the right course of
action, as Wm Low's chairman has already made clear.
We were well served by advisers who had the courage and good sense to
anticipate but disregard possible adverse comment over recommending this
offer - and to concentrate on shareholders' best interests, rather than on a
macho concept of merchant banking behaviour which sometimes interferes with
such transactions.
