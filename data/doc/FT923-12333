FT  20 JUL 92 / Producers attack network system
INDEPENDENT producers have accused the Independent Television Commission of
'failing to discharge its statutory duty' in making fair arrangements for
the ITV network.
The attack, backed up by counsel's opinion, is in a submission from the
Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact) to the Office of Fair
Trading.
The OFT has been given responsibility for ensuring that there are no
anti-competitive elements in the new ITV network arrangements for the next
10 years and that independent producers are not discriminated against.
Among the changes Pact wants are:
A network centre set up as a free-standing company rather than as part of
the ITV trade association.
A separate programme licence for independents who would not have to supply
their programmes through a 'commending' ITV company.
A five-year exclusive licence for programmes instead of the 15 years that
ITV is seeking.
The ITV proposals are also criticised in a submission to the OFT from
lawyers Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones.
In an independent view, Mr Michael Henry, a media lawyer at the firm, says
he believes that the networking arrangements in their present form 'have no
chance whatsoever of satisfying the 'competition test' set out in the
Broadcasting Act.
