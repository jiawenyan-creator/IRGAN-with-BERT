FT  06 MAY 93 / Fishermen change focus of disruption campaign
BRITISH fishermen have launched a campaign of administrative disruption
aimed at frustrating the European Community's fisheries regime and UK
government policy on preserving stocks.
It emerged yesterday that fishermen's leaders secretly agreed last month on
a tactical switch away from blockades to non-compliance with EC quota
restrictions and new licensing that limits the number of days spent at sea.
Further blockades similar to those that have disrupted a number of UK ports
since the beginning of the year have not been ruled out however.
The new tactics emerged yesterday with leaders of the National Federation of
Fishermen's Organisations (England and Wales) and the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation urging their members to appeal against the new licensing
arrangements of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act.
Mr Robert Allan, chief executive of the Scottish federation, said last
night: 'The name of the game is that we do not like it and we are resolved
to use all the instruments at our disposal to frustrate it.'
In the past week fishermen throughout the country have been refusing to hand
in their EC quota log sheets and landing declarations to local port offices
as required. Instead they have been sending them to different departments of
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in London and elsewhere,
forcing delays and extra work for the government.
Yesterday's move follows the announcement on Tuesday by fisheries minister
Mr David Curry of the new rules under which fishermen's days-at-sea
allocations will be based.
