<DOCTITLE>Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on September 16, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The certification notice will soon be published in the 

Federal Register

.

At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New
findings show that worker separations from Weidmer Brothers Well Service occurred in the State of Montana.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers of Weidmer Bros. Well Service who were affected
by increased imports.

The amended notice applicable to TAW30,165 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers of Weidmer Bros. Well Service, Tioga, North Dakota and in the State of Montana engaged in employment related
to the exploration and drilling of crude oil and natural gas who became totally or partially separated from employment
on or after July 13, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.




Signed at Washington, DC, this 17th day of October, 1994.
