FT  08 JUL 92 / Observer: Interference on the line
When it comes to corporate shenanigans, it is hard to beat the comings and
goings at the top of Ireland's state-owned telephone system - Telecom
Eireann. Yesterday, Professor John Scanlan became the third chairman in the
utility's eight year roller-coaster history. Given that his predecessors
fell out with the government he would be wise to keep his hand in teaching
electronics.
The relationship between the Irish government and its telephone company has
always been a prickly one. There is an apocryphal tale of how one junior
minister of posts and telecommunications used to travel around the country
with a car full of telephones. When a constituent complained that he had
waited for months for a phone, the minister would solve that little problem
by going round to the boot of his car.
Like British Telecom, Telecom Eireann's service is much better than it was
and waiting lists have been dramatically reduced. But its relations with the
government have not improved. Hence the revolving door at the top of the
organisation. The government would dearly love to privatise the company but
until it stops interfering it's going to have a job persuading foreign
investors to take it off its hands.
