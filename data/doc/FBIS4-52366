<F P=106> [Letter from Norodom Sirivut, secretary-general of </F>
FUNCINPEC, National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] 
  [Text] I was astonished to read in the "INSIDE INDOCHINA" 
section of the Bangkok Post of May 3, 1994 the article written 
by aJean de Toulkork. 
  I would like to clarify as follows: 
  1. HRH Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime 
minister of Cambodia and president of FUNCINPEC, never intended 
to fire or to dismiss me from the secretary-general of FUNCINPEC 
position. 
  2. I am myself, Samdech Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, currently 
in the position of secretary-general of FUNCINPEC. I perform and 
continue to perform this duty and fulfill my responsibilities 
with the great support of Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, 
the president. 
  3. In this capacity, as a secretary-general of the party, I 
serve and will serve the president, the party and the members of 
FUNCINPEC very faithfully. 
  Norodom Sirivudh Secretary-General FUNCINPEC
