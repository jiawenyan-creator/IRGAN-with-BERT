HAGBERG WAS ALSO VICTIM OF AN ACCIDENT 
Stacey Toran was the second active Raider player to die in an automobile 
accident during the nearly 30 years the franchise has been in existence. 
Roger Hagberg, 31, a reserve fullback and special teams player for the Oakland 
Raiders in the late 1960s, was killed in an accident near his home in 
Lafayette, a suburb of Oakland, on April 15, 1970. 
By coincidence, Toran and Hagberg both wore uniform No. 30. TOM LaMARRE
