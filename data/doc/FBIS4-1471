  [Text] The Government of Rwanda has apologized to President 
Ali Hasan Mwinyi for failing to attend the Rwanda peace talks in 
Arusha last weekend. 
  In a message delivered to President Mwinyi today by the 
Rwanda minister of communications and transport, Andre 
Ntagerura, and the Rwanda Justice Minister Agnes Ntamabyariro, 
the Government of Rwanda apologized for the failure to attend 
the meeting, citing travel difficulties in Zaire and 
misinformation as the reasons for their delegation's absence. 
They called on the president to continue his efforts to 
reconcile the warring factions in Rwanda in keeping with the 
Arusha peace accord signed last year. President Mwinyi agreed 
to call for another meeting at a date to be announced later. 
  Meanwhile, President Mwinyi held talks with the Belgium 
secretary of state for cooperation and development, Mr. Eric 
Derycke, on economic cooperation between the two countries and 
on the Government of Tanzania's efforts to resolve the political 
crisis in Rwanda.
