LOCAL; 
BODY FOUND IN PLACENTIA CONDO FIRE 
Orange County firefighters discovered a woman's body inside a Placentia 
condominium that was destroyed by fire late Sunday, officials said. 
The body was burned beyond recognition and an autopsy was scheduled for this 
morning, police said. 
The fire broke out about 10:30 p.m. inside a two-story, four-unit complex in 
the 1400 block of Prospect Avenue, Orange County Fire communications supervisor 
Dan Southworth said. It took 35 firefighters 16 minutes to control the fire, 
which destroyed one unit and caused minor damage to another. 
Placentia detectives were investigating the death, Police Lt. Daryll Thomann 
said. "We hope to rule out homicide or determine it was an accidental death," 
he said.
