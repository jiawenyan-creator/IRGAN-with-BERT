FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hachette accuses Havas of share
move
HACHETTE, the heavily-indebted French media group, has accused Havas, one of
its strongest competitors in the French media market, of having secretly
bought up a sizeable block of its shares.
Since the start of this week, Hachette's shares have risen sharply. The
shares yesterday rose by FFr16.8 to FFr158.7, a leap of 11.8 per cent on the
day. This followed brisk dealing on Tuesday and Wednesday when 615,800
shares were traded representing 3.1 per cent of the company. Hachette's
shares started the week at just FFr115.7.
Initially the rise in Hachette's share price was attributed to speculation
ahead of the announcement of the terms for its proposed merger with Matra,
the defence electronics concern which, like Hachette, is chaired by Mr
Jean-Luc Lagardere and controlled by his family.
Havas later denied any interest in buying shares in Hachette, Reuter
reported.
Hachette made a net loss of FFr1.93bn in 1991 on turnover of FFr30.4bn.
For the first half of 1992 Havas made a net profit of FFr567m against
FFr939m in the same period in 1991. Turnover was up 6.6 per cent at
FFr14.3bn.
