FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US expects German, Japanese steps towards
world recovery
THE US expects Germany and Japan to take 'decisive, politically difficult'
steps in the coming months to promote a world recovery, Mr James Dobbins, US
ambassador to the European Community, said yesterday, writes Lionel Barber
in Brussels.
Speaking to Christian Democrats in Bonn, he sought to calm EC fears about
the administration's trade policies and its apparent indifference toward the
EC. He made clear that the US does not at present intend to re-open the
accord on Airbus Industrie.
