FT  07 MAY 94 / Hungarians turn out to oppose socialists
More than 10,000 people attended a rally in Budapest yesterday as Hungary's
governing conservatives resorted to increasingly desperate measures to ward
off the widely predicted return to power of the former communists - now the
Hungarian Socialist party - in parliamentary elections tomorrow, Nicholas
Denton and Chrystia Freeland write from Budapest.
A leading conservative official warned of a far-right backlash if the
Socialists dominate the next government and, as the conservatives fear,
impose controls on the media.
'If the Socialists establish a monopoly, there would be a civil war,' Mr
Ferenc Kulin, leader of the parliamentary group of the governing Hungarian
Democratic Forum, said.
Yesterday evening also saw thousands of right-wingers praying at Budapest's
central cathedral for divine intervention.
