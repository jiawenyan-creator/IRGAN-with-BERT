FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Quotes
'The tide of ideas in British politics is at last on the turn. For the first
time in a generation it is the rightwing that appears lost and
disillusioned'
'(The Tories') time is up. Their philosophy is done, their experiment is
over, their failure is clear. It is time to go'
'This is my socialism and we should stop apologising for using the word. It
is not the socialism of Marx or state control, it is rooted in a
straightforward view of society and the understanding that the individual
does best in a strong and decent community of people with principles and
standards'
'Tory sleaze in high places has given birth to a yob culture - Tory
philosophy is the most effective yob creation scheme'
Tony Blair
