NEWPORT-TO-ENSENDA RACE GRINDS TO A FINISH AS LAST YACHTS COME IN 
The 42nd Newport-to-Ensenada yacht race dragged to a close Sunday when the last 
of the 406 boats remaining in the race eased across the finish line shortly 
before the finish deadline at 11 a.m. 
How slow was the race? The official report from the sponsoring Newport Ocean 
Sailing Assn. said that 406 of the 520 starters crossed the line under sail, 
making it one of the slowest on record. 
The slowness of the race didn't dampen the spirits of the hundreds who crowded 
the patio of the Bahia Hotel to witness the trophy presentation that officially 
ended the race. 
Winner of the President of Mexico trophy for the best corrected time in the 
International Offshore Rule (IOR) class was Amante, co-skippered by Bud and Mel 
Richley of Lido Isle Yacht Club. 
Winner of the President of the U.S trophy for the best corrected time in the 
Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) Hot Rum, sailed by Albert Castillon, 
King Harbor Yacht Club. The presenter was Walker Cronkite, who crewed one of 
the racing yachts. 
Dennis Conner, skipper of the 60-foot catamaran, Stars &amp; Stripes, won the 
special NOSA trophy for the first yacht to finish, but failed to show up to 
accept the award. It was accepted by a crew member. 
NOSA president Doug Wall said all of the boats were accounted for by noon 
Sunday. The official list of DNFs (did not finish) was 114.
