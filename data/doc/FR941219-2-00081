 

In cases where the provision of free services results in a benefit to the provider, the anti-kickback statute is implicated.
If offered or accepted in return for the referral of Medicare or State health care plan business, both the laboratory
and the physician may be violating the anti-kickback statute. There is no statutory exception or ``safe harbor''
to immunize any party to such a practice because the Federal programs do not realize the benefit of these ``free'' services.
See 42 CFR 1001.952(h)(3)(iii).


Other Inducements


The following are additional examples of inducements offered by clinical laboratories which may implicate the anti-kickback
statute:
&bull;Free pick-up and disposal of bio-hazardous waste products (such as sharps) unrelated to the collection of
specimens for the outside laboratory.
&bull;Provision of computers or fax machines, unless such equipment is integral to, and exclusively used for, performance
of the outside laboratory's work.
&bull;Provision of free laboratory testing for health care providers, their families and their employees.
When one purpose of these arrangements is to induce the referral of program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both
the clinical laboratory and the health care provider may be liable under the statute and may be subject to criminal
prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
