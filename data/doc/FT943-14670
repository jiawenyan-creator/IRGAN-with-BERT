FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: St Modwen more than trebled at Pounds 3.96m
St Modwen Properties, property investment and development concern, more than
trebled pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 3.96m in the six months
to May 31. Gross rental income grew 31 per cent to Pounds 5.18m.
Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, described the performance as excellent and
announced a 66 per cent hoist in the interim dividend to 0.5p (0.3p),
covered 4.4 times by earnings of 2.3p (0.6p).
The result was helped by 'significant' contributions from two development
sales at Stoke-on-Trent and Tamworth, Staffordshire.
During the period the company sold three small investment properties at
Rugeley, Staffs, and Torquay and Plymouth in Devon. Mr Clarke pointed out
that the revenue achieved from these sales averaged about 20 per cent more
than their book value at the November 30 year end.
Mr Clarke said that profits from the recent sale of the Octagon Centre,
Oldbury should be judged as being 'one-off' in nature. But even without
this, profits to be realised from the sale of the Oldbury Green Retail Park,
due to be completed in September, should 'ensure a second half result in
excess of the first'.
Following the sales, gearing will fall to about 50 per cent.
