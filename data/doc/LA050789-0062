LONG BEACH PLANNERS WILL EXPAND EFFORTS TO SPREAD WORD ON PROJECTS 
Under a proposal that was passed upon second reading by the City Council, the 
Planning Commission will increase its efforts to advise residents of 
developments proposed for their neighborhoods. 
The revisions in the commission's notification guidelines were prompted by 
complaints from neighborhood activists that they sometimes do not know of 
development plans until they have already won city approval. 
When dealing with large projects -- more than 45 feet in height, more than 
100,000 square feet in floor area and with a seating capacity of more than 500 
people -- the commission will send notices to property owners within a 500-foot 
radius of the proposed development site rather than within a 300-foot radius, 
as now required. 
For the first time, resident managers of rental properties within the proposed 
area also will be notified.
