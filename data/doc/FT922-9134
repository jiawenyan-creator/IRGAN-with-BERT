FT  09 MAY 92 / Deal on gas emission curbs imminent
NEGOTIATORS from 143 countries appeared on the verge of agreement late last
night on an historic treaty to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other
gases blamed for an alarming rise in the earth's temperature.
Mr Jean Ripert of France, chairman of the United Nations-sponsored
negotiating committee, hailed what he termed a 'decisive step', though the
document fell far short of the strict controls that negotiators originally
sought. Environmentalist groups complained that the treaty had been stripped
of any measures to make reductions in greenhouse gases binding on the
developed countries.
Mr Ripert was instrumental in narrowing differences between the US and EC
members, which, he acknowledged, were serious enough to have raised
questions over Washington even joining the treaty.
The convention will be a key document for adoption at the Earth Summit to be
held in Rio de Janeiro next month. Agreement on how to deal with global
warming would remove political obstacles to President George Bush's presence
at the 175-nation conference, which until now has been in doubt.
The draft convention would commit industrialised countries to aim to limit
emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels. But, in deference to US
reservations, no deadline for this would be set.
US officials said the text represented 'a delicate balance of views'.
While the US has opposed the inclusion of binding targets or timetables for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, its delegates see the current text as
committing it only to a frame of reference, rather than to implementing
specific targets or timetables.
The US is also pleased that the agreement now refers to reductions in all
greenhouse gases, rather than just carbon dioxide, the principal such gas.
