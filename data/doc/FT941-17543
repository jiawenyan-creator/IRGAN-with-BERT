FT  04 JAN 94 / Private bill-drafters urged
Parliament should consider employing private-sector lawyers to help draft
bills rather than relying on Whitehall, a report published today by a
leading think tank urges.
The report, written by Mr Graham Mather, head of the cross-party European
Policy Forum, attacks the current system under which the government mostly
relies on the expertise of 26 government parliamentary lawyers.
Mr Mather believes that these lawyers are indulging in 'monkish seclusion
and restrictive practices'.
According to Mr Mather, a number of recent pieces of legislation have been
ill-thought-through and required significant early amendment. These included
the Dangerous Dogs Act, the Criminal Justice Act and the Child Support Act.
He also cites research by Lord Howe showing that by the end of the 1980s the
government was tabling an average of 2,668 amendments to its own bills in
the House of Lords in each parliamentary session.
Mr Mather says that the use of private-sector barristers, solicitors and
other specialists would widen the range of drafting talent available to
Whitehall departments and speed up the parliamentary process.
'Because they are not inured to some of the bad habits of governmental
practice, they would be more likely to insist on reasonable timetables and
proper consultation,' says Mr Mather. 'It would more clearly be in their
interests to draft legislation earlier.'
