STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST PESKY MEDFLY 
Officials of Los Angeles are constantly telling us to conserve water and cut 
down on usage. Seems to me they have overlooked the quickest solution: Stop the 
malathion spraying so we don't have tens of thousands of people all over the 
Los Angeles Basin forced into washing their cars to avoid paint damage. The 
officials can't have it both ways, folks.
