FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: A lesson for teacher to reflect on
Sir, I was dismayed to read of the prominence given to the views expressed
by Mr Peter Owen, chairman of the Independent Schools Association, in your
report, 'UK schools at bottom of class' (October 28).
I would make no claim to pass judgment on the competitive position of the
education system in Britain as opposed to those of our European neighbours
and I am sure that there are many aspects that could and should be improved
upon. My main experience of the education system has been in working with
schools, assisting them with careers work. Owen's contemptuous estimation of
the work of the waiter reveals much about his own lack of understanding of
the world for which he is supposed to be preparing his pupils. Next time he
visits a restaurant, he may care to reflect upon the craft skills,
organisational ability and social skills required to perform what ought to
be a valued and respected profession.
