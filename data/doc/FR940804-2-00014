 

Period of Investigation 



The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. 



Case History 



Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.


On February 11, 1994, the U.S. Embassy in Brazil provided the Department with volume and value statistics for Brazilian
SSB producing firms. On February 14, 1994, Instituto Brasileiro de Siderugica, the association for the iron and steel
industry in Brazil, submitted volume and value data on behalf of its members. 

Also on February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 

On February 28, 1994, the Department sent its antidumping questionnaire to Acos Villares, S.A. (Villares). This
company accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the
POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b). On March 1, 1994, the Department received a letter from Villares stating
that it would not participate in this investigation. No questionnaire responses were submitted. 

On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes
one class or kind of merchandise. (

See

 May 11, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 

On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) and (d). 



Best Information Available 



Because Villares failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we based our determination on BIA pursuant
to section 776(c) of the Act. 

As BIA, we are assigning 19.43 percent, the highest margin among the margins alleged in the petition, in accordance
with the two-tiered BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon a respondent who
refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes the proceeding, and as outlined in the Antifriction Bearings
(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Review (56 FR 31692, 31704, July 11, 1991). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has
been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit (

see Allied Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 941112 (June 30, 1994); and 

Allied Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States, 

996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993); 

see also Krupp Stahl, AG et al. 

v. 

United States, 

822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993)). 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) (19 U.S.C. 1673b(d)(1)) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service
to suspend liquidation of all entries of SSB from Brazil, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this
notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this
notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which
the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.

ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination.
