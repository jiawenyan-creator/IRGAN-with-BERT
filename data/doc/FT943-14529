FT  14 JUL 94 / Ofgas ready to accept delay
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, says it could accept a short delay to the
April 1996 target for the phased opening of the domestic gas market as long
as legislation is in place ensuring full liberalisation in 1998.
The regulator was responding to a disclosure by British Gas that it had
asked the government to put back by six months the 1996 target date to open
5 per cent of the domestic market to competition.
British Gas said such a move would ensure that the information technology
systems which are being put in place in preparation for market
liberalisation 'are fully bedded down'.
It described the development of the new systems as a 'leap in the dark'.
It dismissed fears voiced by some independent gas marketers that the delay
was part of a plan to scupper competition. 'We're not in the business of
scuppering anything.'
British Gas said it wanted to see the legislation needed to open up the
market included in the Queen's speech this autumn. It was also satisfied
with other parts of the liberalisation timetable, which calls for 5 per cent
of the market to be opened in 1996 and 10 per cent in 1997 before full
liberalisation in 1998.
Ofgas yesterday said its priority was to see the new Gas Act in place. 'A
six-month delay would not be too much of a problem' as long as full
liberalisation in 1998 was assured.
