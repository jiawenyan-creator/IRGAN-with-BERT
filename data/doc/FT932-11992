FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew upbeat on EC influence
EUROPE'S EFFORTS to dismantle land and trade frontiers are helping to ease
sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, secretary of
state for the province, said yesterday, Ralph Atkins writes.
Northern Ireland secretaries rarely link the province's problems with wider
developments in the European Community - usually regarding the two as
separate.
But Sir Patrick said: 'When land and trade frontiers are being dismantled,
it is harder to generate enthusiasm for keeping up sectarian fences.'
He told the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce in London that there was
a 'genuine desire' by most people 'to look more towards the future and less
towards the past'.
Sir Patrick added: 'No one should underestimate the influence which
developments within the EC have exerted on this process for change.' He
hopes to restart round-table talks after the province's May 19 local
elections.
