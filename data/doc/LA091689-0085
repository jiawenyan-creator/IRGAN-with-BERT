METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAND-SWAP BILL FOR DUMP DEAD FOR NOW 
A complex land-swap bill that could meet Los Angeles' need for a new garbage 
dump will not be passed by Congress this year because city, county and federal 
officials have failed to reach agreement, the measure's sponsor said. 
"We are essentially past the time when we can move something through Congress," 
said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). "If we can work something out, we 
can get it through early next year." 
The sweeping bill could open the way for a new landfill in Elsmere Canyon. It 
could also provide the city with a third of its future electric power, improve 
the run-down Hansen Dam recreation area in the northeast San Fernando Valley 
and preserve scenic canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
Despite their disappointment in the delay, city and county officials expressed 
optimism that they have made enough behind-the-scenes progress in recent weeks. 
Berman will revise the land-exchange bill, a preliminary version of which he 
first introduced last February, when Congress reconvenes in early 1990.
