IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION 
DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
Guess? vs. Jordache Trial Begins: A bitter dispute between two rival jeans 
makers went to trial in Superior Court on Tuesday. 
The four Marciano brothers who created the trendy jeans of the 1980s at Guess? 
Inc. seek damages from the three Nakash brothers, founders of Jordache 
Enterprises Ltd. In an earlier trial, a jury found the Marcianos and Guess were 
defrauded in a 1983 partnership agreement signed with the Nakashes. This jury 
will determine if damages are owed to the Marcianos. The Nakashes charge that 
the Marcianos filed the suit out of their own "seller's remorse." (Filed Nov. 
29, 1984; Case No. C524347)
