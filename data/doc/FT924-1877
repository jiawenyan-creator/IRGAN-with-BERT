FT  16 DEC 92 / Rao sacks 3 state BJP governments
INDIA'S federal government sacked three state governments ruled by a
pro-Hindu party yesterday and placed them under direct rule following
vicious communal riots sparked by the razing of a mosque, Reuter reports
from New Delhi.
An official said the decision was taken at a cabinet meeting presided over
by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister, and conveyed to President Shankar
Dayal Sharma.
A presidential proclamation said Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal
Pradesh, ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had been brought under
New Delhi's direct rule.
Mr Rao has been under pressure from within the cabinet and the ruling
Congress party to sack the three BJP-ruled governments to make a ban on
several religious groups effective. The official said the cabinet's decision
was based on the reports of the governors of the three states.
The BJP government of northern Uttar Pradesh state was dismissed immediately
after the razing of the mosque in Ayodhya by frenzied Hindu mobs on December
6.
The government last Thursday banned the Rashtriya Swaymsevak Sangh (RSS),
the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, World Hindu Council) and the Bhajarang Dal,
all linked with the BJP and the temple campaign. It also banned two Moslem
religious groups.
