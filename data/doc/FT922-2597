FT  16 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Washington targets Brazil under new
missile rules
NEW US regulations intended to tighten controls on exports of missile
technology have targeted Brazil along with other countries whose missile
development programmes have traditionally aroused US scrutiny, such as Iran
and North Korea.
Several Brazilian missile and satellite launch projects have been included
on a new list subject to special licensing requirements. Ms Joan McEntee,
acting Commerce Department under-secretary for export administration, said
that the list would be used for export licensing, but 'should not be viewed
as a sanction against foreign countries'.
However, the inclusion of Brazil follows President George Bush's return from
Rio de Janeiro, where he took part in the Earth Summit.
US exporters will require individual validated licences for shipments to
Brazil's Sonda III, Sonda IV, SS-300, SS-1000, MB/EE Series Missile and VLS
Space Launch Vehicle. Other countries with missile projects on the list are
China, India, Pakistan, and South Africa, as well as Iran and North Korea
with their Scud projects.
The list also includes the entire Middle East, without naming individual
countries or projects. Commerce Department officials said this was because
concern about the area was more regional. But in the past this device has
been used to avoid offending Israel and Egypt, the US's main allies in the
region.
