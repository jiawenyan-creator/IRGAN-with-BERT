FT  21 SEP 93 / 'World Bank to raise lending commitments' - Correction
In the article 'World Bank to raise lending commitments', in the Financial
Times of September 20, a reference was made in the first paragraph to the
bank's lending commitments of 'Dollars 26.9bn in the past year to June 30'.
This figure should have been Dollars 23.7bn.
