  [Text] The "Partnership for Peace" was the main topic in 
the discussion between President Vaclav Havel and Polish Defense 
Minister Piotr Kolodziejdzyk at Prague Castle today. Both agreed 
that their countries' attitude toward the U.S. plan for 
partnership cooperation with NATO was similar. In this context, 
our president voiced his support for the continuation of mutual 
consultations and cooperation in modernizing the armies of the 
two neighboring states. 
  Minister Kolodziejdzyk said that NATO standards should be 
introduced into these armies as soon as possible and that a 
joint approach to a safe Europe should be adopted.
