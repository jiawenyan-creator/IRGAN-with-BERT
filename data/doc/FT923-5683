FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: America West finance deal
AMERICA West Airlines said a US bankruptcy court granted interim approval to
expand its existing debtor-in-possession financing facility, Reuter reports
from Phoenix.
The carrier added that Ansett Worldwide Aviation agreed to lift the DIP
financing by Dollars 10m to Dollars 53m.
America West said Ansett's decision was aided by the recently announced
participation in the DIP facility of a consortium comprising Arizona
investors and Ireland's GPA Group.
A final ruling is scheduled for September 9.
