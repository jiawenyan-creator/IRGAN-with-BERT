FT  30 JUN 93 / GEC faces strike
WORKERS at the six Scottish plants of GEC Marconi Avionics are to stage a
one-day strike tomorrow over a plan to introduce performance-related pay.
MSF, the industry and services union, which held a ballot among 1,700
members, said the action involved hourly-paid workers and staff up to junior
management level.
