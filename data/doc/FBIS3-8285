  [Excerpt] Representatives of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS] met today 
for their regular Monday talks. Their talks were likely to 
contain a new topic: the possibility that the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL] will join the coalition. 
  At a short press briefing, today's talks were described 
first 
by Vladimir Meciar and then by Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak 
National Party. 
  [Begin recording] [Meciar] The coalition talks concentrated 
on finding support in parliament from other political parties 
and movements for passing important decisions, such as the date 
of the elections, what to do before the elections, and the 
stabilization of the government. Then we discussed which party 
we should consider. It is, however, still too early to say more. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] We have heard that you are to 
hold talks today with the SDL. Can you reveal the topic of your 
talks? 
  [Meciar] The talks with the SDL are to be held this evening. 
We have informed the SNS about the likely course of these talks 
and our position. It is, however, premature to reveal anything 
because this is to be the first official meeting of this nature. 
  [Correspondent] What does your coalition partner think about 
these talks? 
  [Slota] The SNS sees clearly that political stabilization 
has 
priority. This means it wishes for early parliamentary 
elections to be held as soon as possible. For this reason, it 
will support all of the HZDS's steps. 
  [Correspondent] Would the SNS agree with an election 
coalition between the HZDS and the SDL, knowing that the SDL 
presidium said that it would be willing to get together with the 
SNS but without its chairman? 
  [Slota] I do not know the exact words they used. I doubt 
that 
anybody would formulate it in this way because Slota is not 
everything. A party is a party and Slota is Slota. In my view, 
the Slovak part of the SDL is aware that, in particular with 
regard to the economy, it is necessary to hold the elections in 
June. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, have you discussed 
personnel issues, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? 
  [Meciar] We analyzed the situation arising from the 
nonacceptance of Mr. Prokes by the president. He can be deputy 
prime minister but not minister. This is slightly paradoxical. 
Personnel issues will also be discussed tomorrow. 
  [Correspondent, in Czech] Mr. Prime Minister, would you be 
willing to change the date of the elections should an agreement 
be reached on other issues--as an exchange for something else? 
  [Meciar] For God's sake, we cannot make this into a market 
place. Citizens have made a decision through a petition that 
calls for a referendum. This should be implemented within 90 
days from the date decided by the president--that is, by the end 
of June 1994 at the latest. [passage omitted]
