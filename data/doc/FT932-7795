FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Laing joins growing number of UK
housebuilders to report sharp improvement
John Laing yesterday joined the growing number of UK housebuilders to report
a sharp improvement in the housing market since the beginning of this year.
The company said that agreed sales, on which a deposit had been paid, rose
significantly compared with the first four months of last year. Part of this
was because of a temporary rise in sales to Housing Associations taking
advantage of a government spending initiative which ended in March.
If Housing Association business was excluded, private sector sales had still
risen by 20 per cent, said the company, which operates only in south-east
England.
'Downward pressure on prices in the south-east has virtually ceased and the
need to employ sales incentives is reducing,' according to Laing which said
it had seen a considerable improvement in the level of deposits taken in the
first three months of 1993.
