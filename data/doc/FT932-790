FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Northern Telecom sees loss in
second term
NORTHERN Telecom sent a shock wave through the telecommunications equipment
industry late yesterday by forecasting a second-quarter loss and a
significant drop in earnings for 1993 as a whole.
The Toronto-based company also announced the replacement of its chairman Dr
Paul Stern by Mr Bradford Butler, a former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, the
US consumer goods group. Dr Stern stepped down earlier this year as
Northern's chief executive. Mr Butler is a Northern director.
Northern said the second-quarter loss mainly reflected unexpectedly weak
sales of public switching equipment and slimmer margins.
It said revenue growth in most European and North American markets had been
weaker than expected. A spokesman singled out lower capital spending by US
regional telephone companies and by Bell Canada.
Northern's first-quarter earnings of USDollars 75.9m were 27 per cent lower
than a year earlier, although revenues edged up 2.3 per cent to Dollars
1.94bn.
When the first-quarter results were published less than two months ago, Mr
Jean Monty, who replaced Dr Stern as chief executive, predicted that results
for the rest of the year would be similar on a quarter-by-quarter basis to
1992. Second-quarter earnings last year were Dollars 72.3m.
Trading in Northern's shares was halted in Toronto and New York shortly
before yesterday's announcement. They last traded at CDollars 47.38 in
Toronto. Northern is 53 per cent owned by BCE.
