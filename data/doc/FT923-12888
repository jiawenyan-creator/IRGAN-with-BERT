FT  16 JUL 92 / Boost to innovation urged by Nedo
BUSINESSES are diverting cash that should be spent on research and
development into dividend payments, according to the National Economic
Development Office, Daniel Green writes.
Nedo argues in a book it publishes today that the UK's poor industrial
performance could be improved through innovation. Almost two thirds of UK
growth between 1913 and 1984 had resulted from innovation, but over 20 years
the UK had fallen from second to fifth place among the six biggest
industrialised countries in terms of the proportion of gross domestic
product spent on R&amp;D.
