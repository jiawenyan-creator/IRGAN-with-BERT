FT  05 SEP 94 / Summer hiatus keeps the pressure off wage rises
Pay pressures remain weak, with the median 2.5 per cent plateau in basic
rises recorded earlier in the year holding steady, according to Industrial
Relations Services, the independent pay analysts.
IRS said the summer months were traditionally quiet for pay negotiations and
it was not surprising that an initial analysis of settlements for the three
months to the end of July showed no movement in the 2.5 per cent median rise
for the June quarter. This was the sixth consecutive month for the figure.
Half of the 95 basic pay awards monitored by IRS between May and July
increased rates by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, but nearly two-thirds
of bargaining groups secured higher settlements than a year ago. Only a
fifth were lower.
But IRS warns there are tentative signs that this prolonged period of
stability may not continue. Pay awards monitored most recently by IRS - with
a number of influential settlements at 3 per cent, including Vauxhall Motors
in the second stage of a two-year deal - pointed to a gradual drift upwards
in basic rises in the autumn.
