Report to Congress



Paragraph (b)(1) of Section 5707 of Title 5, United States Code, requires that the Administrator of General Services,
in consultation with the Comptroller General of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation,
and representatives of Government employee organizations, conduct periodic investigations of the cost of operating
privately owned vehicles (automobiles, airplanes, and motorcycles) to Government employees while on official
travel and report the results to Congress at least once a year. The law further requires that a determination of the
average, actual cost per mile be made based on the results of the investigation. Such figures must be reported to Congress
within 5 working days after the determination has been made.

Pursuant to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5707(b)(1), the General Services Administration (GSA) conducted
an investigation of the calendar year 1994 costs of operating privately owned automobiles, airplanes, and motorcycles
and consulted with representatives of employee organizations, the Comptroller General, the Secretary of Defense,
the Secretary of Transportation on the results. As required, GSA is reporting the results of the investigation and
the cost per mile determination. GSA's cost studies show and I have determined the per-mile operating costs of POV's
to be 30.0 cents for automobiles, 88.5 cents for airplanes, and 24.5 cents for motorcycles. 

I will issue a regulation to increase the current 25-cent rate for automobiles to 30 cents per mile, the current 45-cent
rate for airplanes to 88.5 cents per mile, and the current 20-cent rate for motorcycles to 24.5 cents per mile. 

This report on the cost of operating privately owned vehicles will be published in the 

Federal Register

.
