  [Excerpts] "What would we do with military training camps 
in Greece or any other European country? The existence of such 
camps would only create problems for the host country as well as 
for our relations with that specific country. We have many 
military camps in Kurdistan to train our people and we do not 
need any in Europe." The military pursuits of the National 
Liberation Front of Kurdistan [ERNK] are aimed at upgrading 
(unofficial) diplomatic relations with Europe and a simultaneous 
escalation of military operations in southeastern Turkey and 
northern Iraq, or northwestern Iraq as Kurdish autonomists call 
the region. Gani Yilmaz, the ERNK's official in charge of 
Europe, made it clear during our discussion. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Improvement With the West and Victory </H5>
  Yilmaz said the noticeable improvement of the ERNK's 
relations with the West, the military successes of the Kurds 
against the Turkish Army, and the escalating economic crisis in 
Turkey--the successful PKK [Kurdish Worker's Party] attacks 
against the country's tourism for the second consecutive year 
have contributed to the economic crisis--have forced the Turkish 
Government to react hastily. He said: ``When there is talk 
about supposed victories of the security authorities in 
Kurdistan and military camps in Greece, you must explain it with 
the orgy of propaganda put out by the mass media that is 
directed by the Turkish Government. 
  ``With German support, Turkey is trying to increase its 
nationalist rhetoric against the Kurdish people and Greece, both 
in the country and abroad. At the same time, problems are 
raised with the Muslim minority in Thrace and the Greek minority 
in Albania, especially after the recent visits of Albanian 
officials to Turkey.'' 
<H5>  U.S. and Germany's Load </H5>
  Personally, Yilmaz believes that, although Turkey us 
struggling to get the U.S. "go ahead" to exploit Iraqi oil in 
the pipeline that begins in Iraq and ends in the 
Mediterranean--in order to improve its failing economy--it will 
soon become an unbearable load for its great allies, the United 
States and Germany. 
  ``Turkey will continue to weaken as long as war in Kurdistan 
and the economic crisis continue. The United States and Germany 
will seriously consider if they are in a position to carry this 
weight for long. 
  ``Turkey may have currently lost its role as NATO's southern 
flank, but it will never stop searching for a role in the 
Balkans and Caucasus. I am afraid, however, that deep down the 
United States is searching for causes to intensify the 
Greek-Turkish dispute so that it can play the role of a mediator 
according to its own conditions. 
  You, the Greeks, speak about a Turkish threat and that you 
belong to the European Union [EU] and NATO. So, I wonder, is it 
the EU and NATO or the PKK guerrillas that will put an end to 
this threat?'' 
<H5>  U.S. Must Commit Itself </H5>
  Yilmaz's conclusion is: ``Greece must not be moved by the 
Turkish accusations against it but must play a more dynamic role 
for the resolution of the Kurdish issue through Europe. 
  ``The United States must document what it believes to be 
correct for our people and we are ready to discuss it. If the 
United States wants to propose a solution to this issue, and if 
it really means it, we will accept its conditions.''
