THE Midwest Stock Exchange, the third largest US equities market, and
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications company, have signed an agreement
to co-operate on selling trading, clearance, settlement and back office
systems, writes Barbara Durr in Chicago.
The MSE will market the communications systems to exchanges and brokerages
worldwide and Ericsson will participate by providing hardware, software and

The agreement provides Ericsson with an opportunity to focus further on the
