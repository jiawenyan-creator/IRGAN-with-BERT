 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 1, 1994, the existing rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal will be replaced with the Panama
Canal Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS). Currently, fees for booking transits at the Panama Canal are assessed
at a fixed rate per Panama Canal Gross Ton. Inasmuch as the PC/UMS will no longer utilize a Panama Canal Gross Tonnage
value, fees for the use of the transit booking system should be assessed on some other basis. This final rule authorizes
retention of the existing method of calculating booking fees for vessels subject to PC/UMS transitional relief measures
and the fixing of fees for all other vessels in reference to the PC/UMS Net Ton.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 17, 1994, the President approved a final rule with respect to a related matter_the complete revision of the
Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal as set forth in 35 CFR part 135. That final rule was published in
the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 43254) on August 22, 1994. The new measurement rules become effective October 1, 1994. 


Corresponding changes in the transit booking system regulations are necessary to reconcile 35 CFR 103.8(e)
with the aforementioned revisions to the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal. On August 16, 1994
a proposed rule with a request for comments was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 41997). In addition, the Commission provided individual notice to various shipping associations and agents.
No substantive comments were received which necessitate change in the final rule. 
Under existing 103.8(e), fees for booking transits at Panama Canal are assessed at $0.23 per Panama Canal Gross
Ton. With the replacement of the existing measurement system on October 1, 1994, a Panama Canal Gross Ton value will
no longer exist. Instead, the new PC/UMS will utilize a PC/UMS Net Ton value. Accordingly, in order to continue using
tonnage as the basis for rate assessment for the transit booking system, fees must be assessed on the tonnage value
used in the PC/UMS. Therefore, transit booking fees will be fixed in relation to the PC/UMS Net Ton for vessels transiting
the Canal for the first time after September 30, 1994. The final rule also provides special relief measures for vessels
which have previously transited the Canal. These measures serve to minimize the financial impact of the change on
the individual customer. 
In the first category_vessels which have not transited the Canal before October 1, 1994, the final rule establishes
a new rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton. This rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton is expected to result in a booking fee near
the rate assessed under the existing system. In other words, the amount paid by an individual vessel at $0.26 per PC/UMS
Net Ton will closely approximate the amount it would have paid at $0.23 per Panama Canal Gross Ton. The new booking fee
rate will be applied to a limited number of vessels inasmuch as the number of first-time transits involves a relatively
small number of vessels each year. 
As noted above, the Commission's intention is to revise the rate in a manner which maintains fees at approximately
the same level as currently paid by individual vessels. Inasmuch as the revision is designed to reconcile paragraph
103.8(e) with the new standard tonnage measurement and not to otherwise alter the booking fees, the establishment
of the $0.26 rate will approximate present booking fees without increasing customer costs. 

For the other and larger category_vessels which have previously transited the Canal, the final rule retains the existing
booking fee computation method. This provision has its genesis in the revisions to the Rules for Measurement of Vessels
using the Panama Canal. The PC/UMS contains transitional relief measures which preserve existing tonnage for ships
transiting the Canal between March 23, 1976 (the date of the last significant rules change) and September 30, 1994,
inclusive. The final booking fee rule provides that the existing method for assessing booking fees for these vessels
be similarly retained. Vessels meeting the aforementioned PC/UMS requirements for transitional relief which use
the booking system after September 30, 1994 will not be affected inasmuch as they will continue to pay the same fee_$0.23
per Panama Canal Gross Ton. For these previously-transiting vessels, the booking fee would change only in the event
the vessel undergoes a significant structural change, defined in the PC/UMS as a change in the volume of the vessel
of 10% or more. Under the PC/UMS, a vessel undergoing a significant structural change loses its entitlement to the
relief measures and becomes subject to application of the PC/UMS measurement formulas. In such an instance, the new
rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton will be applied to the vessel. 
The Commission has been exempted from Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, the provisions of that directive do
not apply to this final rule. Even if the order were applicable, the final rule, which concerns ``rates'' and ``practices
relating'' thereto, would not constitute a ``rule'' as that term is defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601(2)) and would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under that Act. 
A review of the environmental effect of the final rule concludes that it will not have a significant effect on the quality
of the human environment. An environmental impact statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969. 
Finally, the Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission certifies that these regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12778.
