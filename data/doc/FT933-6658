FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: BSkyB behind advance at News Intl
A MOVE into profits at BSkyB, the satellite television venture, and a Pounds
45m swing on interest helped to boost pre-tax profits at Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News International from Pounds 48.1m to Pounds 161.2m for the year ended in
June.
Turnover edged ahead by 2 per cent to Pounds 708m, from Pounds 696.2m
previously. However, operating profits for the group - which publishes The
Sun, The Times, The Sunday Times and other UK newspapers - rose to Pounds
140.9m from a previous Pounds 124.9m, a rise of 13 per cent, reflecting an
increase in margins.
The group, a subsidiary of the Australian News Corporation, said that
revenues from circulation and advertising remained relatively flat
throughout the year. But it had continued to benefit from reduced overhead
costs and increased efficiency through plant modernisation.
News International said that the benefit of declining interest rates and the
effect of new financing arrangements had led to net income from interest of
Pounds 1.6m compared with a net interest charge of Pounds 43.4m for the
previous year.
BSkyB, in which News International has a 50 per cent stake, contributed
Pounds 26.7m following a loss of Pounds 13.3m previously. Total losses from
associates in 1991-92 were Pounds 17.3m. Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, also holds a significant stake in the satellite television company
following the merger of Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting in
November 1990.
Analysts estimate that the total trading profit for BSkyB for the full year
was Pounds 60m before interest on its guaranteed loan facility estimated at
between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m. They expect the business, now reaping the
benefits of the merger, to increase trading profits to about Pounds 150m in
the coming year. However, shareholders in BSkyB have yet to earn a return on
their investment.
Profits also benefited from a reduction in losses on sales of fixed assets
from Pounds 16m to Pounds 7.9m.
Earnings per share were 15.27p, up from 3.95p. The pay-out on special
dividend shares is 1.369p, made up of an interim 0.701p and a final of
0.668p. This compares with 0.997p for 1991-92, comprising 0.524p and 0.453p.
