FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Drinks wholesaling helps Boddington rise
50% to Pounds 11m
BODDINGTON, the pubs, hotels and healthcare group, reported a 50 per cent
increase in profits for the half year to June 27 on the back of a strong
performance from drinks wholesaling.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 7.52m to Pounds 11.3m on sales
relating to continued activities of Pounds 111m (Pounds 76.1m).
Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said the result vindicated the strategy of
expanding the drinks wholesaling division.
The group is reviewing its 19.5 per cent stake in JA Devenish, the West
Country-based pub operator for which Boddington last year launched an
unsuccessful bid.
Mr Cassidy said: 'We are constantly reviewing our options, which include
making a bid, helping someone else launch a bid, placing the shares or
keeping our stake.'
He indicated that he might resume hostilities if Devenish's full-year
results disappointed the City. 'I will wait with interest to see what
Devenish announces for the year in December.'
Devenish recently increased interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.09m to
Pounds 4.24m, reflecting the effects of restructuring.
In the period under review Boddington's interest charge of Pounds 4.05m
(Pounds 2.33m) reflected borrowings related to its Devenish stake. Debt
remained static at Pounds 99m, representing gearing of 42.4 per cent.
Drinks wholesaling increased trading profit from Pounds 529,000 to Pounds
3.1m. About half the increase was due to acquisitions made last year.
The group's 460 pubs increased trading profit to Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 8.5m)
from 18 fewer outlets. Mr Cassidy said he wanted to expand the estate.
Hotels and restaurants produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds
878,000) as room occupancies rose by 5 per cent to 65 per cent.
Profits from the healthcare division rose to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1m) due to
increased demand for nursing homes.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 7.3p (5.2p). The interim dividend
is increased from 2.35p to 2.6p.
COMMENT
Boddington's strategy of expanding its drinks wholesaling operations while
diversifying into healthcare has been the subject of much criticism over the
past year. Yesterday's results should go a long way to blunt those
criticisms. Forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.8m, giving earnings
per share of 16p, put the shares - which rose 3p to 168p - on a prospective
multiple of 10.5. This is still at a discount to the sector average of 12.3,
reflecting concern that the group might launch another bid for Devenish.
There are obvious temptations to renew hostilities, not least because
Boddington would like more pubs. Yet the cost of bidding and failing in the
short-term is too great a risk. In spite of the Pounds 1.3m net annual
carrying cost of its Devenish stake, Boddington would do wise to bide its
time.
