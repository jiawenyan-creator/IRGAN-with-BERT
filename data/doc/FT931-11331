FT  03 FEB 93 / Letter: German screen-based trading not limited
Sir, I would like to set the record straight with regard to two claims that
were made in your article, 'Exchanges fight for the future across Europe',
(January 15).
First, it was suggested that, 'because of limitations of technology', DTB's
screen-based system would not be able to offer the same level of liquidity
as that available on Liffe. The fact is that no other exchange has increased
its turnover as rapidly as DTB. As a fully computerised exchange from the
start, DTB has doubled its trading volume every year since it was founded in
January 1990. Within its first year of operation, DTB became the European
market leader in options trading. In other words, DTB already has a very
liquid market, and the level of liquidity is still rising.
Second, it is not true that 'none of the world's largest futures contracts
are screen-based'. DTB's Bobl future is one of the world's highest-volume
interest-rate futures in the medium-term range. It has moved into the number
one position in Europe within one year.
Furthermore, the majority of the trading volume in cash instruments in
Europe is screen-based or telephone-based.
So, regarding our positive experience with advanced screen trading
technology at the DTB and Ibis (electronic trading facility for stocks and
bonds) in Germany and the impressive performance of screen trading elsewhere
in Europe it seems to be the right time to reconsider prejudices about it.
