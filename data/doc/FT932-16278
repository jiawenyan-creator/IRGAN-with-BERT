FT  06 APR 93 / Hoechst steps in over plant accidents
HOECHST said yesterday that its management board was assuming joint
responsibility for plant safety and environmental protection, taking over
the task from Mr Karl Holoubek, the board member who to date has handled it
on his own.
The move follows a string of accidents at the chemical group. This led to
the call by Mr Joshka Fischer, environment minister in the state of Hesse,
for Mr Holoubek to step aside until a thorough investigation of safety
systems could prove that a recent series of accidents at company facilities
were not caused by mismanagement.
The company, which is based in Hesse, said yesterday that the measure would
be in force while the investigation was being carried out. It declined to
say whether Mr Holoubek had been relieved of this task as a result of the
decision.
Hoechst said the investigation would prove that its security systems were of
a high standard. It is reviewing safety measures at its 123 plants.
Last Friday a broken pipe at its main plant near Frankfurt sent several
hundred kilograms of concentrated sulphuric acid into the atmosphere.
The most serious accident, on March 15, killed one worker and left another
seriously injured after an explosion.
