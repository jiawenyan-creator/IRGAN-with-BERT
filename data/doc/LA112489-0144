P. M. BRIEFING; 
PRIMERICA TO BUY BARCLAYS UNIT 
Financial giant Primerica Corp. has agreed to buy the loan portfolio of the 
U.S. consumer-lending unit of Britain's Barclays Bank PLC in a cash deal valued 
at $1.35 billion, both companies announced today. 
Under the agreement, Primerica's lending subsidiary, Commercial Credit Co., 
will buy assets worth $1.30 billion of BarclaysAmerican-Financial, a unit of 
BarclaysAmericanCorporation, which is the U.S. subsidiary of Barclay's. 
The sale price, therefore, represents a $50-million premium over the total 
value of the loan portfolio. 
Barclays said it will retain the equity in the company, which has a book value 
of around $100 million. 
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.
