MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Fans of 1950s Western-movie star Rex Allen in Willcox, Ariz., are readying a 
museum of memorabilia and will show his films in a theater next door to mark 
the actor's 50th anniversary in movies. Allen was born in Willcox on Dec. 31, 
1921. He began as a singer and radio announcer and signed his first contract 
with Republic Pictures in 1949. The museum and theater will be in the Railroad 
Avenue District, which has been entered on the federal Register of Historic 
Places. ALEENE MacMINN
