<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (RCRA), the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) may grant final authorization to States to operate their hazardous waste management programs in lieu
of the Federal program. EPA uses part 272 of title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR part 272) to provide notice
of the authorization status of State programs, and to incorporate by reference those provisions of State statutes
and regulations that EPA will enforce under RCRA section 3008. Thus, EPA intends to codify the Minnesota authorized
State program in 40 CFR part 272. The purpose of this action is to incorporate by reference EPA's approval of recent
revisions to Minnesota's program. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 This document will be effective November 7, 1994, unless EPA publishes a prior 

Federal Register

 (FR) action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on this action must be received by the close of business
October 6, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain Minnesota statutes and regulations was approved by the
Director of the Federal Register as of November 7, 1994, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Effective July 14, 1989 (see 54 FR 20851), May 15, 1990 (see 55 FR 9880), and December 14, 1992 (see 57 FR 47265), EPA incorporated
by reference Minnesota's then authorized hazardous waste program. Effective May 17, 1993 (58 FR 14321), and March
21, 1994 (59 FR 2998), EPA granted authorization to Minnesota for additional program revisions. In this document,
EPA is incorporating the currently authorized State hazardous waste program in Minnesota. 
EPA provides both notice of its approval of State programs in 40 CFR part 272, and incorporates by reference therein
the State statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under section 3008 of RCRA. This effort will provide clearer
notice to the public of the scope of the authorized program in Minnesota. 
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal statutory or regulatory authority is modified.
The incorporation by reference of Minnesota's authorized program in subpart Y of part 272 is intended to enhance the
public's ability to discern the current status of the authorized State program and clarify the extent of Federal enforcement
authority. For a fuller explanation of EPA's incorporation by reference of Minnesota's authorized hazardous waste
program, see 54 FR 20851 (May 15, 1989). 


Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action is intended to incorporate by reference the decision
already made to authorize Minnesota's program and has no separate effect on handlers of hazardous waste in the State
or upon small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Paperwork Reduction Act 


Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq., 

Federal agencies must consider the paperwork burden imposed by any information request contained in a proposed or
final rule. This rule will not impose any information requirements upon the regulated community. 


List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 272
