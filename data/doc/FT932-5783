FT  02 JUN 93 / Observer: Burnside issue
The Burnside call sign is clearly a passport to prominence in aviation
public relations.
No sooner has David, the erstwhile PR director of British Airways, set up
David Burnside Associates, than fellow Ulsterman, Alan, of the confusingly
named Alan Burnside Associates steps in to run PR for the sale of Belfast
Airport. There are not a lot of Burnsides in Northern Ireland, but DB
insists that he's not related to AB. They are not even members of the same
lodge.
