DIGEST: ALVARADO FOLLOWS LOFRANO AS COACH OF SCOUT TEAM 
Manny Alvarado has replaced Bob Lofrano as coach of the Chicago Cubs scout 
team, but the Kennedy High baseball coach said that he has no plans to follow 
Lofrano at Chatsworth High. 
Lofrano resigned his position at Chatsworth this month to become an assistant 
coach and physical education teacher at Pierce College. Alvarado, who led 
Kennedy to the City Section 4-A Division championship in his first year, has no 
teaching assignment at the Granada Hills campus. He teaches physical education 
at Sepulveda Junior High. 
"I'm not considering applying at Chatsworth because I've already developed 
loyalties at Kennedy," he said. "The people at Kennedy have been good to me and 
I'm willing to be patient." 
Patrick Byrne, a recent magna cum laude graduate of Cal Lutheran and captain of 
the Kingsmen track team, has been named an academic All-American. 
Byrne, an at-large, second-team All-American choice, qualified for the 1989 
NAIA championships in the steeplechase. He won the 1988 NAIA District 3 
steeplechase championship and finished third in the same event this year. He 
compiled a 3.77 grade-point average.
