  [Text] Nanning, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region will speed up construction of the Dongxing 
Economic Development Zone, China's only land-and-water 
connection to Southeast Asia. 
  Opened in July 1992, the zone is attracting streams of 
investors from other parts of the country and overseas. 
  It has concluded contracts on 397 projects involving a total 
investment of 3.79 billion yuan so far. Included are 56 
overseas- funded projects with a total contractual investment of 
126 million U.S. dollars. 
  Last year saw the zone's gross domestic product reach 435.93 
million yuan, an increase of 35 percent over 1992. 
  A local official noted that the zone will focus on the 
development of tourism and the processing industry, and strive 
to develop itself into a modern port city with a population of 
300,000 by the year 2010.
