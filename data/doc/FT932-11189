FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy tops performance tables
with 2.82% rise
EUROPE'S higher-yielding government bond markets, led by Italy, topped the
performance tables in April as the Bundesbank cut German interest rates and
paved the way for other European central banks to follow suit.
Italy (up 2.82 per cent), Denmark (up 2.24 per cent) and Sweden (up 2.18 per
cent) were the top-performing government bond markets in local currency
terms last month, according to figures compiled by JP Morgan Securities.
Pressure on the French franc has subsided since the general election. Cuts
in German, French and other European interest rates - reflecting concerns
about the recessionary environment within Europe - have helped to ease
tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The worst-performing market over the month was the UK, which fell 1.36 per
cent as news of a rise in GDP confirmed recent indications of a recovery in
the UK economy.
In the past 12 months, the top-performing markets have been Australia (up
18.06 per cent), the Netherlands (up 17.58 per cent) and France (up 17.13
per cent) in local currency terms. For dollar-based investors, Italy was
still the top-performing market last month with a gain of 9.76 per cent,
followed by Sweden (up 8.08 per cent). However, over the past 12 months,
Japan has provided the highest returns in US dollar terms, with a gain of
34.38 per cent.
