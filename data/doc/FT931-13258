FT  25 JAN 93 / Borrie to head debt advice trust
SIR GORDON Borrie, the former director-general of fair trading, has become
chairman of the Money Advice Trust, which collects donations from banks and
building societies to fund debt counselling at institutions such as citizens
advice bureaux.
Sir Gordon, who succeeds Sir George Blunden, has been appointed in an effort
to raise the level of donations. Although the trust has a target of
attracting donations of Pounds 3m a year, it received only about Pounds
235,000 last year, its second full year of operation.
The trust has had difficulty attracting donations from building societies
because they have wanted to maintain the repayment of mortgage arrears as
the first priority for those in debt.
Sir Gordon said, however, that he believed attitudes among building
societies were changing because they were realising the value of independent
debt counselling.
The trust, which was established after a call from Sir Gordon in 1987 for
the credit industry to contribute to debt counselling, has funded support
services for money advisers and is trying to establish a national telephone
debt counselling service.
Mr Adam Carnegie-Brown, director of the trust, said it was maintaining its
target for private-sector donations in spite of the low level achieved last
year. The trust's annual report and accounts will be published soon.
He added that the trust had attracted an additional Pounds 20,000 of
benefits in kind and it had been encouraged by the number of new donors. He
said it would be wrong to revise the Pounds 3m target downwards because it
would send an inappropriate signal.
