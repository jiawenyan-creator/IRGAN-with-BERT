Summary of Order
I. Introduction




1. On March 8, 1994, the Commission adopted a Second Report and Order in this proceeding (Second Report and Order)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 establishing general rules and procedures governing competitive bidding for radio spectrum (auctions). The Second
Report and Order identified the types of services and licenses that may be subject to auctions, described a menu of
competitive bidding methods, and adopted generic auction procedures. The Commission stated that specific competitive
bidding rules for licensing individual services would be addressed in subsequent Reports and Orders. This Fourth
Report and Order establishes rules and procedures for auctioning licenses in the Interactive Video and Data Service
(IVDS).

Second Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93253, FCC 9461, released April 20, 1994 (Second Report and Order).
On February 3, 1994, we adopted the First Report and Order in this proceeding, which, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 309(i)(4)(C),
prescribed transfer disclosure requirements with respect to licenses or permits awarded by random selection. First
Report and Order in PP Docket No. 93253, FCC 9432 (released February 4, 1994), petitions for reconsideration
pending.

</FOOTNAME>
Concurrent with this Fourth Report and Order, we are adopting a Third Report and Order, FCC 9498, in this docket
addressing the specific competitive bidding rules and procedures for ``narrowband'' Personal Communications
Services (PCS).
</FOOTNOTE>


2. In this Fourth Report and Order, we find that the value of IVDS licenses is not expected to be sufficiently high to
justify the use of simultaneous multiple round bidding. We therefore conclude that the auction methods most appropriate
to the IVDS are oral bidding (open outcry) and single round sealed bidding. We also establish rules and procedures
to deter possible abuses of the bidding and licensing procedures. Last, we establish preferences for small businesses
and businesses owned by minorities or women to enhance their participation in the competitive bidding process and
in the provision of IVDS system offerings.


II. Background and Auction Eligibility




3. The IVDS is a point-to-multipoint, multipoint-to-point, short distance communications service in which licensees
may provide information, products, or services to individual subscribers located at fixed locations in the service
area, and subscribers may provide responses.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The rules governing IVDS were adopted in 1992 in Gen. Docket No. 912.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In that proceeding, the Commission decided to define specific service areas and license IVDS channels in these areas
on an exclusive basis. As so defined, the IVDS has 734 service areas, with two licenses of 500 kilohertz each (218.0218.5
and 218.5219.0 MHz) available in each area.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In the event of mutually exclusive applications
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 for license, the Commission decided in that earlier proceeding to use the lottery processes specified in our rules.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>

Service offerings might include subscriber opportunities to provide real-time responses to educational and pay-per-view
programming, commercial data applications such as home banking, and the downloading of data. See Report and Order
in Gen. Docket No. 912, 7 FCC Rcd 1630, 1630 2, 1637 54 (1992).

See 47 C.F.R. 95.803, 95.853. IVDS service or market areas are defined in terms of the 734 cellular system
service areas. 

See

 Public Notice, Report No. 9240, released January 24, 1992; 47 C.F.R. 22.903 (cellular). Many of these service
areas cover rural or remote, sparsely populated areas.

The Commission, in general, ``considers two or more applications to be `mutually exclusive' if their conflicts are
such that the grant of one application would effectively preclude, by reason of harmful electrical interference,
the grant of one or more of the other applications.'' Second Report and Order at 12 n. 5.

prior to July 26, 1993. See Budget Act,
