FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Peerless chief warns on impact
of Nafta
PEERLESS, one of North America's biggest carpet groups, will probably
manufacture in Mexico if the North American Free Trade Agreement is
approved, and shift its US and Canadian mills to more specialised products,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Industry over-capacity would mean that an upsurge in Mexican production
would take some years to materialise, but 'there is no mistake about the
implications of Nafta,' Mr Bram Garber, chairman, said after the annual
meeting.
In the US, Peerless was gaining market share and conditions were improving
slightly, he said. But in Canada, the market continues to be soft and
Peerless is rationalising its distribution system.
Peerless will reduce losses in the current quarter ending August 31, and
return to profitability in the third quarter, Mr Garber added.
In fiscal 1993, it lost CDollars 5.2m (USDollars 4m) on sales of CDollars
480m.
