U.S. TO STAY OUT OF ISRAELI COALITION DISPUTE 
Washington will not pressure the Israeli Labor Party to remain in its fragile 
coalition government with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir despite an internal 
dispute over elections in the occupied territories, a U.S. official said 
Wednesday. 
"No, that is something that the parties in Israel have to decide for 
themselves," John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, told 
a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee. 
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres this week urged the party to withdraw from the 
coalition government with Shamir's Likud Party because of its new, hard-line 
conditions for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
The New York Times and the Washington Post reported Wednesday that Washington 
is urging Labor to remain in the coalition. At the State Department, spokesman 
Richard Boucher called the reports "patently absurd."
