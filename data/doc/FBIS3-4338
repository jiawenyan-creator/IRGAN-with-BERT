  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 (CNA) -- Kuomintang 
Secretary-General Hsu Shui-the on Thursday [24 March] asked 
several Japanese political leaders to help create an environment 
that will enable President Li Teng-hui to attend the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum leadership 
conference in November in Indonesia. 
  Hsu expressed the wish when he called on Yoshiro Mori, the 
secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]; Keizo 
Obuchi, a former LDP secretary-general, and Takeo Fukuda, a 
former prime minister. 
  He said that if Li could attend the Indonesian APEC meeting, 
then there would be no big obstacles in the way of his attending 
the 1995 APEC leadership conference in Japan.
