<F P=106> [Statement by FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic on </F>
NATO air strikes on Gorazde for "Radio and Television of 
Serbia"; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Apart from representing an act of aggression and 
the siding with one side in the civil war, the latest air 
strikes also represent a new form of direct, unprovoked, and 
provocative pressure not only on the Serbian side in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also on the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. Together with other forms of pressure that we have 
so far had an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with and to 
feel, this is the biggest and most dangerous straw that 
threatens to break the camel's back. Therefore, those people 
who decided on this kind of military adventure are at the same 
time the side that takes on itself the responsibility for all 
possible consequences, as well as the entire development that 
nobody can say can be completely controlled. In that respect, 
NATO, as well as the United Nations, has simply abandoned the 
impartial role that the situation assigned to them and sided 
with one of the parties to the civil war, that is, with the 
Muslim side. This very much discredits the United Nations and 
the other foreign factors that got deeply involved in such 
military action and called into question their impartiality and 
their ability to continue to carry out peace efforts. The very 
act of aggression on the Serbian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
in itself certainly a great enough provocation for the prospects 
of peace and for us who live on this side of the Drina [River]. 
On the other hand, launching military operations with air power 
in close proximity to our borders always carries the great risk 
of deliberate or accidental mistakes, something that makes the 
entire situation very complex and can lead to uncontrolled 
negative development in the whole region. 
  As regards our resoluteness to defend our own country with 
all means against any foreign enemy and danger, that should not 
be questioned. This would be poor advice to all other factors 
if they took this in a facile way and underestimated our 
resoluteness to defend ourselves.
