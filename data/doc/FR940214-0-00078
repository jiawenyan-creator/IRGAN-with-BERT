<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule amends Standard No. 121, Air Brake Systems, with respect to the requirements related to the application
and holding of parking brake systems and the requirements related to the supply line pressure retention for trailer
brakes. NHTSA initiated rulemaking to respond to concerns raised by International Transquip Industries (ITI) which
manufactures air-applied, mechanically held parking brakes. These amendments provide regulatory relief by removing
unnecessary restrictions to facilitate the use of alternative brake systems, without adversely affecting safety.
