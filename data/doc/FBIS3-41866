  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- A spokesman for Iran's 
Atomic Energy Organization dismissed as sheer lies an American 
daily report alleging that Iran is after production of nuclear 
weapons and said the hostile move was part of a preplanned U.S. 
plot against the Islamic World. 
  Speakign to IRNA Wednesday, 'Ali Shirzadian strongly denied 
the 'U.S. Today' [as recieved] report on Iran's nuclear 
activities and said Iran is one of the active members of the 
Internaional Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and is faithful to its 
commitments as a signatory to the treaty. 
  He noted that Iran's Atomic Energy Organization was 
committed 
to the principle of nuclear inspection adding that it had a 
clear policy and its activities had been for peaceful purposes. 
  The spokesman further said that due to the Islamic 
republic's 
commitment to the rules, the U.S. hostile propaganda against 
Iran's atomic activities had not least affected the IAEA 
decisions so far. 
  He said that the organization's report to the council of 
governors on Iran's clear atomic policies last fall was a firm 
response to U.S. allegations against the Islamic republic. 
  The IAEA secretary-genaral had said in his report that all 
the sites, buildings and laboratories inspected in Iran were 
devoid of any non-peaceful nuclear activities.
