  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- During 1994 five per cent 
of Albanian territory will be under the protection of the 
government. According to Ilir Vesho, expert at the Environmental 
Protection Committee, the areas to be put under the protection 
of the state will include national parks, natural monuments, and 
others. 
  All lagoons will be declared fourth category under the 
classification of World Fund for Environmental Protection. 
Meanwhile the goal of the environmental committee during 1994 is 
to increase national parks and hunting reservations. The area 
under protection will increase from some 15 thousand hectares to 
150 thousand hectares. 
  Projects have been drafted in cooperation with international 
organizations for an effective exploitation of these areas in 
order to ensure foreign currency for population.
