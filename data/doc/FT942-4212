FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: WMC quits Australian nickel
project
Western Mining Corporation, the large Melbourne-based mining group, said
yesterday that it was withdrawing from the Bulong Nickel Project in Western
Australia.
As a result, Resolute Resources, the smaller Perth-based miner which
previously had a 30 per cent interest in the project, will take a 100 per
cent ownership interest and management control.
Resolute said it was anxious 'to take full advantage of the expected upturn
in nickel prices'.
The project was established more than three years ago, to investigate the
viability a significant low-grade laterite nickel deposit, about 30km east
of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.
In statement yesterday, WMC said that studies had suggested that it would be
more attractive to use a sulphur burning acid plant to process the deposits,
rather than to use sulphur dioxide off-gases from the WMC's nickel smelter
at Kalgoorlie.
