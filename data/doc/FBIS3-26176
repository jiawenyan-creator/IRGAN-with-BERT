  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government welcomes the decision of the United States to lift 
the trade embargo on Vietnam since the improvement of 
U.S.-Vietnamese ties will benefit the stability and prosperity 
of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said this at a 
weekly press conference here this afternoon while commenting on 
recent reports that the United States will lift the embargo very 
soon. 
  The embargo was imposed about two decades ago. 
  Wu also said that Sino-Vietnamese relations in various 
fields 
are developing smoothly.
