FT  25 JUN 94 / How to spend it: Garden furniture that grows on you - Where
to look for outdoor accessories that will keep you at the forefront of
fashion
Fashions in furnishing the garden are fortunately not subject to quite the
same hectic time-scales as fashions in frocks. This is not to say that the
horticultural set does not have its serious snobbisms or that the likelihood
of committing some hideous faux-pas is not just as great but at least the
trends have a long enough cycle for everyone to have a chance of catching up
with them.
For some time, tastes in garden furniture have tended towards the simple,
the muted, the sturdy, the indubitably English. Bright continental parasols,
plastic - shaped to look like wrought-iron - and florally decorated
swing-seats can still be tracked down (if you must) but are deeply out of
favour.
Classic designs on the lines of Lutyens are the chief inspirational sources
for garden furniture designers today and one can see why - in the muted grey
of a typical English summer day they fulfil the practical function, add an
air of calm tranquillity to the scene and never, ever jar.
When it comes to the conservatory, then a touch of Eastern rattan could fit
the bill - decorative enough to conjure up visions of Raffles and tropical
verdancy and sturdy enough to serve the practical purpose.
For those with gardens or patios still in need of a little furnishing here
are a few designs currently on offer.
