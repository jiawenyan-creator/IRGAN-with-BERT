SMALL FIRMS GET HELP IN SELLING GOODS ABROAD 
After years of peddling soft drinks, laundry detergent and other consumer goods 
for major corporations, Bob Wallace decided two years ago to take his 
experience and strike out on his own. 
Armed with a few thousand dollars and years of marketing savvy, the former Los 
Angeles marketing manager for Pepsico Inc. and Lever Bros. started an export 
management company to help others do what he does best: sell in the 
international market. 
His goal is simple: "I'm giving the little Davids of this world a shot at the 
world market," Wallace said. "I'm the scout sent out to reconnoiter for the 
advancing troops." 
Wallace, marketing director of Exports International Co. in Santa Ana, is among 
a growing pool of former international marketing managers who have left large 
corporations to work as export consultants for small and medium-size companies. 
"Most export managers have previous corporate experience and have an 
entrepreneurial spirit," said Edward Chavez, president of Anaheim Marketing 
International, an export management firm in Anaheim. "And export management is 
one area that allows them to use this entrepreneurial characteristic to exploit 
their marketing abilities and knowledge of the international market." 
Demand for export assistance has increased as more small and medium-size 
companies -- many with no prior experience in foreign markets -- try to peddle 
their wares abroad, said Martin Magdaleno, president of Sel Pro International, 
an Anaheim export management firm. Also, many companies can't afford to hire a 
full-time international marketing manager, he said. 
"A lot of times, the local manufacturers have a great product but they don't 
export because they don't want to be bothered with the extra paper work and 
bureaucracy," said Magdaleno, a former manager of Beckman Instruments 
international division. 
Moreover, many U.S. companies are reluctant to take the time and effort to 
understand a foreign nation's culture and trade practices -- often a key to 
success abroad. And companies that are doing brisk business in the U.S. market 
are sometimes reluctant to spend money on a possibly risky overseas marketing 
program, said Patrick Killeen, marketing vice president for PEC International 
Trading Co. in San Marcos.
