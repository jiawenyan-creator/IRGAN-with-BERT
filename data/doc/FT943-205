FT  30 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Keying in to both text and
pictures
Electronic databases can usually retrieve either pictures or text but not
both. Although scanned representations of pages can be stored by databases,
they cannot be manipulated.
Cascade Systems, an Ipswich-based software company, has overcome this
problem in an electronic library system that allows users to work with whole
pages of text and pictures which are presented in the same layout with which
they were published.
The Cascade system also allows users to extract information from the
database using a request couched in ordinary language, rather than by
requesting specific keywords. It depends on a probabilistic search
mechanism, which works by weighting each word in the request according to
its frequency in the database.
