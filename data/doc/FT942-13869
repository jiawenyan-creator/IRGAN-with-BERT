FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Nedlloyd expects profit this
year
Nedlloyd, the Dutch-based shipping and road haulage group, said it expects
to post a profit this year for the first time since 1991, helped by a
further recovery in results at its ocean-shipping line.
Ocean-shipping recovered strongly last year, enabling the group to
compensate for losses in European road haulage.
Net losses in 1993 nearly doubled to Fl 12m (Dollars 59m) from Fl 58m in
1992. However, if non-recurring items such as restructuring costs and
extraordinary gains are excluded, the underlying trend shows a narrowing of
group losses to Fl 50m from Fl 73m the year before.
'The turnaround is well under way,' Mr Leo Berndsen, chairman, said.
