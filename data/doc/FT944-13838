FT  26 OCT 94 / Role of Scottish secretary queried

A report by the Scottish constitutional commission says that if a Scottish
parliament were established, executive responsibility for the Scottish
Office would pass to it from the Scottish secretary.
Labour is pledged to establish a Scottish parliament in its first
parliamentary session.
