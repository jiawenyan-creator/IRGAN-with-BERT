FT  17 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Yeltsin issues decrees on trade
MR BORIS Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday issued a series of
decrees on trade and the exchange rates aimed at strengthening the rouble
and providing a firmer basis for privatisation.
The decrees include a reintroduction of tariffs on imports to Russia - all
tariffs were lifted earlier this year to encourage imports because of the
shortage of food and other goods.
Mr Yeltsin's decrees, due to come into force from July 1, are also designed
to underscore Russia's commitment to economic reform as it negotiates access
to loans from the International Monetary Fund.
Aside from the tariffs decree, Mr Yeltsin is also seeking to tighten up
Russia's exports regime. Other decrees include:
Unifying the various exchange rates of the rouble into one floating rate,
that set by the Central Bank, presently standing at Rbs85 to the dollar.
Allowing exporters to pay export tax in roubles rather than in European
Currency Units (ECUs).
Forcing exporters to exchange half of the hard currency earned rather than,
as at present, 40 per cent - but at the floating rate rather than at Rbs55
to the dollar at present.
