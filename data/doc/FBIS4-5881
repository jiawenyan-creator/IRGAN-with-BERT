  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), the largest component in the governing coalition, 
will demand setting approval from all the coalition parties if a 
new party will take part in the eight-month-old coalition, SDP 
officials said Friday [15 April]. 
  At a hastily set meeting of the Central Executive Committee, 
the party's leadership body, the SDP decided to ask other 
coalition partners to attach the condition to participation of a 
new party, the officials said. 
  The SDP's move is apparently intended to block a group led 
by 
Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from 
joining the coalition. 
  Watanabe, who served as deputy prime minister and 
concurrently foreign minister under then Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa of the LDP, which fell from power last August following 
failure to seize a majority in last July's general election for 
the House of Representatives. 
  Watanabe is widely reported set to leave the LDP and form a 
new party in an attempt to pursue ambitions to succeed outgoing 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation 
on April 8. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is head of the 
coalition's 
core party Shinseito, is currently considered the most likely 
replacement to Hosokawa.
