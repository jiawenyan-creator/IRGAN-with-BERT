FT  11 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Irish Peace process may be
delayed
The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation proposed by the government of the
Irish Republic may be delayed until early next month, straining Dublin's
attempts to bring Sinn Fein into the peace process.
The republic is keen to use the cross-party forum to bring Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing, into the democratic process as soon as possible to
bolster moderates in the movement.
Underpinning Dublin's calculations is concern that republican hardliners
could abandon the peace process. Mr Mitchel McClaughlin, Sinn Fein's
northern chairman, told former republican prisoners in Londonderry at the
weekend that the conflict would be resumed if political negotiations broke
down.
