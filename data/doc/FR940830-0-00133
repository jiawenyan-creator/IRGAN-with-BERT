SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending 771.18 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
to restrict exports to Cuba under General License GIFT to food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and
devices, hospital supplies and equipment, equipment for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary
medicines and supplies, fishing equipment and supplies, soap-making equipment, certain radio equipment, and batteries
for such equipment. 
Commodities not eligible for export to Cuba under General License GIFT must be authorized either under the Humanitarian
License Procedure (773.5) or under an individual validated license. 
This action does not affect the continued general license eligibility of informational materials, as described
in General License GTDA (779.3) and Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 0A98I in the Commodity Control
List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to 799.1). 
Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and
the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994. 


Savings Clause 


Shipments of items removed from general license GIFT authorization as a result of this regulatory action may be exported
under the previous general license provisions up to and including September 13, 1994. Any such items 
not actually exported before midnight September 13, 1994, require a validated export license in accordance with
this regulation.
