FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Allied Radio restructure and rights
Allied Radio, the lossmaking broadcaster to Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire,
yesterday announced plans to reconstruct its share and loan capital and make
a rights issue.
The shares were suspended at 10 1/2 p. The company said detailed proposals
would be contained in a circular expected to be sent to shareholders in the
next few days, together with the accounts for the year ending September 30.
Last July, when reporting a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.17m on turnover of
Pounds 2.25m, the company said it was considering a reconstruction of the
balance sheet, including the conversion of loan stock and the elimin-ation
of the negative balance on the profit and loss account.
At present the company is capitalised at Pounds 9.6m, including Pounds 4.75m
worth of convertible unsecured loan stock. Interest on the loan stock due at
March 31 will not be paid, but will be taken into account in the
reconstruction.
The company said 'a significant number' of institutional shareholders and
stock holders had indicated support for its proposals.
