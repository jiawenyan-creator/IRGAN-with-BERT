HELPLESS: Beth and Dick Lundin of Newport Beach were having cocktails in the 
lobby of San Francisco's Hyatt Regency when the quake struck. "It just kept 
going," Dick Lundin said. "You thought it was going to stop, then it got 
worse." Not until 10 p.m. could guests re-enter the hotel, but they slept that 
night on the floor of the Grand Ballroom, using tablecloths as blankets. . . . 
"You are so helpless," Beth Lundin said. "It was the scariest thing in my 
life."
