WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU; 
COMMITTEE ON HIGH SCHOOL 
Officials of the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District are expected to 
appoint a 25-member committee to explore the possibility of establishing a high 
school in Malibu, a district spokeswoman said. 
Spokeswoman Karen Garot said the board of education received 47 applications 
from Malibu residents who are interested in serving on the committee. A
