FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television
The young people in BBC2's documentary series Doctors To Be are seen in
today's programme saddled with responsibilities and obliged to deal with
other people's pain. Nick, 21, finds himself delivering the first baby of a
woman who is about his own age. He and Sarah witness a series of late
abortions which cause them to re-examine their own feelings. Mark has to
deal with an angry patient, and Sarah and Jane confront their fears about
dealing with the dying (8.00).
That is followed (8.50) by Vintners' Tales in which Jancis Robinson meets
Bill Baker, described as Britain's biggest wine merchant. C4's current
affairs series Cutting Edge (9.00) takes a look at 'everyday life' around
the corridors of the House of Lords. It seems that there are 777 hereditary
peers out of a total of 1,200, and 413 are old Etonians. Standing Orders
were written down in 1621. If a minister writes to you on blue paper you can
quote it, but if not you can't. There are 77 women in the House. It all
sounds desperately British.
In Panorama (9.30 BBC1) Tom Mangold reports that the first signs of the long
expected 'crack' epidemic have now surfaced in Britain.
