FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Saison takes full control of
hotels chain
SAISON, the Japanese retail and consumer credit group, yesterday confirmed
plans to make the Inter-Continental Hotels chain a wholly-owned subsidiary
by acquiring the 40 per cent held by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS).
The cash-strapped airline, which bought the stake for Dollars 500m two years
ago, was chosen as a partner for Seiyu, a Saison company, in the hope of
broadening the international appeal of the chain and to help finance the
cost of a refurbishment programme.
Inter-Continental, which Saison acquired for Dollars 2.15bn, has reported
operating profits for the last three years but financing costs have pushed
it into the red.
The hotel chain said that there will not be a sell-off of the group's
assets.
