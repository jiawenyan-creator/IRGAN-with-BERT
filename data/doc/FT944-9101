FT  17 NOV 94 / Syrian executions concern Amnesty
Amnesty International expressed concern yesterday about an apparent increase
in the number of executions in Syria and a lack of fair trials in
death-penalty cases, AP reports. The group reiterated its longstanding
concern about the cases of thousands of political prisoners in Syria. The
statement came after the first visit to Syria by a team from the
London-based international human rights group for talks with high-level
officials.
Amnesty described as 'positive' Mr Assad's release of thousands of political
prisoners since 1991, but said there had been little progress made in
reviewing the cases of others, some of whom have been jailed for more than
two decades.
Amnesty said that during its visit, the delegation raised the cases of more
than 1,000 people, including prisoners detained without trial, those held
even after expiration of their sentence, torture allegations and cases of
people who simply 'disappeared'.
The number of political prisoners in Syria runs in the thousands, Amnesty
says, conceding that an exact figure is impossible to obtain under current
circumstances. Some of the longest-standing political prisoners in Syria are
senior politicians jailed after Mr Assad's bloodless coup in 1970.
