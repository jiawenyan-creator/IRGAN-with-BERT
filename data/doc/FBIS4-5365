  [Text] It was learned that North Korea has greatly 
strengthened security at the North Korean-China border. It was 
learned that North Korea took this action because the number of 
North Korean residents fleeing the hardships of life is 
increasing and because influence from the capitalist ideology is 
penetrating through the border. 
  It was learned that the order to strengthen security in this 
region was made by Kim Chong-il. Kim Chong-il has ordered 
strengthening of security on the border over four times since 
1989, when the East European communist bloc countries collapsed, 
to 1993.
