METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARK'S PLANS FOR FIREWORKS DOUSED 
County fire prevention officials have doused plans for weekly fireworks shows 
at Raging Waters. Operators of the San Dimas aquatic theme park had hoped to 
present the shows every Saturday night through Labor Day. 
But Assistant Fire Chief Ron Jones said the dry brush and expensive homes 
surrounding Raging Waters make it unfit for fireworks displays. 
Officials granted the park a fireworks permit for the Fourth of July 4 and sent 
a crew of fire prevention officers to monitor the show. Fire officers 
eliminated high-altitude skyrockets and pyrotechnic experts shot the fireworks 
away from the dry brush. Still, embers from the fireworks were found smoldering 
in chaparral. 
"We're lucky we didn't have a fire on the Fourth of July," Jones said. "It just 
doesn't show good judgment to shoot fireworks off into dry brush. . . . The 
people who live in that particular area were not too happy at the idea of 
fireworks."
