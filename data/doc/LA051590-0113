BRIEFLY 
Ruling Could Hamper Maxxam Refinancing: A Humboldt Superior Court judge has 
ruled that any prospective buyer from or lender to Maxxam Inc.'s Pacific Lumber 
forest products unit must be told that a pending lawsuit could award Pacific 
Lumber's estimated $2.5 billion in timberland to the filer of the suit, Robert 
Martel of Redway, Calif. The ruling denied a motion by Maxxam to remove from 
the suit a lis pendens, or notice of pending action. The presence of such a 
notice makes it more difficult for Maxxam to sell or refinance its subsidiary.
