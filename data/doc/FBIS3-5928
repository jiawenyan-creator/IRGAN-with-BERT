  [Text] Terusuke Terada, press secretary for the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, in a news conference on 11 March commented 
on the 22.4 percent increase in defense spending envisioned in 
China's 1994 budget draft, and said, "The growth rate, no doubt, 
is large, but we have to take factors like inflation into 
account. An analysis would be necessary." The guideline on 
Japan's Official Development Assistance (ODA) programs requires 
the government to consider in deciding on aid to countries 
whether the recipients' defense outlays are conspicuously large 
or not. Terada in his remark meant to say that the scale of the 
defense budget should not immediately become the reason for a 
review of Japan's ODA programs for China.
