FT  08 DEC 92 / Venture capital industry shrinks
THE VENTURE capital industry is contracting more quickly than previously
expected across a broad range of activities, according to a survey by Levy
Gee, the accountants.
The list of organisations that have ceased to make new investments includes
foreign and UK banks, council-backed funds, technology investors and seed
capital organisations.
Many companies that have pulled out are small, but several large venture
funding providers have ceased to appear in the end-September update of Levy
Gee's UK venture capital database.
Venture capitalists say the industry's contraction has gone further than
they expected at the start of the recession. They expect further withdrawals
in the next few years.
Many funds that failed to perform well during the 1980s have found it
difficult to raise more money as the investment climate has become more
difficult during the recession.
The database lists 19 providers of venture and development capital that are
no longer active, while eight new funds have been set up. The total value of
funds under management by venture companies no longer listed is more than
Pounds 275m.
The foreign-bank-affiliated funds no longer listed as active investors are
Creditanstalt Development Capital and Saudi International Bank.
