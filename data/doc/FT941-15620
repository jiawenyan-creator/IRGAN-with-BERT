FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese warning on fibre imports
Japan's synthetic fibre association may demand emergency import
restrictions, its chairman warned yesterday, writes Paul Abrahams in Tokyo.
Mr Reiichi Yumikura, who is also president of Asahi Chemical, a large fibre
manufacturer, said the association was considering restrictions because
imports of polyester were damaging domestic industry. Japan's fibres and
textiles industry has been badly hit by recession and low-cost competitors
in east and south-east Asia.
