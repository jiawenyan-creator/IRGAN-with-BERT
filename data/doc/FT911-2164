FT  01 MAY 91 / Chinese works boost ailing art market: Saleroom
IF THE art market was looking for signs of a revival it found them in Hong
Kong yesterday when the first session of Sotheby's auction of Chinese works
of art totalled HKDollars 56m (Pounds 4.3m), with only 4 per cent unsold.
The estimates had been kept low to encourage bidding and all 10 most
expensive lots found Hong Kong and Taiwanese buyers.
Mr TT Tsui, the Hong Kong businessman, twice paid Pounds 588,811: once for a
Yuan Dynasty blue and white dish of the 14th century with a Persian/Arabic
inscription, and once for a early Ming blue and white ewer.
At Christie's in London a sale of orders and decorations achieved Pounds
270,000, with just 3 per cent unsold. Top price was the Pounds 29,700 paid
by Spink, the London dealer, for the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle which
Kaiser Wilhelm II awarded to Sultan Abbas II of Turkey in 1914. It was part
of the German campaign to turn the Ottoman Empire against the Allies.
The price of fame was illustrated in the Pounds 6,820 paid by a private
Scottish collector for the Order of Merit awarded in 1977 to Sir Frederick
Ashton, founder and principal choreographer of the Royal Ballet, who died in
1988. The OM is a rarely awarded British civilian honour and the gold medal
seldom appears at auction.
