FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Public offer for Renault 'set to
be oversubscribed'
The public offer for shares in Renault, which closes tonight, is set to be
oversubscribed, Mr Alphandery, the French economy minister, said yesterday.
The first estimates of demand from private investors, which are being
allotted the majority of the shares on offer in the partial privatisation of
the motor group, had been encouraging, he said.
However, the minister indicated that the level of subscriptions could be
less than in previous privatisations. He said that the partial nature of the
operation, which will leave the French government with just over 50 per cent
of Renault's shares, and depressed stock market conditions, could limit the
number of applications from private individuals.
'I am confident about the operation,' he said, adding that it was too soon
to give a precise figure for the level of subscriptions.
Final figures for applications in the public offer will be announced next
Wednesday.
Previous issues in the government's programme of privatising 21
publicly-owned groups, have drawn strong demand from private investors. Elf
Aquitaine, the oil group, attracted 3m investors when it was privatised
earlier this year, while Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals
company, drew 2.9m investors when it was sold at the end of 1993.
Institutional investors have also shown strong demand for the privatisation
issues. In the case of Renault, the shares allocated to institutions have
been subscribed more than 15 times.
At FFr165 a share, the motor group is valued at just under FFr40bn (Dollars
7.81bn), lower than the FFr45bn to FFr50bn valuations given by some motor
industry analysts.
Including the receipts from Renault, the sale of public sector assets had
already netted the government about FFr103bn, he said.
