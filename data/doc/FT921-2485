FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: US groups in German move
TWO US electronics companies are to revive the heart of east Germany's
electronics industry which Siemens, the German electronics group, regarded
as being beyond saving.
Both companies are getting their stakes without payment, but will later
transfer know-how and technology.
LSI Logic of California agreed with the Treuhand privatisation agency to
take a 19.8 per cent share in Mikroelektronik of Erfurt, with the remaining
stake going to the Thuringian Landesbank, which has yet to be formed. The
Treuhand agreed to invest DM125m (Dollars 76.2m) in the new company to cover
expected losses and modernisation.
It will also provide the site for a factory to produce Asics integrated
circuits.
VLSI Technology, another California company, will take a 19.8 per cent share
in Mikroelektronik Dresden. An unnamed private bank is to hold 49 per cent,
and an investor, still to be found by the state of Saxony, will get the
remainder.
The Treuhand said it would give the new company DM125m for R&amp;D and
production of integrated circuits. The Dresden company expects sales this
year of DM22m to rise to DM91m by 1994.
The east German electronics industry, developed at enormous cost by the
Communists to produce obsolescent chips and computers, was considered the
most difficult industry to save. Employing 22,000 people in 1989, it is down
to fewer than 4,000 employees. The Treuhand said more than 1,500 jobs were
to be retained under the new plan, approved on Tuesday by the managing
board.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, a Treuhand spokesman, admitted the new electronics
ventures were a very 'shaky affair.
He said the Treuhand agreed to set up the joint ventures as a result of
'political pressure' from the state governments where the electronics
companies were located. The states had previously refused to invest money in
the Treuhand's MTG electronics holding company, which had losses last year
of DM327m on sales of DM78m.
