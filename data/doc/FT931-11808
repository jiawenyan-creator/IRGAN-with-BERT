FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Stonehill furniture
The future of Stonehill Holdings' furniture division is in the balance
because of the weak market.
The company said its future would be reviewed at the year end but
significant activity was unlikely in the foreseeable future. It was not
prepared to risk additional working capital.
Stonehill also reported a reduction in group pre-tax losses from Pounds
290,000 to Pounds 170,000 in the six months to September 30 helped by an
improvement in its property activities. Turnover was again Pounds 1.09m.
Losses per share were 0.91p (1.58p).
The shares have been suspended since January 5.
