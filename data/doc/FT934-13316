FT  22 OCT 93 / Red army called back
RED public telephone boxes were making a comeback in central London
yesterday as part of an initiative by Westminster council. British
Telecommunications is installing 62 of the 'K6' red public telephone boxes
as Westminster aims to brighten up the borough in preparation for the new
century.
BT aroused a storm of protest when it removed most of the old-style boxes in
the 1980s. The boxes, designed in the 1930s by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott,
architect of Liverpool Cathedral and Battersea Power Station, are appearing
on a route from Westminster Abbey to St Paul's Cathedral, via the Houses of
Parliament, Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, the Strand, the Royal Courts of
Justice, Fleet Street and Somerset House.
Conservationists are delighted that 25 of the old boxes are replacing modern
kiosks. But as part of the deal between BT and Westminster BT will be able
to put up more modern boxes too.
BT said all requests for K6 red boxes are considered 'on individual merit'
in areas of significant historical interest.
