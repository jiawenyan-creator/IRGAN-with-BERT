FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo edges up
The Enterprise Oil/Lasmo bid battle entered another crucial phase, with
Lasmo shares creeping higher and those of Enterprise slipping back as the
market responded to intense speculation in the weekend press that Enterprise
will sweeten the terms of its bid by the end of the week.
Under UK Takeover Panel rules, Enterprise has until the end of this week to
come up with a revised offer.
One oil sector specialist said no counter to the Enterprise bid was likely
to emerge until Enterprise had made a final bid. 'And it is by no means
clear that another potential bidder is sniffing around, despite the heavy
activity in the market late last week,' the analyst added.
Enterprise shares fell 11 to 399p while Lasmo moved up 5 1/2 to 147 1/2 p.
Turnover in Lasmo was 4.7m shares.
