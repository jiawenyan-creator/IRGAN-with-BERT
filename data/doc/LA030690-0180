NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
REDGRAVES TO STAGE 'SISTERS' 
The theatrical Redgraves are planning an on-stage family get-together in 
Chekhov's "Three Sisters," with Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave joining Vanessa's 
daughter, Joely Richardson, in the title roles. 
The two sisters, Vanessa and Lynn, have never performed together publicly, 
Thelma Holt, the play's producer, said today. 
Richardson, 24, appeared in the film "Wetherby" with her mother. Lynn, who 
turns 47 on Thursday, has been living in Los Angeles for many years and has not 
worked on the British stage since 1973. 
"I always felt that to justify spending so long away it would have to be 
something very special for me to return," said Lynn, who received an Academy 
Award nomination for her role in the 1966 film "Georgy Girl." 
Vanessa, 53, received an Oscar for the 1977 film "Julia."
