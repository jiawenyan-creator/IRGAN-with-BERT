AIRLINES PICKED FOR NEW ROUTES TO JAPAN 
An administrative law judge recommended Thursday that five U.S. airlines be 
awarded direct routes to Japan from six U.S. cities. 
The judge picked United, Delta, American, Continental and America West airlines 
to fly the new routes in what is already a $6-billion annual aviation market 
for the two countries. 
Cities getting new flights would be Chicago; Los Angeles; San Jose; Portland, 
Ore.; Seattle, and Honolulu. 
The complex, 90-page recommendation followed applications by a dozen carriers 
to serve various U.S.-Japan routes under a new international air agreement. 
Transportation Department officials are expected to make a final decision on 
the carriers and routes in November. 
Judge John J. Mathias selected United Air Lines for Chicago-Tokyo and proposed 
that two routes be awarded to Delta Air Lines: Los Angeles-Tokyo and 
Portland-Nagoya. Other carriers and routes he recommended were American 
Airlines for San Jose-Tokyo, Continental Airlines for Seattle-Nagoya, and 
America West Airlines for Honolulu-Nagoya. 
If approved, it would be the first Japanese route for America West. 
The airlines that sought routes but got none were Hawaiian, Northwest, Pan 
American and Trans World. Mathias also rejected applications that would have 
added direct flights between Japan and St. Louis, Houston and the Hawaiian 
island of Maui. 
Mathias said his recommendations followed department guidelines for awarding 
the routes and would enhance competition among airlines and cities to be 
served.
