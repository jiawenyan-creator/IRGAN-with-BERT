  [Text] Before a more in-depth look at the news of the day, 
let us listen to the information that we have just obtained from 
our fax machine, which says: 
  As the B-H PRESS news agency has learned, an agreement on a 
one-day cease-fire has been reached with the enemy side this 
afternoon. [Words indistinct] cease-fire comes in force at 1800 
today and refers to the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The aim of this cease-fire is to create, with the mediation of 
UN Protection Force, the conditions for talks and 
intensification of the peace [word indistinct].
