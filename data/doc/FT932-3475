FT  14 JUN 93 / Economist succeeds Demirel as premier
MRS TANSU Ciller, a 47-year-old academic economist, will be sworn in today
as Turkey's new prime minister. She becomes the first woman to lead the
predominantly Moslem country and one party delegate said: 'She is the only
candidate who can represent Turkey in a European context.'
Having resigned as economics minister last week to contest the leadership of
the conservative True Path party (DYP), Mrs Ciller emerged unchallenged on
the second ballot of 1,169 DYP delegates. She had fallen just short of an
absolute majority against two other contenders in the first round. Mr Ismet
Sezgin, interior minister, and Mr Koksal Toptan, education minister, then
withdrew.
The new premier succeeds Mr Suleyman Demirel, whose accession to the
presidency last month created yesterday's leadership contest. With the death
in April of then President Turgut Ozal, and Mr Demirel as president, Mrs
Ciller's election marks a watershed in Turkish politics.
Her emergence is unlikely to signal a great shift in Turkey's traditional
pro-western foreign policy, although she is expected to accelerate economic
reforms.
A wealthy Istanbul economics professor, Mrs Ciller is seen as the party's
best hope to restore its tired image ahead of the vital municipal elections
next year and the general election which must be held before 1996.
She told delegates that they were 'writing the first words on a sheet of new
white paper'. A relative unknown in DYP ranks, who entered parliament only
at the last election, she owes her rise to Mr Demirel, who picked her as an
economic adviser. However, the president will need to counter a public
impression that he opposed her candidacy.
