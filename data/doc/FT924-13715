FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Strong profits growth at
Huhtamaki
HUHTAMAKI, the Finnish consumer products group, announced yesterday a 165
per cent growth in profits (after financial items) to FM281m (Dollars
59.97m) in the first eight months, compared with FM105m in the previous
corresponding term.
Net sales rose 9 per cent to FM4.3bn, while operating income climbed by 77
per cent to FM403m.
Earnings per share were FM7.38, up 169 per cent.
The company expects profits to remain favourable for the rest of the year,
although strong profits growth would slow and the markka's depreciation
would increase financing costs slightly, it said.
The company's three main areas of international operations are confectionery
(through the Leaf group), accounting for 60 per cent of net sales and making
it one of the world's top 10 confectionery producers; food and beverage
packaging in the Polarcup group; and pharmaceuticals, via its Leiras
business.
Huhtamaki's expansion strategy began in 1983 when it doubled in size through
the purchases of three US-based enterprises - Leaf Confectionery, Beatrice
Food and the Donruss division of General Mills. These moves transformed the
company from a group with no foreign export markets beyond the Soviet Union
into an international conglomerate.
Over the past nine years the company has made 40 acquisitions, at a gross
cost of FM3.2bn, and 25 divestments, relieving its net financial burden by
FM1.5bn.
In March, it completed its move out of food production by divesting its 50.1
per cent holding in the Jalostaja food business to Finnish Unilever.
This was followed last July by the transfer of the non-alcoholic and
alcoholic beverages business Marli to the Finnish alcohol group Rettig, in
exchange for Rettig's lozenges business.
Most of the company's FM2.6bn investment programme has been directed into
the North American confectionery business.
This has meant six plant closures and the concentration of production in
Memphis, Denver, St Louis and Centralia, with a cut to 2,300 from 2,800 in
its US workforce. Two-thirds of its confectionery turnover comes from these
operations.
Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, says that Huhtamaki wants to position its
products in 'segments of the market where they do not compete head-on with
major brands and manufacturers.'
A similar pattern can be found in the company's Polarcup packaging group,
which accounts for 21 per cent of net sales and 15 per cent of operating
earnings. In the first eight months, net sales rose by 37 per cent, helped
by the acquisition of the US Sweetheart company.
Polarcup has avoided producing corrugated board and flexible packaging in
order to concentrate on single-use food services and paper and plastic
packaging for dairies and ice cream makers.
In those markets the company has achieved substantial sales in the Nordic
region and central Europe, and also around the Pacific rim.
The Leiras pharmaceutical group is the smaller of the company's three core
areas, with a 34 per cent growth in its exports to FM224m, or 47 per cent of
total sales.
Mr Peltola sees potential for substantial growth in this sector. Two million
women, for example, already use the company's Norplant contraceptive
implant.
Over the past two years Huhtamaki has undergone a period of consolidation.
This may not last much longer, though growth will remain firmly inside the
company's three designated areas.
