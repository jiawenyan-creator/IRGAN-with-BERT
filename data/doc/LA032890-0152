WORLD; 
CZECH EMIGRES TO REGAIN RIGHTS 
Thousands of Czechoslovak emigres can recover the citizenship they lost after 
the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion, Parliament ruled today. 
Thousands of Czechoslovaks who emigrated after the crushing of the Prague 
Spring reform movement were stripped of citizenship by the country's Communist 
rulers and made stateless. 
Parliament, amending current laws, ruled today that Czechoslovak nationality 
can only be given up voluntarily and gave people stripped of citizenship until 
1994 to reclaim it. 
Parliament, in a package of civil rights measures being rushed through, also 
abolished press censorship introduced after the 1968 invasion. Private 
citizens, including foreigners, now have the right to publish newspapers and 
magazines.
