<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (RCRA), authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to grant approval to states to operate their underground storage tank programs in lieu of the federal
program. 40 CFR part 282 codifies EPA's decision to approve state programs and incorporates by reference those provisions
of the state statutes and regulations that will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under
sections 9005 and 9006 of RCRA subtitle I and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. This rule codifies
in part 282 the prior approval of Kansas' underground storage tank program and incorporates by reference appropriate
provisions of state statutes and regulations.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 This regulation is effective November 28, 1994, unless EPA publishes a prior 

Federal Register

 notice withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on the codification of Kansas' underground storage tank
program must be received by the close of business October 27, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications
listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register, as of November 28, 1994, in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 552(a).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6991c, allows the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to approve state underground storage tank programs to operate in the state
in lieu of the federal underground storage tank program. EPA published a 

Federal Register

 document announcing its decision to grant approval to Kansas. (59 FR 29201 June 6, 1994). Approval was 
effective on July 6, 1994.
EPA codifies its approval of State programs in 40 CFR part 282 and incorporates by reference therein the state statutes
and regulations that will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006
of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. Today's
rulemaking codifies EPA's approval of the Kansas underground storage tank program. This codification reflects
the state program in effect at the time EPA granted Kansas approval under section 9004(a), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a) for its
underground storage tank program. Notice and opportunity for comment were provided earlier on the Agency's decision
to approve the Kansas program, and EPA is not now reopening that decision nor requesting comment on it. 
This effort provides clear notice to the public of the scope of the approved program in each state. By codifying the
approved Kansas program and by amending the Code of Federal Regulations whenever a new or different set of requirements
is approved in Kansas, the status of federally approved requirements of the Kansas program will be readily discernible.
Only those provisions of the Kansas underground storage tank program for which approval has been granted by EPA will
be incorporated by reference for enforcement purposes. 
To codify EPA's approval of Kansas' underground storage tank program, EPA has added 282.66 to title 40 of the
CFR. Section 282.66 incorporates by reference for enforcement purposes the State's statutes and regulations. Section
282.66 also references the Attorney General's Statement, Demonstration of Adequate Enforcement Procedures, the
Program Description, and the Memorandum of Agreement, which are approved as part of the underground storage tank
program under subtitle I of RCRA. 
The Agency retains the authority under sections 9005 and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, and other
applicable statutory and regulatory provisions to undertake inspections and enforcement actions in approved states.
With respect to such an enforcement action, the Agency will rely on federal sanctions, federal inspection authorities,
and federal procedures rather than the state authorized analogs to these provisions. Therefore, the approved Kansas
enforcement authorities will not be incorporated by reference. Section 282.66 lists those approved Kansas authorities
that would fall into this category. 
The public also needs to be aware that some provisions of the State's underground storage tank program are not part
of the federally approved state program. These non-approved provisions are not part of the RCRA subtitle I program
because they are ``broader in scope'' than subtitle I of RCRA. See 40 CFR 281.12(a)(3)(ii). As a result, state provisions
which are ``broader in scope'' than the federal program are not incorporated by reference for purposes of enforcement
in part 282. Section 282.66 of the codification simply lists for reference and clarity the Kansas statutory and regulatory
provisions which are ``broader in scope'' than the federal program and which are not, therefore, part of the approved
program being codified today. ``Broader in scope'' provisions cannot be enforced by EPA; the State, however, will
continue to enforce such provisions. 


Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule codifies the decision already made (59 FR 29201 June 6, 1994) to approve the Kansas underground storage tank
program and thus has no separate effect. Therefore, this rule does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
Thus, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.



Paperwork Reduction Act 


Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.,

 Federal agencies must consider the paperwork burden imposed by 
any information request contained in a proposed or final rule.
