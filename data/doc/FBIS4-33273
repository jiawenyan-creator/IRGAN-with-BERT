  [Text] Marcos Portal, Cuban basic industries minister, has 
said in Paris, capital of France, the ethics of our 
professionals as well as Cuba's political and social stability 
guarantee foreign investments on our island. 
  Portal, concluding a tour in Paris that took him to Norway, 
Great Britain, Holland, and France, has said Cuba ranks 29th in 
security for investments, placing it ahead of most Latin 
American countries. 
  Although he did not downplay the negative effects of the 
U.S. 
blockade against Cuba, Portal said the Cuban Government's 
economic strategy does not depend on the lifting of this measure 
imposed by Washington more than 30 years ago.
