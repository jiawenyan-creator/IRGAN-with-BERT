FT  12 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television
Keen gardeners are well served by television today. In Gardeners' World
Geoff Hamilton visits the Logan Botanical Gardens in Scotland (8.30 BBC2)
and Garden Club promises to 'check out varied vegetables, blooming bedding
plants, and those deemed to be beneficial to butterflies' (9.00 C4). Lovers
of comedy repeats should also be happy. BBC1 provides yet another chance to
see an episode of the prison series Porridge (8.00), BBC2 re-screens an
episode of the space saga Red Dwarf (9.00), and C4 continues its re-run of
The Golden Girls (9.30). But if gardening and old comedy are not your
passions then radio is a better bet. In BBC Proms 1994 the BBC Concert
Orchestra plays Sibelius's Karelia Suite, Four Dances by Constant Lambert,
Rawsthorne's Concerto for Two Pianos, The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Dukas,
Capriol Suite by Warlock, and La Valse by Ravel (7.00 Radio 3). In Something
To Write Home About Edward Enfield takes his bicycle to Ireland and reports
on his adventures on the road (8.50 Radio 4). And the Kaleidoscope Feature
is an interview with writer William Trevor (9.30 Radio 4).
