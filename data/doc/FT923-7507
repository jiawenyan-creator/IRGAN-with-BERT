FT  18 AUG 92 / Arabs may delay start of Washington talks
ARAB participants in Middle East peace talks due to resume next week are
threatening to delay their arrival in Washington in protest at the US
decision to grant Israel billions of dollars in loan guarantees without
first insisting on a settlement freeze.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation has summoned delegates to its Tunis
headquarters to discuss tactics before the Washington round. PLO hardliners
have demanded that the Palestinians boycott the talks until they get
undertakings that work on Jewish settlements will be stopped.
Palestinian officials have denounced President Bush's decision to grant some
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in guarantees without making public details of
understandings reached with Israel over settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The four Arab parties to the peace talks - Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the
Palestinians - are expected to meet in the next few days to discuss the
settlement issue. Their last meeting as a group was in Damascus in July.
Comments last week by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, on his
return from the US, that his government was pressing on with 11,000 homes
already under construction in the territories, have infuriated Palestinians.
They are demanding that work on these structures be stopped as a gesture of
good will, and that construction on new dwellings in Jerusalem and its
environs also be curbed.
Palestinian delegates to the peace talks were briefed at the weekend on the
US position by the American consul in Jerusalem. Sketchy details provided by
the US official did not allay Palestinian suspicions that Mr Bush had
softened earlier US demands that Israel freeze settlements.
