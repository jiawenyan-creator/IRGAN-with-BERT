North Carolina State officials sent a letter to the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Monday asking for an investigation into allegations of illegal 
activity in the school's basketball program. 
The letter to NCAA President Dick Schultz, which is signed by athletic director 
and basketball Coach Jim Valvano and Chancellor Bruce Poulton, cites 
allegations on the jacket of the book "Personal Fouls" by Peter Golenbock. 
The allegations included illegal gifts of jewelry and cars to players, the 
changing of grades by faculty and university officials and the passing of large 
amounts of secret money from the booster club. North Carolina State officials 
deny all of the allegations.
