FT  30 JUN 92 / Commercial bank lending still weak
LENDING by the nine biggest commercial banks has remained subdued, according
to figures that were released yesterday.
The statistics support theories that the economy is still some way from a
strong uplift.
The British Bankers Association, which released the statistics, said
sterling lending by the nine totalled Pounds 706m in the three months to
May, compared with Pounds 2.2bn in the previous three months.
On a seasonally adjusted basis - which takes into account the normally weak
demand for borrowing by companies and individuals in the spring - the figure
for between March and May comes to Pounds 3.1bn.
That is in contrast to the Pounds 1.8bn seasonally adjusted figure for the
previous three months.
The association warned that the seasonally adjusted figures may give a
flawed view of borrowing trends.
In recent years, companies have required smaller loans in the spring, when
cashflow is traditionally high.
But such seasonal fluctuations - for which the adjusted figures attempt to
compensate - may not apply when the country is in recession.
According to the unadjusted figures, people borrowed Pounds 1.6bn from the
nine banks between March and May, while companies repaid about Pounds 900m.
Manufacturers repaid Pounds 511m and construction groups Pounds 370m.
The increase in personal borrowing was largely accounted for by lending for
house purchases, which rose by Pounds 1.5bn, up from Pounds 1.1bn in the
previous three months.
However, the association said the rise was probably due to banks taking a
greater share of the mortgage market, from building societies, rather than
to an upturn in demand for housing.
