SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
General Information 


Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, the Board is responsible for the supervision and regulation
of all bank holding companies. The FR Y9 and FR Y11 series of reports historically have been, and continue
to be, the primary source of financial information on bank holding companies and their nonbanking activities between
on-site inspections. Financial information, as well as ratios developed from the Y series reports, are used to detect
emerging financial problems, to review performance for pre-inspection analysis, to evaluate bank holding company
mergers and acquisitions, and to analyze a holding company's overall financial condition and performance as part
of the Federal Reserve System's overall analytical effort. The FR Y6 report is the Federal Reserve's principal
source of internally generated and independently audited financial data on individual bank holding companies and
their banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The report enables the Federal Reserve to monitor bank holding company
operations and to ensure that the operations are conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with the provisions
of the Bank holding Company Act and Regulation Y.
