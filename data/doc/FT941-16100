FT  12 JAN 94 / Ashdown forms commission to develop economic policy
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrat party, has formed a
commission to draw up policies aimed at boosting the economy while at the
same time tackling unemployment.
Mr Ashdown said he is keen to improve the nation's competitiveness but also
enhance 'social cohesion'.
The Commission on Wealth Creation and Social Cohesion will look at how to
generate wealth yet keep unemployment low and protect the environment.
The commission, chaired by Liberal Democrat academic Lord Dahrendorf, warden
of St Antony's College, Oxford, will also consider issues such as taxation
and the operation of banks.
It will gather evidence from business leaders, trade unions, economic
analysts and professionals from education and social services. The
commission will produce a report with about six proposals in the autumn.
Mr Ashdown said: 'There is a desperate need for an authoritative,
comprehensive and radical vision of Britain's economic future.
'The commission's role is to establish impartially the needs and changes
which we must address as a nation.'
Proposals made by the commission would 'inform but not dictate' Liberal
Democrat policies, he said.
