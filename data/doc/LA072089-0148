The Greek government said that Washington must dismantle U.S. bases in Greece 
next year without a new defense pact. Talks on a new agreement have been 
frozen. A five-year agreement signed by the previous Socialist administration 
expired last year. "The issue of the U.S. bases in Greece is frozen . . . but 
the 17-month countdown which began last December for the Americans to remove 
the bases if a new agreement was not signed is still in force," said Deputy 
Foreign Minister George Papoulias.
