FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: MGM-Pathe reduces first quarter
deficit
MGM-Pathe Communications, the financially troubled Hollywood studio
controlled by Credit Lyonnais, the French state bank, yesterday reported a
first-quarter net loss of Dollars 54.7m against a deficit of Dollars 100.6m
a year earlier.
The company reduced operating losses to Dollars 14.4m from Dollars 24.6m.
Revenues were little changed at Dollars 298.9m compared with Dollars 292.5m.
It attributed the narrower deficit to lower writedowns on films and
television programming, a tighter control of general corporate expenses and
the absence of significant reserves in the 1991 period. Those reserves,
adding up to Dollars 44.8m, were taken to cover the possibility that
investments and affiliate loans made by prior management, led by the
unpredictable Italian financier Mr Giancarlo Parretti, might not be
recoverable or collectible.
During the latest quarter, MGM-Pathe's interest expense rose to Dollars
36.5m from Dollars 29.2m.
