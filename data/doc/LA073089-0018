TELLING IT LIKE IT IS ABOUT TV 
Thank goodness for people like Arthur Temple ("Former Director of Time Still 
Hits Warner Merger," July 13) with his strong feelings of how the television 
and entertainment industries are befouling our national moral culture with 
their endless repetitious showings of violence, murder, guns, vulgarity, 
profanity and sex. 
Thanks for telling it like it is.
