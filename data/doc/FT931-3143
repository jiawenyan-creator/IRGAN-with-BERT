FT  17 MAR 93 / China reduces deficit and increases defence spending
CHINA'S budget deficit would reach Yuan 84.4bn (Dollars 14.7bn) for 1993, a
slight decrease on the actual deficit recorded last year, Mr Liu Zhongli,
finance minister, announced yesterday. He also pledged an increase in
defence spending of 12.4 per cent to Dollars 7.5bn.
Speaking on the second day of China's National People's Congress, or
parliament, Mr Liu said mismanagement and waste in state-run organisations
and a shortfall in tax revenues had contributed to 'great financial
difficulties.'
Some two-thirds of China's state-owned industries, which account for about
50 per cent of industrial production, racked up huge losses last year,
adding to burdens on the exchequer. Last year's deficit reached Yuan 90.49
(Dollars 15.7bn), or about five per cent of GNP. The 1992 deficit
represented an increase of 24.6 per cent on the previous year.
Mr Li said total revenues this year were expected to reach Yuan 452.23bn
(Dollars 78.6bn), an increase of eight per cent over 1992. Expenditures were
projected at Yuan 472.7bn (Dollars 82.2bn), up 6.8 per cent.
This year's boost to defence spending will mark the fourth year in a row
that the military will receive a substantial increase; however, published
expenditures for the services account for only a relatively small proportion
of the actual cost of maintaining China's offensive capability.
Mr Liu also announced increased spending of about 9.8 per cent on education
and 10.8 per cent on science and technology.
Investment in agriculture will increase by 9.3 per cent.
Chinese officials also outlined planning targets for the coming year based
on anticipated growth in gross national product of 8 per cent.
Mr Zou Jiahua, the vice premier in charge of the state planning commission,
said these estimates were conservative and it was 'expected they would be
exceeded in implementation.'
Mr Zou said the demands of new investment would continue to drive the
economy in 1993. He predicted that activity would continue to be 'rather
brisk.' China registered economic growth last year of 12.8 per cent.
Mr Zou reported that in 1992 committed foreign investment in China doubled
compared with the previous year. China absorbed Dollars 11bn of foreign
funds, and approved 47,000 foreign-funded enterprises in 1992, more than the
total of the previous dozen years.
On Monday, Mr Li Peng, the premier, forecast growth in the remaining years
of the 1991-95 five-year plan of 8-9 per cent. This would enable China to
achieve its goal with time to spare of quadrupling GNP between 1980-2000.
Ministers yesterday also revealed more details of a comprehensive
restructuring of ministries and government departments to reduce duplication
and waste. A number of ministries will either go or be merged, and staff
slashed across the board.
The NPC, which will meet for the next two weeks, will endorse constitutional
changes, and approve the appointment of new personnel, including a head of
state and several vice premiers.
