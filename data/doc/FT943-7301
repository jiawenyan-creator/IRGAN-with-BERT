FT  24 AUG 94 / People: BBC beams in two finance men
The BBC has brought in two new finance directors to help it fulfil its
ambition to become a major international broadcaster in the satellite age.
Tony Kay, formerly deputy finance director of Granada/LWT International, has
been appointed finance director of the newly-created BBC Worldwide TV, and
Andrew Hind, director of finance at Barnardos, is joining the BBC World
Service as finance and commercial director.
They both come under the umbrella of BBC Worldwide which was established in
May and is headed by Bob Phillis, the BBC's deputy director-general, who is
known for his interest in tight financial controls.
The aim of the new structure is to provide a fully co-ordinated approach for
the first time to the BBC's international and commercial activities. BBC
Worldwide has three separate divisions: Worldwide TV which is responsible
for programme sales, co-productions and the BBC's news and non-news
channels; Worldwide Publishing; and the World Service, the international
radio service funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Jeff Hazell, who was at World Service TV, has been appointed director of
channel sales and marketing of BBC Worldwide TV. However, it is not clear
whether a role will be found in the new organisation for Christopher Irwin,
the former chief executive of World Service TV, the forerunner of BBC
Worldwide TV. The BBC said yesterday that Irwin was still on leave and
refused to comment on speculation that he would receive substantial
compensation for loss of job.
