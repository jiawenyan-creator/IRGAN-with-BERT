FT  03 FEB 92 / US bank to advise on HK airport funding
DIFFICULTIES in attracting a suitable finance director have prompted Hong
Kong's Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) to appoint a US commercial bank
as a surrogate for the initial financing for the HKDollars 43.6bn (Pounds
3.1bn) airport scheme.
The PAA is expected to select J P Morgan to advise on key aspects of the
authority's 'financial operations'.
The PAA declined to say what J P Morgan's brief would entail but it is
understood the bank has signed a short-term contract to provide wide-ranging
financial advice to the authority until a finance director is recruited. The
terms of J P Morgan's contract will be reconsidered after the appointment of
the director.
Mr Richard Allen, PAA's chief executive, flew to London over the weekend to
interview candidates for the job. There is some urgency as construction of
the airport - part of a HKDollars 98.6bn transportation project - is running
to a tight schedule and the authority needs a top financial expert in house.
The authority has to decide by May on the successful candidate for site
reclamation and preparation of the 1,248-hectare airport. 'We have got to
get off running in the next month or so,' said one senior executive.
Until recently Wardley, the merchant banking arm of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, was thought to be the likely winner of the PAA's finance
mandate. But the authority felt that the bank, the Hong Kong government's
overall financial adviser for the airport project, lacked independence.
