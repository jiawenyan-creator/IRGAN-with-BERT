FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Costs to be slashed' at new
copper mines
NEW COPPER mines scheduled to come on stream in the next three years are
expected both to boost production and to slash operating costs, according to
a report from the Commodities Research Unit. The growth follows a decade
bereft of new capacity and marked by rising costs as producers concentrated
on maximising output at a time of high prices.
Eight projects - including La Candelaria in Chile and Louvicourt in Canada -
are due to come on stream by the end of 1995 and have a combined annual
capacity of 277,000 tonnes a year. Average operating costs of these mines
and Chile's Escondida, which opened at the end of 1990, are expected to be
less than 45 cents a lb.
This compares with average operating costs of more than 60 cents a lb in
1990. Cash copper is selling at 114 cents a lb on the London Metal Exchange.
A further 10 projects - including Windy Craggy in Canada and Codelco's
Chuqui Norte and El Abra in Chile - are due to come on stream between 1996
and 2005, producing an additional 720,000 tonnes a year at an average 43
cents a lb.
