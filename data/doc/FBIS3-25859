  [Text] Washington, January 31 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton called Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
last night and urged progress in the U.S.-Japan economic 
framework talks, the White House said here today. 
  The President has sent U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor and deputy assistant to the President for economic policy 
Bo Cutter to Tokyo to meet with their Japanese counterparts, 
said White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers at a news 
briefing. 
  They will hold consultations to "seek mutually agreeable 
resolutions to the issues being discussed under the framework," 
Myers said. 
  President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa are scheduled 
to meet in Washington on February 11. 
  In last night's call, Clinton also extended to Prime 
Minister 
Hosokawa his congratulations on achieving political reform in 
Japan. 
  Both houses of Japanese parliament have passed a package of 
anti-corruption bills put forward by Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
  "The President thinks it is a good step that the government 
has resolved this and can move forward now to focusing on 
economic issues," Myers said.
