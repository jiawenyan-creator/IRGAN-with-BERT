SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background




The Department of Commerce (the Department) may revoke an antidumping duty order or finding, or terminate a suspended
investigation, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii), if no interested party has requested an administrative review
for four consecutive annual anniversary months and no domestic interested party objects to the revocation or requests
an administrative review.

We had not received a request to conduct administrative reviews of the following antidumping duty orders, findings,
or suspension agreement for the last four consecutive annual anniversary months. Therefore, pursuant to 353.25(d)(4)(i)
of the Department's regulations, on September 9, 1993, November 2, 1993, December 27, 1993, December 30, 1993, January
3, 1994, January 27, 1994, February 4, 1994, and March 29, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 notices of intent to revoke these antidumping duty orders and findings or terminate the suspended investigation
and served written notice of the intent to each interested party on the Department's service list in each case. Within
the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke these antidumping
duty orders and findings or terminate these suspended investigations. Therefore, because domestic interested
parties objected to the revocations and terminations, we no longer intend to revoke these antidumping duty orders
and findings or terminate the suspended investigation.
