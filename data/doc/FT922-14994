FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Brussels reverses view on
P&amp;G-Finaf nappy venture
PROCTER &amp; Gamble of the US and Finaf of Italy face further problems in their
nappy-making joint ventures in southern Europe after the European Commission
yesterday reversed its position that the enterprises would not cause undue
concentration in the nappy market.
The two companies modified their plans last autumn at Brussels' behest,
after which the Commission said it intended to give its approval to the
joint ventures, and invited public comment.
Such invitations usually stir little reaction. But in this case it brought
complaints from several governments, as well as from no fewer than 10 of the
two companies' competitors in the European nappy market.
Using more up-to-date figures on P&amp;G's recent market share, the Commission
has concluded that the joint ventures in Italy, Spain and Portugal would
give the two companies more than half the EC nappy market.
The Commission said it was hard to see how Brussels' new concerns could be
satisfied without some divestment.
P&amp;G said it was 'very ready' to negotiate further with the Commission.
However, the company, which makes Pampers, noted that nappies were 'a very
volatile market'. There was very little brand loyalty, it said, because new
mothers were moving into the market all the time. 'Today's share may be
quite different tomorrow,' P&amp;G claimed.
After receiving what they thought was final approval from Brussels in
January, P&amp;G and Finaf put the final touches to the management of their
southern European joint ventures.
The Commission's fresh concerns do not affect other products, such as adult
incontinence and female hygiene products.
