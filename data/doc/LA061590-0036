HORTON PLAZA TO PUT CURBS ON FREE PARKING 
Horton Plaza in downtown San Diego is changing its parking policy to discourage 
non-shoppers from using the parking structure, said Craig Pettitt, general 
manager of the plaza. 
Under the new rules, those parking in the 2,400-car structure will still get 
three free hours of parking, but will have to get their parking tickets 
validated by any of the merchants in the mall. 
Shoppers have to make a purchase to get validation, but there is no minimum 
amount. 
Customers now are often turned away because people who work in the area are 
taking advantage of the three free hours of parking, Pettitt said Thursday in a 
press conference at the mall. 
"If we are turning away customers, obviously we are turning away dollars," he 
said. 
Of the 3 million cars that used the parking structure last year, 20% to 30% 
were not shoppers, Pettitt said. 
As a result, the structure had to be closed 110 times, for varying lengths of 
time, last year. 
"Our ultimate goal is to never close the parking structure," Pettitt said. 
The new policy goes into effect July 2, he said. 
Validated parking will cost $1 per half hour after the three free hours. 
Nonvalidated parking will cost $1 per half hour and will no longer be free 
after 5 p.m. Pettitt criticized nearby merchants not located in Horton Plaza 
who encourage their customers -- often in advertisements -- to use Horton 
garage.
