FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: First Leisure rises to Pounds 30.4m
FIRST LEISURE, the discotheque, ten-pin bowling and tourist attractions
group chaired by Lord Delfont, yesterday announced a 4 per cent improvement
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 30.4m after what it described as the most
difficult year since the company was set up in 1983.
Lord Delfont said he expected tough trading conditions to continue
throughout most of this year. He said the first half of the current year
would be particularly difficult and would coincide with the planned closure
of Blackpool Tower and several discotheques for redevelopment.
Mr John Conlan, chief executive, said the group was looking into the
possibility of acquiring some of the assets of Themes International, owner
of Windsor Safari Park, which went into administrative receivership earlier
this month.
Mr Conlan said the company was interested in Themes International's bowling
alleys and would also look at the safari park. He added, however, that
discussions were at an early stage.
First Leisure's profits for the year to October 31 1991 were boosted by a
strong performance from snooker and the ten-pin bowling business.
The strong performance of First Leisure's snooker activities is in part due
to the rise in unemployment and the increase in the number of people looking
for activities to fill their day.
The sports division, which includes bowling, snooker and the Chichester
Marina, saw profits rise 31 per cent to Pounds 12.8m on turnover of Pounds
26m (Pounds 21.8m).
Profits from discotheques were flat at Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 13.5m) on
turnover slightly up at Pounds 41.6m (Pounds 38.5m). Mr Conlan said this
sector was the first of the company's businesses to feel the effects of the
recession, as competitors discounted prices heavily to increase market
share.
The group is in the process of redesigning its discotheques to give them a
more futuristic, high-tech look. Mr Conlan said the last redesign of the
discotheques, in the mid-1980s, had attempted to give them a similar look to
the lounge of a luxury hotel.
Profits at the group's tourist facilities, which include all three Blackpool
piers and the Winter Gardens conference centre, fell to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds
14.1m) on a small advance in turnover to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 38.7m). Mr
Conlan said visitor numbers were down, and those tourists who did visit the
attractions were spending less.
Depressed conditions in London's West End, where the company has a stake in
the Prince of Wales and Prince Edward venues, saw profits from theatres fall
to Pounds 728,000 (Pounds 1.1m) on turnover of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 3.2m).
The company announced last November that Mr Cameron Mackintosh, the
theatrical producer, had agreed to increase his 20 per cent interest in the
Prince of Wales and the Prince Edward to 50 per cent.
Group turnover increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 108.7m (Pounds 102.3m).
Earnings per share rose from 15.62p to 15.67p and a final dividend of 3.95p
(3.5p) is proposed, making a total of 5.695p, a 13 per cent improvement on
last year's distribution of 5.05p.
