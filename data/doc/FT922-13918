FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Philips raises Blockbuster stake
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, yesterday exercised a Dollars 66m
option to acquire shares in Blockbuster, the US-based video rental chain
which owns the Cityvision chain in the UK.
The move raises the Dutch company's stake in Blockbuster to 4.5 per cent and
deepens a partnership formed last November. The 6m shares bought yesterday
come on top of 2m shares purchased at the end of February.
Blockbuster also said that it had amended an additional option which allows
Philips to buy 5m more shares. The option is now exercisable until December
15 this year, but if the shares are bought between July 1 and the end of the
year, the price will rise to Dollars 12 per share. If it is exercised before
July 1, the price will be Dollars 11 - the price at which the 6m shares were
bought under the first option.
When Philips agreed to invest the Dollars 66m in Blockbuster last year, it
said that this would either take the form of a direct stake - exercise of
the 6m share option - or that the money would be put into joint projects in
the home entertainment field, possibly a stake in Cityvision.
