FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Saint-Gobain eyes 2% BNP holding
SAINT-GOBAIN, the French glass and building materials group, said yesterday
it planned to take a stake of about 2 per cent in Banque Nationale de Paris
when it is privatised.
Saint-Gobain said the move would reflect a long-standing relationship
between the two companies. BNP holds just under 4 per cent of Saint-Gobain's
shares.
Mr Marc de Nadaillac, managing director, also said he saw no signs of
recovery in the group's principal markets in the current half. He was
speaking the day after the group announced a two-thirds fall in net profits
for the first half of the year, to FFr452m (Dollars 80.7m) from FFr1.4bn.
In particular, the sale of glass to the automotive industry, Saint-Gobain's
largest business activity, is expected to remain depressed as a result of
the continued sharp decline in the European car market.
Mr de Nadaillac said the company would expand outside Europe and develop
specialty products to counteract the effects of the recession in its
principal markets. Mexico, Korea and eastern Europe were being considered.
The company also plans to trim its debt and investments in the second half
of the year. Gearing is forecast to fall to 45 per cent at the end of the
year, compared with 46 per cent at the end of 1992. Industrial investments
are targetted at FFr4.6bn this year compared with FFr5.08bn in 1992.
The French finance ministry said the pre-subscription of BNP shares would
start on Monday, and that the privatisation of the bank would take place by
December 20 at the latest, market conditions permitting.
Analysts in Paris were surprised at the late deadline.
