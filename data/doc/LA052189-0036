STAKING A SMALL CLAIM IN COURT 
Your article of May 11, "How to Proceed in Small Claims Court" (Legal View by 
Jeffrey S. Klein), was most instructive and should certainly help litigants to 
be better prepared. 
The public, however, should have been made aware that a Small Claims Advisory 
Service exists (at the request of the courts) and is run for the benefit of the 
consumer by the County of Los Angeles under the auspices of Consumer Affairs. 
Any Small Claims Court Clerk will give out the number of the nearest advisory 
service (there are several locations throughout the county). Advisers give 
non-legal advice to plaintiffs or defendants on procedural matters, fees, 
subpoenas, appeals, collection methods and general conduct in Small Claims 
Court.
