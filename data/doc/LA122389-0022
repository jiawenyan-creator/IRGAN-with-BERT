CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L SCANDAL 
Hooray for Shirley Lampel! It took guts to disrupt one of Sen. Alan Cranston's 
political forums on behalf of 23,000 holders of worthless junk bonds sold by 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan ("Cranston's Promise on Bonds Told," Dec. 17). But 
some folks will believe anyone and anything. After trusting Lincoln and losing 
her savings, how can Lampel be "absolutely positive" Cranston will keep his 
pledge to help the bondholders after his unabashed acceptance of some $900,000 
in political contributions through Lincoln's President Charles Keating? 
It's naive to presume a cunning, unconscionable and obsessed political animal 
like Cranston is interested in helping anyone but himself. After some two 
decades dedicated primarily to the job of raising funds and getting reelected, 
does Lampel truly believe Cranston is really interested in helping anyone but 
himself while he lies atop the political trash heap? Is she blind to the fact 
that Cranston spent the past couple of years fiddling with Keating's political 
contributions while the bondholders burned?
