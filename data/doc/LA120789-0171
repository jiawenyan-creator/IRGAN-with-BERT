BRIEFLY 
Telecommunications Deal Expected: An international consortium including San 
Francisco-based Pacific Telesis is expected to be awarded a license today to 
build West Germany's first private cellular telephone system. The deal could be 
worth billions in revenue for Pacific Telesis, the parent of Pacific Bell and 
owner of a 26% stake in the consortium. Pacific Telesis' partners are West 
Germany's Mannesmann AG and DG-Bank, along with Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless 
PLC and France's Lyonnaise des Eaux.
