ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class D airspace area at Springfield/Chicopee, MA by amending the effective hours of that
area to coincide with the hours of operation of the associated air traffic control tower (ATCT). This action also establishes
Class E airspace at Springfield/Chicopee, MA when the associated ATCT is closed. The intended effect of this action
is to clarify when two-way radio communication with the Springfieldd/Chicopee, MA ATCT is required and to provide
adequate Class E airspace for aircraft conducting instrument approach procedures when that ATCT is closed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Comments Invited 


Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES

'' section. However, after review of the comments and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation. 

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. 



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Springfield/Chicopee, MA by amending the effective hours of that area to coincide with the hours of operation to the
associated air traffic control tower (ATCT). This action also establishes Class E airspace at Springfield/Chicopee,
MA when the associated ATCT is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control
zone (CZ) existed at this airport. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued
the use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D
airspace.'' The former CZ was effective on a continuous basis, while the former ATA was contingent upon the hours of
operation of the ATCT. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation made it necessary
to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the hours of operation of the ATCT. Class E airspace
in the vicinity of Springfield/Chicopee, MA is necessary for aircraft executing instrument approaches to that airport
during times when ATCT is not in operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication
with the Springfield/Chicopee ATCT is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing instrument
approach procedures to that airport when the ATCT is closed. 

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to modify the Springfield/Chicopee Class D airspace and establish Class E airspace
in the vicinity of Springfield/Chicopee, MA in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these
areas. Therefore, I find that notice and an opportunity for prior public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable
and contrary to the public interest. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
