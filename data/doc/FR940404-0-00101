 

f. A commenter objected to the proposed rule not being posted in the prisons within a timely manner. It is Bureau policy
to post proposed rules in its institutions to facilitate inmate comments. The date of posting is often dictated, in
part, by when we receive the requisite copies of the 

Federal Register

 and by mailing time. On occasion, delays can result from this process. To accommodate this commenter's concerns,
the Bureau plans to extend (ordinarily to 60 days) the time for public comment on future Bureau rules. 


g. A commenter favors letting each person who receives a call decide whether to accept or reject that call, without
sending money. In response, the Bureau first notes that there is no requirement for an outside person to forward the
inmate funds. As already discussed, the Bureau believes that there are strong correctional management reasons for
restricting collect telephone calls and for providing that inmates should ordinarily pay for their telephone calls.
Certainly, where the need exists, and as set forth in the rule, the Bureau will provide collect call capability or,
in the alternative, pay for the call itself. 


Each potential recipient of a call has the option of refusing consent to be maintained on the inmate's telephone list.
Even if an individual elects to remain on the inmate's telephone list, he or she can use other means, such as an answering
machine or other services provided by local telephone carriers (caller ID, for example), to screen incoming calls,
or simply hang up. 


h. One inmate commenter alleged that the Bureau transferred inmates to institutions far removed from anticipated
release areas in violation of Bureau designation practice, resulting in reduced opportunity for visits and higher
costs for telephone communications. This commenter recommended that a certain number of free telephone calls be
provided to any inmate located 500 miles or more from a home city.
