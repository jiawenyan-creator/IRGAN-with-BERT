 

(26) Distribution of ETM+data is scheduled to begin by late 1998. How many scenes of ETM+data do you (i.e., your organization)
expect to purchase the first year they are available? 

Assume cost per scene is not a factor in your decision.
&bull;Less than 5 scenes.
&bull;510 scenes.
&bull;1120 scenes.
&bull;More than 20 scenes.
&bull;I don't expect to purchase any scenes the first year.
&bull;Don't know.

How many scenes per year do you expect to purchase in subsequent years?
&bull;Same as above.
&bull;More than above.
&bull;Less than above.
&bull;Don't know.

(27) Several commercial satellite systems are being built that will supply very high spectral and spatial resolution
data. How will the advent of such systems affect your use of Landsat data?
&bull;Landsat data purchases will likely increase.
&bull;Landsat data purchases will likely decrease.
&bull;No impact on Landsat data purchases.
&bull;Don't know.


(28) Regarding planning for future Landsat missions, please rank the following capabilities in ascending order
(1 to 7: 1 being the most important) of their importance to you.






XXX

 Maintaining ETM+image characteristics


XXX

Improved spatial resolution in the Pan band


XXX

Improved spatial resolution in the spectral bands


XXX

Shorter revisit interval


XXX

Improved spectral resolution (more bands)



XXX

Active sensing (radar capability)



XXX

Other (please specify)

XXXXXXXX





(29) Utilizing Landsat data in the future may require improved technology capability in your organization, e.g.,
ability to apply radiometric and/or geometric corrections to raw data. Such a requirement
&bull;Would be a major difficulty.
&bull;Would be a minor difficulty.
&bull;Would be no difficulty.
&bull;No opinion.


(30) What other types of land remote sensing data acquired from space-borne platforms are you currently using or plan
to use?
&bull;Spot.
&bull;Resours.
&bull;ASTER.
&bull;IRS.
&bull;Other(s) (please specify) 

XXXXXXXX





(31) Please provide your recommendations to the Landsat Program Management regarding the status, effectiveness
and operation of the Landsat system.
