FAIRPLEX; 
DACHI'S FOLLY WINS DERBY, SETS RECORD 
Over an extremely fast track at Fairplex Park Saturday afternoon, Dachi's Folly 
set a track record in beating favored Greydar by a neck to win the $104,300 
Pomona Derby. 
Rallying from seventh down the backstretch, Dachi's Folly moved between horses 
on the far turn and caught Greydar in the final strides. Rocket Gibralter was 
another neck behind in third. Due To The King, winner of the Foothill Stakes, 
was rank throughout and faded to seventh. 
Dachi's Folly covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 2/5 under Alex Solis, breaking 
Epidaurus' record by one fifth of a second. Dachi's Folly paid $18. 
"I was really surprised because he finished three lengths behind Greydar the 
last time and really needed the race," Solis said. "He really kicked it in down 
the stretch this time." 
Greydar was four wide around the clubhouse turn and three wide into the 
stretch. 
In the 10th race, Monte Parnes set a track record of 1:41 3/5 for 1 1/16 miles, 
paying $46 to win. Growler Sandue, a $25,000 claimer, equaled the 6 1/2-furlong 
track record of 1:15 1/5 in winning the eighth.
