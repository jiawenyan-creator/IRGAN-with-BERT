FT  03 FEB 92 / Auditors oppose shake-up in monitoring
THE collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International has not
demonstrated a need for significant changes in auditing practices, the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says.
Greater statutory powers of access by Bank of England investigators to
auditors and reporting accountants are not required, the institute has said
in a written submission to the Bingham inquiry, which is investigating BCCI.
It says the case for detailed examination of banks' internal control systems
every year is also not proven, in spite of the existence of stricter
procedures by regulators in other financial service sectors. Examinations of
banks take place on a 'rolling basis', typically every four or five years.
That saves costs and need not reduce the effectiveness of banking
regulation, the institute says.
It argues that there should still be annual meetings between the regulator,
the reporting accountant and a bank's management.
The institute says auditors of banks have a responsibility to conduct their
work 'so as to have a reasonable expectation of detecting material
misstatements in the financial statements'. That should normally allow them
to detect frauds with a significant effect on figures in the statements.
It emphasises that concealment by collusion or forgery are among actions
that may prevent an auditor detecting fraud. It says a company's management,
not auditors, is responsible for preventing fraud.
