  [Text] The election battle in the Northern Cape appears to 
be heading for an interesting finish with both the ANC and the 
opposition parties having won 15 seats each in the provincial 
legislature at this stage. With more than 92 percent of the 
provisional results available, the ANC has won 49.8 percent, the 
NP [National Party] 40.3 percent, the Freedom Front 5.9 percent, 
and the DP [Democratic Party] 1.8 percent. This means 12 seats 
for the NP, two for the Freedom Front, and one for the DP.
