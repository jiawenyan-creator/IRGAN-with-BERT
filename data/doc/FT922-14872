FT  03 APR 92 / Growth in Germany helps Redland contain profits fall
STRONG growth in Germany helped Redland, the building materials group,
contain a fall in profits last year to 24 per cent, in line with market
expectations, in spite of a halving of the contribution from the UK.
The Reigate-based group, which last month won control of rival materials
group Steetley in a Pounds 600m bid, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 186.3m,
down from Pounds 245m.
The results were achieved after charging Pounds 11m of plant closure and
redundancy costs against operating profits but reflected the impact of the
UK recession.
Earnings per share fell from 50.7p to 30p but the group is recommending a
final dividend of 16.75p, giving a total of 25p, up from 23.35p last year.
For the first time Redland broke out the contribution from Germany, where
profits grew 20 per cent to Pounds 85.8m, or 45 per cent of total operating
profits.
Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director, said the Steetley acquisition would
help reduce exposure to Germany although the housing market was not slowing
in line with the German economy and eastern Germany was likely to remain a
fast-growing market.
Lower tax and financing costs and the benefits of integrating the
acquisition should enhance earnings per share by 10 per cent this year, he
said.
UK profits fell from Pounds 72.4m to Pounds 34.4m, with lower sales in
roofing, aggregates and bricks reflecting the recession in domestic
building. Profits also fell in continental Europe, outside Germany, in the
US and the Far East including Australasia.
Roofing profits fell only 7 per cent to Pounds 128.9m, buoyed by Braas in
Germany, the 51 per cent-controlled joint venture, with sales of concrete
roof tiles particularly strong in former east Germany.
Aggregates profits fell 40 per cent to Pounds 45m, although Western Mobile
in Colorado and Redland Stone in Texas benefited from more buoyant demand.
The interest charge fell from Pounds 12m to Pounds 300,000, as gearing fell
from 34 per cent to 10 per cent. After the Steetley acquisition gearing is
likely to end the year at about 24 per cent, but a refinancing of Steetley's
debt will save Pounds 3m in a full year.
The tax rate in 1991 rose to 27.5 per cent from 26 per cent, reflecting
higher profits in Germany, but could fall again as a result of the
acquisition.
