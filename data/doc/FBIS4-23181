  [Text] Cape Town May 29 SAPA -- The National Executive of 
the Labour Party [LP] had agreed that the party should be 
disbanded, LP spokesman Mr Peter Hendrickse said on Sunday [29 
May]. He said the decision, made at a weekend meeting of the 
executive in Cape Town, would be put before a special congress 
of the party in about three months for ratification. 
  He also said that his father, Senator Alan Hendrickse, had 
stepped down as leader of the party. Mr Miley Richards would be 
acting leader until the congress. 
  Senator Hendrickse had told a party congress in December 
that 
he wanted to stand down, but had been persuaded to stay on until 
after the election. 
  Mr Hendrickse said only congress had the power to decided to 
dissolve the party. The NEC [National Executive Committee] 
recommendation would in the meantime be circulated to all 
regions for discussion. "It was felt that the party had served 
its purpose, fighting for the realisation of a non-racial 
democratic South Africa," he said. "Having attained those 
objects there was no need for the party to continue as a 
separate body." 
  The LP, founded 29 years ago, stood in the April election as 
part of the ANC alliance. Mr Hendrickse said there had been 
talk in the party for the past two years that it should disband. 
There were however supporters in the Western Cape in particular 
who felt very strongly that it should not. "But at the end of 
the day the NEC recommendation to congress will be that the 
party be dissolved," he said.
