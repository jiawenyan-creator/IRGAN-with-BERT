FT  01 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: DTB lifts margin requirement
on bund future
The German futures and options exchange (DTB) has increased the margin
requirement on its government bond futures contract and its DAX stock index
future.
The move follows the recent rise in volatility in Germany's bond and stock
markets. An official said the new margin requirement took effect yesterday,
and would remain in force until further notice.
'The 30-day volatility in the bund future was higher than we had assumed
under our worst-case scenario,' the DTB said.
'Last Thursday, the (March) contract closed 108 ticks below the previous
day's close, while our worst-case scenario assumed a maximum move of only
100 ticks,' it said.
Margins represent the collateral that an investor must deposit to secure an
investment position.
The DTB's margin on the bund future was raised to DM3,000 (the equivalent of
a 120-tick move on the future) per contract from DM2,500 (100 ticks). The
margin on the DAX future was increased to DM13,000 (130 index points) from
DM11,000 (110 index points).
Europe's other large exchanges are not envisaging similar moves.
'The exchange is not planning to change its initial margin on the bund
future,' said a Liffe official, noting there was always the possibility of
making intra-day margin calls at times of high volatility. Liffe's initial
margin requirement on the bund future is currently DM2,000.
'We are constantly monitoring volatility levels to ensure the margin
requirements are appropriate, but for the moment we are not considering any
changes,' a Matif official said.
