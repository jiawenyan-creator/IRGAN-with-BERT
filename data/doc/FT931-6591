FT  01 MAR 93 / Backbench MPs support phasing out of mortgage interest tax
relief
THE PHASING OUT of mortgage interest tax relief is supported by 55 per cent
of backbench MPs, according to a survey commissioned by the housing charity
Shelter, Alan Pike writes.
Shelter says MPs of all parties endorse proposals for better targeted help
for homeowners, which it is publishing today.
The charity wants the government to accompany the ending of tax relief -
which costs the exchequer Pounds 5bn a year - with other arrangements for
helping the needy.
These might include a mortgage benefit scheme, based on existing housing
benefit, or an alternative form of assistance for low-income home owners,
and a review of further ways to help with housing costs.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, said the recent record mortgage
arrears and repossessions had 'highlighted the absurdity of the current
mortgage tax relief policy'.
The call to abolish mortgage tax relief is supported by the Tory Reform
Group, a moderate Conservative pressure group, in its Budget submission to
the chancellor.
It believes tax relief should be phased out over five years. In the
meantime, the group argues, the chancellor should stimulate the housing
market by offering homebuyers a cash alternative to tax relief.
Such one-off payments would, it suggests, be about Pounds 2,000 initially
and diminish annually.
'This would help to encourage first-time buyers, offsetting the current
incentive to remain outside the market while prices continue to fall,' it
says.
