FT  13 AUG 93 / Letter: M&amp;S and a question of marketing strategy
Sir, The defence by Marks and Spencer chairman Sir Richard Greenbury
(Letters, August 5), of its plans for Brooks Brothers (in response to Nikki
Tait' s article: Management, July 8) is to be expected. Nevertheless there
are aspects of his letter which surprise me.
'We are not trying to popularise Brooks,' he says. 'Clearly this would not
be in its interests and we are not so stupid as to think it would be.' The
last part of this comment, I fear, identifies the problem all too crisply.
'Brooks Brothers, however,' continues Sir Richard, 'cannot develop and grow
based upon a declining number of ageing Wall Street customers and must
broaden its base at least into the 40-year-olds . . .' Perhaps Sir Richard
is planning a massive expansion. Given the size of Brooks Brothers and the
large market available for its products, demographic factors should not
impede sustainable growth, '. . . while of course maintaining the loyalty of
its more traditional customers,' continues Sir Richard. 'We are succeeding
with this policy.' This confident assessment of success seems, to put it
mildly, rather premature.
More generally, Sir Richard's letter opens an interesting debate about
marketing strategy. Should companies that market products to a well-defined
group of customers and enjoy their loyalty continue to maintain the
integrity of their position, or should they be receptive to change?
Conventional wisdom is that companies must be sensitive to the markets they
serve and should attempt to optimise the preferences of their target
customers as successfully as possible. The recently fashionable view is that
firms should lead their customers rather than follow.
The long-term consequences of Sir Richard's decisions are not yet clear.
What is beyond doubt, however, is that I have lost a cherished supplier of
high-quality products.
