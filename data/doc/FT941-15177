FT  17 JAN 94 / Treasury warns Railtrack on pay
The Treasury has voiced its concern to Railtrack over the salaries it is
proposing to pay some directors.
Its interest was sparked by a proposal by Railtrack, which is to run the
rail infrastructure from April, to pay a seconded civil servant a
significantly higher salary.
The Treasury has set Railtrack's initial rate of return at 5 per cent in
1994-95, rising by 1 percentage point a year until it reaches 8 per cent.
This was done on the understanding that Railtrack would be able to meet the
higher return over the three years by cutting its costs instead of
increasing its charges.
