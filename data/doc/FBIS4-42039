  [Text] Bishkek, 30 Jun -- Problems of setting up a 
functional economic union were to have been discussed tomorrow 
in Chimkent by the leaders of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and 
Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan]. However, an ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
learned from reliable sources that the meeting has been 
postponed to 8 July. 
  The Chimkent meeting was planning to discuss setting up 
working bodies to run an economic union of the three republics, 
including an executive committee on deepening economic 
integration. The heads of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kirgizia 
also intend to discuss problems relating to curtailing the 
emigration of Russian-speaking residents in these Central Asian 
republics.
