FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
Continued weakness of the US dollar together with fears on inflation in both
the UK and US sent stock index futures plunging, writes Joel Kibazo.
By the close, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was at 2,864, down 71
on its previous finish and at a 26 point discount to its fair value premium.
The session was particularly volatile and September, having opened at 2,908,
reached a high of 2,915 after lunch before falling to the day's low of 2,860
towards the close. In traded options, total volume was 37,152 lots with
21,454, done in the FT-SE 100 option.
