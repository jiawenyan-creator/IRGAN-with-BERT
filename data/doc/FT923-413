FT  29 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below
18,000 on worries over high yen
THE Nikkei average fell below 18,000 for the first time since September 16
on worries over the effects of the high yen on the Japanese economy, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed down 422.15 or 2.3 per cent at the day's low of
17,972.61, after hitting the day's high of 18,397.47. Although hopes that
public funds would be invested in the stock market buoyed up share prices in
early trading, the fall in the futures market prompted arbitrage-related
selling.
Volume fell to 200m shares from 355m. Declines outnumbered advances by 634
to 320 with 167 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 22.44 to 1,349.09 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
rose 1.05 to 1076.21.
Market participants had expected the injection of public funds as a part of
the government's package to support the financial system and stock market.
However, traders said that the thin volume had possibly turned fund managers
away.
Traders also blamed the higher yen for the fall in share prices. The yen
moved to a new all-time high against the dollar, closing at Y119.65,
prompting worries about foreign exchange losses at leading exporters.
High-technology issues and car manufacturers with high export ratios were
lower. Hitachi lost Y17 to Y745 and TDK, the magnetic tape maker, fell Y190
to Y3,330. Honda Motor lost Y80 to Y1,280 and Nissan Motor Y9 to Y615.
Issues chosen as new components of the Nikkei average as of October 1, were
traded actively. Hazama, the construction company, rose Y11 to Y555 and
Seika, a machinery trader, gained Y1 to Y696. Minebea, however, lost Y4 to
Y506 on profit-taking.
But issues due to be replaced in the index plunged. Godo Shusei fell Y100 to
Y570, Daito Woolen Spinning &amp; Weaving lost Y100 to Y420 and Takashimaya Y100
to Y863.
Itoman, the trading company which will be absorbed by Sumikin Bussan, an
unlisted trading company affiliated with the Sumitomo group, saw heavy
volume, but closed unchanged at Y124.
Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting led market volume, but fell Y11 to Y508 on
profit-taking. The issue had previously gained popularity on reports of a
gold mine discovery in southern Japan.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 287.83 to 19,502.24 in volume of 13.4m
shares.
