  [Excerpts] Shanghai, 12 Feb (WEN WEI PO) -- On the eve of 
the Lunar New Year, Shanghai residents learned from television 
programs that Deng Xiaoping would once again join them in 
spending the spring festival. This was the seventh consecutive 
time he did so since 1988. [passage omitted] 
  It was on the afternoon of 9 February (that is, on the eve 
of 
the Lunar New Year) that Deng Xiaoping gathered happily with 
Shanghai's senior-level persons such as Wu Bangguo and Wang Ju. 
Deng Nan and Xiao Rong, Deng Xiaoping's two daughters, held his 
arms [chan fu 2356 2105] on the left and right as he walked into 
the reception room to shake hands with Wu Bangguo and Wang Ju, 
who had waited there. Compared with last year, Deng Xiaoping 
was slightly thinner. [passage omitted]
