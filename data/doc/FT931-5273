FT  06 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow flat despite unemployment
figures
Wall Street
A DAY of fluctuating price movements ended with US stock shares flat or
lower in spite of a stronger than expected February employment report,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.67 at 3,404.58. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 1.16 at 446.18, while
the Amex composite ended up 0.96 at 413.80, and the Nasdaq composite 0.64
higher at 681.37. Trading volume on the NYSE was 249m shares.
The news that non-farm payrolls had jumped 365,000 and the national
unemployment rate dropped from 7.1 per cent to 7.0 per cent last month
surprised Wall Street, which had been expecting only a modest increase in
payrolls and no change in the jobless rate.
The markets, however, failed to respond positively to the news, at least at
first. Prices fell in early trading, and remained essentially flat for most
of the morning session. The weakness in equities was attributed to the big
fall in bond prices which followed the release of the jobs data.
The benchmark 30-year bond issue initially fell by more than a point on the
news, sending the yield back above 6.8 per cent. The rise in bond yields
upset equity investors, who fear higher interest rates could slow economic
growth. Bonds, however, rallied later to end virtually unchanged, the
30-year yielding 6.74 per cent.
This recovery helped shares bounce back strongly, with the Dow showing a
gain of 35 points at one stage, but the buying quickly petered out and
leading issues were fortunate to hold on to their gains.
Among individual stocks, some cyclicals and big industrial issues were in
good form. Alcoa climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , Goodyear firmed
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 71 1/8 , General Electric put on Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 85 3/4 , and Caterpillar added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 58 3/4 .
Computer shares were also in demand. Motorola was especially strong, rising
almost Dollars 3 before slipping back to end up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 60
1/4 in turnover of 1.3m shares. Hewlett-Packard added Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 76 3/4 , and Digital Equipment climbed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 46 3/4
.
Salomon, which fell sharply on Thursday on news of trading losses at its
Wall Street securities subsidiary, bounced back, rising Dollars 3/4 to
Dollars 40 3/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, many leading issues were lower. After a strong start,
Microsoft fell back to end Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 82 3/4 , Intel lost
Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 115 3/4 , and Amgen slipped Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 33 1/4 .

TORONTO shares ended the week on a winning note, closing higher in continued
active trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index rose 23.20
points, or 0.66 per cent, to 3,524.49, for a gain on the week of about 72
points.
Advances led declines 383 to 281. Volume soared to 72.245m shares from
68,576,000 shares on Thursday, and trading value was CDollars 707.2m against
CDollars 630.1m.
