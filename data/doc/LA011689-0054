STUDENTS' SIT-IN AT S. AFRICA CONSULATE COULD END TODAY 
An anti-apartheid vigil by 27 junior and high school students outside the 
offices of the South African Consulate in Beverly Hills continued for a third 
day Sunday without incident. 
Beverly Hills police and security guards at the La Cienega Boulevard office 
building where the consulate is located reported no problems, but added that 
only the students' mothers, who brought food, were allowed in to see them. 
According to one mother, Phyllis Menard, the students plan to end their protest 
today with a march and rally to oppose South Africa's policy of racial 
separation and discrimination and to commemorate the birthday of slain civil 
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
