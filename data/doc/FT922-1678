FT  20 JUN 92 / Two held in Exxon kidnap case
THE FBI has arrested and charged two people with the kidnapping of Mr Sidney
Reso, the head of Exxon's international division, who disappeared from his
New Jersey home on April 29, Alan Friedman writes from New York.
But in a bizarre twist to the seven-week saga, law enforcement authorities
said last night they had not yet found Mr Reso even though they had two of
his suspected kidnappers. They said Mr Arthur Seale and his wife Mrs Irene
Seale, both from New Jersey, were being charged with kidnapping and
conspiracy to kidnap and commit extortion.
The FBI said the two had been identified as the authors of a ransom note
sent early last month claiming that Mr Reso was being held by a militant
environmental group called the Rainbow Warriors. But the FBI believed there
was actually no such group.
The bureau said Mr Seale was a security employee at Exxon, but left six
years ago. The two suspects were arrested while returning a rental car in
Hackensack, New Jersey, that the FBI said had been used in connection with
the abduction of Mr Reso.
