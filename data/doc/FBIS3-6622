Shinseito, by unidentified TOKYO SHIMBUN reporter; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
and the Japan New Party [JNP] have agreed to form a 
parliamentary group. Like this, moves toward the realignment of 
political parties have been accelerated. 
  [Hata] The enactment of the political reform law has 
provided an opportunity to create new politics. So far, we have 
argued "what ideal politics is." From now on, we should take 
action to achieve "ideal politics." For this, it is an urgent 
necessary to establish a two-party system. To tackle many 
difficult issues, (the ruling parties) need to become a unified 
force as soon as possible. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Is this basically aimed at preventing the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] from regaining power? 
  [Hata] The LDP had been in power for 38 years and this 
caused the problems we are facing now. Unless we establish a 
stable political force capable of taking the reins of government 
in place of the LDP, Japanese politics will go backward and lose 
its vitality. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Do you mean it is necessary to form a 
parliamentary group to deal with difficult problems? 
  [Hata] That is right. The government has to carry out such 
tasks as tax reform, decentralization of political power, 
deregulation, and electoral reform for the House of Councillors. 
In particular, deregulation is a difficult issue. Although the 
ruling parties agreed on deregulation measures at a 
representatives meeting, each has argued for and against the 
measures. This is not good. In this manner, we will never be 
able to carry out deregulation. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] There is an idea within the ruling parties 
of establishing a tripolar political system in which politics is 
pursued by three forces -- "the LDP," "Shinseito-Komeito 
alliance," and "the alliance of social democrats and liberals." 
What do you think of this? 
  [Hata] Under the current medium-sized constituency system, 
the ruling parties are obliged to compete with each other. I 
wonder if this will change (under a single-seat constituency 
system). The ruling parties will never cooperate in elections 
unless they run as a single party. Therefore, it is best for 
them to merge and form a new party. I intend to discuss this 
with other parties. If the ruling parties do not unite, the 
people will get confused. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Does Shinseito plan to form a parliamentary 
group with the JNP first as a step toward a large group? 
  [Hata] If I say yes, Diet business will come to a halt. We 
still do not know when the budget bill will be passed. In such 
a situation, if we discuss such matters as that this party and 
that party will be unified first, (the ruling coalition) will 
fall apart. We do not set an order to form a parliamentary 
group. All the ruling parties should merge in one parliamentary 
group at one time. It will take about five or six months to 
determine the allocation of electoral seats under a single-seat 
constituency system. Immediately after it is determined, 
political parties will begin the selection (of candidates). 
Before that, the ruling parties have to establish a 
relationship of mutual trust. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] What is Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
opinion? 
  [Hata] I gave my opinion to him and he gave his opinion to 
me. We discussed many things. He has agreed that if the ruling 
parties do not take the course (toward forming a large 
parliamentary group), it will be difficult for them to win in 
the general election conducted under a single-seat constituency 
system. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] You mean your view and the prime minister's 
are the same? 
  [Hata] Almost the same. He himself has begun to think that 
it is not easy to stabilize politics when there are so many 
political parties, and that it is necessary to consolidate (the 
ruling parties). 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN] But Sakigake [Harbinger] party is opposed to 
forming a large parliamentary group. 
  [Hata] I think Sakigake will also join in the group. We are 
serious about the idea of forming a parliamentary group. Each 
party should think what it should do to better Japanese 
politics. For example, although Shinseito and the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] once took totally different 
political stances, the two have now cooperated in tiding over 
many difficulties. If we take a lot of time to explain the idea 
to Sakigake and the SDPJ, I am sure they will understand.
