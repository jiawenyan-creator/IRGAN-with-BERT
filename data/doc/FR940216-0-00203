(D) If the limits in paragraph (g)(8)(i)(C) of this 
section are exceeded, the sources of error in the analysis 
should be determined, corrected, and all analyses subsequent 
to and including the last duplicate analysis confirmed to be 
within the compliance specifications must be repeated. The 
specification limits for the range and relative range of 
duplicate analyses are minimum performance requirements. 
The performance of individual laboratories may indeed be 
better than these minimum requirements. For this reason it 
is recommended that control charts be utilized to monitor 
the variability of measurements in order to optimally detect 
abnormal situations and ensure a stable measurement process.

 For reference purposes, a single 
laboratory study of repeatability was conducted on 
approximately 27 replicates at each of five concentrations 
for each oxygenate. The variation of MTBE analyses as 
measured by standard deviation was very linear with respect 
to concentration. Where concentration is expressed as mass 
percent, over the concentration range of 0.25 to 15.0 mass 
percent this relationship is described by the equation:

 

standard deviation=0.00784&times;C+0.0187





(2)

 The other oxygenates of interest, methanol, 
ethanol, DIPE, ETBE, and TAME, had consistent coefficients 
of variation at one mass percent and above:

(3)

 The relationship of standard deviation and 
concentration for methanol between 0.27 and 1.07 mass 
percent was very linear and is described by the equation: 



standard deviation=0.0118&times;C+0.0027





(4)

 Based on these relationships, repeatability for 
the selected oxygenates at 2.0 and 2.7 mass percent oxygen 
were determined to be as follows, where repeatability is 
defined as the half width of the 95 percent confidence 
interval (i.e., 1.96 standard deviations) for a single 
analysis at the stated concentration:
