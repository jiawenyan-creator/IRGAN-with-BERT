KCET'S 14 EMMYS LEADS LOS ANGELES AREA AWARDS 
KCET Channel 28, with strong support from a dance program, stepped ahead of the 
competition at the 42nd annual Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards presented Saturday 
by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. 
The public television station captured 14 Emmys to lead the field. It was 
boosted by "ISO Dance Theatre," which won five statuettes, including honors for 
best performers and entertainment programming. 
Other multiple winners at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium show for KCET were the 
series "Take Five: Arts and Culture" with three awards and "By the Year 2000" 
with two. 
KCBS Channel 2 and KABC Channel 7 earned 10 Emmys apiece, while KNBC took the 
prize for best regularly scheduled daily news program among its eight trophies. 
The KCBS news department accounted for six Emmys with wins in the categories of 
spot news ("San Bernardino Pipeline Explosion"), news writers and investigative 
reporting ("Gang God-fathers"), mini-documentaries ("Children Are Dying"), live 
coverage of an unscheduled news event ("Wind Storms"), and camera crew -- hard 
news breaking story ("Emergency Rooms"). 
KABC newscasts picked up five Emmys as the station tied KCBS for live coverage 
of an unscheduled news event ("Earthquake Remote -- Santa Cruz") and also won 
for instructional series ("Drugbusters"), commentary by Bill Press, film/tape 
editors of hard news programs ("Puppy Mills") and film/tape editors of news 
features ("Thrill Rides"). 
Two of four Emmys bestowed on KABC's "Eye on L.A." were for information segment 
("Guns") and special class -- program area. 
Besides the best daily newscast award, KNBC's news department won for feature 
reporting ("Mono Lake"), mini-documentaries ("Red Dawn") -- in a tie with KCBS 
-- and camera crew -- news feature ("Town 4 cSale"). "Fred Roggin's Sports Bowl 
'89" was named best sports special and his "Sunday Night Sports" segment titled 
"Morganna" was an unlikely victor in the category of sports reporting. 
On accepting his Emmy for the lighthearted feature about Morganna Roberts, the 
buxom blond notorious for kissing professional athletes, straight-faced 
producer Jeff Hoffman said, "Listen closely -- you'll be able to hear the sound 
of hell freezing over." 
Rounding out the evening's winners were KTLA with five awards, KCAL with four, 
KTTV with two and KLCS and Continental Cable with one each. 
Ted Meyers, the versatile KCAL broadcaster whose 56-year career began with 
radio station KFAC in 1944, received the prestigious Governors Award.
