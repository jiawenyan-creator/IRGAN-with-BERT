OPENING CEREMONY FOR STUDENT CENTER 
Santa Monica College will celebrate the official opening of its new student 
center Nov. 13. 
The 12,000-square-foot facility, called the Cayton Associated Students Center, 
houses student government and other offices, a computer laboratory, a lounge, 
and a reading room. 
The center, which has been in use since the beginning of the school year, is 
named for James and Lucille Cayton of Pacific Palisades, who donated $100,000 
to the $1.5-million project. The college's Associated Students gave $675,000, 
plus $175,000 for furnishings. 
The opening, which includes a ceremony honoring the Caytons, will begin at 11 
a.m. with a processional from the clock tower on campus to the new center, 
which is in the Student Activities Building, at 1900 Pico Blvd.
