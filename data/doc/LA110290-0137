BARR TO STAR IN ABC MOVIE 
ABC broadened its relationship with its highest-rated star Thursday, signing 
Roseanne Barr and her husband, Tom Arnold, to produce a TV movie, a special and 
a series for the network. 
She will star in the movie and special, but the series is not intended to 
feature her, the network said. All three will be produced by the couple's 
Barnold Productions. 
"Her success has contributed greatly to our success and we're delighted to 
extend that partnership to new creative areas in the future," ABC Entertainment 
President Robert Iger said.
