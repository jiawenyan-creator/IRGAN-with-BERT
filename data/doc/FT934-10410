FT  05 NOV 93 / Observer: Daggers drawn
Apparent confirmation as to the state of relations between Reuters and the
London Stock Exchange. For its Christmas party this year, the exchange data
group at Reuters that services UK and Irish exchanges is, for reasons best
known to itself, putting on a dinner at the Lansdowne Hotel with a murder
mystery as its theme. To get the punters psyched up, invitations have just
gone out complete with evidence bag and plastic dagger.
Imagine the panic when the missives promptly set the red lights on the
exchange's postal X-ray equipment a-blinking. Officials were not entirely
reassured when they ripped open the packages to discover that the
enclosures, though fakes, hailed from their rival trading system provider.
