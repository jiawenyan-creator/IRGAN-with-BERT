FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television
Yet again BBC1 offers its viewers a night of kick, spit and writhe as the
lads get out there on the park and do what's got to be done ..or not. Do you
believe they can beat San Marino by seven goals? Do fish wear spats? The
whole ghastly business is covered in Sportsnight Special (6.50) which takes
up 2 hrs 25 mins. Then, to make doubly sure that no BBC1 viewer goes to bed
happy, Sportsnight (10.40) spends another 70 minutes on World Cup Football.
Between the two comes the first in a five-part documentary series, States Of
Terror (9.45), each of which looks at an example of terrorism during the
past 20 years. It starts with Silke Maier-Witt, who was a member of what the
BBC calls the 'Red Army Faction', which I was taught in the 1970s should
rightly be called the Red Army Fraction. Still, nobody denies its members
set out to terrorise West German society.
One of the most original and varied series on television, Bookmark (BBC2,
8.10), offers 'a film set in the fictional world of Shena Mackay' starring
Susan Fleetwood and Harriet Walter and featuring the writer herself.
