  [Text] A series of bomb attacks damaged four bank branches 
and left 13 people injured last night. Three of the bank 
branches are located in La Victoria, near Gamarra, and the other 
is located is the San Juan de Miraflores District. 
  Terrorist criminals simultaneously detonated explosives 
devices at the bank branches last night at 2210. The branches 
are located in various points of the capital, and the explosions 
caused considerable damage. 
  Three bank offices were damaged by blasts in La Victoria 
District. A Credit Bank branch located at the intersection of 
Aviation and Uname Avenues sustained considerable structural 
damage. A few meters away, the explosion of a powerful device at 
the Wiese Bank, which is located at the intersection of Uname 
and Gamara Avenues, not only caused considerable damage but also 
left 13 people injured. Many of those injured sustained cuts 
and bruises. The injured, who were mainly pedestrians, were 
taken to the 2 de Mayo Hospital, where they are now recovering 
from their injuries. 
  The detonation also caused additional damage by breaking 
windows in buildings and shopping malls located in the vicinity. 
Work teams removed the damaged windows during the early morning 
hours. A Continental Bank branch, located near the Wiese Bank, 
also sustained considerable damage. 
  The same thing happened in the San Juan de Miraflores 
District. In this area, precisely at Vargas Machuca Avenue and a 
few meters away from a military facility, a Credit Bank branch 
also sustained damage after terrorists detonated explosive 
devices. The damage here was minor.
