  [Text] President Rafael Caldera said the stay of 
proceedings against the military personnel involved in the 4-F 
[4 February 92] and 27-N [27 November 92] events will continue 
on course as it should. 
  The president made these statements in Valencia following 
the 
ceremony for the episcopal ordination of Monsignor Reinaldo Del 
Prette Lissoi, which the president attended as the guest of 
honor. 
  [Caldera] It was a very beautiful, solemn ceremony and a 
fine 
expression of the feeling of the Venezuelan people. It was also 
a recognition of the brilliant figure of Venezuela's 
ecclesiastic youth. I am very satisfied because I think it is a 
sign of vitality, force, and faith in the Venezuela we all want. 
  [EL GLOBO] What can you tell us about the stay of 
proceedings 
against the coupists? 
  [Caldera] That will continue on course as it should. In a 
way, I am committed to the country. My conscience has committed 
me to solving this problem, which must be solved in a way that 
strengthens peace and unity in the Armed Forces and among the 
Venezuelan people. 
  [EL GLOBO] And what about the salary increase you announced? 
  [Caldera] That is being considered to see how it will be 
processed, because there are various options in the Labor Law. 
The Labor Ministry will bring it up at the next cabinet meeting. 
  [EL GLOBO] What has the governor of Carabobo State proposed 
in terms of decentralization? 
  [Caldera] It will continue in a constructive manner, because 
we want harmony between national, regional, and municipal 
authorities. 
<H5>  Support From the Governors </H5>
  Carabobo Governor Enrique Salas Romer, president of the 
Association of Governors [of Venezuela, AVG], said President 
Caldera has "the support of the AVG independent of the positions 
its members may have. We maintain our support for the person 
chosen by the people to guide the destiny of the country." 
  Salas Romer said some of the president's statements make him 
feel optimistic about Caldera's attitude toward the 
decentralization process, which "is not a goal but a reality 
based on the economic, social, educational, and political growth 
of the Venezuela that extends beyond Caracas and which also 
demands the participation of the people of Caracas."
