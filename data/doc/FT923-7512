FT  18 AUG 92 / Gorbachev urges faster reform drive
MR Mikhail Gorbachev, Russia's most famous private citizen, yesterday urged
the country's leaders to speed up reform, warning of dire consequences if
they failed in their task.
'I lagged behind events and they are doing the same today. If the leaders of
Russia and the Commonwealth do not take the initiative, then others will
seize it from them,' the former Soviet president said.
His warning struck an ominous chord only two days before the first
anniversary of the coup that hastened the disintegration of the Soviet
Union.
Although Mr Gorbachev thought that only an 'idiot or a crazy man' would
attempt another coup, he warned of a more gradual and sinister coalescence
of anti-democratic forces, threatening dictatorship or some form of
neo-Bolshevism.
