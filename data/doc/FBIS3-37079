  [Text] London February 12 TASS -- General principles for 
cooperation between the two countries are now being established. 
They found their manifestation in the signed declaration on 
basic principles for inter-state relations and in a number of 
other agreements, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan of Armenia told 
ITAR-TASS, summing up the results of his first official visit to 
Britain. 
  The Armenian president described it as very important that 
during the talks with Prime Minister John Major he received 
assurances about future support for Armenia in international 
financial organisations. 
  Problems concerning a settlement of the Karabakh conflict 
and 
Britain's relations with Azerbaijan were discussed during the 
meetings. London is interested in Azerbaijani oil. Therefore, 
one of the aims of the visit was to secure that this economic 
aspect of the problem has no negative political consequences for 
Armenia and that the British Government pursues a balanced 
policy promoting the establishment of peace, Ter-Petrosyan 
emphasised. Such promises were received. Moreover, Britain 
intends to make more active efforts in the Nagorno-Karabakh 
peace process in the near future, he added. 
  In this connection, British representatives were provided 
with detailed information about actions being undertaken within 
the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and about Russia's proposals aimed at solving the 
Karabakh problem. 
  The Armenian president confirmed that Armenia and 
Nagorno-Karabakh supported the International Olympic Committee's 
proposal to declare an "Olympic truce" in the area of 
Azerbaijan-Karabakh confrontation for the period of the 1994 
Winter Olympics without any pre-conditions.
