Value Engineering 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA proposes to issue a regulation on value engineering (VE) that would require its application to selected Federal-aid
highway projects, when funded under the FHWA's grant-in-aid process. The proposed regulation would require State
highway agencies (SHA) to establish and administer VE programs; it outlines minimum VE program requirements and
provides guidance in establishing, administering, and monitoring a VE program. This proposed regulation is considered
necessary to implement 23 U.S.C. 106(d), which provides that, in such cases as the Secretary deems advisable, the
Secretary may require a value engineering or other cost reduction analysis of plans, specifications, and estimates
for proposed projects on any Federal-aid highway.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FHWA recognizes VE as an effective and proven technique for reducing cost, increasing productivity, and improving
quality when applied in the development of highway projects. This document solicits public comments regarding the
VE requirements being considered by the FHWA. 


In 1991, the Congress required the FHWA to study its VE program. Section 1091 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act of 1991, Public Law 102240, 105 Stat. 1914 (Dec 18, 1991), required the Secretary of Transportation
to ``study the effectiveness and benefits of value engineering review programs applied to Federal-aid highway projects,''
and to ``report to Congress on the results of the study *** including recommendations on how value
engineering could be utilized and improved in Federal-aid highway projects.'' 
The FHWA's evaluation of the effectiveness of its VE program, as described in a report submitted to Congress in June
1993,

 concluded that the application of VE in the development of highway projects has the potential to result in substantial
cost savings without adversely affecting any of the highway projects' design, aesthetics, or construction standards
while assuring that environmental and ecological goals are maintained. During the study made to prepare this report,
the FHWA examined VE data covering fiscal year (FY) 1988 to FY 1991 and found that only a limited number of States had
active and effective VE programs.

``Value Engineering on Federal-aid Projects,'' a report to Congress by the Secretary of Transportation is available
for inspection and copying as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7 appendix D. A copy is in the file for FHWA Docket No. 9412.

</FOOTNOTE>


The study found that FHWA's policy of the past 20 years of promoting VE through education, encouragement, and technical
assistance has had limited success in persuading all States to implement VE programs on a continuing basis. This finding
is despite overwhelming evidence that VE can be a very effective way to improve projects and control costs from States
with active VE programs. The FHWA has, therefore, concluded that in order to improve the effectiveness of the VE program
nationwide, all States need to 
have active VE programs. As a result, the FHWA proposes to require the use of VE in all States on selected Federal-aid
highway projects.
