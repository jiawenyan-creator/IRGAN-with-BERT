 

Section 35.50Possession, Use, Calibration, and Checks of Dose Calibrators



There is an editorial change in this section. The phrase in the proposed rule ``over the range of its use between 

XXX

 and 

XXX

'' has been replaced by ``over a range from 

XXX

 to 

XXX

.'' 



Section 35.900Radiation Safety Officer



Two additional board certifications have been recognized in this section of the final rule. 

During the public comment period, the Commission became aware of the need to recognize certifications by the American
Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine (AOBNM) and the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR). A letter dated
August 16, 1990, from Richard E. Cunningham (Director, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NRC),
to Paul J. Chase (Chairman, AOBR and Vice President, AOBNM), stated that the NRC intended to include certifications
of (1) AOBR in 35.900, and (2) AOBNM in 35.900, 35.910, and 35.920 in the next amendment to 10 CFR
Part 35. Therefore, the certifications by AOBR and AOBNM have been added to this section of the final rule. 



Section 35.910Training for Uptake, Dilution, and Excretion Studies

Section 35.920Training for Imaging and Localization Studies



One additional board certification has been recognized in both sections of the final rule. 

As discussed in the previous section, the Commission became aware of the need to recognize certification by AOBNM.
Therefore, the certification by AOBNM has been added to both sections of the final rule. 



Section 35.930Training for Therapeutic Use of Unsealed Byproduct Material



Two additional board certifications have been recognized in this section of the final rule. 

A comment stated that certification by the American Osteopathic Board of Radiology (AOBR) should be recognized in
all applicable sections of 10 CFR Part 35. Under the existing regulations, the Commission has recognized AOBR certification
in 35.910, 35,920, 35.940, 35.950, and 35.960. 

Following receipt of this comment, the Commission requested additional information from AOBR concerning training
and certification criteria for therapeutic use of unsealed byproduct material. After reviewing supporting documents
provided by the American Osteopathic College of Radiology (AOCR), the Commission has determined that AOBR certification
is equivalent to certification by the American Board of Radiology (ABR). Therefore, recognition of certification
by AOBR has been added in 35.930 of this final rule for certification granted after 1984 because all candidates
certified by AOBR since 1984 will meet the NRC's training requirements. 

During the public comment period, the Commission also became aware of the need to recognize in 35.930 certification
by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. This is in addition to the recognition reflected in 35.900,
35.910, and 35.920 of the proposed rule. A letter dated June 3, 1992, from John E. Glenn (Chief, Medical, Academic and
Commercial Use Safety Branch, Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety, NRC), to Gilles D. Hurteau of the
Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, stated that certification by the latter is acceptable for approval,
among other things, as an authorized user in 35.300. Therefore, certification by the Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Canada has been added to this section of the final rule. 



Section 35.981Training for Experienced Nuclear Pharmacists



This section was not included in the proposed rule, but has been added to the final rule in response to numerous comments.
This section has been patterned after the provisions in 10 CFR Part 32 for ``grandfathering'' an ``authorized user.''


To ``grandfather'' an experienced nuclear pharmacist, the licensee needs to apply for a license amendment identifying
that individual as an authorized nuclear pharmacist. The licensee must receive the license amendment before allowing
that individual to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist. 

A licensee seeking to ``grandfather'' a nuclear pharmacist must ensure that the individual has completed a structured
educational program as specified in 35.980(b)(1) on or before (the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

) and is currently working as a nuclear pharmacist. However, the individual does not need a preceptor statement (35.980(b)(2))
and the individual's training, specified above, does not need to be within 7 years preceding the date of application
(35.972).
