Grades 


51.2925 

U.S. No. 1. 


``U.S. No. 1'' shall consist of apricots of one variety which are mature but not soft, overripe, or shriveled and which
are well formed, free from decay, worm holes and from damage caused by limbrubs, russeting, growth cracks, dirt, scab,
scale, hail, bruises, disease, insects, skin breaks, stem pulls, or mechanical or other means. For tolerances see
51.2928. 


51.2926

bruises, disease, insects, skin breaks, stem pulls or mechanical or other means. For tolerances see 51.2928.



Marking and Packing Requirements 


51.2927 

Marking and packing requirements. 


The minimum size or numerical count of the apricots in any package shall be plainly labeled, stenciled, or otherwise
marked on the package. 
(a) 

Numerical count. 

When the numerical count is used the fruit in any sample shall not vary more than one-fourth inch in diameter. See 51.2928
(b) Size for tolerances. 
(b) 

Minimum size.

 ``Minimum size'' refers to the diameter of the smallest apricot in the package. It shall be stated in terms of whole
and eighth inches, as 11/2 inches min., 15/8 inches min., etc., in accordance with the facts. 


Tolerances 


51.2928 

Tolerances. 


In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling the following tolerances are provided as
specified: 
(a)

be allowed for decay. 
(2) 

U.S. No. 2 grade.

of this amount, or 1 percent shall be allowed for decay. 
(b) 

Size.

 (1) If packages are marked with numerical count: Not more than 10 percent of the samples in a lot may fail the one-quarter
inch variation requirement designated in 51.2927 paragraph (a). 
(2) If packages are marked with minimum size: Not more than 10 percent, by count, of the apricots in any sample may be
below the minimum size specified. 


Application of Tolerances 


51.2929 

Application of tolerances. 


Individual samples are subject to the following limitations: Provided, that the averages for the entire lot are within
the tolerances specified for the grade. 
(a) For a tolerance of 10 percent or more; individual samples in any lot may contain not more than one and one-half times
the tolerance specified. 
(b) For a tolerance of less than 10 percent, individual samples in any lot may contain not more than double the tolerance
specified.
