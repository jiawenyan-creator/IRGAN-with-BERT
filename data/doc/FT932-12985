FT  26 APR 93 / MP hits out over coal white paper
MR Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee has
accused the government of subverting the authority of parliament in its
handling of the coal crisis. He made the charge because of the way MPs were
denied the opportunity to vote on his committee's report on the crisis. The
government's coal white paper, published last month, largely passed over the
committee's detailed recommendations.
