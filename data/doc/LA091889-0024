MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . . 
Three Los Angeles stations picked up honors as the National Assn. of 
Broadcasters presented its first Marconi Radio Awards at the convention. Named 
as stations of the year for their formats were KPWR-FM (contemporary hit 
radio-top 40), KTWV-FM (jazz-new age) and KMPC-AM (big-band nostalgia). 
Chicago's WLS-AM was selected "Legendary Station" and ABC news commentator Paul 
Harvey won the personality of the year award in the network-syndication 
category. The Marconi awards are to be made annually. ALEENE MacMINN
