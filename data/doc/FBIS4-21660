  [Text] Bryansk -- For many years a strictly guarded 
facility existed in the rayon center of Pochep in Bryansk 
Oblast. Nobody there apart from the oblast party committee 
first secretary knew what was behind the barbed wire. Now the 
shroud of secrecy has been lifted and the residents of Pochep 
have found out that chemical weapons are being stored nearby. 
  But it was another discovery that particularly bothered 
them: 
It is planned to build a facility here to destroy the said 
weapons. 
  Local residents posed the reasonable question: "Surely 
Bryansk Oblast, which was contaminated by radiation from 
Chernobyl, should not also become an area for destroying 
chemical weapons?" Signatures are being collected in opposition 
to the plant's construction.
