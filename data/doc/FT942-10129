FT  12 MAY 94 / Record number of pupils stays on
Only 7 per cent of UK 16-year-olds went into full-time employment last year,
the lowest figure ever, a report from county council careers services shows
today.
Instead the survey of school-leavers' destinations by the heads of the
careers services shows that a record 68 per cent chose to stay in education
full-time. Further education is increasingly chosen instead of training
schemes.
Just 12 per cent entered Youth Training schemes using training credits,
while 3 per cent chose employment which involved some planned training
outside the YT scheme. In 1989, 21 per cent of 16-year-olds used training
credits, but the scheme's popularity has fallen every year since.
The total unemployed was 6 per cent, down from 9 per cent in 1992, although
this was helped by a 3.9 per cent fall in the relevant age group.
The careers services also note a 'slight but worrying' increase in the
percentage of children whose position is not known, which now stands at 6
per cent. Many may be unemployed, and not involved in training or education.
Careers heads also voice concerns over regional variations, with the
northern region - including Cleveland, Durham, and the Tyne and Wear
metropolitan authorities - having the lowest take-up of further education at
56 per cent.
Other wide regional differences include north-west London having the highest
staying-on rate - 86 per cent of 16-year-olds in Harrow were staying on
followed by 85 per cent in Barnet. Southwark in south London had the highest
unemployment (21 per cent) while Knowsley on Merseyside had the lowest
staying-on rate, at only 46 per cent.
