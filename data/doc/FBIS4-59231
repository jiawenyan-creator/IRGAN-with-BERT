  [Text] Baghdad, 10 May (INA)--The newspaper BABIL stresses 
that the United States and Saudi Arabia are nurturing the 
secessionist trends to fragment Yemen's unity because of the 
honorable position its government and people took in support of 
Iraq during the great Mother of Battles. 
  In an editorial today, the paper says: The Arab nation's 
enemies want to intimidate the Arab masses with the bloody 
fighting in Yemen in a desperate attempt to bury the dreams of 
unity and the Arabs' aspiration to achieve their comprehensive 
unity. 
  BABIL concludes by saying: The unity which the Yemenis have 
built with their blood and sweat is invulnerable to 
fragmentation. That unity will remain the cure for the wounds of 
sabotage and treachery. 
  The paper stresses that unity and unionists will always 
triumph.
