FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: AMD computer launch intensifies
battle with Intel
THE MARKETING battle between Silicon Valley semiconductor rivals, Advanced
Micro Devices and Intel, intensified yesterday when AMD announced plans to
launch its own version of Intel's 486 microprocessor, the device used to
power most high-performance personal computers, writes Louise Kehoe.
Although AMD said volume deliveries of its 486 would not begin until the
fourth quarter, slightly later than analysts had expected, the announcement
represents a significant challenge to Intel, which dominates the
microprocessor market.
AMD's 486 plans follow the introduction last year of its version of Intel's
386. AMD claims to have won a 30 per cent share of the 386 market, with 1991
sales of over a Dollars 1bn.
However, Intel is fighting back. Earlier this month the company unveiled
aggressive plans to introduce a barrage of 30 new versions of its
microprocessors this year, including some designed for portable computers
and others that lift the performance of existing products. In addition,
Intel said it would launch its next generation microprocessor, code-named
the P5, this year. The new chip will offer performance of 100 Mips (millions
of instructions per second).
The P5 will bring features such as fault tolerance to desktop computers.
These were previously found only in mainframe computers, Intel said.
Intel slashed the prices of its existing 386 products in December,
intensifying competitive pressure upon AMD. Intel aims to lead an industry
shift to its 486 chips before AMD can gain a foothold in the high end of the
microprocessor market.
AMD said that it would offer two new versions of the 386, including a
version that will rival the performance of Intel's current 486 product.
