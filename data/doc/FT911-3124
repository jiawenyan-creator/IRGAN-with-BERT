FT  26 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Tories mount attack on 'Napoleon' -
Europe
THE Conservative-dominated Bruges Group, which opposes a Federal Europe,
yesterday sprang from recent internal rows over its criticism of Mr John
Major to publish a highly personal attack on Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission.
Mr Delors was likened to Napoleon and accused of having 'exceeded and
perverted' his responsibilities, by Mr Russell Lewis, a leader writer on the
Daily Mail and author of the pamphlet. The EC president had undermined the
spirit of the Treaty of Rome with his 'Brussels bureaucrats' narrow,
interventionist, mercantilist approach.'
The pamphlet reflects the group's determination to counter any who favour
moving towards a federal Europe. For many of the group's supporters, Mr
Delors is a favourite target.
It says that to some Mr Delors is an 'European idealist' but 'he can also be
plausibly regarded as a French nationalist who hopes, though by drearier
means, to fulfil the dreams of Louis XIV, Napoleon or de Gaulle and turn the
new Europe into a greater France.
If the Liberal Democrats hold a balance of power after the next election,
they would insist that any agreement with one of the major parties - which
would encompass a commitment to legislate a change to the electoral system -
should be formal and last for a parliament lasting at least four years, Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader said yesterday.
