<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cabinet Decision To Lower Taxes and </F>
Social Security Charges Gets Positive Reception"] 
  [Excerpt] The cabinet decision to lower taxes and social 
security contributions on citizens and companies by a total five 
billion guilders in 1994 and 1995 has been received positively 
from all sides. Only the opposition in Parliament has 
criticized the way in which the tax reduction is to be financed. 
  In part, the measures will be paid for by the 
higher-than-forecasted fiscal income received by the cabinet 
last year. In addition, the cabinet is assuming that next year 
income will be positive due to the higher growth forecast made 
by the CPB [Central Planning Bureau] for 1995. According to the 
initial CPB estimate, which does not take the tax reduction into 
account, next year growth will be 2.5 percent compared with 
slightly less than 1 percent this year. 
  The cabinet decision is a compromise between the wishes of 
the governing parties. The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] 
wanted most of the money to go to employers, while the PvdA 
[Labor Party] preferred lowering personal taxation. Both 
parties can live happily with the compromise. A CDA spokesman 
described the cabinet decision as a "respectable package, a very 
defendable mix." The PvdA said it was "happy with its main 
points." 
  The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 
criticized 
this method of finance. VVD spokesman Korte said the cabinet 
was selling something it did not have by spending money now, 
while it was far from certain whether the revenue would appear 
next year. D66 [Democrats 66] also thought the cabinet was 
moving too fast. D66 spokesman Ybema said only a new cabinet 
could make such a decision. Despite these criticisms, both 
parties supported the tax reduction option. 
  In a commentary on the cabinet decision, Prime Minister 
Lubbers said the tax reduction was entirely in line with the 
SER's [Social Economic Council] recommendations on mid-term 
economic policy. 
  In the draft recommendations, the SER calls for taxes and 
social security contributions to be lowered by some 15 billion 
guilders in the next four years. This is intended to boost 
employment. Lubbers estimated that the cabinet decision would 
lead to the creation of some tens of thousands of extra jobs. 
  The reduced taxation is not only good for employment, but 
will also have a positive effect on all incomes, including those 
of people on social security. Finance Minister Kok, the PvdA's 
leading candidate, said this would probably allow the linkage 
between wages and social security to be reestablished in 1995. 
  On Sunday [20 February] Kok called on employers and trade 
unions to make a "social pact" with the cabinet for the coming 
years to increase employment. The cabinet decision means that 
wage increases could remain limited in 1995, according to 
Lubbers. [passage omitted]
