FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Eurocopy up to Pounds 1.22m aided by
cost-cutting
COST-CUTTING helped Eurocopy, the office equipment distributor which last
year underwent an enquiry by the Office of Fair Trading, improve interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 721,000 to Pounds 1.22m.
Turnover for the six months to end-March fell to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 18.4m)
as recession continued and the company stopped discounting to achieve sales.
Mr Michael Armitage, finance director, said: 'We feel we are at sufficient
distance from the horrible events of last year that we can resume our policy
of seeking out quality business at fair prices.' The OFT decided not to
revoke the company's licences following assurances about some of its
business practices.
Eurocopy said demand for photocopying equipment remained 'extremely weak';
there had also been a further 6 per cent fall in usage.
Service revenue accounted for Pounds 9m (Pounds 10.3m) of turnover, machine
sales halved to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 6.6m).
The group spent Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.4m) releasing customers from contracts
where it had found evidence of bad practice, out of a Pounds 10.5m provision
made last year.
Eurocopy was continuing its Pounds 7m legal action against Sketchley,
relating to the 1989 purchase of photocopier dealer Equipu.
The interim dividend is 0.5p (1.1p) as the policy resumed of paying a third
at the half year and two thirds at the year end.
Earnings were 1.68p (1p).
