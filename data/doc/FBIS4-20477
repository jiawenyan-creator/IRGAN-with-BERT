<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Fe/C/Si ultrafine particles (UFPs) are synthesized by laser 
induced vapor-phase reaction with a 150-W CW CO[.sub]2[/] 
laser using Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/], SiH[.sub]4[/] and 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]4[/] as raw materials. Instantaneous 
temperature of the reaction flame is measured by a SCIT 
[Scientific, Inc.] infrared thermometer and its dependence upon 
parameters such as laser power density, reaction pressure and 
gas ratio is determined. The Fe and Si content in the product is 
analyzed by the EDTA volumetric method and potassium 
fluorosilicate method. This ultrafine particle is fully 
characterized by X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction, 
transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and 
laser fluorescence spectroscopy. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Laser induced vapor-phase synthesis is a highly advanced 
technique for preparing UFPs. It has been used to prepare a 
number of UFPs[.sup]1,2[/] that cannot be fabricated via 
conventional chemical techniques. Because of advantages such as 
small particle size, narrow particle distribution, controllable 
composition and large specific surface area, the study of UFPs 
prepared by laser induced vapor-phase synthesis in catalysis has 
become an important branch in UFP applications. The Fe series of 
UFPs is the original catalyst that attracted a great deal of 
attention. Laser induced Fe-based UFPs were found to be 
extremely selective in F-T synthesis.[.sup]3[/] Fe and Fe/C 
UFPs have been prepared using a 10.6-m CW CO[.sub]2[/] 
laser as a light source for thermal 
decomposition.[.sup]4,5[/] The influence of various 
parameters on the synthesis of Fe/C/Si UFPs is discussed in 
detail in this paper. The reaction mechanism is also explored. 
Furthermore, the behavior of Fe/C/Si UFPs is characterized. 
<H5>  2. Experimental Method </H5>
  Laser-induced UFPs are prepared using a reaction apparatus 
and based on principles similar to those employed by an MIT 
group.[.sup]1[/] An improved experimental system is described 
in detail in a previous paper.[.sup]5[/] In this work, a 
150-W CW CO[.sub]2[/] laser is the light source. The raw 
materials used include liquid Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/], high-purity 
SiH[.sub]4[/] and C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]4[/] gas and 
high-purity N[.sub]2[/] and Ar as the carrier gases. All 
reactive gases and carrier gases are individually controlled 
with a mass flow regulator. The pressure in the reaction zone is 
stable and adjustable. 
  Pre-mixed reaction gas comes out of a 2-mm-diameter nozzle. 
Reaction takes place after the gas stream meets a focused laser 
beam perpendicularly. The reaction flame is stable and conically 
shaped. Its temperature is measured with a SCIT infrared 
thermometer having a range of 600-2000C. A 5-mW He-Ne laser 
may be used to monitor the formation of these UFPs. The UFPs 
produced are carried by the carrier gas into the collector. They 
are removed from the collector and treated under an inert gas 
atmosphere and then characterized. In this experiment, Fe/C/Si 
UFPs are produced at a rate of approximately 2-3 g/h. 
<H5>  3. Results and Discussion </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Characterization of Fe/C/Si UFPs </H5>
  Table 1 shows the reaction conditions and experimental 
results in the preparation of Fe/C/Si UFPs. For comparison, 
FSC-107, FSC-111 and FSC-112 are UFPs of Fe/Si, Fe/C and C/Si, 
respectively. Various analytical methods are employed to 
characterize the UFPs, including conventional chemical analysis, 
XRD (X-ray diffraction), TEM (transmission electron microscopy), 
and IRS (infrared spectroscopy).

  Conventional chemical analysis is primarily used to 
determine 
the Fe and Si content in the UFPs. In this work, the EDTA 
volumetric method and potassium fluorosilicate method are used 
to analyze the Fe and Si content, with results shown in Table 1. 
It is worthwhile noting that a number of unexpected problems may 
be encountered in using conventional methods to assay UFPs due 
to their unique properties. Hence, some correction may be 
required. To verify our analytical results, the Fe and Si 
contents of specimen FSC-105 are determined by atomic absorption 
and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that our method 
is valid. In addition, the specimen is also examined by atomic 
emission spectroscopy. It is found that besides Fe and Si as 
major constituents, the specimen's Ca and Mg contents are below 
one ten-thousandth. There are no other metallic elements 
present. Oxygen analysis is not done on all samples. However, 
total carbon analysis is done on specimens FSC-105, FSC-111 and 
FSC-112. By way of calculating the percentages for Fe, C and Si, 
the analysis indicates the presence of a small amount of oxygen. 
We believe that oxygen, as an impurity, exists as 
H[.sub]2[/]O, SiO[.sub]2[/] and 
Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. In the IR spectra, in addition to 
Fe-Si and Si-C absorption bands, H[.sub]2[/]O and 
SiO[.sub]2[/] bands are also found (see Figure 1). A 
comparison to the IR spectra of binary specimens shows the 
presence of at least one Fe-Si compound and SiC in the Fe/C/Si 
UFP.

  XRD analysis is chosen to determine the crystalline 
structure 
of the specimen. In all tertiary Fe/C/Si UFP specimens, 
Fe[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/] is found to be the principal 
crystal. SiC, _a_-Fe, Fe[.sub]3[/]C and FeSi[.sub]2[/] 
begin to emerge after varying the reaction conditions. Figure 2 
shows the XRD patterns of FSC-101, FSC-103 and FSC-105, where 
the 2_th_ diffraction angles of 52.0, 58.0 and 
59.3 and face distances of 0.221 nm, 0.1997 nm and 0.196 nm 
are characteristics of Fe[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/]; 2_th_ 
diffraction angles of 45.2 and 78.0 and face distances 
of 0.253 nm and 0.153 nm are characteristics of _a_-SiC; and 
the 
2_th_ diffraction angles of 55.4 and 57.1 and face 
distances of 0.208 nm and 0.202 nm are characteristics of 
Fe[.sub]3[/]C and _a_-Fe, respectively. the low and wide 
diffraction peaks are due to the small crystal dimensions. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-006-05B>      Figure 2. XRD Patterns of Fe/C/Si Particle </FIG>

  The presence of Fe[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/] can also be 
determined by electron diffraction. A diffraction ring 
corresponding to SiC is also apparent. Figure 3 [photograph not 
reproduced] shows the electron diffraction pattern of specimen 
FSC-103. It agrees with the XRD result. TEM is employed to 
observe the UFPs. Figure 4 [photograph not reproduced] is a TEM 
picture of specimen FSC-103. The particles are close to 
spherical and they are linked together in the form of a chain. 
The average particle diameter is 25 nm and the UFP has a narrow 
particle-volume distribution. Over the entire range of 
experimental conditions, the average diameter is 7-35 nm. In 
specimen FSC-OA (obtained under conditions such as 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]4[/] : SiH[.sub]4[/] = 5 : 2, 
Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/] : 14C; pressure 70 kPa), small crystals 
of the order of 1 nm in diameter are found in such particles 
under TEM [see Figure 5 photograph, not reproduced]. The effect 
of experimental parameters on UFP diameter will be discussed in 
a separate paper. 
  In addition, a Digisorb 2500 specific surface-area analyzer 
is used to measure the specific surface area of specimen 
FSC-111, which is 195.3 m[.sup]2[/]/g. The absorption 
isotherm of the UFP is the classical S type (type II), which is 
often seen in non-porous materials.[.sup]6[/] Hence, most of 
the particles produced by laser induced vapor-phase synthesis 
are non-porous. 
<H5>  3.2 Reaction Temperature as a Function of Experimental </H5>
Parameters 
  Table 1 shows reaction flame temperature as a function of 
different experimental conditions. A series of experiments was 
also designed to study reaction temperature as a function of 
pressure. In this series of experiments, with the exception of 
pressure, other parameters remain the same as those for specimen 
FSC-105. It is found that the reaction flame temperature rises 
with increasing pressure and SiH[.sub]4[/] flow rate (see 
Figure 6). This is because an increase in reaction pressure is 
equivalent to an increase in the concentration of the reactant. 
Consequently, more laser light is absorbed. SiH[.sub]4[/] is 
a good absorber for the laser. An increase in its flow rate also 
increases the absorption of laser energy. Hence, the reaction 
temperature also rises. The preparation of FSC-104, FSC-105 and 
FSC-106 happens to prove this point (see Table 1). In addition, 
parameters such as laser power density, reaction-zone light spot 
size, and ratio of reactant gas to carrier gas also affect the 
reaction temperature. In this work, laser power density is 
regulated by varying the spot size in the reaction zone at a 
stable laser power level. Therefore, the effect of laser power 
density and spot size on the reaction temperature cannot be 
discussed separately. In conclusion, several parameters will 
affect the reaction flame temperature in the preparation of UFPs 
by laser. This temperature has a direct impact on the property 
of the UFPs. Therefore, it is critical to study the relation 
between these experimental parameters and the characteristics of 
the UFPs in detail.

<H5>  3.3 Reaction Mechanism </H5>
  In a laser chemical reaction, the most basic condition is 
that the reactant must be able to directly or indirectly absorb 
the laser energy. In the preparation of Fe/C/Si UFPs, 
SiH[.sub]4[/] can be excited by intensely absorbing the 
10.6-m photons emitted by the CO[.sub]2[/] laser. 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]4[/] molecules can also absorb such 
photons. Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/], however, cannot directly absorb 
this laser energy. On the basis of the composition of the 
product and the above discussion, we believe the reaction 
mechanism is fairly complex and can be expressed in the 
following steps. 
  3.3.1 Energy absorption 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;

  3.3.2 Energy transfer 
  SiH[.sub]4[/]* + Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/] 
Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/]* + SiH[.sub]4[/] 
  C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]4[/]* + Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/] 
Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/]* + C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]4[/] 
  SiH[.sub]4[/]* + C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]4[/] 
C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]2[/]* + SiH[.sub]4[/] 
  3.3.3 Reactions 
  Fe(CO)[.sub]5[/]* Fe* + 5CO 
  SiH[.sub]4[/]* Si* + 2H[.sub]2[/] 
  C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]4[/]* 2C* + 2H[.sub]2[/] 
  Fe* + C* Fe/C 
  Fe* + Si* Fe/Si 
  Si* + C* SiC 
  Fe* + Si* + C* Fe/C/Si 
  3.3.4 Deactivation 
  Fe* + M Fe + M 
  Si* + M Si + M 
  C* + M C + M 
  Therefore, the composition of the Fe/C/Si UFPs is very 
complicated. It may include Fe, Si and C individually, or binary 
compounds of Fe/C, Fe/Si and Si/C, or tertiary compounds of 
Fe/C/Si. Instead, we use Fe/C/Si to represent these compounds 
collectively.
