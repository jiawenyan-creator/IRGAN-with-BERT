<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin </F>
by Gildo Campesato in Rome; date not given: "`Italy Should 
Invest Immediately in Russia'"] 
  [Text] "Our real deficit is time. I have come to Rome to 
sound the alarm bell and shake things up a little." During the 
first two days of his visit to Italy, Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin spent almost three hours in a meeting with 
ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] President Luigi Meanti 
and Managing Director Franco Bernabe. First, a meeting with the 
top management, then a more personal lunch to talk over a shrimp 
cocktail and a fruit cake about specific business plans such as 
the upgrading of petrochemical plants and the 3.5-trillion-lire 
gas pipeline project signed with ENI last December. "It is the 
contract of the century," was the convinced comment of 
Chernomyrdin, who knows a thing or two about gas since he was 
director of the sector in Russia for years. Moreover, ENI is 
like home for him because his son studied at the AGIP [Italian 
National Oil Company] management school in San Donato Milanese. 
  [Campesato] Your visit to ENI is not just a courtesy call 
then? 
  [Chernomyrdin] No, even if I know this company very well. 
We talked about the company's projects in Russia and in 
particular about its participation in the development of the 
offshore oil field in the Barents sea. And I also came to wake 
it up a bit. We can work together with ENI in the 
petrochemical, chemical, and refinery sectors as well as in the 
oil sector. And then in other sectors not directly linked to 
oil, such as the sector of industry for agriculture. There are 
great opportunities for investments by major foreign companies 
in Russia, but we must not waste time, we must begin to work 
aggressively. I would like ENI to develop wide-ranging projects. 
  [Campesato] There is a problem of returns on investments. 
  [Chernomyrdin] I do not rule out cooperation in other 
sectors, but the more immediate and best returns are those from 
large-scale projects in the fields of energy and raw materials. 
  [Campesato] In the West there have been fears about Russia's 
capacity to export energy products. 
  [Chernomyrdin] There are no problems of any kind. Moreover, 
Italy will draw an extra 6 billion cubic meters of gas under the 
recently-stipulated contract. But this does not refer to the 
supply of methane only. The contract is very important because 
it provides for the introduction of new technologies, remote 
measuring and control systems, new turbocompressor groups. This 
means a great deal of cooperation between Italy and Russia in 
the future. 
  [Campesato] Italian companies had demonstrated their 
interest in the upgrading of Soviet electric power plants. Have 
these projects been abandoned? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Not at all. In the future we will tend to 
increase our cooperation with multinational groups in the energy 
sector. For example using gas power plants for the production 
of electricity. And then perhaps looking at the exploitation 
and combined use of electronuclear power plants. 
  [Campesato] There is a more general problem however: 
creating 
conditions that will encourage Western investments. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Our fundamental objective is to limit 
inflation and stabilize the financial system. We can do it: 
What we realy lack is time. 
  [Campesato] But some fear that the reforms could be stopped. 
  [Chernomyrdin] We are focusing on speeding up reforms as 
planned and streamlining privatization. But as you can 
understand, these issues are not easy to resolve. 
  [Campesato] Reforms are not implemented by fine talk. 
  [Chernomyrdin] There is a Russian proverb that says: "You 
can say halva, halva, halva, but your mouth will not become 
sweeter." We will try to extract more, refine more, drill deeper 
in order to earn more and develop other sectors. And this will 
be done in cooperation with Western companies. Our philosophy 
is this: Invest, spend, have a return to reinvest. Otherwise 
you are right, fine talk does not lead to reforms. 
  [Campesato] The reform toward a market economy has created 
several problems such as unemployment. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Official statistics show that there are 
900,000 unemployed. In a country with a population of 150 
million that is nothing. 
  [Campesato] Those are the statistics. But in reality.... 
  [Chernomyrdin] In reality, unemployment is a problem of 
great concern to us. Because if we really began to speed up the 
rate of reforms in order to achieve results as soon as possible, 
we would have to contend with a number of companies going 
bankrupt. And at that point unemployment would become an even 
more serious problem. 
  [Campesato] And then? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Then we could pass a law on bankruptcy. But 
if it is to work properly, we must also adopt measures to get 
companies back on their feet. We must create the conditions so 
that privatized companies can generate profits, on completely 
new foundations. It will be an enormous effort because of these 
complicated issues that are so closely intertwined.
