  [Text] According to reports received by your PRAVDA 
correspondent from a high-ranking officer at the CIS military 
staff, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is expected to be removed 
from office in the current government reshuffle. At first 
sight, this move appears unlikely given Boris Yeltsin's 
particularly confidential relationship with Pavel Grachev, whose 
45th birthday the president celebrated with him in person. 
According to the source, however, the main reason for the 
expected ouster is the need, which has become overdue, to get 
rid of a person responsible in large measure for the 4 October 
bloodbath. In particular, the top brass has long been demanding 
that from the president. It should be added that yesterday 
Pavel Grachev was released from a hospital where he was treated 
for the exacerbation of heart disease. The Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry's press service, where we turned to for 
explanation, was concerned by Viktor Chernomyrdin's not 
mentioning the Defense Ministry chief in his news conference. 
  According to information from our confidential source, the 
Defense Ministry may for the first time be headed by a civilian, 
current Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, doctor of 
sciences, responsible for matters related to state-of-the-art 
military hardware and weaponry.
