 

E. Impact of the Revised Hospital Wage Index 



Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that the wage index be updated annually beginning October 1, 1993. In addition,
this section requires that updates to the hospital wage index be budget neutral. The FY 1995 wage index will represent
the second annual update to the wage data. We will use the wage data from the FY 1991 Medicare cost report to calculate
the updated wage index. For FY 1995, the wage index will continue to include salaries, fringe benefits, home office
salaries, and certain contract labor salaries. In the past, updates to the wage data have resulted in significant
payment shifts among hospitals. Since the wage index is now updated annually and there are no changes to the types of
costs included in the wage index data, we expect these payment fluctuations will be minimized. Based on the proposed
wage index calculation (after reclassifications under sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act), there
is a significant drop, compared with previous years, in the number of labor markets that experience major increases
or decreases in wage index values. We reviewed the data for any area that experienced a wage index change of 10 percent
or more to determine the reason for the fluctuation. When necessary, we contacted the intermediaries to determine
the validity of the data, or to obtain an explanation for the change. Our review indicated that most of the significant
changes were attributable to improved reporting by hospitals. 

The following chart compares the shifts in wage index values (after reclassifications) for labor markets for FY 1995
with those experienced as a result of last year's wage index update.
