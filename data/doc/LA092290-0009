NATIONALISTIC DREAMS OF UNITY IN MIDDLE EAST 
It is a sad day when one opens the Opinion section and reads a supposedly 
scholarly article that lacks any historical or political reality, presented as 
the leading article. I refer to "Grand Delusions." 
It endeavors to represent that the Arabs have been pursuing an unfulfilled 
dream to unite the Arab nations, which share a common history and language. 
Four "Arab" leaders (among them Khomeini who was an Iranian and thus a 
non-Arab) are introduced. The four pursued the dream of uniting "Arab" nations, 
including Iran, a non-Arab nation. 
The Times has accomplished in a single day what 2,500 years of history has 
failed to do, i.e., the destruction of Iranians' separate and distinct 
identity, history and language.
