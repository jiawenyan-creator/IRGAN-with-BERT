  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President 
Clinton held a telephone conversation only through an 
interpreter from the U.S. side in the early morning of 4 March 
because a Japanese interpreter from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs [MOFA] was unable to be present at the conversation due 
to the U.S. failure to give advance notice. This has been 
revealed by officials concerned. 
  President Clinton gave a call to the prime minister's 
official residence just before 0100 on 4 March, Japan time. It 
has been reported that because the phone call was made without 
advance notice, the prime minister had no time to contact MOFA 
officials, and he talked with the President for about 10 minutes 
only through a U.S. interpreter. Later, the prime minister 
informed the MOFA of the telephone conversation. However, the 
incident has left a diplomatic problem in that no one but the 
prime minister knows details of the conversation. 
  It is usual that when the prime minister holds a telephone 
conversation with a foreign leader the time and topics are 
coordinated in advance and the MOFA officials, as well as 
interpreters from both sides, are present at the conversation. 
This is because telephone conversation between state leaders 
are none other than diplomatic negotiations. 
  In the past, the United States made sudden telephone calls 
to 
then Prime Ministers Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa. But, 
the recent call was especially exceptional because it was made 
early in the morning. There is speculation that President 
Clinton "made the telephone call in the early hours" 
intentionally because of his distrust of Japanese bureaucrats.
