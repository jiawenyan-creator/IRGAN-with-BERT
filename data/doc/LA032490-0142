ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 
LEGION OF LATIN STUDENTS TO ARRIVE 
Not quite sure whether or not Mars and Apollo are related? Confused over the 
meaning of veni, vidi, vici? Curious about how to throw the discus while 
wearing a toga? Well, California Latin students will address those issues and 
others this weekend at the annual state Junior Classical League convention in 
Irvine. 
The students, members of Latin clubs at their schools, will gather at 
University High School in Irvine, the home of the nation's second largest Latin 
club. Student organizers have spent the year preparing for the three-day event 
and say that this week has been the busiest. 
"It's chaos, total chaos," said convention co-chairman Aaron Shapiro, one of 
the 236 members of University High's club. "There're about 1,300 students 
coming, and right now it's really hectic." 
Representatives of 49 schools from across the state are scheduled to attend the 
convention, and students traveling long distances will be housed with the 
families of Orange County students. 
The convention includes everything from a quiz bowl on mythology to a written 
language and grammar test to team chariot races. 
Participants can enter any of the events, as well as help make a team banner or 
scrapbook relating to this year's theme. The theme is based on a quote from 
Virgil's epic poem "Aeneid" and translates: "Perhaps one day it will be 
beneficial to remember these things." 
Gloria Shu, a senior at University High and the state's Junior Classical League 
president, said the annual event is a memorable one. 
"It really brings the state together," Shu said. "You can see Latin and Roman 
and Greek culture at work." 
This is the 35th year for the convention and the second time in the last four 
years that it has been held at University High. This year's keynote speaker 
will be former Los Angeles Rams football player Rosey Greer. LAURA MICHAELIS
