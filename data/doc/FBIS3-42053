  [Text] Moscow has notified Seoul that it has made contracts 
to sell 12 decommissioned submarines to Pyongyang and already 
handed over one to the country under the contract, the Foreign 
Ministry said yesterday. 
  Russian Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov met South 
Korean diplomats in Moscow Thursday and told them the vessels 
cannot be restored to submarines as they have been completely 
removed of arms and other equipment. 
  He also said Russia has obliged North Korea to allow 
Russians 
to check, for verification, the disassembling process in the 
contract, the ministry said. 
  ``From these reports from Russia, the decommissioned 
submarines being sold to North Korea are believed to be for use 
as scrap metal,'' said Paek Nak-hwan, director-general for 
European Affairs. 
  When asked by Seoul of its evaluation, Washington also said 
it saw little possibility that North Korea would acquire 
submarine technologies through disassembling the vessels, Paek 
said. 
  U.S. officials said that North Korea might use some of the 
disassembled parts for its other submarines but this also might 
not pose much worries, he said. 
  Paek said the former Soviet Union had handed over two 
decommissioned submarines to South Korea's Samsung in 1989 in 
exchange for some medical equipment. 
  Samsung conducted a close examination but didn't find any 
other use of the vessels but as scrap iron at that time, he said. 
  The former Soviet Union also sold two vessels to Taiwan in 
1991 but China did not raise objections, Paek said. 
  The official said Seoul has demanded an additional 
explanation from Moscow on how it will check the process of 
disjoining the vessels. 
  ``We will continue to closely watch future development of 
the 
Russia-North Korea dealing,'' he said.
