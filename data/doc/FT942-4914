FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa
Johannesburg was unnerved by gold bullion's dip below Dollars 380 an ounce,
while a lack of foreign demand compounded the diminished interest of local
investors. The overall index fell 38 to 5,462, industrials receded 38 to
6,539 and golds gave up 35 to 1,923.
