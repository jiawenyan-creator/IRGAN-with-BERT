  [Excerpt] Officials in Aden have welcomed international 
moves to halt the fighting in Yemen. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, 
named by southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid as his deputy, said 
in a telephone interview with AL-YAWM that, for now, 
international intervention is the only way to stop the war. 
  Al-Jifri predicted imminent international recognition of 
south Yemen's secession. He said delay in recognition was 
natural in view of the rapid succession of developments in Yemen. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid stood ready to meet with President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih anywhere, on condition that the meeting 
coincided with a cease-fire and a pullback by northern forces to 
the pre-unity lines. Victims of the offensive on Shabwah 
Governorate showed symptoms indicating the use of chemical 
weapons, al-Jifri said. 
  The southern official said he thought it unlikely that 
northern forces would enter Aden, citing strong defenses, rather 
than political considerations. [passage omitted]
