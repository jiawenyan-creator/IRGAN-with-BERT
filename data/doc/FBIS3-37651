  [Text] The KURANTY editorial office has learned from 
competent sources about the release from custody in Vilnius of 
an Israeli citizen held on suspicion of complicity in the 
assassination of V. Lingis, deputy chief editor of the 
Lithuanian newspaper RESPUBLIKA. This fact is explained by the 
increased activities in Lithuania of the Israeli "Mosad" 
intelligence service. In particular, to secure the release of 
their compatriot and to neutralize possible negative reaction 
regarding Israel, this special service brought into play its 
contacts among Lithuanian parliamentarians. Publications in 
local mass media aimed at preventing a rise of anti-Israel 
sentiments in this Baltic country have simultaneously been 
inspired. Investigation into Lingis' assassination is 
continuing. 
  "Mosad" is showing heightened interest in the situation in 
Lithuania also because the press, including RESPUBLIKA, carried 
reports about the role of dummy Israeli firms in illegal arms 
deliveries to the country from abroad.
