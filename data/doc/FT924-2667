FT  11 DEC 92 / People: JFB chairman
Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the metals and engineering group, yesterday announced
the appointment of Martin Llowarch, 57-year-old former chief executive of
British Steel, as non-executive chairman. Described by colleagues as 'easy
to get along with - but tough', Llowarch surrendered his position as Sir Bob
Scholey's heir apparent last year, following reported differences over
strategy. JFB, which is facing severe pressure on margins, will offer
Llowarch the opportunity to use his skills as a ruthless cost-cutter. 'When
I go to sleep at night,' he once said, 'the last word I say to myself is
'competitiveness'.'
Llowarch is also non-executive chairman of Transport Development Group, and
a non-executive director of Abbey National and Hickson International.
