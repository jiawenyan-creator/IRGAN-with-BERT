<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft revised recovery
plan for the Sonoran pronghorn (

Antilocapra americana sonoriensis

) which the Service listed as an endangered species on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001). This animal's population is estimated
to be less than 800 animals; less than 300 in the United States and no more than 500 in the State of Sonora, Mexico. Distribution
is limited primarily to Sonoran desert habitats. Factors that limit population growth are not well understood. However,
loss of habitat due to drying of extended reaches of the Gila and Sonoyta Rivers, competition from domestic livestock,
and human encroachment are believed to be limiting factors. Illegal hunting and predation on fawns may also limit
growth of some populations. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments on the draft recovery plan must be received on or before November 7, 1994, to receive consideration by the
Service.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point that it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe site-specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and survival
of the species, establish objective, measurable criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting species,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed. 
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal
agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. 
Sonoran pronghorn habitat in the United States consists of broad alluvial valleys separated by blocked-faulted
mountains. Creosote and white bursage are the dominate vegetation in these valleys. Sonoran pronghorn are found
in the creosote-bursage plant association throughout the year, but utilize areas containing palo verde-mixed cacti
plant associations during spring and summer months. The requirement of water for drinking has not been verified.
In Mexico, Sonoran pronghorn are found in areas where permanent water is not available, and there is no evidence of
them traveling long distances to obtain water. The Recovery Plan has been revised to include research results obtained
since the original recovery plan was completed in 1982 and to reflect recovery objectives that reflect current information
known about the species. 
The Sonoran Pronghorn Recovery Plan has been reviewed by the appropriate Service staff in the Southwest Region. The
plan will be finalized and approved following incorporation of comments and materials received during this comment
period. 


Public Comments Solicited 


The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to the approval of the plan. 


Authority 


The Authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).
