LOTTO WINNER JUST NEVER GAVE UP 
Patience, steady betting and dreaming of "the big one" paid off for Jose Amador 
Granados of Anaheim over the weekend. 
Granados, a Mexican national who has lived in California for 14 years, was one 
of the four winners of the $44.9-million California Lotto 6-49 jackpot. 
He is expected to clear about $448,000 annually for the next 20 years after the 
federal government takes out 20% in taxes, state lottery officials said Monday. 
An avid lottery player, Granados said he has spent at least $30 a week on 
tickets since the lottery began 3 years ago. 
"Every time I go to buy something, I buy a ticket," he said. He estimated that 
he has spent more than $3,000 on tickets altogether. 
"I was trying and trying," he said during an interview Monday at the Laguna 
Hills landscaping company where he is a supervisor. 
"I never had this much money before." 
No probability theory or birthdates played roles in Granados' number selection, 
which he left to chance. The "pick six" computer chose his winning combination 
of 16-26-27-36-43-45. 
Granados, 30, said he had trouble sleeping Sunday night because of the 
excitement. "I feel good, but at the same time I feel different." 
Still, he insisted, riches will not change him. 
"I'm still the same person; my personality is going to be the same," he said, 
"I don't like to change." 
Granados said he will keep his job. 
Ken Lawson, owner of Lawson Landscaping Maintenance where Granados has worked 
for 6 years, said he wasn't too happy about Granados' good fortune. 
"I wasn't thrilled he won, actually, because I didn't want him to quit," Lawson 
said, only half joking. Managers described Granados as a hard worker -- he 
works 6 days a week -- and a good employee who had worked his way up to 
supervise several crews totaling about 35 men. 
With about a dozen gold chains draped about his neck and showy gold rings that 
he wears on both hands every day, Granados sported a bit of a nouveau riche 
look Monday. But he said his first purchase from the lottery check, which he 
expects in 3 weeks, will be a practical one -- a home for his parents who live 
alternately in Tijuana and California. Then, he said, he will buy a new car for 
himself. 
Asked how he will handle people who are expected to ask him for donations, 
Granados replied that he likes to help poor people. 
"I am of poor people; we came from Mexico," he explained. "When I have 
something, I like to help the poor people." 
The winning ticket was purchased at an Albertson's on Campus Drive in Irvine, 
which lottery officials said will get about $56,000, or 0.05%, as its share of 
the winnings. 
The three others winners were James Hickey of La Puente, James Hurley of 
Hayward and Charles Johnson of San Francisco.
