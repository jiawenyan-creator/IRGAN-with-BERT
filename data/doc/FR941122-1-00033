 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

The Proposed Amendment


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.


39.13


[Amended]


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:





McDonnell Douglas: 

Docket 94NM172AD.





Applicability:

 Model DC9 and C9 (Military) series airplanes, and Model MD88 airplanes, as listed in McDonnell
Douglas DC9 Service Bulletin 24121, dated February 24, 1992, certificated in any category.





Note 1:

 This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (c) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed
configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration,
or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD.





Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.
To prevent an engine start valve uncontained failure, which could cause damage to the engine cowling, damage to adjacent
engine components, and possible fire in the cowling, accomplish the following:
(a) Within 8 months after the effective date of this AD, perform a visual inspection of the wire termination lugs on
the ignition selector switch located in the forward overhead switch panel in the flight compartment to determine
if the lugs are installed correctly, in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC9 Service Bulletin 24121,
dated February 24, 1992.
(1) If any wire termination lug is improperly installed, prior to further flight, remove and reinstall the wire terminations
with the barrel up, and encapsulate the wire termination lugs and attachment screws with sealant, in accordance with
the service bulletin.
(2) If all wire termination lugs are properly installed, prior to further flight, encapsulate the termination lugs
and attachment screws with sealant in accordance with the service bulletin.
(b) Within 10 days after removing and reinstalling any wire terminations with the barrel up, as required by paragraph
(a)(1), submit a report of that action to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification
Office, 3960 Paramount Boulevard, Lakewood, California 90712, Attention: Robert Baitoo, ANM140L; fax (310)
6275210. Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 21200056.
(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO.





Note 2:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Los Angeles ACO.



(d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be
accomplished.

 


Issued in Renton, Washington, on November 16, 1994.
