FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Belgian bank up 8% at BFr5.4bn
Kredietbank, Belgium's third largest bank, boosted consolidated net profits
by 8.7 per cent to BFr5.4bn (Dollars 170m) for the first half of 1994,
writes Lionel Barber in Brussels.
The earnings growth was largely due to a strong performance in customer
services, as well as tight control of costs and a cut in write-downs and
provisions. Second-half profit is expected to match the first.
The bank's performance was held back by disappointing results on 'certain
financial operations for own account,' with current gross income falling 0.6
per cent. Kredietbank blamed uncertainty in the financial markets and the
rise in long-term interest rates.
Customer deposits rose 6.9 per cent to BFr1,365bn.
