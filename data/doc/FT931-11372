FT  03 FEB 93 / BCCI liquidator hits back at critics
THE LIQUIDATORS to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday hit back at criticism from creditors calling for their removal,
Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
who is joint liquidator to BCCI, said delays caused by 'a small' group of
dissenting creditors were costing 'many hundreds of thousands of pounds'.
His comments follow remarks from Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East,
who has represented a group of BCCI creditors criticising Touche's fees, the
size of the settlement being negotiated and the slow pace of its payment.
Mr Morris said substantial delays were being caused by the decision by
creditors to appeal against ratification by the Luxembourg courts of the
settlement negotiated by the liquidators.
Without the delays, he said, a first payment of Pounds 800m would have been
received from the government of Abu Dhabi in December.
