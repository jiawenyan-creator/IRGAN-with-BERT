FT  14 SEP 92 / Iberia to trim its role at Heathrow
IBERIA, the Spanish airline, has asked British Midland to check in its
customers at Heathrow Airport and deal with their baggage.
The transfer is expected to mean redundancies for 52 permanent Iberia
employees and 24 casual staff.
Iberia also intends to centralise its UK reservations operation, handling
all bookings from its Regent Street office. The company refused yesterday to
say whether that would result in the closure of other offices or to comment
on job losses resulting from its UK and Heathrow restructuring.
