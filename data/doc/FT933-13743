FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: Narrow-minded attitude to events held outside
south-east
Sir, The motoring section told us ('Be a VIP for just Pounds 15', July
10/11) the British international car show at the National Exhibition Centre
is really a regional event. Why do the London-based media so often make
these snobbish attacks on events held outside the south-east?
This narrow-minded idea, that an event staged in London is national (or
international), while those held elsewhere are regional only, hinders the
country.
As cities like Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester, etc, look to find new
positions for themselves, they are not helped by the constant sniping in the
national press.
