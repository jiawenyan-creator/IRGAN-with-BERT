FT  07 DEC 94 / Observer: Model man
So Patrick Minford is back in favour. Margaret Thatcher's erstwhile
economics mentor is not only well dug in as a member of the Treasury's panel
of economic advisers, but is now poised to receive Pounds 120,000 of
government money to help out over the next four years with his economic
modelling activities.
Minford, who caught the Iron Lady's eye in the 1970s with his theories about
free-market economics, was summarily dropped from the Economic and Social
Research Council's funding list in 1990. He began to fret that his ideas
were, well, insufficiently appreciated by the mainstream.
Not that he is letting this new-found largesse go to his head. The monies
will be put to reasonably eccentric use - for one thing, towards hooking up
with a Cray supercomputer at the government's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory
in Oxfordshire.
Undeterred by the fact that such machines are normally the preserve of
nuclear scientists or aircraft engineers rather than of practitioners of the
dismal science, Minford reckons he can harness their massive power to figure
out knotty little problems of trade flows and the role of markets in the
world economy. He's even christened his baby in suitably user-unfriendly
terms. Roll on the 'computable general equilibrium model'.
