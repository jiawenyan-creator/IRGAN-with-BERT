FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Beijing in last push for status
China has begun what is expected to be long and intensive negotiations with
its main trading partners in a final push to become a founder member of the
World Trade Organisation, due to succeed Gatt next January, writes Frances
Williams in Geneva.
An initial three-day round of tariff negotiations with the US ends today.
They were aimed at resolving outstanding problems before calling another
meeting of Gatt's working party on Chinese membership to draft the terms of
entry.
There seems to be growing optimism that the eight-year-old negotiations can
be successfully completed by the end of the year, although officials warn
many pitfalls remain.
