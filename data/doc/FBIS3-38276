  [Text] The granting of a U.S. visa to the Sinn Fein 
president, Gerry Adams, has provoked a predictable storm of 
words flying back and forth across the border and across the 
Irish Sea. Mr. Adams was at Dublin Airport this lunchtime for 
his flight to New York, and he spoke to reporters, including our 
Charlie Bird: 
  [Begin recording] [Adams] Well, I welcome the waiver. I 
think it can only help to create a better climate. And it 
shows, I think, a concern by the Clinton administration to be 
better informed on the situation. 
  [Bird] What's your reaction to the Unionist reaction? 
  [Adams] Well I think it's fairly predictable and, you know, 
there's a certain sense to it. What are they saying? That, 
that.... 
  [Bird, interrupting] Well, Mr. Robinson was saying, sort of, 
that the Americans were giving in to terrorism again and that 
you were being put center stage. 
  [Adams] This is the man who invaded Clontibret. 
  [Bird] But what's your reaction to his reaction? 
  [Adams] Well, I think it's nonsense. Why doesn't he come and 
argue his case? I mean, what are they afraid of? Have they no 
argument to put? Are they not willing to take any part in any 
sort of democratic debate? 
  [Bird] Now, would you see this relaxing of your entry into 
America as perhaps a turnabout by the United States on the 
prospects of sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland? 
  [Adams] I don't know. I mean that's a matter absolutely for 
the Clinton administration. All I can say is that it can only 
help create a better climate. It will inform U.S. opinion; it 
will allow those who wish to engage with me. It certainly will 
advance the entire peace process and the United States can play 
an influential role. They can encourage the British. They can, 
without taking sides, help to move the situation on. And if a 
peace envoy comes out of that, we're for that idea in principle. 
  [Bird] The Americans said that they wouldn't let you into 
America unless you renounced violence. Are you renouncing 
violence? 
  [Adams] Well, I don't advocate violence. I'd like... 
  [Bird, interrupting] Are you renouncing it though? 
  [Adams] Excuse me. It isn't an issue as far as I'm 
concerned. 
  [Bird] It is with them. 
  [Adams] Oh well, it isn't with them. I have spoken and had a 
very frank hour-and-a-half discussion with a representative of 
that government. And we exchanged views, and my attitude to 
violence is quite simple and straight forward. I want to end it. 
  [Bird] Mr. Adams, up to a couple of months ago the American 
Administration were saying that you had links to paramilitary 
organizations, and this was the reason why they weren't allowing 
you in. 
  [Adams] Well, you know I've never conceded that. I'm 
president of Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein is not involved in armed 
struggle. Sinn Fein is not the IRA. And the main function of 
Sinn Fein at this time, and for some considerable time, has been 
to see the building of a peace process in this country. And 
that's what I've been engaged in for some long time, and it's a 
matter of great priority for me. 
  [Bird] What are you going to say when you're in the United 
States? Some politicians are hoping that you will make some 
announcement, that you will say something that will perhaps move 
the peace process forward. Will you be saying anything which is 
going to move the peace process forward when you're there? 
  [Adams] Well, I think the very fact that I will be there, 
that I can engage with American opinion, that I will be 
informing American opinion of how the U.S. Administration can 
help to encourage, without taking sides, to encourage the 
British Government to move forward. [sentence as heard] All of 
that can only help the peace process. It all creates a far 
better climate, because the people should never be afraid of 
information. [end recording] 
  And that was Gerry Adams at Dublin Airport.
