CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
GOING PLACES; 
NOW IN MALIBU: MASTERS OF SUBJECTIVITY 
'As with every art, in photography the most important thing is that we feel 
fully what we are doing," said Hungarian-born photographer Andre Kertesz, 
describing the works he and his counterparts started producing just after World 
War I. These experiments -- the photographer interjecting his own feelings into 
the familiar -- would continue indefinitely under the rubric subjectivity. A 
stunning collection of prints representing the genre, "Experimental 
Photography: The New Subjectivity," is on display at The J. Paul Getty Museum, 
joining the remarkable Greek and Roman antiquities, pre-20th-Century Western 
European paintings, sculpture and decorative arts housed in the lovely 
re-created 1st-century Roman country villa overlooking the Pacific. 
Among the works: Kertesz's "Diver," Czechoslovakian Josef Sudek's "Late Roses," 
American expatriate Man Ray's "Cannes" and American W. Eugene Smith's "The 
Wake," all of which capture the drama of a moment in a single powerful image.
