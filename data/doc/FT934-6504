FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum metals fall in
'overreaction'
Sharp falls in prices for sister metals platinum and palladium yesterday
afternoon were a 'wild overreaction' to an announcement of a new motor
emission control system, according to Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at
stockbroker T. Hoare and Company.
The January platinum futures price fell by 2.3 per cent and the palladium
December price by 2.75 per cent at the New York Mercantile Exchange after
Engelhard Corporation said it had developed technology that trapped
hydrocarbon emissions during the first two minutes of vehicle operation that
a catalytic converter took to become activated.
Ms O'Connell suggested this might result in an add-on to conventional
emission control systems but did not appear to threaten the autocatalyst
markets for the two metals.
Mr Gordon Bassett, general manager for precious metals marketing at Johnson
Matthey North America, agreed. 'This is not something that would effect
palladium or platinum use,' he told the Reuter news agency. And an Engelhard
representative confirmed that the company's hydrocarbon trap would be used
in addition to, rather than in place of, traditional catalytic converters
using platinum group metals.
Prices for both metal recovered somewhat near the close. In late trading,
Nymex's January platinum position was quoted Dollars 1.90 off the day's low
at Dollars 374 a troy ounce, still Dollars 6.90 down on the day, while
December palladium had edged up by 50 cents to Dollars 126 an ounce, down
Dollars 3.05.
'Platinum was looking pretty weak on fundamental grounds irrespectively,' Mr
George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers, told Reuter.
