FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CIA better than expected at Pounds 3.65m
CIA GROUP, the USM-quoted independent media-buying concern, reported higher
than expected pre-tax profits, up 29 per cent from Pounds 2.83m to Pounds
3.65m, for the year to December 31 1992.
CIA's share price, which closed unchanged at 285p, had risen by 16p earlier
in the week on rumours of better than predicted results.
Turnover increased to Pounds 235.3m (Pounds 172.4m), while operating margins
were 16 per cent. The group benefited from net new business wins of Pounds
76m in 1992, compared with Pounds 51m. Operating costs of its UK operations
were reduced by 7 per cent, and it ended the year with Pounds 8m cash.
Earnings per share improved by 15 per cent to 15.72p (13.62p).
The total dividend is increased 16 per cent to 4.35p (3.75p) with a final of
3.03p.
Mr Chris Ingram, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We expect continuing
opportunities for growth, both organically and acquisition, in the UK and
internationally.'
Analysts are now revising their 1993 forecasts; cautious estimates suggest
possible growth of 10 per cent this year.
