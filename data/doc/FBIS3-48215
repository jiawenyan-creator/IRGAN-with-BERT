  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Hanhwa Group Chairman Kim 
Sung-yon was sentenced to one year in prison with a two-year 
suspension and fined 4,723 million won (5.83 million U.S. 
dollars) Friday in a Seoul District Criminal Court for 
violation of the Foreign Exchange Control Law. 
  "The accused deserves heavy punishment because he illegally 
bought a luxurious mansion in a foreign country with a 
commission he received in relation to overseas business," the 
bench said in passing sentence. 
  "But the court grants him a stay of execution, considering 
that he deeply repents of his actions and that the government is 
revising the Foreign Exchange Control Law to keep pace with the 
internationalization era." 
  Kim was arrested in November and charged with diverting 6.5 
million dollars in commissions paid to a Hanhwa subsidiary for a 
construction deal in Saudi Arabia to buy a home in Los Angeles. 
  The prosecution demanded Jan. 13 that he be sentenced to 
three years in prison and fined 5.8 million dollars.
