FT  06 AUG 92 / Observer: Self-absorbed
Birmingham City Council has decided, yet again, that it needs a new
identity. This time the second city fathers have hired Vincent Hanna, the
chubby television journalist, at a cost of Pounds 20,000, to chase this
elusive grail.
So, over the past six weeks, Hanna has been looking at the communications
emanating from the City Council - Pounds 32m worth a year. He found Pounds
2m of savings by slimming down here and centralising there, all in the
interest of getting value for money.
It looks, though, as if the first sign of the new corporate identity,
Hanna-style, will be a new logo to replace the red, white and blue V sign,
criticised for being masculine, racist and sexist. Given the Council's
predeliction for plastering the logo everywhere, replacing it should happily
absorb the Pounds 2m Hanna saves.
