  [Text] On 19 November, the National Research Institute for 
Metals (NRIM) of the Science and Technology Agency announced 
that in the primary materials experiments conducted in the fall 
of 1992, a compound semiconducting monocrystal with a diameter 
of 20 millimeters (mm) and twice the purity of those created on 
earth was produced. This was the first compound semiconductor 
created under microgravity conditions, and the biggest 
monocrystal created in space. 
  In the experiment, the suspension zone fusion method was 
used 
in which materials were suspended in space without containers. 
The materials used were indium and antimony. The monocrystal 
that was grown was 20-30mm in diameter and 100mm long, and this 
diameter is 4 times the monocrystals grown on earth.
