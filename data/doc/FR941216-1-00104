1With reasonable care in storage, Hazard Division 1.4 items may be stored in any weatherproof warehouse in a warehouse
area for general supplies provided such warehouse is separated from all other warehouses by at least the aboveground
magazine separation distance specified.

2Limited quantities of Hazard Division 1.4 items may be stored in facilities such as hangars and manufacturing or
operating buildings without regard to Q/D. Examples: small arms ammunition, riot control munitions, and pyrotechnics.
Also, small magazines used for similar purposes may be separated by applicable fire protection distances.

Note:

 List of items (examples only): Small arms ammunition without explosive projectiles, fuse lighters and squibs, distress
signals, 20mm ammunition without explosive projectiles, colored smoke grenades, and explosive valves or switches
(see 184.22(b)).

1``EIDS Fuzed'' means that the fuze has an EIDS booster with an out-of-line EIDS explosive and two or more independent
safety features. The fuze must be certified as invulnerable to accidental detonation of the warhead.

2Fuzed configuration must be tested for propagation. Fuzed Hazard Division 1.6 ammunition must contain either an
EIDS fuze or a non-explosive fuze (fuze contains no explosive); otherwise the ammunition is classified as unit risk
Hazard Division 1.2. Minimum fragment distance is based on hazardous fragment areal density requirements, as determined
for Hazard Division 1.1 ammunition, applies for unit risk Hazard Division 1.2.

3Unit risk Hazard Division 1.2 may be justified on a case-by-case basis.

4Fuze must have two or more independent safety features and independently classified Group D.
