ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; 
PLANNING DIRECTOR IS HIRED BY CITY 
After a 10-month search for a new planning director, the city has hired Michael 
W. Brotemarkle to fill the vacancy left by Frank Schuma. 
Brotemarkle has worked for the community development departments of five cities 
in Southern California and has managed two private consulting firms that 
handled environmental and redevelopment planning. 
He currently resides in Orange but lived in Fountain Valley for eight of his 30 
years in Orange County. 
"When the job became open I immediately said yes," Brotemarkle said. "All my 
kids were born in this town, and it's like coming back home." 
Among Brotemarkle's first jobs will be to assist in revising the city's General 
Plan, a blueprint for commercial and residential construction over the next 10 
years. That project will begin this December and take about 18 months to 
complete.ROSE APODACA
