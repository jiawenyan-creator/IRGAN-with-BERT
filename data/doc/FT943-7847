FT  20 AUG 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): LME gains erased as
stocks rise
London Metal Exchange contracts generally lost most or all of their earlier
modest gains yesterday following the announcement of increases in stocks
held in exchange registered warehouses.
The exception was aluminium, which was able to hold steady on news of a
9,525 stocks fall, although that was somewhat less than had been expected.
For this metal, however, the gains of Wednesday and Thursday had only
cancelled out the falls of the previous two days, which revealed strong
support around the Dollars 1,470-a-tonne mark for three months delivery
metal. At yesterday's close the three months price stood at Dollars 1,489.50
a tonne, down Dollars 1 on the week.
In contrast copper, the LME's flagship contract, had been testing the upper
limits of its recent trading range.
Building on last week's modest rally the three months price attempted on
Thursday and yesterday morning to break decisively through overhead
resistance at Dollars 2,420 a tonne. But these forays faltered at Dollars
2,435 and Dollars 2,427 respectively, the second after the LME announced
that there had been a 5,475-tonne rise in warehouse stocks, the seventh in a
row. That took the stocks figure to 353,575 tonnes, up 14,975 so far this
month.
By the close three months copper was down to Dollars 2,407.50 a tonne,
Dollars 5 lower on the week, and that helped to knock the stuffing out other
LME contracts.
Only lead ended the week with a net rise - of Dollars 5.75 to Dollars 581 a
tonne for three months delivery - reflecting general recognition of its
sound fundamentals and the approach of the northern hemisphere winter, boom
time for the replacement car battery market. But reaction to copper's fall
and to its own continuing stocks rise had resulted in a Dollars 11.50 fall
yesterday, confounding traders hopes that the price might soon regain the
Dollars 600-plus levels last seen on August 4.
At the London bullion market meanwhile the gold price extended last week's
sell-off before staging a cautious rally. The low of Dollars 376.25 a troy
ounce was reached on Tuesday, but by yesterday's close it was up to Dollars
382.10, a gain of Dollars 4.60 overall.
After support had held at the low speculative buyers, who thought the market
had become oversold, were encouraged by a US interest rate rise, traders
explained. And after a later break through resistance between Dollars 378
and Dollars 379 they began to think in terms of a renewed assault on the
Dollars 383 level above which the last rally stalled, although that hurdle
looked 'formidable'.
The London Commodity Exchange coffee market was firing on all cylinders at
the start of the week as it caught up with the previous Friday night's news
of an unexpectedly bullish US Department of Agriculture estimate of
June/July frost damage to the 1995-96 Brazilian crop. It put the total loss
at between 30 and 40 per cent, close to an earlier Brazilian government
assessment and at the top end of the range suggested by market analysts.
In response the November delivery futures price at the LCE shot up Dollars
157 on Monday and added another Dollars 55 on Tuesday morning, reaching
Dollars 3,485 a tonne. But by then the market had had enough. Starved of
further bullish news, speculators started to take their profits and by last
night's close close the price had been marked down to Dollars 3,315, having
regained, on balance, just Dollars 45 of last week's Dollars 277
retrenchment.
