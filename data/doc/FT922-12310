FT  21 APR 92 / Chambers report idle plant capacity
NEARLY 80 per cent of companies in the East Midlands, one of the most
economically diversified regions of the UK, worked at less than full
capacity during the first quarter of this year, according to the latest
business survey of the region's Chambers of Commerce.
The results of the survey, carried out in March and covering 336 companies,
provide scant evidence of any recovery from recession.
The number of companies with under-used capacity has remained fairly
constant since 1990. There is little in the flow of orders to suggest any
immediate change.
At 31 per cent, the proportion of companies with larger domestic order books
is lower than either last December, at 35 per cent, or last September at 33
per cent.
Although 31 per cent of companies received more export orders during the
first quarter, that proportion is only slightly higher than that recorded
last September and lower than the values recorded last June.
Although most East Midlands companies expect an improvement in turnover and
profitability, 80 per cent found that over the past three months their cash
flow either remained the same or deteriorated.
Equally, the chambers' survey suggests, most companies have no plans to
increase their investment.
The main financial preoccupation of business remains, as it has done since
1990, the high level of interest rates. Most analysts believe there is
little immediate prospect of lower rates.
