  [Text] The Americans have offered Russia assistance in 
building a burial site for radioactive waste. However, they 
have also stated that nuclear waste from the United States 
should be accepted at the burial site as a condition for doing 
so. Germany has also come forward with a similar proposal. 
Viktor Kutsenko, a representative of the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, said this in an 
interview for the RIA agency. He stressed that Russia would not 
agree to the country being turned into a dumping ground for 
nuclear waste.
