FT  30 DEC 92 / Letter: Report must look at adequacy as well as safety of
pensions
As your leader, 'Safer pensions' (December 16), so rightly says, it will not
be enough if Prof Goode's report confines itself to narrow questions of
safety. The urgent need is that private-sector pensions should fulfil the
government actuary's precept - '. . .the fundamental objective. . .is to
provide a satisfactory income in. . .retirement'.
The key word is satisfactory. It is not sufficient that pensions funds
should merely be secure against fraud. An income may be secure but at the
same time hopelessly inadequate. As the Occupational Pensions Board report
(Cmnd 8649, note 1, Chapter 9) of 1982 pointed out, the average level of
pension provision is appalling, notwithstanding the case sums invested and
the huge tax privileges funds are accorded.
As presently constructed, defined benefit schemes allow shiploads of money
involving true funding rates of 100 per cent and more of nominal salary, to
be tipped into the pockets of those who lest need such massive subsidies. at
the same time, because true funding rates are ruthlessly age progressive,
the UK's notorious 'too old at 50' employment syndrome is encouraged.
There are far better ways of achieving the fundamental objective (notably
fully-indexed revalued average schemes).
