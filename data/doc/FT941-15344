FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: War of words continues over LWT
The battle of statement and counter statement between London Weekend
Television and Granada continued yesterday as the London ITV company
attacked Granada for its 'vague and woolly' documents.
In a letter to shareholders Sir Christopher Bland, LWT's chairman, asked a
series of questions ranging from inquiries about the rate of decline of
Granada's rental business to whether advertising sales house contracts would
have to be unscrambled if the hostile Granada bid succeeded.
Granada instantly replied with answers to LWT's 'facile' questions. They
included the information that last year operating profits from the rental
business rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 105m and a promise to reorganise the
two sales houses involved, The Time Exchange and Laser, 'when its bid
succeeds'.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, denounced the 'smokescreen'
put up by its rival and said the deal was still the best bet for the future
of LWT.
Meanwhile, a decision by the Takeover Panel means that the war of words can
go on until the Office of Fair Trading decides whether or not to refer the
bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
