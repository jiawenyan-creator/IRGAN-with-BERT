P.M. BRIEFING; 
AEROSOL STREAMERS RECALLED 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall today of more than 
a million cans of aerosol string streamers, warning that the party product can 
catch fire when sprayed near an open flame. 
Commission Chairwoman Jacqueline Jones-Smith said the voluntary recall by five 
companies is being conducted "because of several terrifying accidents that 
occurred when this type of product was sprayed near lit candles on birthday 
cakes and burst into flames." 
The aerosol cans, which are used like confetti at parties, are flammable 
because of the propellant they use, officials said. 
The recall involves about 1.13 million cans sold nationwide in the last year 
for less than $5 a can. The aerosol cans have colored plastic caps indicating 
the color of streamer inside.
