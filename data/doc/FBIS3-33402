  [Excerpts] Just minutes ago, at the Chamber of Commerce of 
the Republic of Cuba, a letter of intent was signed between the 
participants in the fourth Cuban-Spanish bilateral committee of 
economic cooperation. This committee will make use of innovative 
means to increase economic relations -- specifically, in the 
granting of credits, on the Spanish side -- and the 
diversification of areas in which permission for investments are 
granted in Cuba, including mixed enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  The bilateral committee is responsible for establishing the 
path of trade between the two countries. Tonight the committee 
has come out in favor of intervening in the balancing of the 
internal finances of our country. In our opinion, the response 
of our entrepreneurs should be greater imagination and 
aggressiveness.
