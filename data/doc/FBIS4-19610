<F P=106> [Jan Bohets report: "Maystadt Proposes That EU Should Make </F>
Aid No Longer Dependent on Awarding of Orders"] 
  [Text] Belgian Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt appealed 
to his EU colleagues yesterday to put an end to the practice of 
"tied" aid. The goods delivered by the aid funds of one member 
state must be able to go to companies in other member states. 
According to him, doing so would benefit the efficiency of 
awards of technical aid. 
  As the major shareholder in the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), we must set a good 
example, said Maystadt at the annual general meeting of the 
bank. The principle of "tied" aid consists of the recipient 
countries being obliged to use the money they receive to make 
orders with companies located in the donor country in question. 
  Maystadt also requested that the bank show its commitment to 
extending mutual trade between the former communist countries. 
In many cases, those countries are not greatly in favor of this 
themselves and opt to gamble everything on making exports to the 
West. 
  Furthermore, he appealed for the bank to ensure that legal 
and ethical standards are complied with, thereby preventing 
mafia-type practices. Intimidation aimed at frightening off 
newcomers and retaining monopolies is widespread practice in the 
former Soviet Union and East Europe. This gives rise to the 
impression that the activities of the private sector are 
equivalent to dishonesty. 
  Finally, Maystadt called for the bank to be active in all 
the 
countries located within its area of activity. It should not, 
he maintained, be judged so much on the basis of its financial 
results as on its contribution to the process of transition to a 
market economy and democracy. For that reason, the bank should 
not hesitate to commit itself in areas and countries where the 
needs were greatest, as long as it did not endanger its 
financial solidity in so doing, said the minister.
