KITTY DUKAKIS ADVISES DOCTORS AGAINST DRUGS 
Kitty Dukakis, describing herself as an alcoholic and drug addict, Friday urged 
doctors at a World Congress of Psychiatry to avoid prescribing drugs that may 
cause addiction. 
"I urge you psychiatrists not to give in to our society's urge for a quick fix, 
not to rush to identify drugs as the first solution to your patient's problem," 
said Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. 
Doctors' prescriptions often complicate an alcohol and drug abuse problem, 
which addicts carefully hide from their doctors, she told the conference. 
Dukakis said her long addiction to amphetamines relapsed to alcoholism after 
her husband lost the presidential elections in 1988.
