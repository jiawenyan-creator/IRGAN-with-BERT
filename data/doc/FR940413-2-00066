Notice.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
was duly appointed receiver for each of the financial institutions specified in 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. 

The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of the below listed
receivership estates are insufficient to wholly satisfy the priority claims of depositors against the receivership
estates. Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution or payment
to any creditor of lessor priority, including but not limited to, claims of general creditors. Any such claims are
hereby determined to be worthless.
