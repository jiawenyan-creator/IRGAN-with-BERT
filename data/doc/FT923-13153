FT  15 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Ryoko Securities to pull out
of Switzerland
RYOKO Securities, which is 33 per cent owned by the Mitsubishi Bank group,
is to pull out of Switzerland, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Tokyo-based brokerage will return Ryoko Securities' Swiss licence on
July 20. The move stems from shrinking primary and brokerage business in
Switzerland, and to ensure help in underpinning cost-cutting in Japan.
Three Japanese second-tier securities companies paid Y9.8bn to compensate
clients' losses from securities trading during the two years to March 1992,
according to the Finance Ministry.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange fined Dai-ichi Securities, New Japan Securities and
Kankaku Securities Y5m each. Four officials at the three companies have
resigned and 21 had their salaries cut.
The moves are part of last summer's compensation scandal which hit the
Japanese securities industry. It centred on unethical practices.
