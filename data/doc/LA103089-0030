POP MUSIC REVIEW; 
ECLECTIC ACTS AT STREET FESTIVAL 
Quick: At what community's street festival would you expect to find a guy 
selling Ginsu knives next to a yoga meditation booth? 
West Hollywood it is, where old age meets New Age -- literally, in the two 
musical acts that opened the five-year-old city's fourth annual Street 
Festival. On one of two main music stages Saturday was the spritely female 
geriatric sextet the Dixie Belles, while over in another corner of West 
Hollywood Park was the mellow jazz of the Ellen Schimmel Quartet -- both 
competing with the booming bass of a disco pavilion. Following the Belles, and 
eclectic in its own right, was the band Rotondi, with its polkadelic mix of 
Cajun and African rock: Post-Modern hipness you can dance to -- though no one 
did. 
The only disharmonious note of the sunny afternoon came when five people 
graphically but silently protesting meat consumption were removed from the park 
by security personnel. The vegetarians' leader, who identified himself only as 
Jingles, accused the city of ejecting them in deference to meat-selling 
vendors, but officials said that only organizations paying for booth space were 
allowed to use the event as a forum for their causes. 
The festival -- also featuring reggae group the Skanksters, Tex-Mex rockers 
Alienz, Latin pop group Tierra and country-rocker Lucinda Williams -- drew more 
than 100,000 people, event organizers said. The Sunday conclusion was expected 
to draw at least 150,000. STEVE HOCHMAN
