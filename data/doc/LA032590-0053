LEADERS OF 2 CORRECTIONAL AGENCIES IN WHITTIER, NORWALK TO TRADE JOBS 
Two California Youth Authority superintendents will switch jobs on April 2, CYA 
Director C. A. Terhune has announced. 
Greg Zermeno, superintendent of Fred C. Nelles School in Whittier, will become 
superintendent of the Southern Reception Center and Clinic in Norwalk. 
Edward R. Futch, superintendent of the Norwalk institution, will assume the 
same position at Nelles. 
Zermeno, 43, has been with the department since 1971. He has held a variety of 
positions, including assistant superintendent at Preston School in Ione, before 
being named head of Nelles five years ago. 
Futch, 50, also started with the department in 1971 and has served in a number 
of capacities. He has been superintendent of the Norwalk Reception Center and 
Clinic since 1987. 
Terhune said the changes are in keeping with his long-standing practice of 
periodically rotating top management staff members to enhance their career 
experience and to "provide for significant change and new ideas to come into 
our institutions." 
The California Youth Authority is the correctional department for juveniles and 
young adults.
