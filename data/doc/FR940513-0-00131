 

NEMA also suggested that the Commission require that manufacturers of all lamp products covered by the labeling rules
include on the outer (packing) cases in which the lamps are shipped a label or pre-printed message stating: ``Product
herein tested and labeled in compliance with the Energy Policy Act of 1992'' or, alternatively, with an approved symbol.
NEMA suggested that the advisory statement be integrated with or be placed adjacent to the usual case contents label
and included format recommendations. 



B. ACEEE's Proposals 



ACEEE also submitted specific labeling suggestions for discussion purposes.

30

 ACEEE stated that because purchase patterns vary for residential and commercial purchasers, different labeling
approaches would probably be warranted. It pointed out that commercial purchasers generally have a greater technical
understanding about lamp products, whereas residential purchasers generally know very little about lighting and
need information that is non-technical and easily understood. It also noted that residential purchases generally
are made through grocery, hardware, and other retail outlets, where products in boxes or other packaging are selected
by the purchaser off the shelf in small quantities. ACEEE stated that, in contrast, commercial purchasers generally
order medium to large quantities of lamps from lighting distributors, using information in catalogs and sales brochures,
as well as information provided orally by sales personnel. These commercial purchases often are shipped in case quantities,
and printed packages for individual lamps are rare.

ACEEE suggested that two types of information appear on labels for residential purchasers: annual operating cost
and relative light output. It proposed that relative light output be measured by comparing the lumen output of a product
to a reference lamp, with a reference lamp defined for each common type and wattage of lamp.

31

 It also suggested that annual operating cost include both the purchase cost (manufacturer's suggested list price
prorated for an assumed annual hours of operation) and annual electricity cost (for average operating hours and electricity
cost).

32

 ACEEE suggested that use of an annual operating cost metric would allow purchasers to compare products with different
lives and costs.

For example, ACEEE suggested a 60 watt standard incandescent A-lamp as the reference lamp for a 15 watt compact fluorescent
lamp. The relative light output of the compact fluorescent lamp might be 88%, based on average light output.

ACEEE, C40, 3, illustrated this as follows: Assuming 1,000 hours per year of operation and $.08 per kilowatt-hour
unit electricity cost, a 15 watt compact fluorescent lamp (with a $20 list price and 10,000 hour rated life) will have
an annual operating cost of $3.20 ([$20/

{

10,000 hour life/1,000 hours per year

}

 + [15 watts X 1,000 hours per year/1,000 Wh/kWh X $.08 per kilowatt hour]). In comparison, a standard 60 watt general
service incandescent A-lamp (with a $1.00 list price and 1,000 hour rated life) will have an annual operating cost
of $5.80. 


</FOOTNOTE>


ACEEE further stated that a lumens-per-watt disclosure probably should not be used for residential purchasers.
ACEEE maintained that such a disclosure could encourage residential purchasers to buy higher wattage lamps that
have higher lumens-per-watt ratings, when a lower wattage lamp with a lower lumens-per-watt rating might provide
sufficient light for their needs and cost less to operate at the lower wattage. For commercial purchasers, on the other
hand, ACEEE suggested that a lumens-per-watt rating probably would be acceptable because catalog display space
is likely to be very limited and commercial purchasers are more sophisticated. 

ACEEE supported disclosure of relevant information on lamp packages and other point-of-sale materials that provide
information on particular products, such as fact sheets and special displays for residential sales. For commercial
sales, it suggested requiring the information in catalogs and other sales materials that provide information on
specific products. Finally, ACEEE recommended that the Commission specify label content and size, but that the Commission
allow manufacturers to develop their own customized designs, consistent with Commission specifications. 



C. Commission's Proposals 



1. Disclosure Requirements 



Based on the options discussed in the NPR about the kinds of information purchasers need to select lamp products and
the proposals suggested by interested parties (as summarized above), the Commission proposed requiring disclosure
of two types of information for lamp products covered by the labeling rules. One category included basic performance
information (such as light output, which is needed to select lamp products that meet purchasers' requirements),
and the other category included various supplemental disclosures designed to further facilitate selection of the
most energy efficient lamp. Each category is discussed below. 



a. Basic disclosures

. The Commission proposed requiring that lamp package labels and catalogs conspicuously disclose the following
information: (1) Lumens (whether identified by that term, or another such as ``brightness'' or ``light output'');
(2) watts; (3) design volts (if other than 120 volts); (4) average life (in hours); and (5) number of items in the package.

33

 For multiple filament (``three-way'') general service incandescent lamps, the Commission proposed requiring
that lumens, watts, and design volts be disclosed for operation at each level, and that the life rating be based on the
life of the first filament that fails. Finally, the Commission proposed that the following statement appear on package
labels and in catalogs from which the lamps could be ordered: ``More efficient lamps may have a higher purchase price,
but may cost you less overall.''
