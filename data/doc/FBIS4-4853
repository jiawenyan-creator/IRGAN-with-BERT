  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, acknowledging deteriorating ties with new party 
Sakigake [Harbinger], said Monday [4 April] a once widely 
anticipated merger between his Japan New Party (JNP) and 
Sakigake is not "a commitment." 
  The relationship between Hosokawa, the JNP leader, and 
Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and head of 
Sakigake, has deteriorated so badly that the premier 
unsuccessfully tried in early March to dump the top government 
spokesman. The two parties floated the idea of a potential 
merger last summer. 
  The two parties currently maintain a loose 
intraparliamentary 
group within the House of Representatives. 
  Asked Monday to elaborate on the JNP stand on the merger 
plan, Hosokawa replied, "it's still in limbo." Some Sakigake 
leaders are demanding that Hosokawa's JNP honor "the commitment" 
to merge with Sakigake.
