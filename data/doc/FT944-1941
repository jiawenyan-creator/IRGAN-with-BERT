FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lincoln National to acquire Liberty Life
Lincoln National, the financial services group, is in discussions over the
purchase of Liberty Life Assurance, the small UK life insurer and subsidiary
of Hansard Financial Trust.
The move, expected to be completed early in January, is a further stage in
the rationalisation of the UK life insurance sector, where competition is
intensifying and putting increasing pressure on costs.
Acquiring LLA will give Lincoln National 180 sales agents to add to its
direct sales force of 590, and will increase its funds under management by
almost half to Pounds 1.6bn. The number of clients will rise by almost one
third to 460,000.
Mr Jeffrey Nick, Lincoln National's managing director, said there would be
some redundancies among LLA support staff, but Lincoln National would be
able to accommodate some LLA employees in its new head office in Uxbridge.
The acquisition is the company's third in two years - it bought Citibank
Life in August last year and Crown Unit Trusts a few months earlier. As a
subsidiary of an overseas parent - it is wholly owned by Lincoln National
Corporation, the US investment and insurance group - it is in one of the
categories of life company identified as vulnerable to a price war if it
does not attain critical mass.
Mr Nick said the purchase of LLA was 'clear evidence of our parent company's
commitment to building a presence in the UK commensurate with its size and
reputation in other markets'.
With Pounds 26.9m in regular premiums and Pounds 93.4m in single premiums
last year, Lincoln National was just below the 40 largest UK life companies.
LLA's income was Pounds 5.2m in regular premiums and Pounds 55.4m in single
premiums.
