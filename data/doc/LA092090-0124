LOS ANGELES HEAT DESERVED BETTER NEWS PLAY 
Paul McLeod's account of the Los Angeles Heat's game vs. San Francisco (Times, 
Sept. 9) must have been heavily edited. One of the most important aspects of 
the game was omitted: the superb penalty-kick save by Mike Littman on a shot by 
San Francisco's Townsend Qin. 
This was a game of very high standards played before 3,500 that was dismissed 
by The Times in a postscript the previous day. 
In a few short months, Bobby Sibbald has woven a championship-caliber team. So 
let us give credit to Sibbald and the Heat, who made it to the championship 
final, and hope they will continue to satisfy their growing core of fans in 
Torrance at El Camino Stadium, not at West Torrance High.
