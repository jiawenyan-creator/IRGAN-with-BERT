FT  30 DEC 93 / Soldier wounded in bomb blast in centre of Belfast
A soldier was wounded in the hand in a bomb attack near the centre of
Belfast last night. Police said a device was fired from the front garden of
a house at passing police and army vehicles. They said the injured soldier
was not badly hurt. Earlier a device had exploded in the centre of the city
as police officers were passing in a car. Nobody was hurt in that incident.
There have been five terrorist attacks in the province since the IRA
Christmas ceasefire ended on Sunday. They are seen as part of an IRA policy
of inflicting minimal damage while a formal response to the Anglo-Irish
peace declaration was being debated within the republican movement.
