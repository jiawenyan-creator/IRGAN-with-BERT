  [Text] Corruption is the most serious flaw a politician can 
have, according to a poll of 1,000 Argentines conducted in the 
Federal Capital and Greater Buenos Aires by the New Majority 
Studies Center consultancy. 
  According to the study, 77.3 percent of those queried said 
corruption was the most serious flaw a politician can have, 18.1 
percent cited dishonesty, 2.7 percent thought it was infidelity, 
and 1.8 percent pointed to lack of seriousness [frivolidad]. 
  The poll, conducted during February 1994, showed that 85.1 
percent of Argentines polled in the Federal Capital view 
corruption as the most serious flaw as opposed to 72.9 percent 
in Greater Buenos Aires. 
  By political affiliation, voters belonging to the UCeDe 
[Democratic Center Union], United Socialist, and Grand Front 
parties assigned greater significance to corruption as a 
politician's most serious flaw than did voters of the PJ 
[Justicialist Party], UCR [Radical Civil Union], and Modin 
[Movement for Independence and Dignity] who felt that dishonesty 
was most significant. 
  Furthermore, more men than women cited corruption as the 
worst flaw.
