FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: APH listing this month
Automotive Precision Holdings, a precision engineering company that exports
80 per cent of its products to North America, is planning to come to the
market later this month with a valuation of around Pounds 50m.
The company was bought by the management four years ago for a total of
Pounds 5.7m from Hunting, the defence, aviation and oil group. Mr Stefan
Petszaft, managing director, said the team of five managers in the buy-out
team were expecting to retain 50 to 55 per cent of the equity after
flotation. The company would receive only Pounds 2.5m of the new money,
which would be used for costs, repayment of borrowings and additional
working capital.
APH was breaking even on turnover of Pounds 14m at the time of the buy-out.
Last year profits before non-recurring items were Pounds 4.9m on turnover of
Pounds 17m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.9m.
