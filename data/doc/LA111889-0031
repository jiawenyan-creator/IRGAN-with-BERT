NO MORE 'CHICKEN SOUP' 
I am neither Catholic nor Jewish, and I want to say that I loved Jackie Mason's 
character on "Chicken Soup." 
My word, he was always handing out sensible advice, saving the situation and 
being funny at the same time! What could possibly have offended the Jewish 
people? 
Frankly, the Irish should have been offended. The program showed the Irishman 
in a much less attractive light.
