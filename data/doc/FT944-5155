FT  05 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt
As pressure grows in the US for a further interest rate rise after the
latest employment figures, German economists continue to argue over whether
the Bundesbank will produce a further rate cut in the present economic cycle
before heading upwards again.
This week's crop of indicators, including third-quarter GDP, manufacturing
orders for October and unemployment in November, are likely to show that the
German economy continues to be fairly robust after this year's recovery.
Since the Bundesbank is known to be concerned about gathering inflationary
pressures as industry's capacity utilisation continues to grow, a further
interest rate cut is unlikely at Thursday's central bank council meeting.
'The Bundesbank will not ease further in this interest rate cycle,' said Mr
Gunther Thumann, economist at Salomon Brothers, categorically.
Among those ranged alongside him are Goldman Sachs, Bayerische Vereinsbank
and Industrial Bank of Japan. The Bundesbank, however, has tried to keep the
bond market calm by suggesting that the next move could be either way.
So far, this has worked reasonably well. In two weeks' time, however, all
eyes will be on the Bundesbank again when it sets the M3 target range for
1995 and thus gives a clue to its monetary intentions.
