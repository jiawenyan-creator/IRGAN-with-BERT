RAP BIBLE STORIES 
The convoluted non-thinking of Kris Parker and Steve Hochman is amazing. 
Hochman's idea is that Parker's lyrics send "a powerful black pride message." 
Those lyrics are based on Parker's nonsensical notion that the Bible supports 
him. Hell, the Bible supports anything; it all depends on the interpreter. 
Remember, Hitler was a Christian, and so was Jim Jones.
