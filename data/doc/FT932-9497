FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Rise of 13.8% at Zurich
Insurance
ZURICH Insurance, Switzerland's biggest insurer and one of the largest in
the world, reported that both life and non-life business contributed to a
13.8 per cent rise in 1992 net profits, Reuter reports from Zurich.
The company posted group net earnings of SFr491.4m (Dollars 327.6m) against
SFr431.8m in 1991.
It said non-life insurance business had contributed to the increase in spite
of the increased burden from natural catastrophes, but that the bigger
contribution came from growth in its life insurance business.
At the same time, investment earnings rose 10.8 per cent to SFr4.1bn.
Zurich reported a 10 per cent increase in its gross premium income -
equivalent to turnover in other sectors - to SFr21.5bn, although it noted
that some two fifths of the increase stemmed from acquisitions.
The company will give fuller details of its 1992 performance at its annual
news conference on June 2.
