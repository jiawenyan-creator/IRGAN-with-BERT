FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Reed Exec loss narrows to Pounds 177,000
REED EXECUTIVE, the employment agency, cut interim pre-tax losses from
Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 177,000.
The figure for the six months to July 4 was achieved on turnover of Pounds
43.2m, against Pounds 40.8m. The result was in line with expectations
expressed in April.
The company said this had resulted in positive cash inflow of Pounds
930,000. However, that excluded the repayment of Pounds 630,000 of ACT,
previously provided, which has been deferred.
Reed has made small profits every month since May but said the full-year
outcome depended on the inevitable loss in December being contained so that
it did not negate the profits for the previous 11 months.
Losses for the period were 0.9p (5.8p) per share.
