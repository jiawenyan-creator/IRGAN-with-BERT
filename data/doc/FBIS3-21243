<H5>  Outline of Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX) </H5>
  The Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX) is Japan's first 
chance to conduct a test in which a test vehicle will re-enter 
the atmosphere from earth orbit. The test will be conducted as 
part of a series of flight experiments to develop the H-II 
Orbiting Plane (HOPE). OREX is designed to develop the designing 
and manufacturing technology for a flying object which must 
endure orbital re-entry and to serve the development of HOPE 
with data obtained on aerodynamic force and heating conditions. 
  The OREX test vehicle will be launched with the H-II TF-1 
rocket and, after circling the earth once, will begin to 
re-enter the atmosphere. On the re-entry, the vehicle will 
gather experimental data, transmit the data to the ground and, 
then, splash down in the central Pacific Ocean. OREX is 
scheduled on 1 February 1994. 
  The test project is being conducted in joint research 
between 
the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). 
<H5>  Purposes of OREX Vehicle </H5>
  The aim of OREX is the development of the critical 
technology 
for the re-entry of HOPE into the atmosphere from orbit prior to 
returning to the earth and to obtain the following data 
regarding the re-entry: 
  --Basic data on aerodynamic force and aerodynamic heating 
during re-entry flight. 
  --Basic data on heat resisting structure during re-entry 
flight. 
  --Basic data on the communications blackout phenomenon, in 
which communication is cut out during re-entry. 
  --Basic data on navigation with GPS receiver in re-entry, 
etc. 
<H5>  Test Vehicle </H5>
  The shape of the OREX test vehicle will resemble the front 
part of the HOPE and will have a conic style with an obtuse 
nose. The front face of the test machine, which undergoes severe 
aerodynamic heating at the time of re-entry, consists of 
carbon/carbon material (C/C) and ceramic tiles, both slated to 
be employed on the HOPE, and their heat resisting performance 
will be tested. 
  The C/C nose in the center of the front face has an 
aeroshell 
structure with a diameter of 1.8 meters and a curvature radius 
of 1.35 meters and is one of the largest solid-type noses in the 
world. 
  The test vehicle will carry a guidance control system, a 
communication control system, a propulsion system, a speed 
reduction system and an experiment and measuring system. The 
Drawing of the test vehicle is shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) and 
in the main specifications in Table 1.

<H5>  Flight Plans </H5>
  The test vehicle will be launched with an H-II rocket into a 
circular orbit at an altitude of about 450 kilometers. The 
vehicle will circle the earth once in about one hour and 40 
minutes, when it will apply a reverse jet to pull out of orbit 
within visible range of NASDA's Tanegashima and Ogasawara 
stations. 
  After separation from orbit, the experiment vehicle will 
gradually drop to lower altitudes and re-enter the atmosphere 
over the central Pacific two hours after launch. 



  After the re-entry, the temperature of the test vehicle's 
front face will rise to about 1,570 degrees centigrade by 
aerodynamic heating. The electric waves transmitted from the 
test vehicle will be reflected, dispersed and absorbed by 
electrolytic dissociation air around the vehicle and 
communication with the ground will become impossible. This is 
the communication blackout phenomenon. The vehicle's conditions 
during the blackout will be measured by sensors installed in 
various parts of the vehicle and will be recorded in a data 
memory, an onboard instrument. 



  When the phases of aerodynamic heating and the communication 
blackout end, the test vehicle will convey the data recorded 
during the blackout to vessel and airplane stations waiting near 
its scheduled splashdown area. The vehicle will splash down in 
the central Pacific south of Christmas Island about two hours 
and ten minutes after its launching. 
<H5>  Experiment Plans </H5>
  The OREX test vehicle will gather data between separation 
from the H-II launcher and its splashdown in the Pacific after 
circling the earth. The measured data will be basically 
transmitted in real time. However, communication with the 
receiving stations becomes impossible in some parts of the orbit 
and during the section of the communication blackout. To solve 
this problem, the measured data will be kept in data memory, to 
be retrieved when the electric wave linkage is restored with the 
receiving stations, and then transmitted. 
  The outlines of the experiment and onboard sensors are shown 
in Table 2.
