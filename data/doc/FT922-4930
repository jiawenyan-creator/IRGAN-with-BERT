FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Leigh blames recession for 5% fall
LEIGH INTERESTS, the waste management company, blamed low levels of waste
production in the south of England for a 5 per cent fall in profits for the
year to March 31.
Despite two acquisitions, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds
14.1m on sales up 23 per cent at Pounds 118.8m.
Earnings per share fell from 18p to 15.5p but the company is recommending
the payment of a final dividend of 5.37p, giving a total of 7.83p, compared
with 7.64p.
Mr Malcolm Wood, chairman, said signs of the recession continued in the
south of England where waste volumes generated and handled were lower than
at the same time last year.
The company had responded by cutting back the relevant operations.
At an operating level profits advanced by 24 per cent to Pounds 17m, helped
by the acquisitions. However, an interest charge of Pounds 2.93m compared
with interest earned last year of Pounds 982,000 led to the fall in pre-tax
profits.
The company had decided to take advantage of low asset prices by spending
Pounds 23.1m to buy the Gerrards Cross Waste Disposal Company, operating
near the junction of the M40 and the M25, and Ideal Aggregates, which has
its biggest landfill asset near Rugby.
These acquisitions took gearing to 50 per cent, a level which the company
said it expects to persist through this year.
The company is about to commission the UK's first wet-air oxidation plant in
Birmingham which will treat aqueous organic waste without resorting to
expensive incineration.
