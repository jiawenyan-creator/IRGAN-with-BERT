  [Text] Budapest, 18 Apr (MTI) -- A stable government is 
assured in the wake of Hungary's parliamentary elections in May, 
in spite of the fact that certain parties are trying scare 
tactics on the population with their election remarks, Ivan 
Peto, the chairman of Hungary's largest opposition party, the 
Alliance of Free Democrats (AFD), said at a press conference in 
Zalaegerszeg (W Hungary) on Monday. 
  According to the AFD Chairman, a coalition of parties 
collectively holding a 60 per cent majority of the votes would 
guarantee a secure governing position. 
  Peto was of the opinion that votes between the liberal 
parties and the Socialist Party will decide who will replace the 
current government.
