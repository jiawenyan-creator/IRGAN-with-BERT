FT  16 NOV 94 / Bosnian rebels 'to join Serbs'
Forces loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, the ousted Moslem leader, are being
mobilised to join a Serb offensive against Bihac, the northwestern Moslem
enclave, UN officials said yesterday. 'Our estimate is that Mr Abdic is
presently mobilising a force of at least 5,000 from refugee camps,' Mr
Michael Williams, UN spokesman told reporters. Bosnian Serb forces are
reportedly closing in on Bihac; Mr Williams yesterday confirmed they fired
seven Sam anti-aircraft missiles at the Bihac pocket on Monday. About 30,000
civilians and soldiers last August fled the Bihac pocket, designated a UN
safe area, after being defeated by Bosnian government forces. They lived
under difficult living conditions in Serb-held lands in Croatia, when Zagreb
refused to let them cross into the self-styled Serb state. Local Serbs have
re-armed Mr Abdic's soldiers, apparently preparing an assault from Croatia,
which borders the Bihac pocket, the dense Moslem heartland.
