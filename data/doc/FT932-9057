FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Improvement for ANZ in first six
months
ANZ GROUP, the big Australian bank, yesterday reported a 25.6 per cent
increase in net profits to ADollars 170.3m (USDollars 121m) for the six
months ended March 1993.
For the whole of last year ANZ ran up net losses of ADollars 578m following
heavy provisions for bad loans.
Gross income for the first half of this year fell nearly 13 per cent to
ADollars 4.6bn but the bank is holding its dividend at 10 cents per share.
Mr Don Mercer, the chief executive officer, said the bank could look forward
to doing better than the latest results.
'Nevertheless, what we have achieved is not an unreasonable result, bringing
a 7 per cent return on shareholders' funds. It is also a first step back to
profits after the problems of 1991-92,' he said.
Net profit was helped by a reduction in the provision for bad and doubtful
debts to ADollars 377m. During the previous six months ended September 1992,
provision for bad debt was ADollars 1.2bn.
There was overall improvement in the performance of the group's divisions,
with the Australian business banking operations reducing losses to ADollars
33.5m from ADollars 73m in the same period last year. Esanda, the financing
arm, turned around from a loss of ADollars 33.8m to a net profit of ADollars
13.4m.
International banking suffered a slight setback, with net profit in the
division declining to ADollars 82m from ADollars 96.4m.
Non-accrual or problem loans have fallen to ADollars 2.73bn from ADollars
3.53bn since the end of the financial year.
