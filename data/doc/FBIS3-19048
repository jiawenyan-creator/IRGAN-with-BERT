<F P=106> [Report signed "J.-M.C.": "LE MONDE's Special Envoy Not </F>
Wanted in Tunisia"] 
  [Text] Through the Tunisian External Communication Agency 
(ATCE), the Tunisian authorities recently informed Jacques de 
Barrin, LE MONDE's special envoy who was preparing to visit 
their country to cover the 20 March presidential and 
parliamentary elections, that he was not wanted in Tunisia and 
that, if he tried to enter the country, he would be turned back. 
  Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of Tunisian 
authorities hounding "malicious media." In the past few weeks, 
the BBC correspondent was expelled from Tunisia, while KUNA, the 
Kuwaiti News Agency, narrowly avoided having its local office 
closed. And what can be said about the many problems facing our 
Tunisian colleagues in exercising their profession, because 
they, just like the special envoys of the foreign media, are 
forced to work under close surveillance. What can be said also 
about the refusal to sell foreign newspapers, including LE 
MONDE, when their content is judged to be hostile. 
  Does the struggle against religious fundamentalism justify 
the country's political life being suspended and the government 
being afraid of its own shadow? The resulting image does not 
fit with the one intended by the man who, in removing Habib 
Bourguiba from power on 7 November 1987, presented himself to 
his fellow citizens as "the man of change."
