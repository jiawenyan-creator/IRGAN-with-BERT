FT  02 NOV 92 / Company support for wages councils
MANY smaller companies support the retention of wages councils, according to
a survey by the independent IDS pay research group, Catherine Milton writes.
The Department of Employment has recently restated its view that the
councils, which set minimum pay for about 2.5m workers in low-paid
industries, have no permanent place in the labour market.
The IDS survey shows employers are 'deeply divided' over the councils. Many
smaller companies, and some large companies, say the annual increases are
useful for reviewing pay rates. The IDS says: 'Arguably wages councils
fulfil the role for which they were created - to protect small companies and
their workers from competition by undercutting wages.'
