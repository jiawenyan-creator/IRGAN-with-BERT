FT  24 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Asda
Asda's closure of Lofthouse Foods will come as a devastating blow to its
employees but will only confirm the management's reputation for hard-headed
pragmatism. The bacon and sausage meat company lost Pounds 2.5m in the first
half of the year. Conditions have not improved since. Lofthouse's markets
are in long term decline because of consumers' diminishing appetite for red
meat. There is significant overcapacity and Lofthouse could never hope to be
as efficient manufacturers as Hillsdown Holdings.
Since Asda will not adopt the FRS3 accounting standard for this year's
results, the closure costs will be taken below the line. They will be more
than offset by the gains from the disposal of Asda's MFI stake. The bigger
strategic question, though, concerns the future of the company's loss-making
Allied Maples carpet subsidiary. Allied Maples has been heavily rationalised
but is still struggling against fierce competition. Asda must hope that a
pick-up in market demand will permit a recovery and subsequent sale.
This would leave Asda free to concentrate on maintaining the momentum of its
core food operations. Despite recent progress, it still has a huge amount to
do to ensure its long term viability. Budgens' link-up with the giant German
Rewe group suggests that even the industry's smaller fry are shaping up for
the fight.
