FT  21 DEC 93 / Burton gives chief executive 60% rise
Mr John Hoerner, chief executive of fashion retail group Burton, enjoyed a
pay increase of at least 60 per cent to Pounds 624,000 for the year to
August, according to the annual report published yesterday.
Mr Hoerner, an American who became chief executive in February 1992, has won
praise in the City for turning Burton around after its profits collapse of
the early 1990s, but his pay increase may raise some eyebrows.
Part of the explanation is his decision not to take a pay rise when
appointed chief executive, but to respect a group-wide pay freeze. That
means for the year to August 1992 he was not the group's highest-paid
director - shown in the accounts to have earned Pounds 357,000 plus
performance-related payments of Pounds 35,000.
Mr Hoerner is thought to have earned about Pounds 325,000 that year,
although the size of his bonus is unknown.
He decided to take his entitlement last year, however, and received total
pay of Pounds 453,000, plus performance related payments of Pounds 171,000.
In the same year, Burton transformed an Pounds 800,000 loss into an Pounds
18.5m profit.
But Mr Hoerner has some distance to go to match former Burton chairman Sir
Ralph Halpern, whose total pay peaked at Pounds 1.36m in 1987, before
tailing off to Pounds 640,000 in 1990. He also lags behind compatriot Mr
David Dworkin, who carried out a similar rescue mission at Storehouse before
returning to the US in February, shortly after receiving a Pounds 2.7m bonus
on top of total pay of Pounds 575,000.
