FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Belgian metals group back in
profit
DRASTIC restructuring of Union Miniere's operations has helped the Belgian
non-ferrous metals group back into profit for the first half of 1992.
But a BFr1bn (Dollars 34m) extraordinary loss on the sale of the group's
stake in Hessenatie, its freight handling subsidiary, dragged the overall
interim result into the red.
The group, 82 per cent of which is owned by the holding company Societe
Generale de Belgique, made a profit of BFr416m before tax and extraordinary
items, compared with a loss of BFr1.32bn in the six months to June 30 1991.
The company forecast that it would break even for the full year, assuming
there was no further deterioration in the economic situation.
Operating profit rose from BFr4m to BFr894m in the first half. The company
attributed this increase to the BFr2.4bn rationalisation programme announced
last December, and increases in margins on some raw materials.
After tax and extraordinary charges of BFr1.49bn, the group share of
first-half losses was BFr1.39bn, compared with losses of BFr1.33bn last
year.
Turnover rose from BFr59.5bn to BFr66bn in the first six months of the year.
