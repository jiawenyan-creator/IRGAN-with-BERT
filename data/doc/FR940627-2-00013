<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 The applications and related documents are available for review upon written request or by appointment in the Permits
Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Room 13130, Silver Spring, MD 20910 (301/7132289);
and


(P63C and P566) - Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, CA 908024213 (310/9804016);
and 
(P63C) - Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK99802 (907/5867221).
Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on these requests, should be submitted to the Director, Office

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The subject permits are requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C.
1361 

et

 

seq

.) and the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216).


Dr. Robert Elsner (P63C) requests authority to obtain six harbor seals (

Phoca

 

vitulina

 

richardii

) from beached/stranded and rehabilitated animals at Sea World to conduct physiological research. The objective
is to extend the studies on isolated coronary arteries to intact, conscious seals to determine the effect of prostaglandin
inhibitors and other agents on coronary blood flow during experimental dives. The animals will be returned to Sea
World after each use.
Dr. Paul Ponganis (P566) requests authority to capture from the wild and release up to 20 elephant seals (

Mirounga

 

angustirostris

), and obtain from rehabilitated stock up to 10 elephant seals and 6 harbor seals (

Phoca

 

vitulina

). Rehabilitated animals will be obtained from Sea World and released directly to sea (off La Jolla) at completion
of experiments. Initial techniques, instrument development and testing will be conducted on rehabilitated animals.
The objective of the study is to utilize the elephant seal to better understand the metabolic and physiological responses
to extreme breathholding, and during sleep apnea and forced submersion, to compare metabolic rate, organ blood flow
regulation, and the time course of oxygen depletion in different body compartments.
