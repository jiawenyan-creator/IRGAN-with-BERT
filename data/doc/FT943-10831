FT  03 AUG 94 / Bias case broker denies she lied
A City insurance broker who is claiming unfair dismissal and sexual
discrimination told an industrial tribunal yesterday that she was sacked
after she was wrongly accused of lying to a Lloyd's underwriter while
conducting a deal.
Miss Samantha Phillips was an aviation broker for Willis Corroon. She said
she was persecuted by her manager and then ultimately fired after she
allegedly spurned the advances of Mr Giles Wilkinson, head of production at
Willis Corroon.
Mr Wilkinson denies harassing Miss Phillips and the company claims she was
dismissed for gross misconduct.
At yesterday's hearing at Croydon, south London, Miss Phillips said she had
been banned from doing business with LA Hudson, the underwriter, after a
deal had gone wrong.
When she asked for the ban to be revoked, she said she was called into a
meeting with Mr Wilkinson. She denied suggestions she had failed to inform
LA Hudson that she had contacted other underwriters about insurance cover
her company was seeking to arrange for a client.
She was later suspended, and four days after that, dismissed.
It was earlier alleged that Mr Wilkinson had made advances toward Miss
Phillips and that he interrupted a business trip in 1992 to join her in
Denmark.
She alleged that after she rebuffed him, he became 'derisive and negative'
and he once told her in front of other brokers: 'Back down, bimbo.'
