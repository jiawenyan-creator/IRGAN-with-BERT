FT  31 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow restricted to slight rise
in very thin trade
Wall Street
UNCERTAINTY about the economy and corporate earnings continued to plague US
stock markets yesterday, and at the end of the quietest trading session this
year share prices were virtually unchanged, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 3.80 at 3,235.24.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 0.50 at 403.00,
while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks slipped 2.60 to
602.07. Turnover on the New York SE was extremely light at 134.2m shares.
The market continues to search for a new direction, but the lack of
convincing news that the economy was on the mend and that corporate profits
were rebounding kept investors on the sidelines yesterday.
The only economic data released during the session was disappointing - a 2.7
per cent fall in new single-family home sales during February. The market
had expected a rise in home sales, and the decline reversed the recent
pattern which appeared to show a decent recovery in the US housing market.
Chrysler rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 5/8 in active trading after
Prudential Securities, the broking house, upgraded its rating on the car
maker's stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy'. General Motors was up Dollars  1/8
at Dollars 36 3/4 and Ford Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 38 3/4 .
Banks were weaker, especially those leading issues still troubled by reports
of financial problems at Olympia &amp; York, the property developer, which last
week admitted that it faced a serious cash flow problem because of its
billion-dollar debt burden. Among the biggest declines were two banks said
to have some of the greatest exposure to O &amp; Y: Chemical, down Dollars 1 1/4
at Dollars 33 3/8 , and Citibank, Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 17.
Boeing firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 on news of an order for 15
twin-jet 757s from USAir (off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 17 1/2 ), which should
be worth about Dollars 900m to the aircraft manufacturer.
Varian Associates dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 39 as the market digested
the news late on Friday that the company had failed to reach an agreement on
the sale of its vacuum-making operations.
Helene Curtis advanced Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 39 1/8 in the wake of a big
improvement in the healthcare and beauty products group's fourth-quarter
profits, which rose from 28 cents a share a year ago to 69 cents a share in
the final quarter of 1991.
On the over-the-counter market Intel fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 53 1/4 and on
the NYSE Advanced Micro Devices eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 17 3/8 after
the two stocks were downgraded by PaineWebber semiconductor analyst Mr John
Lazlo because of the threat of competition from a chip produced by Cyrix.

WEAKNESS in banks and real estate and construction stocks more than offset
gains in other indices in Toronto, sending the market moderately lower.
Nervousness over Olympia &amp; York's cash flow problems and the constitutional
squabble continued to weigh on the market.
The composite index was finally 10.1 down at 3,406.7. Declines outnumbered
advances by 270 to 230 after modest volume of 23.7m shares valued at
CDollars 234.4m.
