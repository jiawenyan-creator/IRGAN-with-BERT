BRIEFLY 
Oil Price Soars: Energy futures headed higher, paced by rising prices for crude 
oil and wholesale home heating oil. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the 
April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 
44 cents higher at $18.72 a barrel, adding to Wednesday's gain of 13 cents. 
Contracts for more distant months posted slightly smaller increases. Among 
other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, April unleaded 
gasoline rose to 52.21 cents a gallon from 51.56. Chris Gohler, in the energy 
group of Elders Futures Inc., said a combination of fundamental and technical 
factors pushed up crude prices.
