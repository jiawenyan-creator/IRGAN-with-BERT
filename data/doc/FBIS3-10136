  [Text] Today Congress approved the request to promulgate 
the Social Emergency Fund. A total of 439 legislators were 
present, and the measure passed with 372 votes in favor, 61 
votes against, and six abstentions. 
  The bill establishing the fund could be promulgated even 
tonight if a proposal put forth by Deputy Germano Rigotto is 
accepted. He proposed to vote on a request to give priority to 
a vote on the political chapter that includes the deadline for 
incompatibility, and then close the session. A new session 
could then be convened immediately afterwards to promulgate the 
Social Emergency Fund. In this case the decision would be 
published in the congressional newspaper tomorrow. 
  Some political parties are concerned with the reduction of 
the period on incompatibility for running in the upcoming 
election. Rigotto's request was approved, although following a 
request to verify the quorum.
