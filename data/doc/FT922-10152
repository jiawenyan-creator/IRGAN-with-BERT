FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): Smaller companies pick up
Investors are still waiting for the long term outperformance of smaller
company shares to reappear. As the graph shows, Footsie stocks have easily
outstripped those in the much broader All-Share Index since the start of
1989. This week, small company shares have continued their post-election
rally, with the Hoare Govett index (capital gains version) up 2.4 per cent
to 1248.57 over the seven days to April 30 and the County index also rising
2.4 per cent to 984.92 over the same period.
