FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Sparkling with extra class - Vintage Champagne
/ Giles MacDonogh sips some special cuvees
The Krug brothers used to say that they preferred their (admittedly rather
special) Grande Cuvee to their vintage wines. After all, while God makes
vintage champagne, only a highly talented mortal can make wines as great as
the Krug Grande Cuvee.
Vintages are not declared every year, for the very simple reason that God is
not always that kind to champagne growers. There are miserable years in this
northernmost outpost of French viticulture when the grapes scarcely ripen.
To make drinkable champagne in years such as these, you need to add reserve
wines from other years to achieve the weight and balance required of
champagne.
The 1980s, however, proved to be a champagne-maker's dream decade. All the
major houses declared vintages in 1982, '83, '85, '86, '88, '89 and '90 and
some declared other years, too. During the economic boom times, the wines
walked off the shelves with such indecent speed that they were often a
little on the raw side - or 'green' to use the technical term.
The quality of the decade and the recession, however, have had one
beneficial effect: stocks are high, and the wines released these days have a
touch more maturity than many of those sloshed back in the days of
enrichissez-vous and Margaret Thatcher. Most of the top champagnes (or
grandes marques) are now released when they are five years old.
Champagne is a blend of three grape varieties: Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir and
Chardonnay. Pinot Meunier does not generally figure in vintage champagne, as
it is not considered able to age with dignity. And although there are some
fabulously rich Chardonnay vintage champagnes, it is the black Pinot Noir
which gives the body to most of the great vintage wines.
A young vintage champagne often has a bouquet of fresh fruit: crushed
raspberries or strawberries. As it gets older, an increasingly toasty, nutty
character creeps in. When it is really old, it sometimes smells a little of
old rose petals in a pot-pourri.
English people are supposed to like the taste of really old champagne, and I
have heard it said that a vintage should not be broached before it is 10
years old. A really ripe vintage of this sort, such as an '83, would be
perfect now. On the other hand, such wines are hard to find.
Many people open a bottle of champagne at Christmas, either around the tree
while the presents are being unwrapped or at the lunch table later. In
general, non-vintage cuvees are fine without food; they have an aperitif
effect as the sharpness of the acidity begins to stir the stomach juices.
A mature vintage champagne, on the other hand, goes very well with the first
course of a Christmas meal - either with oysters, smoked salmon or - in the
case of the richer, older wines - foie gras.
The FT tasted 22 vintage champagnes available in the shops this Christmas.
The foIlowing are recommended.
1990. Deutz - a firm which has specialised in champagne for laying down in
the past. This would benefit from a few years more in the bottle. Pounds
21.05 from Laytons or Andre Simon shops (071-387 2552).
1989. Most of these would profit from a little more time to mellow the
wines.
Drappier - fresh raspberry character but quite sharp still. Pounds 15.76
from Threshers and Wine Rack.
Taittinger - a superbly complex wine with the redolence of fresh pressed
roses. Pounds 27 to Pounds 30 from Selfridges or Irvine Robertson of Leith.
1988. This is the first vintage to be properly ready this Christmas,
although there is certainly no hurry to drink up.
Laurent Perrier - superb balance with a lovely lemon peel tang. Pounds 23 to
Pounds 27 from Oddbins, Lay and Wheeler (01206-76446) or EN Booth
(01772-204316).
Henriot - a lovely champagne with a bouquet of hazelnuts, but it needs more
time. Pounds 19.05 from Cellar 5.
Pommery - showing already a mature character of bread and white truffles. It
is very much a food wine and would be delicious with foie gras. Pounds 19.75
from Bibendum (071-722 5577).
Veuve Cliquot - another big wine ideal for food. Pounds 25.95 to Pounds
29.50 from Waitrose, Harvey Nichols (071-235 5000), La Reserve (071-589
2020), Eldridge Pope (0305-251 251) or Fortnum and Mason (071-734 8040).
Roederer - rich again (honey and apples) and another food wine. Pounds 29
from Harrods, Tanners, Laytons, Justerini and Brooks, Lay and Wheeler, Berry
Bros and James Nicholson.
Pol Roger - a big Pinot Noir wine with plenty of fresh raspberry tastes and
one of the great wines of the vintage. Pounds 28 from Berry Bros, Harrods,
Tanners (0743-232400), Valvona and Crolla (031-556 1668) and Bennetts of
Chipping Camden (0836-840392).
Bollinger - potentially the best of all but a slow developer and one to lay
down. Pounds 30 from Sainsbury, Majestic, Bottoms Up, Threshers, Oddbins and
Wine Rack.
1986. Alain Thienot - an interesting champagne which would be good with more
highly flavoured foods: Pounds 20 to Pounds 23 from Robersons, Barnes Wine
Shop or the Clifton Cellar in Bristol.
Ruinart - this champagne is a point and one of the loveliest wines in the
tasting. With its nutty bouquet, it would be superb with food. Erick
Bequemont, of the Four Seasons Hotel, suggested a salade folle with foie
gras. Pounds 21.60 from Bibendum.
Billecart-Salmon - tasting of raspberries and cream and a very delicate,
feminine champagne. Pounds 28 from Harvey Nichols or Adnams of Southwold.
1985. Alfred Gratien - call 0342-315105 for stockists. Pounds 33.
Piper Heidsieck - the only really old-tasting champagne in the tasting.
Perhaps a little like Miss Haversham but it will have its admirers. Pounds
18 to Pounds 20.50 from Davy's of London, Les Caves du Patron of Leicester,
Vin de Bordeaux of Oldham or Best Cellars of Devon.
Bruno Paillard - creamy bread and walnuts, just right for this Christmas.
Pounds 22.95 from Le Nez Rouge (071-609 4711).
Charles Heidsieck - strawberry mousse, soft and luscious, it could even be
drunk with bland fowl such as turkey. Pounds 27.50 to Pounds 30 from
Selfridges, Fenwicks of Newcastle, Cavendish House of Cheltenham, or Binns
of Darlington.
Krug - nuts, raspberries and lemon, astonishingly complex, this really is
God's wine. Pounds 66 to Pounds 75 from Oddbins, Harrods, Selfridges or
Threshers.
