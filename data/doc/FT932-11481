FT  04 MAY 93 / Letter: Ozal's domestic achievements
Sir, While Edward Mortimer is correct to stress the late Mr Turgut Ozal's
international achievements ('Friend when in need', April 28), Mr Ozal's
domestic rehabilitation is equally important. Under Mr Ozal, Turkey became a
country worth dealing with and investing in. He pushed Turkey away from
nationalism and authoritarianism. If western leaders want Turkey to continue
becoming more tolerant of diversity and more concerned with the creation of
wealth, they should have paid Mr Ozal the tribute he deserved by attending
his funeral.
