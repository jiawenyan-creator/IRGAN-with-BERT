FT  20 AUG 94 / Private finance agreed for Tube
London Underground has signed its first deal under the government's private
finance initiative involving the supply of computing services to its
engineering department in London.
It has reached a Pounds 10m agreement for Electronic Data Systems to provide
and maintain computing services - including hardware, software, maintenance
and support - over five years. The agreement covers the seven floors of the
engineering directorate's new offices at Canary Wharf in Docklands.
The contract sets performance standards with penalties for any failure to
meet set targets. EDS, based in Uxbridge, west London, will decide how to
meet these requirements and accept the risk that its choices of hardware and
software are correct and that its staff can provide the agreed level of
support.
The contract meets the Treasury's guidelines on bringing private finance
into the public sector because EDS takes a share in the risk.
Mr David Bailey, London Underground's development director, said: 'This is a
way to increase the level of investment in public-sector organisations.'
The underground is attempting to involve private finance in other investment
projects, notably plans to modernise rolling stock on the Northern Line and
to install automatic access barriers at more stations. These schemes have
yet to win the approval of the Treasury.
