GUNMAN FLEES WITH RESTAURANT'S RECEIPTS 
A gunman held up three restaurant employees early Monday morning and stole 
several thousands dollars before fleeing, police said. 
The employees, a busboy, manager and bartender, were unharmed, police said. 
The robbery occurred shortly after midnight at El Torito Grill, 951 Newport 
Center Drive. The gunman entered the restaurant as the employees were preparing 
to close for the evening, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
No patrons were in the restaurant at the time, he said. 
The gunman ordered the employees to the back of the restaurant and made them 
tie each other up, Gonis said. 
The robber then fled with the day's receipts, estimated at several thousand 
dollars, Gonis said.
