FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Finnish forest profits fall by
60%
THE COMBINED pre-tax profit of Finland's publicly quoted forest groups fell
by over 60 per cent in 1990 when compared with the previous year, according
to the Central Association of Finnish Forest Industries (CAFFI).
Mr Heikki Parnanen, a CAFFI vice-president, blamed the poor result of the
country's forest groups on high labour and production costs.
He said that the industry's debt level was also a big strain. 'The net debt
of all Finnish forest companies amounts to around 60 per cent of their
turnover; 6 to 7 per cent of their turnover goes to only paying the
interests on the loans,' he added.
Mr Parnanen estimates that it will up to 2 years before the situation
improves.
'This year will be even worse than 1990. The operating margin of all Finnish
forest companies is expected to drop from 13 per cent of turnover to under
10 per cent this year,' he said, adding that export earnings could also fall
by 10 per cent in 1991.
The sector employs between 70,000 and 75,000 people. Of these, 6,500 have
already lost their jobs with another 6,500 working a shortened week. By the
end of 1991, however, Mr Parnanen estimates the number of unemployed will
drop to 10,000-15,000.
