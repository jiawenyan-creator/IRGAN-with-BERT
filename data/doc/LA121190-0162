P.M. BRIEFING; 
HONG KONG DETAILS AIRPORT COST 
The colony's proposed new airport will cost $10.2 billion (HK$79 billion) at 
1990 prices, excluding a planned new port, the government said today as it 
released detailed estimates of the project's costs for the first time. 
The airport, the most ambitious civil engineering project ever undertaken by 
Hong Kong, will be built on reclaimed land off northern Lantau Island and will 
be linked by road and rail to other parts of Hong Kong. 
Secretary to the Treasury Hamish MacLeod said the actual airport at Chek Lap 
Kok would cost $4.9 billion, with the new complex's road and transport 
infrastructure costing another $5.3 billion. When the plan was first announced 
in October last year, the government estimated the whole project, including new 
port facilities, at $16.4 billion at 1988 prices.
