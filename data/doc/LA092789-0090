MOVIE REVIEW; 
'MUTANT ON BOUNTY' ABANDONS GOOD SENSE 
"Mutant on the Bounty" (at the AMC Century 14) is too amusingly schlocky a 
title to waste on such a hopelessly inane and pointless space comedy. 
While on some sort of research mission, a spaceship crew encounters a saxophone 
player whose face is a mess after floating 23 years in space -- he's the benign 
mutant of the piece. Later on, the crew is menaced by a goofy pair of space 
bandits who have in their possession a deadly virus. Only performance artist 
John Fleck, who tries hard to be funny as a campy android, is worthy of mention 
in the entire amateurish enterprise. 
Because the AMC Century 14 is perversely screening a trailer of "Mutant on the 
Bounty" (Times-rated Mature for crude language) immediately preceding its 
presentation, you can't say you haven't been warned.KEVIN THOMAS
