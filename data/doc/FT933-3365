FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trizec prepares for asset
revaluations
TRIZEC, North America's biggest quoted property developer, is preparing to
write down the value of some assets in tandem with a financial restructuring
being negotiated with debt and equity holders.
The Calgary-based company said that it was in the throes of a 'comprehensive
revaluation' of assets and liabilities, which would be reflected in
financial statements for its fiscal year to October 31.
The revisions will include adjustments to the carrying value of the
Bay-Adelaide Centre, a half-completed, 57-storey project in Toronto on which
work has been halted.
The continuing North American property slump widened Trizec's losses to
CDollars 17.7m (USDollars 13.5m), or 10.9 cents a share, in the third
quarter to July 31, from CDollars 1.6m, or 0.5 cents, a year earlier. Losses
for the first nine months were CDollars 12.7m, or 14.3 cents, compared with
a gain of CDollars 10.4m, or 6.5 cents.
Nine-month rental revenues rose by 3.5 per cent, but the improvement was due
to the contribution of new properties and favourable exchange-rate
movements.
The company said that net rents from its office properties had been cut by
the more generous inducements needed to maintain high occupancy rates.
It described the shopping-mall market as 'difficult', with downward pressure
on rents and increased demand for higher inducements from prospective new
tenants.
Trizec said it aimed to hold a vote among holders of CDollars 1.1bn of
senior debentures on its restructuring proposals before October 20.
