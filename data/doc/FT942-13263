FT  26 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Up in smoke
Sir, I refer to your article, 'Showdown in the last gasp saloon' (April 21).
Take a lot of American puritanism, mix it with the typical shoot-it-out
mentality of the early days, add some spices of misleading and biased
science plus a spoonful of I-know-what's-good-for-you-nannyism. Stir it
well. Again, add a good portion of bureaucratic frustration of the US health
administration about the lost war on drugs and out comes the anti-smoking
frenzy of the modern US. The 'land of the free' is a bygone reflection of
better times - when a good smoke was regarded as enjoyable.
I hope Europeans will not engage in every American hype.
