FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Recruitment pushes ATA into Pounds 0.4m
loss
ATA Selection incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 400,000 in 1991 as losses
of Pounds 590,000 in the discontinued recruitment subsidiary offset a profit
of Pounds 190,000 from financial services.
There were also extraordinary charges of Pounds 521,000 for closure costs,
bringing the overall loss to Pounds 695,000 after a tax credit of Pounds
227,000.
But there were now signs of economic recovery and the remaining financial
services division was expected to improve its performance this year. With
the elimination of losses from the closed recruitment division directors
said they could report a return to profits.
In 1990 the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 41,000, comprising a
Pounds 278,000 loss in recruitment and a Pounds 319,000 surplus on the
financial side.
Turnover in 1991 came to Pounds 5.27m (Pounds 6.64m) with financial
accounting for Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 2.64m). Losses per share were 1.09p
(earnings 0.16p) and there is no dividend (interim 1p last time). The
company's shares are traded on the USM.
