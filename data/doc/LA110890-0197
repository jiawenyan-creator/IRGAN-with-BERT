ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; 
NEW COUNCILMEN MINDING BUSINESS 
Economic growth will likely become the focus of the City Council when two new 
members, who were heavily backed by the Chamber of Commerce, are sworn in later 
this month. 
Newcomers Joe Anderson, a former chamber president, and Truman Benedict, a 
retired superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District, plus 
incumbent Thomas Lorch were elected to four-year terms in Tuesday's election. 
Incumbent Brian J. Rice was defeated, and incumbent Holly Veale did not seek 
reelection. 
Anderson and Benedict ran on a strong pro-business platform and received $1,500 
donations in the campaign's final days from the San Clemente Political Action 
Committee, which is affiliated with the chamber. 
Anderson, the top vote-getter, said his priority will be to attract businesses 
to the city in an attempt to expand its tax base. 
"We have been preoccupied with residential development in this city and have 
neglected building up our economic base," he said. "We need to change that 
emphasis somewhat." 
Benedict also campaigned for broadening the city's tax base, including building 
light industry and a luxury hotel within its limits. 
"I think the voters showed they want growth, but managed growth, and that the 
business community wants greater attention," Benedict said. 
Lorch, who did not receive chamber backing, said he hopes he will be able to 
work with Anderson and Benedict, but he fears their election will give the 
chamber too much influence on the council. 
"The chamber's PAC gave them a lot of money and is going to expect them to 
listen to them," Lorch said. "Some might say the chamber is going to run this 
city." 
Rice blamed his loss on unethical campaigning by his opponents. 
"I ran a clean campaign, but the people who won were the ones who were the most 
negative," he said. "They also posted their signs illegally all over town. 
Running a clean campaign cost me the election." TERRY SPENCER
