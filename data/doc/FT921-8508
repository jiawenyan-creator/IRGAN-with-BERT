FT  17 FEB 92 / Tories to pledge inner-cities agency
THE CONSERVATIVES are to give an election pledge to set up a new development
agency to oversee the regeneration of England's crumbling inner cities.
But the plan being urged by Mr Michael Heseltine, envi-ronment secretary,
will fall short of the creation of the agency which he has long sought as a
vehicle to create new public-private sector partnerships in deprived areas.
Senior ministers said yesterday there was broad agreement in the cabinet
that the manifesto should give new focus to efforts to rebuild the inner
cities.
The general view among ministers is that, in spite of the substantial sums
spent on urban programmes, the government is widely seen as indifferent to
the plight of inner cities. Mr Heseltine is also anxious to find a suitable
umbrella organisation to oversee his plans for extensive new development
along the east Thames corridor.
The new agency would take charge of the urban programme and of the 10 urban
development corporations in England. The implication is that it would
receive substantial additional funding, although the Treasury insists that
there can be no commitments beyond those allowed in present spending plans.
On present plans it would continue to operate under the sponsorship of the
Department of the Environment, although there are suggestions that if Mr
Heseltine moved after the election, the responsibility might be transferred
with him.
