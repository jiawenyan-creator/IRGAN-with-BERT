  [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- Pending the release of an edict by 
the Russian president defining special regulations for 
privatizing property on the territory of the capital and the 
approval of a municipal program of privatization for 1994, 
Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov has suspended denationalization of 
real estate by his own instruction. 
  The document says: "To suspend temporarily the privatization 
of buildings and nonresidential premises unless they are to be 
part of the company capital of joint-stock companies set up by 
transforming state enterprises in accordance with the existing 
legislation." The mayor declined to entrust anyone with 
supervising the implementation of instruction and reserved the 
supervision for himself.
