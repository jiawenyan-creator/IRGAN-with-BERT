METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERMAN URGES IRS TO START TAXING ELKS 
Saying the public should not be compelled to subsidize racial discrimination, 
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has called on the Internal Revenue 
Service to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Van Nuys Elks Lodge, which 
rejected two black men for membership twice this month. 
In a letter to the IRS this week, Berman said the Van Nuys lodge has "forfeited 
the right to a tax exemption." 
Earlier this month the lodge rejected Jules S. Bagneris III and Thomas J. 
Montgomery on the same night two other black men were finally admitted to the 
Lompoc lodge after months of controversy. Bagneris and Montgomery reapplied and 
last week were rejected for a second time. 
Elks officials have repeatedly denied charges of racism. "The men have a right 
to vote the way they feel," said Robert Verte, secretary to the national 
organization's grand exalted ruler. 
Richard Vasquez, a Los Angeles-based IRS agent specializing in tax-exempt 
organizations, said the IRS has investigated other fraternal organizations for 
alleged civil rights violations in the past, but has never revoked any such 
organization's tax-exempt status.
