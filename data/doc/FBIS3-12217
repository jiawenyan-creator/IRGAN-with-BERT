<F P=106> [Interview with Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the PLO delegation </F>
in Washington, by Elimelekh Ram; place and date not given -- 
recorded, in English] 
  [Text] ['Urayqat] What happened in Hebron meant to all 
participants that the issue of settlements will either make or 
break this peace process. So any negotiations, in my opinion, 
that doesn't have the settlements on the top of the agenda will 
be senseless negotiations. 
  [Ram] In other words, Mr. 'Urayqat, you suggest to open the 
DOP [Declaration of Principles] and the Cairo agreements. 
  ['Urayqat] What I am saying is very clear. What I am saying 
is that the crimes, the massacres of Hebron have demonstrated to 
those in the Israeli Government who insisted to have the 
settlement issue delayed -- it has proven them wrong. If they 
want peace, real peace, it means this issue must be on the 
agenda. 
  [Ram] Okay, Sir, so I repeat my question: You mean to open 
the agreement, the DOP and the Cairo agreement? 
  ['Urayqat] Yes.
