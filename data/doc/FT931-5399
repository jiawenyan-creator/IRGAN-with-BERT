FT  05 MAR 93 / Malaysia ready to tackle power crisis
A COMPLETE overhaul of Malaysia's electricity system has been proposed by a
British consultancy firm called in to examine increasing problems of power
supply in the country.
The UK-based National Grid Company made the recommendations in the midst of
what the government admits is a power crisis.
Late last year almost all of peninsula Malaysia was without electricity
supply for several hours after what the authorities said was a lightning
strike a power plant.
In recent weeks Tenaga Nasional, the recently partially privatised
electricity utility, has said power cuts have been occurring throughout the
country due to maintenance and upgrading work. It says full supplies might
not resume for some months.
Power supplies have failed to keep pace with demand as Malaysia's economy
has grown by more than 8 per cent in each of the last five years. Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, has ordered that restoration of full
power supplies be given top priority.
It is feared power shortages might deter foreign investors. Mrs Rafidah
Aziz, minister for trade and industry, says complaints from industrialists
has reached an 'intolerable' level.
Malaysia is at present allowing local and foreign concerns to build, own and
operate a number of power stations. Malaysia favours Russia's new offer for
jet fighter sales and has ordered a detailed study, Defence Minister Najib
Abdul Razak said. Russia is competing with the US to sell replacements for
ageing fighters.
