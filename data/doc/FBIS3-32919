  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin revealed today that Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria has enough support to obtain the OAS 
secretary general position if the president decides to run for 
it. 
  During an informal talk with reporters following her meeting 
with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, who is on a two-day 
official visit to Colombia, Sanin said she had no doubts that 
Gaviria would win if he decided to present his candidacy to head 
the continental forum right now. 
  The minister, who, with this objective, has been carrying 
out 
intensive contacts with the Caribbean countries and at the OAS 
headquarters itself, asserted that Gaviria's possible candidacy 
is seen with approval and has received the backing of several 
governments. Sanin did not specify the countries that would 
support the possible candidacy of the Colombian president, whose 
government ends on 7 August. 
  The foreign minister's disclosure is not an official 
announcement of President Gaviria's candidacy for the OAS 
secretary generalship. According to an official communique, 
which was issued on Sunday, the Colombian president has still 
not decided if he will run for this position and will announce 
his decision in the forthcoming days. 
  If Gaviria decides to run, he must confront Costa Rican 
Foreign Minister Bernd Neihaus, who is the strongest candidate 
for the position up to now. Furthermore, Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has also presented his name for 
consideration by the 34 OAS member states. 
  The U.S. Government is a proponent of the Colombian 
president's possible candidacy and, according to reports, 
Argentina, Peru, and Mexico also back Gaviria. Precisely, the 
Peruvian president admitted his support for the Colombian 
president to reporters in Santa Fe de Bogota.
