FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: Downturn at Sanyo Electric
Buoyant sales of batteries and semiconductors were not enough to support
better results at Sanyo Electric, which reported a 44 per cent decline in
pre-tax profits for the year to November 1993.
Pre-tax profits were Y6.04bn (Dollars 553.5m), down from Y10.69bn in the
previous year, and the dividend is being cut to Y5 from Y6.50 per share.
Sales dropped 6 per cent to Y1,020bn and the net loss was Y4.07bn, compared
with Y5.77bn.
The company's performance was adversely affected by last year's sharp rise
in the yen which, combined with depressed domestic demand, put pressure on
sales both at home and overseas.
Demand for audio-visual products, such as colour TVs, was particularly weak
and capital investment by Japanese companies remained stagnant.
Amid the prolonged recession in Japan, prices of consumer electronics goods
have collapsed, with heavy discounts offered not only on old models but also
on those recently introduced.
In addition, Sanyo's business in Japan was last year hurt by the unusually
cold and wet summer, which hit demand for air conditioners.
In contrast to the decline in audio-visual and electronic product sales, the
company saw firm demand for semiconductors and batteries.
On a consolidated basis, sales fell by a marginal 0.7 per cent to Y1,530bn
from Y1,540bn but pre-tax profits rose nearly six-fold to Y3.23bn from
Y562m.
