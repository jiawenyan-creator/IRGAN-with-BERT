FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Multitone agrees to bid from Champion
CHAMPION Technology, the Hong Kong-based telepaging group, yesterday made a
recommended 143p-a-share cash offer for Multitone Electronics which values
the UK-based paging equipment pioneer at just over Pounds 21.5m.
Champion said it had received irrevocable undertakings in respect of 62.4
per cent of Multitone's issued equity. Multitone's shares closed 8p higher
at 139p.
The deal, once completed, will provide the fast-growing Champion group,
which was listed in Hong Kong in August last year, with additional
manufacturing capacity, and access to the European market for paging
equipment.
Champion, which has a market capitalisation of HKDollars 802.4m (Pounds
70.1m), yesterday reported pre-tax profits of HKDollars 148.8m on turnover
of HKDollars 298.6m in the year to June 30. The group has recorded compound
growth in turnover of 122.3 per cent over the last three years - mainly
fuelled by the market in China but has acknowledged that the supply of
adequate numbers of high quality products is the main limiting factor
affecting it's future growth.
Multitone, which has operations in the UK, continental Europe and Malaysia
and distributes its products mainly in Europe, developed the first radio
pager in 1955 and was one of the pioneers of pager systems.
In the year to April 30 the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m
(Pounds 1.9m) on turnover of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 23.2m).
Last month it issued a warning saying that it expected to report a small
pre-tax loss in the first half and only a small pre-tax profit for the year.
