FT  01 APR 92 / Cabot of US signs Czechoslovak deal
CABOT Corporation of the US, the world largest producer of carbon black, has
set up a joint venture with Czechoslovakia's only coal tar processor to
produce carbon black, a raw material used in the manufacturing of tyres and
rubber products.
The joint venture, worth about Dollars 90m and 52 per cent owned by Cabot,
yesterday received a Dollars 20m loan from the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank.
This is IFC's first loan in Czechoslovakia. In January, the company approved
a 12 per cent equity investment worth Dollars 6.5m in Zivnostenska Banca,
the country's oldest bank which will be partially owned by Berliner Handels-
und Frankfurter Bank (BHF) of Germany. IFC is considering other investments
in the cement and automotive industry. The new joint-venture, called
CSCabot, will modernise a plant of Deza, a large chemical company in Moravia
and build two new carbon black production units with a capacity of 25,000
tons per annum. The project should be completed by early 1994 and will have
a total production capacity of 80,000 tonnes per annum.
The company will produce carbon black, a raw material used in the making of
tyres and plastic products and will be in a lead position to supply the
country's modernized automotive and trucks industry.
Baroum, Czechoslovakia's monopoly producer of tyres is currently negotiating
with Continental of Germany. Skoda, the Czech car company, last year teamed
up with Volkswagen of Germany and the country's three truck companies set
joint ventures with Mercedes of Germany and Iveco of Italy earlier this
year.
