  [Text] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- A protocol on the 
exchange of goods and the provision of services in 1994 and an 
agreement on the support and protection of investments was 
signed by members of a visiting Ukrainian Government delegation 
and the Slovak Government. 
  The Ukrainian first deputy minister for external economic 
relations, Mikhail Reznik, said the trade between the two 
countries did not as yet correspond to the economic potential of 
the two countries. "The documents signed will make it easier for 
entrepreneurs to make trade contacts, and this will definitely 
show up in the volume of trade," he said. 
  More than 50 per cent of Ukrainian goods came to Slovakia 
via 
a third country, Reznik commented. 
  Last year the trade turnover between Slovakia and the 
Ukraine 
amounted to $280 million, which is more or less the level of 
previous years, Reznik said. 
  Ukraine wants to continue importing iron ore to Slovakia, 
and 
also sees a market for its chemical industry. From Slovakia it 
wants to import consumer goods. 
  The number of Ukrainian-Slovak joint enterprises is around 
120, Reznik said. Cooperation will be increased in the fields 
of engineering, the manufacture of vans and lorries, the mining 
and arms industries and agrocomplexes.
