FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: In the balance
Sir, Joe Rogaly's article, 'Merits of Muddle' (February 11), is the best
political comment for a long time. The only alteration I would make would be
to change the words 'hung parliament' to 'balanced parliament'. We have
suffered for too long the effects of elected dictatorships going by the
euphemism of strong leadership.
