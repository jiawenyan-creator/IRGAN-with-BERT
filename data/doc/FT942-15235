FT  16 APR 94 / Polish debt deal goes ahead
Poland's western government creditors in the Paris Club have put into
operation the final phase of a deal aimed at halving Poland's sovereign
debt. Under the second tranche of the Paris Club agreement Poland's
sovereign debt, estimated at Dollars 28.7bn (Pounds 19.6bn) by the Finance
Ministry, is to be reduced by around Dollars 3.4bn while interest payments
in coming years are to run at below market rates. However, the creditors
'reserved the right to review their decision' to make sure it is compatible
with debt reduction agreement Poland struck with the London Club of
commercial bank creditors last month. This is to put additional pressure on
owners of Dollars 12.3bn Polish commercial debt, unhappy at the 42 per cent
London Club debt reduction, to accept the arrangement, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
Britain's chancellor, said on a visit to Warsaw yesterday.
