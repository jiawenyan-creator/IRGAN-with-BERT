FT  08 JAN 94 / Bush fires reach Sydney suburbs
A resident of Sydney's northern suburbs hoses down his roof in an effort to
hold back the flames as Australia's worst bush fires in a decade rage only
six miles from the city centre.
Three people have died in the fires sweeping New South Wales. Yesterday,
thousands more were evacuated and up to 70 houses destroyed, some exploding
in the intense heat. Unless the searing temperatures and winds drop, at
least 3,000 homes are expected to be lost this weekend.
The fires, which stretch along 500 miles of the state's coastline, are being
fought by more than 7,000 firefighters. Sydney centre is not under threat,
although the smell of burning eucalyptus trees and black smoke has reached
the city, and power has been interrupted.
