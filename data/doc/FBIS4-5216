  [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean 
Government has announced a 1994 national budget amounting to 
41,525,190,000 won (18.8 billion U.S. dollars based on a 
current exchange rate of 2.20 won to one dollar.) 
  The announcement was made by Finance Minister Yun Ki-chong 
at 
the Seventh Session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly 
Thursday, North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA) said, 
according to NAEWOE PRESS, Seoul's official monitor of North 
Korean press reports. 
  The budget represented an increase of 2.4 percent in 
revenues 
and a rise of 3.2 percent in expenditures, KCNA said. 
  The North Korean Government plans to hike budget 
expenditures 
for the "people's economy" by 3.2 percent, and for social and 
cultural projects by 2.8 percent, compared with rises last year 
of 3 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, from the year 
earlier. 
  In 1993, the North Korean Government had budget revenues of 
40.5 billion won (18.8 billion dollars based on an average 
exchange rate in 1993 of 2.15 won to one U.S. dollar). Of the 
total, the government spent 40.2 billion won (18.7 billion 
dollars), leaving a surplus of 328 million won (152 million 
dollars), KCNA said. 
  The fact that Pyongyang increased the 1994 budget by a 
relatively small margin from 1993 was seen as a virtual 
admission that it has failed to fulfill its third seven-year 
economic plan (1987-93), analysts at NAEWOE said. 
  The Pyongyang government has apparently set the next three 
years (1994-96) as an adjustment period for construction of a 
socialist economy, they said. 
  Pyongyang increased military spending 4.1 percent from 1993 
to 11.6 percent of the total budget. But a considerable 
proportion of its actual military outlay is believed to be 
hidden in the sector called expenditure on the people's economy, 
NAEWOE said. 
  If everything was taken into consideration, the North's 
military spending would amount to more than 30 percent of the 
total, it said.
