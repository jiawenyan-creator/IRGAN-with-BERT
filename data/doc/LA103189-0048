ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
SMALL YARDS: One reason that Orange County residents are sacrificing their 
yards to make room for ever-bigger homes on ever-smaller lots (D1) may be that

investments, foreign travel and collecting wine, while shunning such pursuits 
as automotive work, crafts, sewing -- and gardening. Rick VanderKnyff and Lanie
