BRIEFLY 
Dataproducts to Sell Headquarters: The computer printer maker tentatively 
agreed to sell its 21.5-acre Woodland Hills headquarters property to Trizec 
Properties Inc. of Canada for $63 million. A New York-based investor group that 
last week made a $273-million takeover bid for Dataproducts -- as well as two 
other bids for part of the company -- struck an earlier deal to sell the 
property to Trizec for $57 million should it succeed in buying Dataproducts. 
Dataproducts Chairman Jack C. Davis said proceeds from the sale would be 
distributed to the firm's shareholders.
