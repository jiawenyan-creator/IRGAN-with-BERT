China and Vietnam have tackled sensitive border issues in direct high-level 
talks in Beijing, diplomats said. Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Dinh Nho 
Liem arrived unannounced last weekend and began talks with his Chinese 
counterpart, Liu Shuqing. China's Foreign Ministry said the talks will cover a 
political settlement in Cambodia, but the two sides reportedly also discussed 
bilateral relations, including the Spratly Islands, claimed by both nations.
