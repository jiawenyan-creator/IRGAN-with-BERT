FT  09 JUL 93 / Revenue 'gave details to Exchange'
THE INLAND Revenue provided vital information to the Stock Exchange on
extensive undisclosed share purchases by overseas vehicles of Mr Asil Nadir,
the fugitive businessman, a senior Revenue investigator claimed yesterday.
Mr Michael Allcock, suspended head of SO-2, the Revenue's special
investigation unit, yesterday detailed extensive links between the Revenue
and the exchange since 1984. The information gathered by the two
organisations was channelled via the exchange to the Serious Fraud Office.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Allcock said the exchange gave
the Revenue details of share transactions in exchange for information on a
network of Swiss companies allegedly linked to Mr Nadir.
Mr Allcock says the exchange's regulatory powers during the 1980s were 'a
joke' and its powers to investigate the money trail behind suspected illegal
share dealings was too restrictive.
The exchange has confirmed that its information gathering powers are
extremely limited. It refused to comment on the Nadir case. The Revenue said
information could only be given to other agencies in exceptional
circumstances, when it could receive details in return that furthered its
own inquiries. The SFO confirmed it received information from the exchange
on Mr Nadir, but denies collusion with the Revenue on the Nadir case, as
alleged by MP Mr Michael Mates.
