NO REST FOR FAST-MOVING RESCUER OF BEKINS CO. 
Thomas E. Epley, chairman of Bekins Co., recently moved into a new ground-floor 
office at Bekins' modest, red-brick headquarters building in Glendale. But in 
front of his desk is a wall still undergoing renovation, its wallpaper torn 
away and awaiting a new finish. 
The wall is an apt metaphor for Bekins since Epley took the helm of the 
venerable moving company in 1985. At that time, Bekins was listing badly, hurt 
by a disastrous diversification effort and the deregulation of the moving 
industry, which intensified competition and kept downward pressure on prices. 
Epley responded by stripping away all of Bekins' ill-fated acquisitions, which 
ranged from pest control to financial services. "There wasn't a single one of 
them that was viable," he said recently. 
And once Epley was left with just Bekins' core moving business, he formed a 
group that bought the company from Minneapolis financier Irwin Jacobs for $66 
million in a leveraged buyout in May, 1987. The moving business was barely 
profitable, but Epley was convinced that he could bolster its performance. 
Praise From Agents 
He has, by many accounts. Several of Bekins' independent agents -- locally 
owned moving companies that represent Bekins -- praised the company for vastly 
improving its computer system, which tracks delivery schedules and billing and 
thus is the lifeblood of the business. 
"They are definitely leading the pack" in computer automation, asserted Dennis 
Eversole, general manager of Acme Moving &amp; Storage, a Bekins agent in 
Belmont, Calif. "I would not have said that three years ago." 
But like his office wall, Bekins still presents Epley, 48, with work to be 
done. 
The moving business in general is a slow-growth business with profit margins of 
less than 5 cents per dollar of revenue. Bekins' revenue last year edged up 
only 3%, to $325 million from $317 million in 1987. Bekins is profitable, 
although Epley would not disclose any details. 
Bekins also faces lots of competition; the company is the nation's 
fifth-largest mover, with about 8% to 10% of the U.S. market. And at the 
moment, industrywide growth is flattening because of slowing housing sales, 
particularly in California, where Bekins is best known. 
"Right now, we've got a real softness in the California market," Epley said. 
"That's caused us a problem." 
On the national level, it's also debatable whether Epley has yet lifted Bekins 
a notch in the nationwide moving market, according to Bekins' rivals. 
Hasn't Seen Change 
"I have not really seen any change of direction in Bekins," shrugged James L. 
Wilson, executive vice president of United Van Lines, a Fenton, Mo.-based 
concern that is the nation's second-biggest mover. "They don't have a major 
impact on us." 
Epley, a Jeannette, Pa., native who earned engineering and business degrees 
from the University of Cincinnati and Northwestern University, respectively, 
has been busy enough trying to improve Bekins' existing businesses. 
Its two primary divisions are Bekins Van Lines and Bekins Moving &amp; Storage. 
The van lines business, which accounts for two-thirds of Bekins' revenue, acts 
as the main conduit between Bekins' agents at each end of a move. The agents, 
either independent or company-owned firms, are the ones that actually pack and 
move the goods. But Bekins' van lines division schedules the packers and 
drivers, bills the customer, arranges for storage, collects the customer's 
money and then doles out the cash to the various parties involved. 
The moving and storage division, meanwhile, is composed of Bekins' 
company-owned agents, which are mainly in California, Texas and Florida. Each 
of those agents mostly serves its local area. 
But beyond hauling household goods, Epley also is pushing Bekins in other 
moving-related businesses to fatten the company's profits. 
For instance, Bekins is trying to increase its handling of specialty freight, 
such as computers or other products transported to trade shows. The company 
also moves and installs furnishings for new hotels and retail outlets. 
More Stores 
And Bekins is expanding the number of its Bekins Boxstores, which are retail 
outlets that pack and ship specialty items -- an antique clock, for example -- 
and which sell boxes, tape and other packing materials for the do-it-yourself 
mover. Bekins already has 17 company-owned stores in California. Last week it 
began making plans to franchise the stores. 
"Boxes, as mundane as that may be, are very hard to come by that have any 
strength or capabilities for storage or moving," Epley said. 
But Bekins has no plans for the same type of pell-mell expansion outside of the 
moving business that it pursued a decade ago and that Epley had to dismantle. 
"We are not looking elsewhere for growth," Epley said. "We're working from 
within; we're trying to make sure we've got that last fine-tuning in place." 
Bekins traces its roots to 1891, when Martin and John Bekins, sons of a Dutch 
immigrant, founded the company in Sioux City, Iowa., with three horse-drawn 
vans, a warehouse and 12 workers. Four years later, they moved the operation to 
Los Angeles and opened their headquarters in an old van with the wheels 
removed. 
The Bekins family retained control of the company for the next several decades, 
but by the early 1980s, a now publicly held Bekins -- its poor acquisitions and 
deregulation taking their toll -- became the target of a takeover fight between 
two corporate raiders, the Belzberg family of Canada and Irwin Jacobs. Jacobs 
won with a $92-million purchase completed in 1983. No Bekins family members are 
still involved in management. 
Before joining Jacobs to run Bekins, Epley had spent 15 years at FMC Corp., a 
major producer of machinery, chemicals and defense systems. He became known as 
a trouble-shooter, at various times heading up struggling FMC units involved 
with specialty chemicals, phosphorous chemicals and defense products. 
Biggest Problems 
"I tended to gravitate toward the businesses that had the biggest problems and 
biggest negative trends," he said. "I get very bored managing something that is 
in a steady state where you make a little improvement here and there over 
time." 
Epley got just what he wanted at Bekins. After Jacobs hired him, Epley 
overhauled Bekins' management in addition to its computer system. He also pared 
Bekins' entire work force by 7% -- to about 2,000 from 2,150 -- and otherwise 
claims to have cut Bekins' overhead costs by more than $3 million a year. 
Besides saving money, Epley's moves have made Bekins more efficient, to hear 
some of Bekins' agents tell it. Dan Kaske, owner of Apace Moving Systems, an 
agent in Orange, said that before Epley took over, Bekins "was notoriously 
very, very slow in paying their agents," often taking up to 90 days. Bekins' 
new computer system "enables us to pretty well get paid in a 45-day period," 
Kaske said. 
Epley's plan is to maintain steady, albeit thin, profits at the core moving 
business and to pad those earnings with its new ventures in hauling specialized 
freight and operating packing/shipping stores. But if housing sales continue 
dropping or the overall economy weakens to otherwise depress demand for moving 
services, Epley could have his hands full. 
Epley's group acquired Bekins in a leveraged buyout, meaning the group borrowed 
most of the money using Bekins' assets as collateral. Bekins will have to make 
payments on that debt for the next several years -- whether business is 
improving or not. 
And Epley might have a hard time finding places to save cash if profits are 
squeezed further. After all, he said of the company, "we've basically gotten it 
as lean as it can be."
