FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): 'Mismatch' found between jobs and
training
A GAP between jobs advertised in London and what people are being trained to
do is identified in a survey published today.
The Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities examined 15,711 jobs
advertised in newspapers and Jobcentres in a sample week in February, and
compared them with 6,429 training places provided by Youth Training and
Employment Training, the scheme for long-term unemployed adults.
The association used National Vocational Qualification levels to compare
jobs available with training places. It says in its report that most
trainees achieve NVQ level 2, yet most jobs available are at the lower NVQ
level 1 or the higher NVQ level 3.
In addition it says there is a discrepancy between the types of jobs
advertised and training courses. For example, fewer than 1 per cent of jobs
available involved motor repair and maintenance, but 18 per cent of YT
trainees were on such courses. More than 7 per cent of jobs available were
in catering, but only 1.1 per cent of YT and 1.4 per cent of trainees on ET
were taking catering courses.
Ms Margaret Hodge, leader of the association, said there was a serious
mismatch between the standards achieved by trainees on the main schemes and
many of the jobs available.
