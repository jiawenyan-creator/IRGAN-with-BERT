  [Text] Kuwait, 27 Jun -- The State of Kuwait has reiterated 
its adherence to principles and resolutions issued by the UN 
Security Council and the last Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] 
ministerial meeting on the situation in Yemen. It also said 
that it will not reserve any energy in its efforts toward 
stopping the shedding of innocent blood in Yemen within the 
framework of the resolutions issued on the Yemeni crisis and the 
calls for a peaceful settlement. 
  This was said in a telephone call made to the amir of 
Kuwait, 
Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary 
general of the Yemeni Socialist Party. 
  Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad stressed Kuwait's adherence to the 
resolutions issued by the GCC ministerial meeting, which was 
held recently in the Saudi Arabian town of Abha, and UN Security 
Council Resolution No. 924 which calls for an immediate 
cease-fire [words indistinct] to impose political solutions by 
the use of military force. 
  The amir told the Yemeni Socialist Party secretary general 
that he will continue efforts to consult with GCC leaders in 
order to curb the spilling of innocent blood in line with 
resolutions made on the Yemeni crisis, and in line with calls 
made by a number of sisterly and friendly countries in order to 
achieve security and stability throughout the area.
