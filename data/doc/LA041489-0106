BRIEFLY 
Oil Futures Fall: Energy futures prices retreated as some traders decided to 
cash in their holdings to take advantage of recent price rises. On the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the 
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell 35 cents to close the day at $20.29 a 
barrel. Other contract months also fell. Among refined products, unleaded 
gasoline for May delivery fell 1.30 cents to 68.81 cents a gallon and heating 
oil for May delivery lost 1.06 cents to 52.14 cents a gallon.
