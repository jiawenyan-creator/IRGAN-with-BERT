  [Text] Haikou, 18 Jan -- The Hainan Provincial Electric 
Power Bureau and Daguangba Power Plant Construction Directorate 
jointly announced that the No. 1 unit of the Daguangba water 
conservancy and hydropower hub project -- a key "Eighth 5-Year 
Plan" project -- passed examination and acceptance, and formally 
joined the grid on 29 December 1993. The unit has been 
functioning normally. 
  The Daguangba water conservancy and hydropower hub project, 
located on the mainstream of the Changhua Jiang in Dongfang 
County in western Hainan Province, will be used for power, 
irrigation, flood control and tourism, and will generate 520 
million kWh per year, irrigate 995,000 mu of land, and will have 
a 1.7 billion cubic meter reservoir. 
  When completed, this project will alleviate the electric 
power bottleneck on Hainan, and will have great significance for 
the economic development of western Hainan. 
  Although the installed capacity and output of this project 
will be in the lower range of large-size plants, its 
construction will provide valuable experience in terms of new 
technology in design and construction.
