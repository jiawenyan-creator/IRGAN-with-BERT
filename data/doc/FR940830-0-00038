 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of a state
action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

v. 

U.S. E.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 25666 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 31, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See Act, section 307(b)(2).)
