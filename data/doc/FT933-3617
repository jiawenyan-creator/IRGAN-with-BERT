FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television
With the autumn season, Monday evenings are once again becoming heavy on the
factual side. Prompted by the visit to Britain of Australian prime minister
Paul Keating, BBC2's Assignment (7.40) considers plans to turn Australia
into a republic, and interviews Keating's political rival, Bob Hawke.
Channel 4 continues its series Vets In The Wild which has an underlying
sadness: Barkley Hastings, who is seen training young vets at Whipsnade Zoo,
died last year of cancer, aged 34, before his pupils could start work
(9.00).
Panorama investigates 'Babies On Benefit': Rachel who became pregnant at 15
in order to leave school and get her own home; Michelle who, at 22, is
expecting the fifth of the babies she has had by two different fathers, and
so on (9.30).
The Late Show returns to BBC2 with former television critic Mark Lawson
added to the familiar team of presenters. Let's hope he ignores the Guardian
party line and brings a trace of non-conformism to the only regular current
affairs series on television dealing with the arts . . . and, ominously,
'kulcher' (11.15).
