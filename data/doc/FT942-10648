FT  10 MAY 94 / Pounds 53.8m British Library deal signed
A Pounds 53.8m contract to clad and fit out the final phase of the troubled
Pounds 450m British Library building at St Pancras in London has been
awarded to a joint venture between Sir Robert McAlpine and Haden Young.
The project, which will be smaller than planned, is running several years
late and hundreds of millions of pounds over-budget.
The first phase of the development - forecast to cost Pounds 116m when it
was announced in 1978 by the then education secretary Mrs Shirley Williams -
is due to be handed over this year. It is expected to have cost at least
Pounds 300m.
The 25,000 sq ft final phase is due to be completed by 1995 and the library
ready for occupation in 1996.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said yesterday that the
cladding and fitting-out contract for the final phase had been awarded after
competitive tendering.
A 1991 report by the Commons public accounts committee, the public spending
watchdog, strongly criticised the Office of Arts and Libraries, the
department responsible for commissioning the building, and the Property
Services Agency, which is overseeing its design and construction.
It blamed both bodies for serious management weaknesses, for cost increases
and for producing an unsuitable building. When both phases are completed in
1996 it will seat 1,176 readers compared with the 3,440 originally planned.
In 1991 the development hit fresh problems when mobile shelves, made in the
Netherlands, jammed and the anti-corrosive paint covering them peeled.
Their replacement at the makers' expense caused a further two-year delay in
the project, which was expected to have been completed in the late 1980s.
The PSA projects division, responsible for the library, was acquired in 1992
by Tarmac, the UK construction company.
