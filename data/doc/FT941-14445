FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: QMH calls in the lawyers
Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group currently negotiating a Pounds 1.3bn
financial restructuring, has had to call in lawyers to sort out an
embarrassing technical hitch.
Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said yesterday, 'it is simply a corporate
legal irritation'. He said it would not delay the group's refinancing.
QMH admitted it had failed to give holders of its 7 per cent convertible
preference shares, which were issued in 1985 in a rights issue, the chance
to vote in September 1989 and August last year on resolutions to increase
the group's borrowing powers.
This means the resolutions, which increased the group's borrowing powers,
were not valid. It also calls into question the validity of other
resolutions passed at the same meetings.
However, it said the invalidity of the borrowing powers resolutions did not
mean the company's borrowings could be called into question.
The discovery has raised 'complex issues' the company said, and it has
appointed Freshfields, the City solicitors, and leading counsel to advise on
how to resolve them. Mr Coppel said QMH had been advised it would not need
to hold last year's annual meeting again.
The other resolutions passed at the agm, which was adjourned in August and
concluded in November, included the appointment of Mr Coppel as chief
executive, and in November the adoption of the annual report.
QMH said it would 'communicate with shareholders and all other relevant
parties' once the position was clear.
At the end of 1992 there was Pounds 9.17m worth of preference shares
outstanding, which would convert into a total of 20.8m ordinary shares
against the total of 924.3m QMH has in issue at present. Each preference
share has one vote.
The problem does not affect the much larger class of 7 1/2 per cent
convertible preference shares issued in 1991.
