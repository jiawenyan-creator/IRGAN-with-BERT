FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Olivetti losses deepen to
L93.4bn in first half
OLIVETTI, the troubled Italian computers group, deepened its losses to
L93.4bn (Dollars 74.6m) in the first six months of this year from L73.7bn in
the corresponding period last year, owing to the continuing turbulence in
the world information technology industry.
Sales fell by a further 5 per cent to L3,748bn from L3,943bn, while net
operating profits dropped by more than 23 per cent to L33.9bn.
In an attempt to strengthen its management team, the company announced the
appointment of Mr Corrado Passera, formerly managing director of the
L'Espresso publishing group.
L'Espresso is controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company.
Mr Passera will become joint managing director alongside Mr De Benedetti,
who will continue in his position as chairman.
Olivetti shares fell in expectation of the news, announced after the market
closed, with a L33 drop to L1,682.
The company blamed the fall in earnings and sales on the continuing problems
in the computers sector caused by over-capacity and fierce price
competition.
Prices for personal computers had fallen by 40 per cent in the six months -
almost the same decline as for the whole of 1991, it said.
Although Olivetti, in common with other computer manufacturers, has been
cutting costs, the L188.9bn reduction in its cost base had proved
insufficient to counter the effect of falling product prices.
The company again stressed the strength of its balance sheet, and its
ability to ride out the continuing crisis in the industry.
Moreover, it repeated its strategy of meeting its problems by pushing
through a policy of reducing its break-even level and forging new alliances
with other complementary producers in order to reduce expenditure on
research and development and accelerate the time taken to introduce new
products.
