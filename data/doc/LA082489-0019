'GREEN CARD' TO TAKE ON PINK HUE 
Call it a pink card. 
U. S. immigration officials Wednesday unveiled the new document that is being 
issued to legal permanent resident foreigners. It will replace the 
long-cherished "green card," which, in fact, hasn't been green for several 
decades, the U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said. 
The face of the new card, known formally as an I-551 form, will have a "rose" 
or "off-pink" color, an INS press release stated, and the back will have a 
"pink to blue rainbow effect shading on the top portion, with the bottom 
portion being white." Like its predecessor, it will contain the photograph, 
signature and fingerprint of the bearer. 
But there is more here than just a color change. 
The new card, noted Vicki Quainton, acting deputy INS district director in San 
Diego, will replace a version that has been frequently duplicated by fraudulent 
means. Many thousands of false "green cards" are in circulation, the INS 
concedes. 
The key aspect of the new card, the INS says, is that it will be readable by 
computerized machines, a fact that will make it easier to authenticate at ports 
of entry and at INS offices nationwide. 
Another major difference: The new cards will have to be renewed every 10 years.
