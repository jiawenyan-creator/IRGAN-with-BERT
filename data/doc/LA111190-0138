COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; 
FOOTHILL CONFERENCE 
Antelope Valley 12, Mt. San Jacinto 7 -- Despite a school-record 11 fumbles, 
Antelope Valley remains in the hunt for the Foothill Conference championship. 
The conference title will be decided Saturday when Antelope Valley plays at 
Citrus. Citrus (7-2, 7-0) set up the championship game with a 14-8 win over 
Desert (6-4, 6-2). 
The Marauders (8-1, 6-1) lost four of the fumbles, but their defense more than 
compensated, coming up with five interceptions, three by Birk Sopsher. 
Mt. San Jacinto (6-3, 4-3) was held in check for most of the night but cut the 
deficit to 12-7 when quarterback Vince Daley ran 10 yards on the first play of 
the fourth quarter. 
Marty Washington ran 39 yards and Jason Camp kicked 37- and 41-yard field goals 
to account for Antelope Valley's scoring. STEVEN HERBERT
