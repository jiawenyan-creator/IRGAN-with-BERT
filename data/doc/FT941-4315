FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Beazer Homes gets Pounds 463m tag
Hanson yesterday finalised its sale of Beazer Homes, the fourth largest UK
housebuilder, through a flotation at 165p a share to give the group a market
value of Pounds 463.4m.
Of that, Pounds 50m is new money going to Beazer Homes and the rest will go
to Hanson, which is selling its entire interest, generating an exceptional
profit of about Pounds 200m.
Hanson said the pricing struck a balance between ensuring the issue was a
success and an appropriate price for Hanson shareholders. Mr Dennis Webb,
chief executive of Beazer Homes, said it was a fair price.
Of the 280.8m shares being sold, three-quarters were being placed with
institutions with the balance available through a public offer.
Beazer said if it had been quoted last year it would have paid a 5p
dividend, giving a yield at the issue price of 3.8 per cent, covered 2.3
times by earnings per share of 11.4p assuming a 25 per cent tax charge. The
yield is towards the top end of the range for housebuilders.
It planned a 1.8p final dividend for the nine months to end-June 1994, and
suggested it would have paid 5.4p in the 12 months to June had it been
quoted for the full year, an 8 per cent rise over 1993.
Although completions are running 28 per cent ahead so far this financial
period, margins are expected to weaken by contrast to most other
housebuilders. Beazer is working through its higher cost sites, and has to
take on the Pounds 800,000 annual pension cost and Pounds 1m annual cost of
being a separate, quoted company.
