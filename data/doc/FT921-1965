FT  21 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
as a result of political uncertainty - pushed the futures market back to a
discount to the cash market in fairly thin trading, writes Christopher
Price.
The March FT-SE contract opened up at 2,476, but soon slipped several
points. Then, independent traders, some caught in short positions, helped
squeeze March to what turned out to be the high point of the day at 2,479.
Lack of demand saw it drift away and by mid-morning March was trading around
the 2,459-level. Goldman Sachs then sold some 600 lots in the 2,451-4 range
which pulled the contract down. Slightly disappointing UK inflation figures
and German pay settlement news hit the short sterling and gilt markets,
which in turn further knocked the March contract. A brief rally was not
sustained in a featureless afternoon's trading. March closed at 2,544, down
27 on the previous session, and at a discount of some 7 points to its
4-point fair value premium to cash. Volume was 6,552.
In the traded options market, Asda was the top stock, with nearly 14,000
lots traded out of a total of 38,887. This was followed by British Steel and
Cable and Wireless.
