A Riverside mother who baked 106 Valentine's Day cupcakes for her son's 
kindergarten classmates said they were rejected by school officials who feared 
that the treats could spread AIDS, but administrators denied that was the 
reason. Edwina Hatzenbuehler claimed Principal Corrine Law of Monroe Elementary 
School told her the school had a policy against distributing homemade food, 
possibly because it could have been made in a "dirty house" and threatened 
spread of diseases such as AIDS. Hatzenbuehler said, "It really just hurt my 
feelings. I told her you can't spread AIDS by cupcakes." She added no one in 
her family is suffering from the disease and all are in good health.
