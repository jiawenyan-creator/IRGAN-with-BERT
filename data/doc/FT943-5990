FT  01 SEP 94 / North Sea gas licences granted
The government yesterday announced the completion of the 15th North Sea oil
and gas licensing round, the first to be conducted under a 'fast-track'
approach to ensure early exploration of the blocks on offer.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy and industry minister, said many of the successful
bidders had agreed to accelerate their seismic surveys and exploration
drilling to ensure any discoveries could be tied into the existing North Sea
transportation infrastructure.
'This will bring forward smaller developments which might not otherwise be
economic,' he said.
The six-year licences cover 29 of the 81 blocks offered last April. They are
concentrated in the southern basin, a mainly gas area, and the central North
Sea. Both are established production areas.
Amoco UK, the British arm of the US oil company, and British Gas were among
the successful bidders. But Mr Eggar said he was pleased that a number of
smaller companies also secured licences.
The recent surge in North Sea oil and gas production continued in July,
according to figures published yesterday by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Output to the end of July was up 29 per cent over the same period last year,
in spite of a seasonal fall owing to annual maintenance shutdowns on many
platforms. Oil production in July averaged 2.4m barrels a day, 19 per cent
higher than a year ago.
