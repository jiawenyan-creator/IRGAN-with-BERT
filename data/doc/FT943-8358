FT  17 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome climbs
Takeover talk refused to die down among pharmaceutical stocks, with Wellcome
once again attracting most attention. The shares galloped a further 27 ahead
to 719p. Glaxo, off 3 at 627p, was the name being mooted yesterday as a
potential bidder for Wellcome, although analysts said such a move, one of
the market's long-standing takeover stories, would run counter to the
company's culture.
The regional electricity companies (recs) tried to recover their poise but
most failed to stay in positive territory. BZW was doing its best to inject
a bullish tone to keep the sector humming after last week's perceived
supportive Offer recomendations.
The broker was forecasting dividend growth of between 6 and 8 per cent per
annum, together with the now much-anticipated corporate activity, and

Seeboard, ahead a penny at 402p, and Sweb, off 6 at 706p.
The oil majors were largely unmoved but the exploration and production
stocks included a dull feature in Enterprise Oil, which dipped 7 to 403p as
NatWest Securities reiterated its bearish stance on the stock.
NatWest said: 'The shares have bounced since the Lasmo bid, understandably
since higher oil prices should guarantee that even if the dividend is not
covered it will be paid. However, at a 30 per cent premium to asset value
the shares still look expensive.'
Burmah Castrol shares were on offer after talk that the stock had figured
prominently in a sizeable programme trade; at the close they were 7 lower at
869p.
Hoare Govett was pointing out the potential of the Chinese cellular market
in respect of Cable and Wireless, together with the latter's recent
underperformance in the equity market. The stock hardened 2 1/2 to 438p.
Scantronic was one of the market's worst performers, weakening 6 1/2 to 20p
after warning of first-half losses.
Food and detergent giant Unilever continued to bask in the glow of its
sparkling results released last Friday, the shares adding 19 at 1126p.
Speculative interest pushed United Biscuits up 7 to 345p.
Argos, the catalogue retailer, again suffered from market disappointment
with Monday's results and the stock slid 7 to 360p. Great Universal Stores
put on 5 at 566p as Hoare Govett upgraded the shares to a hold. US buying
was said to have helped Kingfisher advance 10 to 530p.
WH Smith was reported to be fighting a strong rearguard action over fears
that the Net Book Agreement, which keeps retail prices at a minimum
requirement, may be about to expire. The shares rallied from initial
easiness to close unchanged at 483p.
NatWest Securities was said to have been responsible for an agency cross in
Sears, 8m shares at 118p. The stock slipped back a penny to 122p.
A positive agm statement from Mansfield helped the regional brewer up 4 to
232p. Other regionals also caught the mood, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley adding 8
at 541p and Vaux 2 at 241p.
Holiday tour operator Airtours slipped 5 to 453p as rival Owners Abroad,
which the former failed to take over last year, announced a name change and
rebranding exercise. The shares eased 2 to 107p. Seasonal buying lifted
Eurocamp 9 to 282p.
Nervous trading in BICC ahead of today's interim figures left the shares 9
lighter at 412p. Profits are expected to be in the region of Pounds 60m.
News of the lower than expected figures for new car registrations in the
first 10 days of August hit several motor dealers and component
manufacturers.
Among dealers, Reg Vardy fell 7 to 184p, while in the component
manufacturers sector, GKN eased 10 to 630p and T&amp;N, in which 2m shares were
dealt at 235p, well below the market price, finished 12 down at 240p.
A two-way pull in international conglomerate Hanson, which reported
third-quarter figures in line with market expectations, brought volume of 7m
as the shares eased a half-penny to 264p.
ICI continued its slide in the wake of the recent downgrade by investment
bank Lehman Brothers, finishing 17 cheaper at 821p.
