FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: USG in debt restructuring deal
USG, the parent company of US Gypsum, has reached agreement in principle
with two of its three creditor groups on a debt restructuring plan which
would involve it making a 'pre-packaged' Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.
Under a pre-packaged scheme, a company reaches agreement on a restructuring
with its creditors before filing for bankruptcy, minimising the time it
spends under the authority of the court.
USG's filing would only involve the parent company, with no effect on trade
creditors of its operating subsidiaries or the status of the many asbestos
health claims pending against US Gypsum.
USG, which ran into financial trouble after loading up with debt to fend off
a 1988 takeover, said it had agreed with its senior bondholders' committee
and agents of its banks on a restructuring which would reduce the face value
of its debt from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 1.6bn.
The plan would leave stockholders with just 3 per cent of the group's
equity.
Some 82 per cent of the equity would be owned by holders of 13 1/4 per cent
senior subordinated bonds, whose creditor committee has accepted the plan.
Some 15 per cent would be held by the junior creditors, who have rejected
the scheme.
The company said that if it could not reach agreement with the junior
creditors it would ask the courts to approve a plan that gave them nothing.
