THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS BY TIMES CRITICS 
DEAD CALM 
Phillip Noyce's 1989 thriller is a spare, smart, seductive piece of real 
movie-making, with (almost) every loophole covered, a superlative cast 
andandough tension to keep us all hyperventilating for hours. Sam Neill and 
Nicole Kidman are on an extended South Pacific voyage when they cross paths 
with insinuating Billy Zane. 
Sunday 10 p.m., Wednesday 11:45 p.m., Friday 10 p.m. Cinemax 
ZELIG 
This is a sweet, piercing, startlingly inventive film, a little rueful around 
the edges, in which Woody Allen fakes a documentary about one Leonard Zelig 
(played by Allen), who in his meteoric moment in the public eye stood somewhere 
between Charles Lindbergh and Babe Ruth. What emerges amid considerable 
technical brilliance and wit is a rather distanced commentary about the perils 
of living a life in a goldfish bowl.
