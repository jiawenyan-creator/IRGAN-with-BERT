FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Engen in line for ITT chair
Mr Travis Engen has been put firmly in line to take over the top job at ITT,
the US manufacturing, hotels and financial services group, when chairman Mr
Rand Araskog retires in two years.
Mr Engen, 50, will take on responsibility for the group's insurance
subsidiary and its communications and information services division in
January. With the three manufacturing divisions he already runs, he will be
in charge of businesses generating three-quarters of ITT's Dollars 22bn
sales.
Mr Engen takes on his new responsibilities from Mr Dale Comey, who is to
retire at the age of 52. ITT said there was 'nothing sinister' in Mr Comey's
departure. He simply wanted to retire early.
