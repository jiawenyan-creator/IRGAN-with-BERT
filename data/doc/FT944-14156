FT  25 OCT 94 / Keidanren backs deregulation
Japan's Keidanren business lobby yesterday urged faster financial
deregulation, as two more foreign companies announced their de-listing from
the Tokyo stock exchange. Britain's Standard Chartered Bank and Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce said they would delist by the end of the year. The
exodus of 18 foreign companies so far this year is seen as a symptom of the
declining competitiveness of Tokyo's capital markets, losing business to
financial centres in Asia. Standard Chartered said the move was part of a
cost-cutting programme. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, Keidanren chairman, warned
Japan's financial industry would be weakened without further deregulation.
