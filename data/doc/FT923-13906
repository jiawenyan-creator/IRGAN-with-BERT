FT  10 JUL 92 / Rao concedes on Bombay probe
The Indian prime minister yesterday announced the setting up of a joint
parliamentary committee to investigate the Rs35bn (Pounds 636m) Bombay stock
market scandal, in response to persistent demands from the opposition for an
unbiased inquiry, writes Shiraz Sidhva from New Delhi. Mr Narasimha Rao's
decision to take the investigation out of the hands of the Central Bureau of
Investigation and the Reserve Bank, India's central bank, could, however,
prolong the process of recovering the money. The committee, made up of
members from both houses of parliament, will be allowed access to all
government documents, and can summon any person for questioning.
A Congress party spokesman said the establishment of the committee 'shows we
have nothing to hide'. Responding to opposition allegations that six cabinet
ministers are involved in the scandal, Mr Rao has summoned three senior
ministers to reassure himself that they are not in any way involved.
