CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: KIDS; 
LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT 
THERE'S NOTHING MORE intriguing than losing oneself in the detailed and tiny 
world of a dollhouse. Shops that specialize in miniatures carry dollhouses and 
furnishings tailored to both children and serious collectors. 
Houses, which come in a variety of architectural styles -- including Colonial, 
Tudor and Victorian (the most popular) -- can be purchased already assembled or 
as kits. Prices for kits suitable for children (including the basic exterior 
shell) begin at about $75. Most shops that sell kits will assemble them for a 
fee. Dollhouses are typically about 24 by 18 inches by 30 inches high and are 
all built to the same conventional scale of 1 inch equals 1 foot. 
Dollhouse interiors are purposely unfinished -- much of the fun is in 
decorating. "Even the youngest children have definite taste about the basics," 
says Wally Hage of The Dollhouse Lady in San Gabriel. "By the time kids are 9 
or 10 they can be quite sophisticated in their selection of furnishings." If 
elegant trappings such as a Lilliputian Persian carpet or a truly baby grand 
piano are avoided, an average six room dollhouse can be completed for about 
$200.
