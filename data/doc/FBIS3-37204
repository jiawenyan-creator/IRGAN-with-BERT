  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- The British prime 
minister said on Tuesday [15 February] he had found no major 
contradictions with Russia on the Bosnian problem. 
  John Major told reporters after signing joint 
Russian-British 
agreements that the positions of both sides are completely 
identical on the necessity to continue searching for ways of a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict. 
  He added that he and the Russian leader had agreed that such 
a settlement should be stable and that peace cannot be achieved 
by military means. 
  According to Major, the positions of both sides also 
coincide 
on the necessity to place under UN control the heavy armaments 
of the warring sides near Sarajevo. 
  The process has already begun and Major characterised it as 
a 
good chance for achieveing peace and urged Russia, the United 
States and the European Union to join efforts in order not to 
miss the chance. 
  The British prime minister believes that the Russian 
negative 
reaction to the possibility of air strikes on Bosnian Serbs was 
caused by a certain misunderstanding of the essence of the NATO 
decision. 
  He added that this was a competent and balanced decision 
which was limited by the concrete problem of Sarajevo and 
adopted according to a request of the UN secretary general. 
  Major said he shared the conviction of the Russian president 
that British-Russian relations had reached the highest level in 
decades. This concerns trade, politics and military cooperation. 
Such a level of practical cooperation did not exist in the last 
50 years, the British prime minister said. 
  Major added that he had invited Boris Yeltsin to Great 
Britain and that the time of the visit will be agreed upon later.
