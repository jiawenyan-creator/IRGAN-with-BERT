FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Swiss to grant banking licences
to Japanese
ALL Japanese banks and securities companies that qualify will be granted
Swiss banking licences before the end of the year, according to a senior
Swiss government official.
The large Japanese financial fraternity in Switzerland has been in a state
of high tension in recent weeks because of the approach of a deadline under
Swiss law obliging all non-banks to convert themselves into banks by the end
of the year.
Applications from Japanese financial institutions have been blocked pending
the completion of bilateral negotiations on various financial issues.
Mr Alexis Lautenberg, head of the financial and economic division of the
foreign affairs ministry, said yesterday that the talks had been
'successful' and so all the Japanese institutions that 'qualified
objectively' would get licences. 'They should relax and be confident,' he
added.
In the talks, the Swiss sought an easing of Japan's tight restraints on
overseas deposits by individuals and the abolition of restrictions on
ownership links between the securities and banking units of Swiss banks in
Japan.
Mr Lautenberg would not reveal the results, which hinge in part on the
passage this week of a financial reform bill in the Japanese parliament.
Twenty Japanese banks and securities houses have Swiss banking licences, but
21 with Swiss operations do not. Mr Lautenberg said that Switzerland would
not issue 21 licences.
The conversion to bank status requires a sharp increase in capital and it is
expected that many institutions, suffering from a capital squeeze at home,
will not apply.
The attraction of the Swiss licence to the Japanese is that, from the
beginning of next year it will enable them to operate throughout Europe,
provided that Switzerland joins the European Economic Area.
Japanese bankers and brokers believe that 10 licences will be offered. The
Japanese MoF will then decide to whom they should be issued.
