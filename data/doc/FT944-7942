FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: MCI launches service to provide
access to Internet
MCI, the US long-distance telephone company, has launched a service to
provide easy and secure access to the Internet, a global network of
computers with an estimated 25m-30m users.
'InternetMCI' services will include an electronic shopping mall, Netscape
Communication's Internet browser software and high-speed network connections
to the Internet.
'MCI is making the Internet as easy to use, as accessible and as critical to
businesses as today's global phone network,' said Mr Timothy Price,
president of MCI's business markets arm. 'Businesses of all sizes will now
be able to sell their goods and services over the Internet,' he said.
Leading telephone companies in the US and Europe are expected to launch
similar services over the next few months, according to Mr Jim Clark,
chairman of Netscape Communications, which develops software for the
Internet. This will lead to a huge expansion in the use of the Internet for
electronic commerce, he says.
'By the year 2000, MCI expects commerce on the Internet will exceed Dollars
2bn and be as common as catalogue shopping is today,' said Mr Price.
Another venture addressing the emerging market for electronic shopping was
announced yesterday by Apple Computer, the PC manufacturer, America Online,
an on-line service provider and Medior, a small software company.
The companies have formed a joint venture called 2Market, to deliver
multimedia CD-Rom and on-line shopping catalogues.
By 1998, commercial on-line services will reach an estimated 19m
subscribers, says Forrester Research, a market research firm. On-line
shopping on these subscriber networks are expected to generate about Dollars
5bn in revenues, market analysts predict.
