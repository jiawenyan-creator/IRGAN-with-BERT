  [Text] Hamas will cooperate with the autonomy police on 
the condition that terror attacks inside the Green Line 
continue. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that in the 
negotiations between the heads of Fatah and Hamas in Gaza, 
several agreements have been reached. These include an 
agreement of nonbelligerency between the two organizations, and 
cooperation for the removal of the Zionist enemy off the land of 
Palestine. A Fatah official in the Gaza Strip has said that 
Hamas also demands that Fatah ask Israel for compensation for 
the years of occupation.
