O.C. HOUSING MARKET 4TH LEAST AFFORDABLE IN U.S., STUDY SHOWS; 
REAL ESTATE: A NATIONWIDE SURVEY INDICATES THAT IN ORANGE COUNTY, IT TAKES 51% 
OF A HOUSEHOLD'S MEDIAN INCOME TO MEET THE AVERAGE MORTGAGE PAYMENT. IN SAN 
FRANCISCO, IT TAKES 54%. 
Orange County was the fourth least-affordable housing market in the nation late 
last year. 
That estimate is based on a study by the Prudential Real Estate Affiliates 
Inc., a chain of real estate brokerages based in Costa Mesa, and Wharton 
Econometrics Forecasting Associates. The study contrasted median household 
income with average monthly mortgage payments. 
The study found that it took 51.5% of a household's median income to make the 
average monthly mortgage payment in Orange County, which has some of the 
highest prices for single-family homes in the nation. (In February, it was 
$243,285, according to the California Assn. of Realtors.) 
Traditionally, a buyer can't even qualify for a mortgage if the payment takes 
more than 28% of his or her monthly income. 
Of the nation's 150-largest housing markets, homeowners in 97 markets could buy 
a home for less than 28% of their monthly income. 
The Northeast and the West continue to be the least-affordable markets. San 
Francisco led all markets with an average monthly mortgage payment that 
required 54.1% of a household's median income. 
The New Bedford-Fall River, Mass., area was second with 53.5%; Honolulu third 
with 52.5%; Santa Rosa fifth with 50%; and San Diego sixth with 46.5%. 
Peoria, Ill., was the most affordable market in the nation. An average mortgage 
required only 8.8% of a household's income. 
Most of the California markets, including Orange County, have booming economies 
and rising incomes, which mean a lot of competition for housing and the 
resulting high prices. Even a slowdown in home sales hasn't brought down prices 
much. 
But New Bedford-Fall River, of all the markets at the top of the list, has a 
much different and less enviable problem: It has relatively high home prices 
and low household incomes, about $31,000 at last count. By contrast, it's 
nearly $54,000 in Orange County. 
New Bedford started out as a whaling port in the Colonial days of the 17th 
Century. Fall River, 12 miles inland, is a product of the 19th-Century's 
Industrial Revolution. Both have long been in decline. New Bedford was hurt by 
the falling fortunes of New England's fishing industry. Fall River was 
abandoned by many of the textile mills at the turn of the century, which moved 
to the South in search of cheaper labor. 
The area's unemployment, usually around 7%, just hit a seasonal high of 11%, 
highest in Massachusetts. Thousands of poor immigrants -- traditionally, many 
are Portuguese -- work in low-wage garment shops or on construction crews. 
Still, even these blue-collar industrial towns weren't immune to the increase 
in home prices as New England's economy boomed in the early 1980s. 
"There were very high expectations for growth in the high-tech industries, in 
defense industries and in services," said Steve Cochran, an economist with the 
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "Incomes were growing and people 
were willing to bid up home prices. 
"The problem is that computers and defense are hurting now, and only the 
service industries are still growing." 
But that hasn't brought home prices down much, even in Fall River. Prices are 
lower here than in Boston -- and they took quite a tumble last year -- but 
they're still high enough to startle most people in Peoria. The average 
single-family house, according to the local multiple listings, costs $138,747. 
"People aren't forced to sell, so they're sticking to their price and holding 
on to their houses," said Louis Andrade, a Century 21 broker in Fall River. "It 
means prices haven't come down all that much." 
Both towns have brought in some new factories by pitching their land costs, 
wages and rents, all of which are lower than much of the rest of Massachusetts. 
Despite the new factories with their better wages, "it still usually takes two 
paychecks to put a deal for a house together," said Edward Lavoie, another 
Century 21 broker in Fall River. "This is a real blue-collar area, and incomes 
aren't anywhere near what they are in Boston." 
Still, Fall River and New Bedford residents can take comfort in the fact that 
home prices are still lower than much of the rest of New England and far lower 
than in California. 
"Yeah, we're nowhere near San Francisco or that other really expensive area you 
have out there," said Lavoie, "Orange County." 
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY 
Here are the most and least affordable of the top 150 U.S. markets. 
Affordability rankings are based on the percentage of an average family's gross 
monthly income needed to make payments on an average-priced house in the area 
after a 20% down payment.
