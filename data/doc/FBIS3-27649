  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- An investment guarantee 
law proposed recently by Beijing's State Council is only a ploy 
as part of Mainland China's effort to achieve its goal of "one 
China, two systems," Mainland Affairs Council Chairman [MAC] 
Huang Kun-hui said Thursday [24 February]. 
  Huang, at a Legislative Yuan briefing session, reported that 
although the protection law, made public at the end of last year 
by Mainland China's State Council, seems to have upgraded the 
status of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland, it does not 
include concrete measures to protect Taiwan investors' business 
interests and personal rights. 
  The newly issued investment protection law still considers 
Taiwan investors "special local investors" subject to Mainland 
China's relevant laws and regulations, Huang said. 
  Huang appealed to local industries to act with utmost 
caution 
in the face of any possible policy changes that might cause 
great losses to them, given that Mainland China is undergoing an 
economic transformation from a planned economy to a 
market-oriented one. 
  Mainland China so far lacks a comprehensive law regulating 
Taiwan industries' investment and normal business practices 
there, let alone protecting their property rights and lives, 
Huang said. In other countries, he added, foreign investors are 
usually given special protection. 
  Taiwan investors can be fully protected in Mainland China 
only when a formal and wide-ranging investment guarantee 
agreement is worked out by Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation 
[SEF] and Beijing's Association of Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS], he said. 
  The SEF and ARATS are the semi-official agents representing 
Taiwan and Mainland China in cross-strait affairs in the absence 
of formal contacts between Taipei and Beijing.
