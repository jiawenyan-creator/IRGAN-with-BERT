  [Text] Vilnius May 8 TASS -- During a meeting with 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, chief of the 
International Monetary Fund's Baltic Branch Adalbert Knobl and 
IMF representative in Lithuania Peter Kornely expressed concern 
over the republic's increasing budget deficit. 
  The meeting was also attended by the Lithuanian prime 
minister, finance minister and chairman of Lithuania's bank 
board of directors. 
  National radio quoted on Sunday the IMF officials as saying 
Lithuania's deficit had exceeded the level specified by the 
memorandum which was signed by the republic's government and the 
IMF. Unless the situation over the mounting deficit is 
rectified in the near future, the International Monetary Fund 
may suspend credits earmarked for Lithuania. The IMF officials 
believe the first thing to be done by the Baltic republic is to 
cut back on budget expenditures. 
  The IMF representatives expressed regret that Lithuania had 
not yet passed a law on its National Bank, nor had it taken any 
measures to regulate activities of commercial banks. The 
officials were especially critical about reliability of 
statistic data which they said did not reflect the actual 
economic situation in Lithuania.
