FT  15 MAR 94 / Russian coal strikes subside
Strikes across Russia's coal industry subsided yesterday as miners began to
receive wages overdue from December and January. However, thousands of
workers have yet to return to the pits and some union leaders are
threatening to turn their financial grievances into demands for a new
government. Stoppages took place throughout Russia's coal regions last week.
They are also seeking Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) in state support for the
debt-ridden industry.
The government has argued that such aid would fuel inflation and put too
much pressure on the budget. Moscow is already struggling to keep the
deficit down to 10 per cent of gross domestic product this year. Miners'
leaders will meet later this week to decide on any further action.
