FT  12 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Baltic states in EC link
THE EC yesterday signed 10-year trade and co-operation accords with Albania
and the three Baltic states, David Buchan reports from Brussels. The EC will
scrap all discriminatory quotas against imports from the four countries;
they pledge not to use licensing or foreign exchange controls to impede
imports from the EC.
Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian ministers hoped yesterday's pacts, giving
them the benefits they briefly had under the EC's 1990 trade and
co-operation accord with the Soviet Union, would be followed by eventual
talks with Brussels on free trade.
