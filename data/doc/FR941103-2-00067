 

(The commentor) believes that some or all of the decrease may result from elimination or reduction of dam repair work
described in Reclamation's response to (the commentor's) comments on the 1995 Work Program review. The increases
(i.e., increases over and above the amounts shown in the 1995 Work Program) are unexplained, however, by changes presented
in the 1995 Work Program. Therefore, (the commentor) recommends use of the investments shown in line 31 of table 7 in
the Collbran/Rate PRS. 




Response: 

Table 7 in the commentor's July 27 comment letter displays Collbran investment as shown in the FY 1995 Work Program.
Western agrees with the commentor's figures for FY 1994 through FY 1998, except that carry-over from FY 1993 must also
be added to FY 1994's total number. Western's brochure study also contained some figures from the FY 1995 Congressional
Budget Submission. There have since been changes to that budget that have reduced some of those costs by approximately
$450,000. Western has rerun the Collbran ratesetting PRS using these changes. 

The following table illustrates how incremental investment in budget figures is transformed into a PRS entry. Figures
from Reclamation's FY 1995 Work Program are used. The Collbran Project was used for this example because it contains
no IDC or multipurpose investment, thereby simplifying the illustration.
