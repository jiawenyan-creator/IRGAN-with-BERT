FT  25 FEB 92 / Observer: Loyalties strined
The Queen's recent visit to Australia will be remembered for the unusually
large number of faux pas committed by her rebellious subjects down under.
Among the more memorable was the Sydney Morning Herald's. It published a
photo-portrait of Her Majesty in full regalia, only to discover that she was
arrayed in the Order of Canada and the Canadian Order of Military Merit
instead of the Order of Australia.
The error was spotted by Sir David Smith, a former secretary to the
Governor-General, who clearly knows his medals. The Herald is blaming
London, though whether it means its own office, Australia House or the city
generally is not clear. Canada's Conrad Black, the new owner of the Sydney
Morning Herald, is going to have to do better than that if he wants to earn
his knighthood.
