FT  29 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Face up to deficit by borrowing
Sir, Stephen Bell of Morgan Grenfell could hardly put the case better when
he writes that recession leads to a loss of industrial capacity and to more
unemployable labour (Letters, November 25).
Why then does he call for 'massive increases in taxation and/or reductions
in public expenditure' to close the budget deficit? He must surely know that
such 'massive' measures will lead to a correspondingly 'massive' worsening
of the recession, to more unemployment and to further losses of industrial
capacity. Samuel Brittan, in a series of articles, has been correct in
repeatedly questioning the seriousness of the budget deficit and in warning
against panic over its size.
The best way of handling the deficit in present conditions is to go on
borrowing. We have already seen from the experience of this year that this
can be done without the rise in interest rates (and fall in security prices)
which some people in the City are so fearful of.
More generally, fiscal action should always be undertaken with a view to its
effects on the economy - on inflation, employment and industry.
