FUROR OVER FLAG BURNING 
In response to "What They Die for, We Burn," by Lee Iacocca, Op-Ed Page, June 
29: 
"The irony," said Iacocca, "is almost too heavy to comprehend": The Goddess of 
Democracy is destroyed in China, and in the U.S., the Supreme Court says 
Americans have the right to burn the flag. 
Through incredibly twisted logic, Iacocca sees the right of free expression in 
America as opposed to the right of free expression in China. 
What can be more ironic than Iacocca's own view?
