FT  12 FEB 92 / Washington delays guarantee payments on BNL loans to Iraq
THE US government is holding up the reimbursement of Dollars 350m (Pounds
191m) in export credit guarantees on loans made to Iraq by the Atlanta,
Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
The delay, according to a senior US official, is related to the forthcoming
trial of several BNL Atlanta officials who have been charged with fraud in
connection with more than Dollars 4bn of improper Iraqi loans.
The trial, which will include Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta
branch manager, is likely to be delayed from March 2 until June, in order to
give defendants more time to prepare.
BNL's Atlanta branch provided crucial funds to Iraq, including about Dollars
2bn that helped to finance Mr Saddam Hussein's nuclear missile and chemical
weapons projects.
The Dollars 350m of BNL loan guarantees - which were supposedly made to
support US farm exports to Iraq - are part of some Dollars 1.9bn of
US-backed loans that Iraq has defaulted on.
A spokesman at the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which guaranteed the
Iraqi loans, said the matter 'is being evaluated at the highest levels of
our department.'
