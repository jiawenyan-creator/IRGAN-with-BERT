FT  04 MAR 93 / TUC attacks change in safety role
THE Trades Union Congress has complained to the government about plans to
advertise the job of chairman of the Health and Safety Commission as a
part-time, rather than a full-time post. Sir John Cullen, the current
chairman, will retire in September.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, wrote to Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, that he was 'surprised and concerned by this decision
to reduce the status of the chairmanship of the HSC'.
The Department of Employment said senior management structures had been
strengthened, and advertising the post as part-time would open access to a
wider range of people, including women.
