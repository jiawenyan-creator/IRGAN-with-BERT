FT  01 AUG 94 / Wage issue high on TUC agenda
Next month's Trades Union Congress looks likely to cause the Labour party
political embarrassment by favouring a specific target for a national
legally binding minimum wage.
It is also expected to try to commit a future Labour government to making
full employment the dominant element of its economic policy.
In the TUC's preliminary agenda, published today, a resolution from the
usually moderate shopworkers' union Usdaw declares that Labour should
introduce a national minimum wage at half of male median earnings - now
about Pounds 4 an hour. This figure should be revised upwards annually, says
Usdaw, in line with the movement of male median earnings.
Unison, the largest union with many low-paid members in the public services,
goes further by saying the proposed national minimum wage target should
eventually rise 'over time' from half of male median earnings to two-thirds
of average earnings.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, has made clear that while he supports the
idea of a national minimum wage in principle he does not want to commit
himself to a specific target.
The GMB general union in its motion calls on Mr Blair to 'stand by the
commitment given to the 1993 congress by John Smith, the then Labour leader,
that the party will ensure all the instruments of macro-economic management
will be geared to sustained growth and rising employment'.
The TGWU, the largest industrial union, says it 'believes unreservedly that
full employment is an achievable social and economic goal and should be a
central priority of the next Labour government'. It also calls for an
'innovative and imaginative' TUC campaign to win support for the full
employment agenda next year.
