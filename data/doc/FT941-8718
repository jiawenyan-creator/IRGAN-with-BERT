FT  18 FEB 94 / Tory chiefs face fresh EU poll row
The pro-European wing of the Conservative party has voiced fresh concern
about the government's campaign for the European elections amid signs that
the forthcoming poll is already reviving the party's divisions over the
Maastricht treaty.
Senior figures in the Positive Europe group, which represents about 90
backbench MPs, plan to protest to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
that the Euro-sceptic right of the party is making the running in the
campaign.
The pro-Europeans fear that the tone of recent statements by Sir Norman
Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, suggest
that the Conservatives might retreat into 'Brussels-bashing' in the approach
to the June elections.
They want Mr Hurd to make it clear to those running the campaign that the
government draws a clear distinction between the institutions of the
European Union and who controls them.
The Tory right has made the growing powers of the institutions - including
the parliament and the commission - the focus of their attacks.
But the Positive Europe group believes that such a strategy would simply
deter Conservatives supporters from voting in the election.
Instead it wants the campaign to emphasise the need for the Conservatives
not to allow the institutions to remain under socialist control.
That approach is backed by Mr Hurd. Pro-European Tory MPs believe, however,
that it is being undercut both by rightwing cabinet ministers and by the
tactics favoured in Conservative Central Office.
