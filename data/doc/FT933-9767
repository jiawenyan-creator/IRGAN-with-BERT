FT  07 AUG 93 / Advance payments could avoid VAT on fuel bills
A LEGAL LOOPHOLE could enable British consumers to avoid paying value added
tax on domestic fuel, if they pay their gas or electricity bills in advance
before VAT is imposed next April.
Chantrey Vellacott, a London accountancy firm, has calculated that if
customers paid London Electricity Pounds 1,500 - enough to cover two years'
average bills - they could save almost Pounds 200, more than they would earn
in interest at current building society rates.
As the law stands, payments in advance for goods to be supplied incur the
VAT charge applicable at the time of payment rather than at the time of
supply. So payments made before VAT is imposed at the start of the next tax
year would be zero-rated. From April 1994, 8 per cent VAT will be added to
domestic fuel bills, with the rate rising to 17.5 per cent a year later.
Maurice Fitzpatrick, a VAT practitioner at Chantrey Vellacott, said the
loophole was used in 1984 when VAT was imposed on home improvements.
Householders who paid in advance for work carried out after VAT became
chargeable were found not to be liable for VAT.
British Gas yesterday confirmed that the loophole existed and that customers
could use it. But it said it would not be promoting the loophole as an
opportunity to save tax, in spite of the fact that substantial advance
payments would bring cash-flow advantages to the company.
East Midlands Electricity said: 'We are happy to accept prepayment of bills
and have always done so. In terms of any scheme or any encouragement with
VAT looming, we have no plans to do that at present.'
However, if too many consumers decide to exploit the ruse, the prospect of
losing much-needed revenue could prompt the government to close the
loophole.
