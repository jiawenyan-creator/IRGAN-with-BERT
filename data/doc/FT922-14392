FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Beghin-Say posts fall to FFr754m
in net profits
BEGHIN-SAY, the French sugar company controlled by Italy's Ferruzzi group,
yesterday announced a fall in net profits for a second year in succession to
FFr754m (Dollars 134.64m) in 1991 from FFr1.08bn in 1990.
The group, which is to be merged by Ferruzzi with Eridiana, its Italian
sugar subsidiary, attributed the fall in net profits to a reduction in
exceptional items from a credit of FFr461m in 1990 to a debit of FFr144m
last year.
Beghin-Say, which was burdened by heavy debts after its 1988 acquisition of
Lesieur, the French cooking oils company, and large investments in
developing its sugar, oil, corn starch and ethanol interests, saw sales rise
by 8.6 per cent to FFr40.91bn during the year from FFr37.67bn.
It mustered a 22.4 per cent increase in pre-tax operating profits to
FFr1.82bn from FFr1.48bn and a 26.7 per cent rise in net profits before
exceptional items to FFr783m from FFr618m. The group's net debt rose to
FFr9.1bn in 1991 from FFr8.47bn in 1990. The board proposed raising the
dividend to FFr30 from FFr27.50.
Beghin-Say said its oils interest had shown 'strong growth' during the year
and that its grinding and refining activities had shown a moderate
improvement.
The merger with Eridania, which caused some controversy because of the
valuation of the Eridania assets being bought by Beghin-Say, will create
Europe's third largest food group, according to Ferruzzi, with projected
sales of over L11,000bn (Dollars 8.59bn) for this year.
Under the terms of the merger, Beghin-Say will make an exclusive rights
issue on Eridania's behalf in return for the latter's Italian sugar
interests and its 30 per cent stake in Cerestar, the starch group, the rest
of which is already owned by Beghin-Say. After the merger the combined
companies will be rechristened Eridania/Beghin-Say (EBS).
