FT  03 DEC 93 / Pole position
In spite of the growth of high-technology satellite and cable
communications, BT engineers still need to be able to climb one of the 4m
wooden telephone poles in use across the UK. Staff, seen here training at
Yarnfield in Staffordshire, start on 10ft poles before graduating to the
familiar 30ft poles which are still a common sight along roads in towns and
countryside
