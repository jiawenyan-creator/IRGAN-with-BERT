SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background


Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397 (c)(3)(A)(i)(I),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II)
of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United
States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register 

of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register.

Europa International, Inc. of Santa Fe, New Mexico (Registered Importer No. R91002) petitioned NHTSA
to determine whether 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1994 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPVs
are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on March 29, 1994 (59 FR
14708) to afford an opportunity for public comment. As described in that notice, the petitioner claimed that 1990,
1991, 1992, and 1994 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPVs have safety features that
comply with Standard Nos. 102
