  [Text] In the Radisson Slavyanskaya hotel a round table 
took place at which members of the American delegation headed by 
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown and representatives of 
the Russian Government met. 
  The signing of an agreement on civil peace will be the main 
condition for economic and political stabilization in the 
country, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin stated at the 
meeting. Sergey Dubinin gave the American businessmen the 
assurance that Russia's financial stabilization is becoming a 
reality: He believes that by the end of the year inflation will 
not exceed 5-7 percent per month.
