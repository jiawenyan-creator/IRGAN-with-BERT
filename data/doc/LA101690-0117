REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CINE-SOURCE STOCK FALLS AS 'TEXASVILLE' FALTERS 
The stock of Universal City-based Cine-Source Inc. has collapsed from $6 on 
Oct. 7 to 21.875 cents as of Monday's close. 
Perhaps investors have noticed that "Texasville," the Peter 
Bogdanovich-directed sequel to the "Last Picture Show," hasn't turned out to be 
the box office success that Cine-Source, the film's co-producer,was hoping for. 
Since its opening Sept. 28, "Texasville" has taken in a paltry $1.93 million in 
ticket receipts. 
The film was the first project for Cine-Source, which lined up $24 million from 
investors to finance the production, promotion and advertising costs.
