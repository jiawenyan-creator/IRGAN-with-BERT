MAUREEN O'CONNOR 
"What you see is what you get" with our Mayor Maureen, and it has been so since 
her first race for city council, when she wore her princess clothes to the 
delight of everyone, and had no "issue" except her famous "open door." Maureen 
is not as intelligent as her twin, but she is also not mean-spirited, and she's 
blessed with liking people, and people respond. 
She gave us a wonderful party, and it is still going on in Balboa Park to 
capacity crowds. She doesn't look like a man, nor act like a man, thank 
goodness, and she has proved effective in ways that count to the average 
person. 
We have had too many hard-headed, insensitive, and corrupt politicians and 
businessmen running San Diego for 30 years -- some real dingbats -- to the 
point of looking like "the banana republic of the Southwest". We needed a 
calmer city government. 
Your paper is usually excellent in coverage, but not this time. Take a look at 
who else San Diegans have overwhelmingly endorsed before you came on the scene 
-- even afterward: Nixon, with his "promise" to end the Vietnam War, and 
dressed the White House in what looked like Middle Ages livery; Reagan, who 
never read anything but his file cards, and didn't know an issue from a hole in 
the ground; and Sneaky Pete -- whom you seem to be bent on anointing, as was 
done before by our local media. 
Come talk to the people, as Maureen does, and learn that many voted for Pete 
Wilson as senator to get him out of San Diego, so he couldn't do any more harm 
here!
