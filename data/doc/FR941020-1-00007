(b) Service on detail, temporary promotion, or reassignment to another supervisory or managerial position while
serving probation is creditable toward completion of probation. Service in a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position
is not creditable.

(c) Absence in a non-pay status while on the rolls (other than absence because of compensable injury or military duty)
is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military
duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service.

(d) Service during a probationary period from which an employee was separated or demoted for cause does not count toward
completion of probation required under a subsequent appointment. In other situations in which an employee does not
complete probation, service is creditable as determined by agency policy.

(b) A nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial employee who is demoted into a position in which probation under 315.904
is required and who, for reasons of supervisory or managerial performance, does not satisfactorily complete the
probationary period is entitled to be assigned to a position at the same grade and pay as the position in which he or she
was serving probation. The employee is eligible for repromotion in accordance with agency promotion policy.
