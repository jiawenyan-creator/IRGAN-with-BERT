FT  13 MAR 92 / Money Markets: Gloom grips traders
GLOOM spread over the UK money market yesterday, with rates firming across
the board and the prospect of great uncertainty ahead.
A bigger-than-expected rise in Spanish inflation (0.7 per cent against 0.3
per cent) left the Spanish authorities without room to make another interest
rate cut. That, together with a fall in sterling, dealt a final blow to
hopes of a cut in the UK.
'The market is fighting scared. It's scared of a change of government or of
a hung parliament, the PSBR is a horror story, and there seems to be no end
in sight to the recession,' said one dealer.
'There seems to be nothing to relieve the gloom, and the feeling is if the
base rate is going in any direction, it might be up.'
Sterling interbank rates reflected this by going above a normal 10 1/2 per
cent gearing, with the whole spectrum from the one week to one year at
between 10 5/8 and 10 3/4 per cent.
The key three-month interbank rate firmed  1/16 to 10-10 9/16 .
Heavy selling caused the June sterling contract to tumble from 89.56 to a
low of 89.31, defying expectations of strong support at 89.42, recovering
only to 89.34.
Day-to-day funding was easier, although overnight rates drifted up from 10
7/8 -10 5/8 per cent to 11 1/4 -11 before late lending by the Bank of
England brought them down to 11-10 3/4 per cent.
The Bank forecast a shortage of around Pounds 700m, but did not operate on
the early round. At midday, it revised the forecast down to Pounds 650m, and
purchased Pounds 207m band 1 bank bills and Pounds 54m band 2 bank bills,
both at 10 3/8 per cent.
The forecast was later revised back to Pounds 700m, and the Bank purchased a
further Pounds 125m band 1 bank bills, and Pounds 16m band 2 bank bills,
both at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of Pounds 170m.
German call money rates remained locked at 9.55/65 per cent, with no sign of
easing, although high reserve levels and a DM3.1bn injection by the
Bundesbank on Wednesday were preventing a rise.
The Federal Reserve added reserves to the US banking system through four-day
system repurchase agreements, to cover a shortage caused by the maintenance
period ending on March 18. Federal funds were trading at 3 15/16 per cent,
below the Fed's presumed 4 per cent target.
