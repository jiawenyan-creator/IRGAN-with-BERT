FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Sunkyong to cut back on
subsidiaries
SUNKYONG Group, Korea's sixth-biggest business group, plans a package of
mergers and a share sale reducing the number of the group's subsidiaries to
24 from 32, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
Sunkyong is to sell two subsidiaries and merge seven others. It will sever
its subsidiary relations with Yukong Fuchs and Sunkyong Cleantech by selling
stakes of 50 per cent and 100 per cent respectively.
Yukong Fuchs is a joint-venture with Fuchs Group of Switzerland. 'Fuchs has
nearly agreed to our plan to sell our stake in the company,' said Sunkyong.
Included in the merger plan are Sunkyong Pharmaceuticals and Sunkyong
Information System which will merge respectively into Sunkyong Industries
and YC&amp;C Co.
The moves reflect Sunkyong's attempts to streamline its organisation.
