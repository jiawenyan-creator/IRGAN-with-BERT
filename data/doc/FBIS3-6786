  [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong says economic and trade 
relations between Singapore and Botswana will get stronger as 
both sides learn more about each other's business opportunities. 
He said effective government, ethnic harmony, and political 
stability are the intangible but critical factors behind 
Botswana's success. 
  Mr. Goh was speaking at the dinner for the visiting 
Botswanan 
leader, President Ketumile Masire. One area of cooperation 
which has already started is a technical training program which 
focuses on education and productivity.
