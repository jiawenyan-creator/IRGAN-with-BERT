FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Oki Electric returns to black
but skips payout
Strong demand for semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, coupled
with a restructuring programme, helped Oki Electric, the Japanese electrical
machinery maker, return to profitability in the first half of fiscal 1994.
Oki beat its own expectations and boosted non-consolidated sales in the
period by 6.6 per cent to Y273.1bn (USDollars 2.8bn) from Y256.2bn last
year.
The company recorded Y24.7bn in recurring profits - before extraordinary
items and tax - compared with a loss of Y6.8bn previously.
Buoyant demand for memory chips, particularly from the computer industry in
overseas markets, and strong orders for telecommunications equipment from
NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group with which Oki has
long-established ties, were the main factors behind the company's improved
performance, it said.
Oki also benefited from a cost-cutting programme it implemented at the
beginning of the term. Net profits totalled Y22.1bn against a loss of
Y12.4bn.
However, the company, which still had an accumulated loss of Y16.5bn at the
mid-term, passed its dividend.
The company forecasts sales of Y530bn in the full year, compared with an
earlier forecast of Y527bn.
Recurring profits are expected to total Y30bn, rather than Y10bn and net
profits are forecast at Y27bn, rather than Y6bn.
