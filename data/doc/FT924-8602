FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westpac management given year's
deadline
SENIOR management of Westpac, the troubled Australian bank, was yesterday
given a year to solve the bank's problems before facing pressure for changes
from institutional shareholders.
Mr Ian Salmon, managing director of the AMP Society, Australia's biggest
financial institution, said it had been made clear to Westpac management
that the bank's operational performance must be improved quickly.
'They will do it in the course of the next six to 12 months or I guess the
board will decide they can't do it and make some alternative arrangements,'
he said.
The AMP is Westpac's biggest shareholder with just under 15 per cent of the
stock and two seats on the board. It has supported the bank's board and
senior managers over the past two years in spite of a series of poor
results.
Mr Salmon said there was no need for further board changes following the
resignations last month of five directors, including Sir Eric Neal, the
former chairman.
However, he said the AMP would 'have something to say' if Westpac were not
moving in the right direction within six months. 'We can apply a little bit
of leverage. We have a fair shareholding. I think we would get a lot of
support,' he said.
Westpac shares fell to a low of ADollars 2.42 on the Australian Stock
Exchange after Mr Salmon's comments, but recovered to close at ADollars
2.50, down one cent on the day. The shares fell 24 cents to a nine-year low
of ADollars 2.51 on Friday, following the announcement of an unexpected
ADollars 115m (USDollars 80m) tax charge in the US.
The US tax problem followed a failed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue and a
disastrous first half, in which the bank incurred a pre-tax loss of ADollars
2.2bn after writing off ADollars 2.65bn against bad debts.
