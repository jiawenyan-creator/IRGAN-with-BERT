FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong growth at Societe
Generale
Societe Generale last year bucked the downturn in the French banking
industry to increase net profits by 10.5 per cent to FFr3.61bn (Dollars
612m) from FFr3.28bn in 1992.
The bank is stepping up its dividend by 6.7 per cent to FFr16 a share.
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said a strong performance from market trading
activities had helped to counter the negative effect of the sluggish banking
market.
He said the group was on course for another increase in profits during 1994.
The news of Societe Generale's profits growth came only a day after Credit
Lyonnais, one of its chief competitors, announced a FFr6.9bn net loss for
1993.
Credit Lyonnais disclosed details of a FFr44.9bn rescue package it has
negotiated with the French government.
Societe Generale, like Credit Lyonnais, has been adversely affected by the
impact of the economic recession on the French banking market.
However, it has been less vulnerable to the downturn, having adopted a more
prudent approach to lending, acquisitions and provisioning in the approach
to the recession.
The group saw its net banking income increase by 10.4 per cent to FFr40.35bn
in 1993 from FFr36.55bn in 1992.
However, it managed to restrict the increase in its costs to 8.5 per cent at
FFr28.04bn in 1993 from FFr25.85bn in the previous year thereby fuelling a
15.1 per cent increase in operating profits to FFr12.31bn from FFr10.7bn
over the same period.
Mr Vienot said most of the increase in operating profits came from market
trading. Societe Generale, like other Gallic banks, last summer made large
profits from its dealings in the French franc during the European currency
crisis.
However, the group was forced to make new provisions of FFr7.21bn, a 15.2
per cent increase over FFr6.26bn in 1992.
Mr Vienot said the bulk of these provisions were writedowns on commercial
loans and property holdings.
M6, the French television station due to be floated this year, reported a 60
per cent increase in net profits to FFr169.2m for 1993.
The company is owned by a group of institutional investors including
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez.
