FT  28 JAN 93 / WH Smith falls 20% after losses at DIY venture
LOSSES at WH Smith's Do It All joint venture and a late start to Christmas
trade cut the retail and distribution group's interim profits from Pounds
50.1m to Pounds 40.2m. Smith's shares fell 15p to 440p.
Group sales rose 7.1 per cent to Pounds 1.07bn in the six months to November
28. The group benefited from an unchanged pension credit of Pounds 4.6m, but
interest charges rose from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.5m. Earnings per share
fell from 14.5p to 10.8p, and the interim dividend was unchanged at 4.3p.
Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, said: 'We still cannot see any clear signs of an
upturn.' If there were a recovery this year, he added, it was likely to be
'slow and uneven'.
Smith's share of losses from Do It All, a chain of do-it-yourself shops
owned equally with Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical group, was Pounds
8.4m compared with a loss of Pounds 900,000 in the corresponding period the
previous year. Boots shares fell 8p to 517p.
Sir Simon said Do It All had held its share of a fiercely competitive
market. There had been less blanket price-cutting in the industry in recent
weeks, although there was still a lot of 'price activity'. He was confident
the chain would recover once the housing market picked up and that Do It All
was 'not going to be a cash gobbler'. He said that, after Smith and Boots
had each put Pounds 5m into the chain in December, with Smith already having
subscribed Pounds 24m in April, no further cash would be needed this
financial year.
In the other UK retail chains, trading profits fell from Pounds 35.6m to
Pounds 30.6m. A 2 per cent drop in sales in November, with customers slow to
start their Christmas shopping, had cost Pounds 3m in profits. Redundancy
costs of Pounds 1m and another Pounds 1m spent on new technology also
contributed to the profit fall.
Sir Simon said Christmas and New Year sales were up 6.6 per cent on the
previous year, although they were down until the last two weeks of that
period.
Falling demand for recorded music meant the Our Price chain made a small
loss, he said. Virgin Retail, of which Smith owns 50 per cent, made a Pounds
100,000 loss.
The group's distribution division raised trading profits 7.3 per cent to
Pounds 16.2m. Smith's US retail operations, which were expanded through
acquisition last year, saw trading profits more than double from Pounds 1.9m
to Pounds 4.2m.
