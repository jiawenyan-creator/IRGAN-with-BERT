HELP FOR BUYERS AT HOME FAIR SATURDAY 
Thinking about buying a home, but feeling overwhelmed by the decisions and 
dollars it takes to crack the Southland real estate market? 
Get expert help this Saturday at the first of The Times' three Home Buyers 
Fairs. 
Panels of realtors, home builders and lenders, government housing officials and 
consumer advocates will answer your questions at morning and afternoon 
sessions. 
More than 50 exhibitors will provide free information and services -- credit 
checks, home prices in your neighborhood, mortgage prequalification, tax 
deduction information -- and will help you make a smart decision on what, where 
and how to buy. 
The fair will run from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Saturday at the Los Angeles 
County Fairgrounds in Pomona. 
For a guide to the fair, please see the second section of Real Estate.
