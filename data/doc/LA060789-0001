CONTROLLING FIREARMS 
Your editorial labeling gun-control opponents as "accomplices" of Purdy was 
both irresponsible and an insult to the overwhelming majority of gun owners who 
are law-abiding. Purdy was clearly deranged, but was hardly a "petty" criminal. 
He could have been in jail that tragic day in Stockton for he had seven prior 
felony arrests. Yet without exception they were plea-bargained down to 
misdemeanors by lenient judges and prosecutors. The blood of five innocent 
children rests on their hands.
