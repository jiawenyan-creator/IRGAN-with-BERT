FT  31 DEC 93 / Outlook mixed for building industry
Contrasting views on the outlook for the construction industry emerged
yesterday with a forecast of a modest rise in building and civil engineering
output accompanied by a warning of further job losses and company closures,
Andrew Taylor writes.
Dr Richard Roberts, senior economist at Barclays Bank, forecast that the
value of construction output measured in constant 1985 prices would increase
next year.
He said that recovery in private-sector retail and residential output would
offset a decline in local authority spending.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that while construction
output might rise slightly next year 'it will not be without further
casualties'.
