<F P=106> [Interview with Rocco Buttiglione, member of the Italian </F>
Popular Party, PPI, by "g.l." in Rome; date not given: "I Am 
Saying We Should Let Them Govern"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [LA REPUBBLICA] Deputy Buttiglione, in your 
opinion, what attitude should the PPI take as regards the vote 
on the government in the Senate? 
  [Buttiglione] We must start with a basic premise. During the 
election campaign, we said that we were asking people to vote 
for us so that we could govern the country, or alternatively, if 
this proved impossible, we would go into opposition. Now, if 
nobody has an absolute majority, as is the case in the Senate, 
this poses a problem. I believe that they will have to reach a 
decision at Palazzo Madama [Senate] by taking one basic fact 
into account: Is a better government than the present one 
available in the foreseeable future? I think we must take a 
responsible attitude, allowing them to govern the country. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] The PPI's "regents," however, do not seem to 
agree with this view. 
  [Buttiglione] I am offering my own opinion. The others must 
then assume responsibility for whatever they decide. In any 
case, I believe the regents are not all that far from my own 
position. Any political force must ask itself whether a better 
government than Berlusconi's is feasible in the foreseeable 
future, and whether early elections would give us a better 
parliament than the existing one. If the answer -- as I believe 
it is -- is "no," then we must appeal to people's sense of 
responsibility. An alternative solution -- although I do not 
know to what extent this would be technically feasible -- might 
be that of bringing down the government, yet giving Berlusconi 
another chance, telling him to attempt to form a better 
government. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Why are you so anxious to establish a 
dialogue with Forza Italia? 
  [Buttiglione] Because we must build up the 
liberal-democratic 
aligment, and this can only be done with moderate forces, by 
breaking up the majority. Forza Italia is a centrist force, but 
in the League there are centrist elements too. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Your line is already giving rise to a 
confrontation within the PPI. Do you agree with holding a 
congress in July, or do you want it to be held earlier? 
  [Buttiglione] If miracles were possible, I would rather we 
had held it yesterday. I think that July may do, but not a day 
later than 8 July. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Will you stand as a candidate for the 
secretariat? 
  [Buttiglione] I will be submitting -- to congress -- a 
political proposal that cannot be simplified to an alliance with 
Forza Italia. I believe that it is right for someone proposing 
a political line to personally assume responsibility for its 
implementation. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Are you not afraid that the PPI may 
definitely disintegrate over the question of its relationship to 
Forza Italia? 
  [Buttiglione] I will make every effort to ensure that it 
stays united. If we really want to build a liberal-democratic 
alignment, we will require all our intelligence and all our 
might. The PPI's problem is not that it has two souls, but 
rather, that it must assimilate the majority system ethos: You 
cannot defend your identity by standing still. Perhaps we ought 
to read again the talents' parable in the Bible.
