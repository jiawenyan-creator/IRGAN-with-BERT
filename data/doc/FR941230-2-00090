<DOCTITLE>Magnetek; Huntington, Indiana, Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



By an application dated November 4, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the
subject petition for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The notice of determinations was issued on October 28, 1994
and published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 16, 1994 (59 FR 59253).

Investigation findings show that the workers producing magnetic components met all the worker group eligibility
requirements for certification. Workers producing electronic ballasts did not meet the ``contributed importantly''
test of the Trade Act. New findings show corporate imports of electronic 
ballasts from Mexico.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to jusitify reconsideration
of the prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 16th day of December,
1994.
