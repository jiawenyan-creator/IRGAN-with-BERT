SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed rule has been developed with full participation and consultation of the affected Indian and Alaska Native
public. Prior to drafting the proposed rule, public scoping meetings were announced and held in Minneapolis, Portland,
Phoenix and Anchorage in February and March, 1991. Input from those meetings was considered and addressed in the proposed
rule. Additional consultation with the affected public was accomplished by maintaining close communication with
the Intertribal Timber Council (ITC) during the rule drafting process and including ITC members on the project steering
committee and project in working groups. 



This proposed rule is published in exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant
Secretary_Indian Affairs by 208 DM 8.
