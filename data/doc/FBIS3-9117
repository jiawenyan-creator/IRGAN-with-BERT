  [Text] Warsaw, 18 Mar--Andrzej Olechowski and Povilas 
Gylys, the foreign ministers of Poland and Lithuania, today 
initialed in Warsaw the "Treaty Between the Polish Republic and 
the Republic of Lithuania on Friendly Relations and Neighborly 
Cooperation." Both ministers underscored the great importance 
of this fact to Poland and Lithuania as well as to the entire 
region. 
  The ministers announced that the text of the treaty would be 
published only after it is signed by the presidents of Poland 
and Lithuania, which is to take place in April. 
  "Treaties open the future and do not refer to the past," 
Minister Olechowski said during the ceremony. He added that 
there had been different, some better and some worse, chapters 
in the history of Polish-Lithuanian relations, but initialing 
and signing the treaty would open a new "wonderful and rich" 
chapter in relations between both states. 
  Minister Olechowski assured journalists that there were no 
reasons for concern that the treaty did not guarantee the rights 
of the Polish minority in Lithuania. 
  Minister Gylys said that, at the outset of the negotiations, 
there were considerable differences between both sides but that 
they were striving for compromise.
