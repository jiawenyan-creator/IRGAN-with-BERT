FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Charge of Dollars 305m at
Prudential Securities
Prudential Securities, the Wall Street securities firm, announced the
addition of Dollars 305m to reserves, set aside to settle lawsuits brought
by thousands of customers who claim they were defrauded when the firm sold
them high-risk limited partnerships in the 1980s.
The addition means Prudential Securities will take a loss of Dollars 215m in
the second quarter. The firm's parent, Prudential Insurance, has agreed to
add Dollars 180m to Prudential Securities' capital.
Even without the cost of adding to its reserves, the firm said it would have
reported a loss of Dollars 35m in the quarter, because of the slump in US
stock and bond markets and the slowdown in the domestic brokerage business.
In the same quarter a year ago, it made a profit of Dollars 35m.
Prudential Securities said it was almost doubling the size of its reserve
fund, to Dollars 635m, because its settlements with customers were proving
larger than anticipated, due primarily to unexpectedly high interest
payments.
The securities house has been making reparations to customers since last
October. Then, it agreed to pay Dollars 371m in fines and restitutions to
settle state charges that it defrauded thousands of investors by persuading
them to buy more than Dollars 8bn of limited partnerships in the 1980s. Many
of those high-risk limited partnerships subsequently soured, and investors
claimed that they were never told the investments were highly speculative.
Its underestimation of the cost of the legal settlements, and the need for a
capital injection from its parent, is a blow for Prudential Securities. When
the firm agreed to the multi-million dollar settlement last year, its chief
executive, Mr Hardwick Simmons, said he hoped the deal represented 'one last
punch'. But since then, the firm has has lost numerous brokers to rival
securities firms.
