FT  04 MAR 92 / Swiss engineers and Japanese pump maker in 5% stake swap
SULZER Brothers, the Swiss engineering group, and Ebara, the leading
Japanese pump maker, are to take 5 per cent share stakes in each other,
writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The Sulzer shares for the transaction, valued at SFr66m (Dollars 44m), are
to come from a 10 per cent block acquired by Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC)
from the collapsed Omni group last year. Ebara will issue convertible bonds
to Sulzer.
Sulzer, which has done business in Japan since the beginning of this
century, said the two groups were in talks about co-operation in the
production of pumps and environmental and refrigeration systems.
The Swiss group noted that Ebara's activities were concentrated mainly in
Japan.
With Japanese markets becoming more open, Ebara saw a need to expand its
presence in world markets. Sulzer, on the other hand, was weak in Asia.
In the pumps field, Sulzer estimated that there was a 50 per cent overlap
between the two groups, with Ebara strongest in standard, mass-produced
pumps and Sulzer ahead in engineered pumps.
Pumps have been a declining portion of Sulzer's business for some years, now
accounting for only 8 per cent of group sales.
