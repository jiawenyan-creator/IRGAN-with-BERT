FT  06 AUG 94 / Palumbo fails to stop legal action
Lord Palumbo, the former Arts Council chairman, yesterday failed in an
attempt to block the legal action brought against him by two of his children
in a dispute over the family's Pounds 70m trust fund.
His two eldest children - Mr James Palumbo and Mrs Annabella Adams - are
suing him to recover some of the fund's assets which they claim were wrongly
paid out. They are also seeking the removal of Lord and Lady Palumbo as
trustees of the fund.
Lord Palumbo earlier this week sought a High Court order for the action to
be struck out. However, following a five day hearing, Mr Justice Rattee
ruled there was a case to go to a full hearing and dismissed his
application.
