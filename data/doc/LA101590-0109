HEALTH; 
TB SHOWS DEADLY RESURGENCE 
Tuberculosis is resurging after decades of decline, killing nearly 3 million 
people worldwide annually and threatening to claim even more lives unless quick 
action is taken, health officials warned today. 
The World Health Organization reported that progress against TB, a contagious 
disease of the lungs and other organs, has "come to an abrupt halt" in some 
industrial countries, including the United States. 
Furthermore, the number of reported TB cases has almost doubled in some east 
and central African nations over the last four or five years, WHO said. 
Currently, about 8 million people annually develop new cases of TB. About 20 
million people worldwide have active cases, and another 1.7 billion are 
carriers of TB bacteria. 
"Countries with the highest rates of HIV (AIDS virus) infection and high 
numbers of TB carriers are recording explosive rates of TB," said Dr. Arata 
Kochi of WHO, explaining that people whose immune systems are crippled by the 
AIDS virus are more susceptible to tuberculosis.
