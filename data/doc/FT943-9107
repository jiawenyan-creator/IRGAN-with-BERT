FT  13 AUG 94 / US predicts fall in Brazil coffee crop of 30-40%
The US Department of Agriculture estimated yesterday that next year's coffee
crop in Brazil would be reduced by between 30 and 40 per cent because of
damage caused by recent sharp frosts. The USDA put next year's crop at
17m-20m bags, higher than Brazil's own assessment of 17m bags made in
mid-July. It compares with US expectations of a Brazilian crop totalling 26m
bags this year. Ms Judy Ganes, soft commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in
New York, said the USDA's figures were well within the market's
expectations. 'The market has been discounting a pretty bearish number so,
if anything, it could cause prices to bounce a bit,' she said. Coffee
futures prices in London and New York fell by about 10 per cent this week on
expectation that the US assessment would judge the Brazilian crop to be in
better health than expected. Prices in London closed at Dollars 3,273 a
tonne on Friday after a day of nervous trading ahead of the report. Week in
