FT  17 MAR 92 / Blue Circle unions may strike
THE four unions representing craft and process workers at Blue Circle Cement
have won a mandate for limited strike action from their members in response
to the company's attempt to introduce a 12-month pay freeze for 1992.
Workers in the AEU engineering union, the GMB general union, the EETPU
electricians' union and the TGWU general union have voted by a large
majority to support an initial seven-day strike.
