FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Zenith sees savings of Dollars
50m from shake-up
Zenith, the troubled US television and electronics manufacturer, plans to
re-engineer its core consumer electronics and cable businesses and
restructure other product lines.
The reorganisation, which comes barely a year after the company's last
significant restructuring, will result in a fourth-quarter charge to
earnings of about Dollars 30m, the company said.
The charge will require the company to amend a Dollars 90m revolving credit
agreement with GE Capital, its lead lender.
The restructuring will affect Zenith's computer monitor and magnetics
businesses, where production capacity is being reduced.
The action will affect two production plants in Mexico and, to a lesser
extent, manufacturing operations near Zenith's headquarters in Glenview,
Illinois.
Combined with previously-announced restructurings, Zenith expects the moves
to reduce costs by about Dollars 50m in 1994.
