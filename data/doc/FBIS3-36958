  [Text] Russia and Ukraine, the two big Slav republics, 
maintain their total opposition to any kind of action by NATO 
forces against the Serbs in Bosnia. Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko, who has just made a speech in Madrid after his 
visit with Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, repeated his 
view that air strikes could cause an escalation of the war. 
  He particularly underlined the danger involved for the 
civilian population, as well as for the Blue Helmet contingents 
stationed in the area. 
  [Begin Zlenko recording, in Spanish] I am very worried about 
the present situation in this region because the military 
contingent from my country is in Sarajevo, and you know that 
this situation makes us search for other solutions. [end 
recording]
