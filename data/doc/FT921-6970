FT  25 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): BT under pressure on childcare
provision
NEARLY three fifths of mothers and 13 per cent of fathers working for BT,
the telecommunications company, do not apply for promotion because of the
demands of childcare, according to a union survey.
BT Union, the co-ordinating body for the four unions which negotiate with
BT, said the results demonstrated the need for BT to assist staff with
childcare costs. It called on the company to act in line with commitments
made in October at the launch of Opportunity 2000, the business-backed
initiative to improve the situation of women at work.
Mr Tony Young, general-secretary of the NCU communications union, said the
survey sought 'to bring these facts out into the open and put pressure on BT
to do more than just say they are an equal opportunities employer'.
BT - which employs 220,000 staff, 28 per cent of whom are women - welcomed
the survey as a contribution to the debate on attracting, retaining and
developing women in the workforce. It said direct payments to staff with
children would be unfair. Provision would be expensive and unlikely to suit
all cases.
Ms Beverley McGowan, assistant secretary of STE, the managers' union, said
the survey showed men were taking childcare seriously. 'We found that aspect
of the results both surprising and heartening,' she said.
The survey found 61 per cent of fathers and 80 per cent of mothers would use
a workplace nursery and 65 per cent of fathers and 87 per cent of mothers a
holiday playscheme. BT Union set the weekly cost of childcare at Pounds 50
per child and said it did not expect BT to bear the full costs.
More than 2,500 staff responded to the survey.
