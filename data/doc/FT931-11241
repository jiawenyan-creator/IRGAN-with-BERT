FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: US groups consider NZ Rail bid
TWO US companies have declared an interest in bidding for New Zealand Rail,
the government-owned railway that is being offered for sale internationally.
Strong interest is rumoured from other overseas interests, including Sea
Containers, the UK rail and ferry operator.
To date, only the two US companies, Railroad Development Corporation, a
Pittsburg railway group, and Burlington Northern, a Texas rail operator,
have announced they are considering buying New Zealand Rail.
The sale of New Zealand Rail is expected to fetch up to NZDollars 400m
(USDollars 210.5m). The government hopes to complete the sell-off by the
middle of this year, and has appointed Booz Allen and Hamilton, the
international management consultancy, to handle the sale.
Mr Robert Pietrandrea, chairman and vice-president of Railroad Development
Corporation, said New Zealand Rail was a 'unique' operation that had defied
conventional wisdom by making money out of passenger services. It was also
one of the few railroads in the world that was profitable.
Railroad Development Corporation is owned by Hawthorn Group, which also has
property, media and other interests. It also runs freight lines in Argentina
and manages a 1,000km line between Omaha and Chicago.
It has been reported that Sea Containers may be part of a consortium being
put together by the New Zealand-based Owens Group, one of New Zealand's
biggest road and port transport companies. A group of New Zealand port
companies, including the Auckland, Tauranga and Lyttelton port companies, is
also preparing to bid in order to retain ownership in New Zealand hands.
