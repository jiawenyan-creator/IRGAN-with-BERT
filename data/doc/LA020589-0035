ENTREPRENEUR KOONS 
Koons combines the worst aspects of the art world with the worst aspects of 
capitalism. 
Publishing the Koons article has alerted readers to the most despicable form of 
art fraud, but I question the Times decision to put the article in the Calendar 
section. The business section would have been more appropriate.
