FT  21 MAY 92 / EC plan to lift power curbs irks workers
THOUSANDS of employees of France's state-owned gas and electricity companies
took to the streets of Brussels yesterday to protest against a European
Commission plan to liberalise the EC energy market.
The proposals - which would allow large consumers to buy gas and electricity
from suppliers anywhere in the Community - will be discussed by energy
ministers today when further demonstrations are planned by the French
unions.
The plans are opposed by states such as France, Germany and the Netherlands,
which are protective of national energy monopolies. Britain, which has
liberalised its energy supply, backs the Commission.
The directives on the table envisage opening networks to large users from
January 1, 1993, with further liberalisation possible from 1996.
Electricite de France and Gaz de France have been among the most vociferous
opponents. Representatives of the unions yesterday met advisers to Mr
Jacques Delors, the Commission president.
Mr Claude Cambus, an EdF manager and director of the French confederation of
senior employees said employees were worried about the effect on long-term
investment and security of supply. 'From 1996, if all clients can go to the
supplier of their choice you will no longer be able to say exactly who is
responsible for continuity of supply.'
Today's meeting of ministers will not reach a decision on the directives.
Informal discussions in Portugal last month showed that most ministers had
reservations about the core of the proposals.
Several European electricity generators are lobbying the Commission and
their national governments to adopt an 'alternative approach to the carbon
tax', writes Neil Buckley in London. They say limiting CO emissions could be
met more effectively than the proposed tax.
