FT  19 OCT 94 / Nurses' pay is unfair says poll
Three in four people believe nurses are not paid fairly for their work, says
a survey today which was commissioned by the Royal College of Nursing.
The poll represents a boost to the nurses' campaign for an inflation-busting
8.3 per cent pay rise. It also shows overwhelming support for a nurse's
right to speak out in defence of patient care.
