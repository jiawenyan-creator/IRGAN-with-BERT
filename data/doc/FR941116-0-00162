(i) The calendar year that includes the first 5 months of the marketing year for upland cotton; and 
(ii) The first 8 months of the marketing year for ELS cotton. 
(b) The deficiency payment for the 1994 and 1995 crops of wheat, feed grains (except as provided for malting barley
producers in accordance with 1413.110), and rice shall be the amount by which the established (target) price

(1) Lesser of: 
(i) The national weighted average market price received by producers during the marketing year for the crop.

for the crop (for barley, prices received by producers of barley sold primarily for feed) plus: 
(A) 10 cents per bushel for wheat; 
(B) 7 cents per bushel for corn, grain sorghum, barley, and oats; and

price support level after reduction by the Secretary. 
(d) The individual farm program payment acreage for wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, and rice shall be the smaller
of the maximum payment acres or the acreage planted to the crop on the farm for harvest within the permitted acreage
of the crop for the farm. However, if the sum of the acreage of the crop planted for harvest and the optional flex acres
planted to other crops is less than the maximum payment acres for the crop, the farm program payment acreage may be increased,
in accordance with 1413.41 and 1413.42.
