  [Text] On 8 June, Ashikaga Bank disclosed the amount of 
trade exchange between Japan and North Korea and remittances by 
ethnic Koreans in Japan to their relatives in the DPRK, which 
the bank handled in fiscal 1993. According to the bank, the 
total of remittances to the DPRK were less than 500 million yen 
that year. Meanwhile, the amount of trade exchange, including 
receipts and payments, was approximately $47 million (about 
4,880 million yen), which accounts for about 10 percent of the 
total trade volume between the two countries (in fiscal 1993, 
according to customs statistics). This is the first time that a 
Japanese financial institution has disclosed the amount of 
remittances to the DPRK it handled. 
  The disclosed amount includes remittances in dollar terms 
Ashikaga Bank handled at a request of other Japanese banks. 
Commenting on the amount of remittances and trade exchange it 
handled, the bank said: "You cannot say the amount is larger 
than handled by other Japanese banks."
