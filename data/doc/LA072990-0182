NEWSWIRE: ANDRIES WINS BACK TITLE . . . AGAIN 
Dennis Andries waited 13 months for revenge. On Saturday in Melbourne, 
Australia, he got it. 
Andries knocked out Jeff Harding in the seventh round to regain the World 
Boxing Council light-heavyweight title he lost to the Australian last year. 
Andries stunned Harding with a chopping right to the head, then knocked him out 
with an overhand right at 2:15 of the round. 
Andries, a Detroit-based Englishman, became only the second to win the light 
heavyweight title three times. 
"Three times man, I did it," Andries said after improving to 37-8-2. "I came to 
his back yard and did a demolition job." 
Andries, 36, also was champion in 1986-87 and 1989. Marvin Johnson is the only 
other three-time champion in the division.
