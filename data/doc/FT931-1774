FT  24 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: A zest for life
United Friendly, one of the minnows of UK life assurance, has done its bit
for the inexorable rise of the sector. Life assurance shares have
outperformed the market by 50 per cent since 1989, when the Pearl first
pointed to the value locked away in its life fund during its vain takeover
defence against AMP. Yesterday's announcement takes the argument one stage
further, since United Friendly's surplus may be large enough to justify a
special distribution to shareholders. That accounts for the 10 per cent rise
in the shares yesterday. Refuge and Britannic, which boast an equal
embarrassment of riches, were dragged along in sympathy.
There is plenty of scope for disappointment. Sizing up the surplus will be a
long actuarial process. There are good arguments for leaving some surplus
assets in the fund. That would allow their fund managers to take some risks
in the pursuit of higher investment returns, and pay higher bonuses to
policyholders in future. Any distribution to shareholders would also have to
be approved by the Department of Trade and Industry. Now that the Office of
Fair Trading's criticism of policy marketing has turned the spotlight on the
industry, the DTI might take a tougher line over distributing surpluses.
But there is more than one way to unlock value. L&amp;G, for example, has also
sold part of its property portfolio and fund management arm to the life fund
for cash. While the smaller life companies are starting to look fully valued
at these levels, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that AMP picked up Pearl
on the cheap.
