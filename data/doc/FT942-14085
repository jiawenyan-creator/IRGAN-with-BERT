FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Interim finance chief for
Woolworth
Woolworth, the US retailer, yesterday appointed an outsider to the post of
interim chief financial officer.
The move prompted speculation that the present incumbent, who stepped aside
at the beginning of this month, will not be coming back.
The new appointee is Mr Andrew Hines, who previously worked at Pentland, the
UK sports clothing group, and Adidas, the US sports shoe company that
Pentland tried to buy in 1992. Woolworth has also made him an interim senior
vice-president.
Mr Hines's predecessor, Mr Charles Young, and Woolworth's chairman and chief
executive, Mr William Lavin, both stepped aside three weeks ago after it was
discovered that Woolworth had misreported losses as profits in the first two
quarters of last year.
Mr Lavin has been temporarily replaced by Mr John Adams, an outside director
of the Woolworth board since 1991.
The Woolworth board last week restated its 1993 results to correct the
mistakes in the quarterly figures, and said it was continuing to investigate
the events leading up to the errors.
Mr Lavin and Mr Young have denied any wrong-doing.
