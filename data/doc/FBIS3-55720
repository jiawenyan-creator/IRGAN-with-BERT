  [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- 170 lawmakers of the 
Federation Council, the upper chamber of the new legislature, 
were promised major privileges in the near future at a meeting 
with a presidential representative on Monday. 
  Pavel Borodin from the administrative office of the 
president 
told the lawmakers, who are mostly regional leaders, that their 
chamber will get 500 office cars, a special polyclinic, country 
houses, as well as four-room apartments in Moscow. 
  Some of the lawmakers opposed the privileges qualifying them 
as "impermissible luxury". 
  But Borodin said that the accomodation privileges may be 
expected only in the middle of 1995 when a corresponding complex 
of buildings with a total space of 360,000 sq metres is to be 
constructed. Besides, it will be the parliament which is to 
adopt the final decision on the issue, he said. 
  For the time being, lawmakers will have to tolerate some 
inconveniences. They will live in hotels, share one office for 
two people, work in a poorely prepared conference hall which has 
dark walls and unpleasantly looking chairs. 
  But Borodin promised fast improvements, including an office 
for each lawmaker.
