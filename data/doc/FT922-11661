FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sphere Investment Trust cuts pay-out
Sphere Investment Trust reported a net asset value of 20.9p per income share
and 66.7p per zero dividend share at December 31.
The figures compared with respective values of 19.3p and 58.9p 12 months
earlier.
Net revenue for 1991 rose to Pounds 4.33m (Pounds 4.09m) and earnings per
income share emerged at 3.53p (3.34p). A fourth interim dividend of 1.0575p
was paid in February bringing the total for the year to an unchanged 3.87p.
However, directors announced a reduced first interim of 0.75p and forecast a
total of 3.1p in a strategy designed to ensure full recovery of advance
corporation tax and to provide sufficient capital growth to safeguard
interests of zero dividend holders.
