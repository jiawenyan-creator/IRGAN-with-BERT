  [Text] Milan June 20 TASS--Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi met with visiting Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin in Milan on Monday to discuss bilateral relations. 
  The meeting became one of the key events in Chernomyrdin's 
schedule. The Russian premier is in Milan to attend the World 
Gas Congress. 
  Chernomyrdin said that the "treaty of friendship and 
cooperation between Russia and Italy is ready for signing." It 
is time for the head of the Italian Government to visit Moscow, 
he said. 
  Chernomyrdin's talks with Berlusconi is the first contact of 
the Russian leadership with the new Italian premier. The 
meeting gave good opportunities for a free exchange of views on 
bilateral relations and international issues. 
  The talks between Chernomyrdin and Berlusconi have started a 
new stage in Russia's contacts with the leaders of the leading 
industrialised countries following recent meetings with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 
light of the upcoming G-7 summit meeting to be held in Naples in 
July which will be attended by Russia.
