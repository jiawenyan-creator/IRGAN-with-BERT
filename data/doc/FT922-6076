FT  27 MAY 92 / US car sales exceed forecasts
STRONGER than expected figures for US consumer confidence and car sales
yesterday indicated that the uncertain economic recovery is becoming more
firmly established.
The signs of stronger domestic growth, together with fears of higher oil
prices, contributed to a sharp fall in bond prices on Wall Street.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its
closely-followed index of consumer confidence rose to 71.6 this month,
against 65.1 in April and a low of 47.3 in February.
Sales of domestically made cars jumped to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate
of 6.7m in the middle of the month, compared with analysts' forecasts of
sales of 6m. Sales were running at an annual rate of only 5.7m in the first
10 days of May.
Sales of light trucks also rose sharply, to an annual rate of 4.9m against
3.7m at the start of the month.
Car sales are seen as a key barometer of public confidence. The failure of
sales to revive earlier in the year was one of the main reasons for fears of
an unusually weak recovery.
The increase in consumer confidence was also larger than expected. However,
the index remains well short of the 100 plus level normal in a healthy
recovery.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the board, said the improved figures left 'little
doubt that the economy is at long last recovering'. The Federal Reserve
reached the same conclusion last week when it decided against further
interest rate cuts. For the first time since August the Fed reportedly
shifted to a neutral monetary stance, abandoning its bias towards lower
short-term rates.
More than a quarter of respondents to the Conference Board survey said they
expected improved business conditions over the next six months, against less
than 10 per cent expecting worse conditions.
