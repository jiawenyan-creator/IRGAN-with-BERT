  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Tuesday urged his select cabinet ministers to take the 
initiative in coming up with tough deregulation measures by the 
end of June, Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. 
  Hata, in seeking their cooperation at a top-level meeting, 
called the task of carving out effective measures for 
deregulation the mission of his cabinet, the top government 
spokesman told reporters. 
  The gathering comes at a time when the government is 
struggling to flesh out a package of market-opening measures 
unveiled in March in a bid to break the impasse in stalled trade 
talks with the United States by June, he said. 
  The relaxation of economically restrictive government 
regulations forms the core of the fresh substantial 
market-opening package aimed at stimulating the sluggish 
Japanese economy and its appetite for imports. 
  Tuesday's meeting followed a similar session held Friday 
where Hata and five key cabinet ministers agreed on the need to 
come up with powerful deregulatory steps by the end of June. 
  "We have only 50 more days," Kumagai said, in reference to 
the deadline for the formulation of the additional mart-opening 
package. "The pace of our efforts will be quickened 
significantly." 
  On top of key cabinet ministers, the meeting brought 
together 
heads of ministers and agencies holding control over a number of 
regulations. 
  Among participants were Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Koshiro Ishida, Chief of the 
Management and Coordination Agency and Yoshio Terasawa, head of 
the Economic Planning Agency. 
  Other participants included the heads of the health and 
welfare, farm, transport, posts, construction and home affairs 
ministries as well as the chief of the National Land Agency.
