FT  02 NOV 94 / Labour steps up its attack on government's tax policies
Labour marked yesterday's introduction of the new departure levy on air
travellers by stepping up its attack on the government's tax policies, David
Owen writes.
Mr Gordon Brown (above), shadow chancellor, urged the government to drop
plans to increase the rate of value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per
cent to 17.5 per cent. He said the government could avoid the planned rise
entirely if it 'had the will'. A typical family faced further annual tax
increases of more than Pounds 360, equivalent to Pounds 7 a week, at a time
when mortgages were 'also going up'.
Government figures showed that between July and September British families
experienced the sharpest decline in living standards for 13 years, Mr Brown
said. 'No wonder the feel-good factor is proving so elusive. It is not a
feel-good factor but a feel-betrayed factor and a feel-angry factor.'
Mr Andrew Smith, shadow chief Treasury secretary, said tax increases were
coming at the same time as ministers were looking to make cuts in public
expenditure.
'There is a way to cut public expenditure. It is to get people back to
work,' he said.
The air passenger duty, set out in last year's Budget, adds Pounds 5 to the
cost of domestic and European flights and Pounds 10 to other flights.
