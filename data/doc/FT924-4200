FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: TV-am starts asset repayment with 40p
TV-am, which has lost its breakfast-time licence, is to start repaying
assets to shareholders through a substantial dividend.
On December 29 it will pay a second interim of 40p per share, at a cost of
Pounds 26.7m, excluding associated ACT of Pounds 8.9m, from distributable
reserves.
Results for 1992 should be announced in February and the directors intend to
recommend a final dividend. No ultimate decision will be taken on the future
of TV-am, in its much reduced form, until then, and possibly not for some
time thereafter.
Assuming no further investment opportunities have arisen, the directors
expect to recommend a liquidation or distribution of the assets.
The Stock Exchange will suspend the USM quote unless the company identifies
a new core business to shareholders by the end of the year. However, the
company will seek cancellation of the listing on January 4 so that dealings
can take place under Rule 535(2).
