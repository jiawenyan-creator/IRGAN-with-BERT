FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Burmine's bid for Europa extended
Following consultations with the Takeover Panel, Burmine's offer for Europa
Minerals will be extended by 21 days.
The last day, therefore, on which Europa may announce 'significant new
information' is March 29.
The extension is designed is to provide additional time for the legal and
regulatory appeals of Mount Edon in Australia to be clarified. Until the
litigation between Mount Edon and Burmine is resolved, Burmine cannot
declare its offers for Europa and Austmin unconditional.
