  [Text] Tashkent 6 June TASS -- Uzbek President Islam 
Karimov and South Korean President Kim Young-sam stated the 
similarity of their positions on international and regional 
issues at their joint news conference in Tashkent on Monday. 
  "As a result of the negotiations we have received mutual 
dividends," Karimov said, stressing the importance of the 
growing mutually advantageous ties between Uzbekistan and South 
Korea. 
  There are about 20 joint ventures in Uzbekistan which have 
established firm positions in the Uzbek market. "We want the 
conditions established for foreign investors to be first of all 
used by South Korea," he added. 
  Kim Young-sam stressed that both countries have a huge 
economic potential and pointed out that Uzbekistan is carrying 
out a realistic programme of reform which can be used in other 
central Asian republics. The South Korean leader pledged 
overall support for Uzbek reform. 
  Kim Young-sam and Karimov have already signed four 
agreements 
on cooperation in the field of culture, free movement of the 
citizens of the two republics, air transportation and 
cooperation between the Uzbek and South Korean foreign 
ministries. 
  Later today the South Korean president accompanied by the 
key 
ministers and representatives of business circles will fly to 
Vladivostok.
