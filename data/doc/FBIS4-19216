Asylum in United States"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 12 -- Twenty-five Italian 
activists in the group Boycott Berlusconi asked for political 
asylum in the United States and said, "Italy is already started 
towards non-democratic forms of government" following the 
general election victory March 27 of the Freedom Front led by 
Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon who turned full-time 
politician in January. 
  The request for asylum was advanced by the Boycott 
Berlusconi 
(Bo.Bi) members in a letter to U.S. Ambassador Reginald 
Bartolomew and made public here by the Verona-based 
organization. The U.S. Embassy in Rome had no comment on the 
letter. 
  According to the 25 signers, the electoral campaign which 
led 
to the win of Berlusconi's Freedom Front, a coalition of the 
businessman's Forza Italia, the federalist Northern League, the 
neo-fascist National Alliance and smaller groupings, "violated 
every rule set by the Parliament." 
  In this connection, Berlusconi was named as "the owner of 
three television networks, various publishing companies (and) an 
enormous network of other economic activities in a monopoly 
regime" who "did not heed the directives of the publishing 
guarantor." 
  The Boycott Berlusconi activists also said they were asking 
U.S. President Bill Clinton to turn to international 
organizations to check up on "democratic violations committed in 
our country" because "an electoral campaign of this type could 
not have taken place in a democratic country." 
  Berlusconi is expected to be tapped by the head of state to 
form the first government of the twelfth legislature.
