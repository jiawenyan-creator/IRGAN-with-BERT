SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On May 28, 1992, the Department determined that U.S. imports of Canadian softwood lumber products are subsidized
(57 FR 22570). The Commerce decision was appealed under Chapter 19 of the FTA. The Panel issued an adverse decision
on May 6, 1993, finding that the Department had not demonstrated that countervailable subsidies existed, and remanded
the case to the Department for further deliberations. The Department completed a redetermination and on December
17, 1993, the Panel issued a second adverse decision, finding that the Department still had not supported its determination
that countervailable subsidies existed. It ordered a second remand, requiring the Department to find that there
were no subsidies. The Department complied with this order, and filed its second redetermination, on January 6, 1994.
The Panel affirmed this redetermination on February 23, 1994 and issued a Notice of Final Panel Action on March 7, 1994.
USTR has until April 6, 1994 to file a request for an ECC review. 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with the 

Timken 

decision, the Department must publish notice of a decision of the Panel which is not ``in harmony'' with the Department's
final determination. The Panel's March 7, 1994 decision constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's
affirmative subsidy determination. Accordingly, the Department is publishing this notice. The 

Timken 

decision also held that the Department must suspend liquidation pending a ``conclusive'' court decision in the action.
Therefore, the Department will continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject merchandise until the ECC issues
a conclusive decision in this action. The Department will implement the decision of the ECC.
