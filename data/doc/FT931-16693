FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Toyota's Pakistan trials near
PAKISTAN'S first Toyota car assembly plant begins trial production in
February and commercial production in May.
The plant is being set up by Indus Motor, a joint venture between Toyota and
Karachi-based Habib Group, at a cost of Rs2bn (Dollars 78.3m) and will have
a capacity to produce 20,000 vehicles annually.
Initially, it will build the 1.3-litre Corolla car - Toyota's best-selling
model in Pakistan - with output set according to demand. Import figures give
an indication of what demand might be: for 1992, the government estimates
about 3,000 cars of all makes with 1.3-litre engines were imported, as well
as 10,000 used cars, of which almost 90 per cent were older Corolla models.
Mr Farhad Zulfikar, Indus Motors' chief executive, said the car's selling
price had not been set, but added: 'It should be much lower than any
imported car in its range.'
Indus Motors has lobbied the government to discourage the import of used
cars and allow tax incentives to Pakistanis living abroad to buy vehicles
produced in the country.
The Toyota plant will be the second Japanese car factory in Pakistan after
that of Suzuki, which assembles the country's most popular 800cc cars and
small pick-up trucks.
Additionally, Honda and Nissan are finalising plans to set up similar
ventures with Pakistani companies and Daewoo of Korea is examining the
feasibility of setting up a plant.
The foreign carmakers hope to take advantage of Pakistan's growing consumer
market and export to Afganistan and the newly-independent central Asian
Islamic countries.
