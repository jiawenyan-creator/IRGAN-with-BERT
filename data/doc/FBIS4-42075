Coalition"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 29 May -- The Christian Democratic Union 
and the Free Democratic Party have described Social Democratic 
Party [SPD] Business Manager Verheugen's latest remarks about a 
ruling coalition between the SPD and the Greens after the 
Bundestag elections as enlightening. In DER SPIEGEL, Vorheugen 
had attacked the Bonn coalition parties and extolled the Greens: 
"We cannot wage the election struggle claiming it is time for a 
change, and then include in the government the very people whose 
policies we want to change. That would make us lose our 
credibility." A red-green coalition no longer appears 
frightening, he said. One cannot expect the present FDP 
leadership and FDP Bundestag group to support reforms. The SPD 
can certainly push through an ecological change easier with the 
Greens, but then the Greens would have to abandon their 
unrealistic positions. The SPD is working toward an election 
result that will provide it with options for the building for a 
coalition, said Verheugen. [passage omitted]
