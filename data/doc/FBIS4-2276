  [Text] Xining, April 7 (XINHUA) -- China is to update the 
40-year-old Qinghai-Xinjiang highway this year. 
  Built in 1954, the 2,728-kilometer highway starts from 
Xining 
City, capital of Qinghai Province, and runs to Shache [as 
received] in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  The renewal will be jointly undertaken by the departments of 
communication and transportation in Qinghai and Xinjiang. 
  Lu Junhan, a project engineer, said that it would improve 
the 
transportation conditions between Qinghai and Xinjiang and 
contribute to the opening up of the resources of minerals, oil 
and asbestos in the Qaidam Basin. 
  According the plan for the project approved by the Ministry 
of Communications, in the second half of this year, Qinghai will 
first reconstruct the highway from Ulan County to Delingha in 
the Mongolian-Tibetan autonomous prefecture of Haixi. 
  The total investment in this 177 kilometer highway section 
is 
about 150 million yuan and the project is expected to be 
completed in 1997.
