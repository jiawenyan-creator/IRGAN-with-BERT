Radion Gataullin broke his world indoor pole-vault record Saturday, clearing 19 
feet 9 inches at the Soviet Union's Winter Championships at Gomel, the news

Gataullin, a silver medalist in the 1988 Olympics, broke the record of 19-8 1/4 
he set Jan. 22 at Leningrad. 
Gataullin, a student from Tashkent in Uzbekistan who will compete in the 
Times/Eagle Indoor Games Feb. 17 at the Forum, is threatening countryman Sergei 
Bubka's reign as the world's No. 1 vaulter.

indoor record of 19-7 before this season. He holds the outdoor record at 19-10
