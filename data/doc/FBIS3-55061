  [Text] Chisinau January 5 TASS -- Leader of the Centrist 
Popular Union Andrey Safonov has filed his resignation from the 
post of the head of the "OLVIYA-PRES" news agency. 
  Local observers note his resignation is linked with 
strengthening of leftist-radical forces in the leadership of the 
Dniester Republic, Moldova's breakaway province. The radicals 
support Tiraspol's tough position at talks on settlement of the 
Dniester-Chisinau conflict. They also oppose economic and 
social reforms in the region.
