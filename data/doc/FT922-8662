FT  12 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Speculative issues
feature as Nikkei continues to rise
THE Nikkei average continued its upward trend yesterday, and active buying
of speculative issues by dealers was noted, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 232.14 ahead at 18,608.09 after opening at the session's
low of 18,407.87 and reaching the day's high of 18,666.70 later in the
morning.
Volume contracted from 450m shares to 380m, while advances outnumbered
declines by 855 to 166, with 118 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks added 13.83 at 1,388.21, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.23 to 1,111.89.
Arbitrage-related trading and short-term buying of speculative 'theme'
stocks by dealers led the activity. Institutional investors remained on the
sidelines, while some life insurers were seen taking profits in small lots.
Traders said some investors were buying stocks with favourable earnings
prospects for the current fiscal year to March 1993, ahead of the corporate
earnings season which is due to start in the next few weeks.
Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said: 'Trading interest will shift
from speculative issues to companies' official forecasts (for the current
year) which will be announced with last year's results.'
A total of 25 issues attained new highs for the year. Okamoto, the condom
maker, and the most active issue of the day, moved up Y10 to Y1,390 on the
'bio-technology theme'. Morinaga Milk appreciated Y7 to Y847 and Meiji Milk
Products jumped Y54 to Y944.
Brokerages gained ground as investors were encouraged by the recent increase
in market volume. Nomura Securities moved ahead Y40 to Y1,440 and Daiwa
Securities put on Y19 to Y859.
High-technology stocks, which advanced last week on bargain hunting, were
mixed, as some institutional investors were seen taking profits. Those to
weaken included Hitachi, which ended Y16 down at Y854, and Matsushita, Y30
cheaper at Y1,400.
Sekisui Chemical dropped Y179 to Y921 on reports that it had suffered
unrealised losses of Y60bn due to stock investments by one of its
subsidiaries.
In Osaka, broad-based buying by foreigners and investment trusts pushed the
OSE average up 320.04 to 21,213.74 in volume of 26.1m shares. Shimano, the
bicycle parts manufacturer, climbed Y130 to Y1,660 on short-term buying. Ono
Pharmaceutical receded Y30 to Y6,350 on profit-taking.
