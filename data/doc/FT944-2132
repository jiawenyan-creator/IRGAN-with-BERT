FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: Inmarsat wins satellite funding
Inmarsat, the London-based satellite communications organisation, has
promises of more than Dollars 1bn from its members to finance a global
mobile phone satellite service.
The figure exceeded its expectations, and follows a decision last week by
the organisation's ruling assembly to approve the project.
Members from more than 40 countries have agreed to the investment. They
include many of the world's leading telecommunications operators. An
investors meeting will be held in January to formalise the project.
The system, based on intermediate orbit satellite technology, is expected to
cost Dollars 2.6bn in total. It will provide a worldwide service for digital
telephone, fax data and paging. It is expected to go live in 1999.
Inmarsat pioneered maritime voice and data in the 1980s, but faces
competition from a number of other consortia in the provision of the new
service. The principal competition seems to be Iridium, led by Motorola of
the US, which has also completed its equity funding.
Brussels yesterday formally approved the creation of a new satellite
telecommunications company, arguing it would promote competition in the
lucrative market for transatlantic business telecoms services.
International Private Satellite Partners (IPSP) comprises a group of nine
companies including Orion Satellite Corporation of the US, Com Dev Satellite
Communications of Canada, Kingston Communications International of the UK
and Stet of Italy.
IPSP will own and operate two high-power satellites which will be placed in
geosynchronous orbit over the Atlantic Ocean. The first was launched last
November and is expected to be operational by the end of the year.
The EC said that IPSP would be competition for the strategic alliances being
forged between existing carriers - often public telephone operators - and
international satellite organisation such as Intelsat.
