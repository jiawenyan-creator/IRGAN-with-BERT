U.S. DRUG FIGHT IN SOUTH AMERICA 
As the so-called "drug war" heats up, I fear that our government will turn to 
increasingly barbaric and simplistic strategies, including increased 
incarceration of drug users, heavy-handed domestic police tactics, vilification 
of drug addicts, and state-sponsored preemptive military strikes against 
suspected drug suppliers. Sen. Joseph Lieberman's (D-Conn.) advocacy for 
allowing the President of the United States to order the murder of what he 
calls "narco-terrorists" (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 18) as a way to "signal the 
seriousness with which we view their acts" represents the first dangerous step 
down this misguided path. 
State-sanctioned terrorism, which is exactly what Lieberman is advocating, is a 
foreign policy employed by desperate nations which lack the sophistication, 
financial resources and commitment to democratic ideals required to formulate 
truly workable solutions to complex problems. Until our nation commits whatever 
resources are required to find nonviolent, non-punitive solutions to the 
underlying social problems of poverty, domestic violence, illiteracy, racism, 
mental illness, and hopelessness which plague large segments of American 
society, the drug problem will remain with us. 
Sending government hit men to foreign lands telegraphs a message to the world 
that others are responsible for the problems in American society which have 
created our current drug problem. Before we start throwing stones into other 
people's yards, we ought to find some enlightened ways to clean up our own 
internal mess. Creating a society where participation in America's opportunity 
system is perceived by all citizens as obtainable and more desirable than a 
life of drug-dealing and drug use should be this nation's priority.
