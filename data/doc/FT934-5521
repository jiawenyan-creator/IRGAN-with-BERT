FT  30 NOV 93 / Superstate 'nightmare' disturbs Hurd
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday criticised what he
called the 'nightmare' scenario of a European superstate, and declared he
was confident that the 'centralising tendency' in Europe was at an end,
writes Gillian Tett.
Speaking in Bologna, he insisted that the principle of subsidiarity should
now be the touchstone for the European Union. 'Subsidiarity is not only
about rolling back the frontiers of the Community, where these have advanced
beyond common sense; it also means moving forward with a lightness of
touch,' he said.
