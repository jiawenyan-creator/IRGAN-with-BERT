  [Text] The regime of tyrant Saddam Husayn has strengthened 
its relations with the Serbian regime in former Yugoslavia. At 
the invitation of 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, the Iraqi regime's 
defense minister, a team of Serbian military experts recently 
arrived in Baghdad to exchange information and discuss the 
results of air raids against Iraq during the Gulf war. A 
Bosnian military source said the military and political 
similarity between the two regimes pushed them toward 
rapprochement and coordination.
