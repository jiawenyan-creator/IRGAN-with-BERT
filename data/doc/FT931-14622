FT  16 JAN 93 / Insurance call sparks angry reply
CALLS by loss adjusters for insurance companies to strengthen claims
investigation procedures have produced an angry response from a leading loss
assessor.
Mr Nicholas Balcombe, chief executive of Balcombe Group, said yesterday that
insurance companies had been doing 'everything to minimise payouts' in
recent years.
Loss assessors generally represent policyholders, while adjusters negotiate
claims on behalf of insurance companies.
Mr Balcombe said insurance companies had 'dramatically slowed up the whole
claims process' by their increasing use of specialist advisers and
investigators.
The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters suggested on Thursday following a
survey of its members that a quarter of insurance claims were fraudulently
inflated.
