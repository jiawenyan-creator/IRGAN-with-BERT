CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
14 AT HOME; 
SAY IT WITH A BALLOON 
PLANNING TO PROPOSE to your sweetheart but don't know how to do it? A 15-foot 
red heart stationed outside her home is sure to score a yes. And when the big 
day of the nuptials finally arrives, Adams Balloon Advertising can drape a 
banner over a giant inflatable, replete with personal message and internal 
lighting. 
In this city of air kisses and overblown egos, there is now a way to send 
appropriately grandiose holiday and personal messages: with a custom inflated 
balloon that lights up with your special salutation. Adams will set up a 
33x30-foot birthday cake inflatable (for $450) on your father's front lawn 
decorated with a personal message (24x20-foot is $350, 11x9-foot is $150). Or, 
depending on your relationship and the intended greeting, maybe a 22-foot-high 
gorilla ($350) -- or a 25-foot-high clown ($350; 18 feet, $250) -- would best 
do the trick. And when Halloween rolls around this fall, there are giant 
jack-o'-lanterns and friendly ghosts, and for Christmas, robust Santas and 
snowmen and such. Joan draper Adams Balloon Advertising, 701 Redlen Ave., 
Whittier; (818) 968-4243.
