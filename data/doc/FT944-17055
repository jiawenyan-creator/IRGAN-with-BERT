FT  11 OCT 94 / Far-right gains in Belgium
The extreme right made further inroads into the Belgian political scene over
the weekend, with voters in Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels region
giving their support to anti-immigration parties in Sunday's communal
elections. In Antwerp, the principal city of Belgium's Dutch-speaking
Flanders region, the racist Flemish Nationalist party, Vlaams Blok, won 28
per cent of the vote, making it the city's leading political party. The
National Front, the francophone extreme right, gained a foothold in the 19
communes of the country's capital Brussels, while in Wallonia, the
French-speaking region, the big cities saw similar advances by the far
right. In Liege they won four seats.
The communal elections, held every six years, focus mainly on local issues
and will have little immediate impact on the fortunes of the federal
governing coalition, led by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister.
Meanwhile King Albert last night named Mr Frank Vandenbroucke, president of
the Flemish Socialist party, as foreign minister and deputy prime minister
in succession to Mr Willy Claes, who is to become Nato secretary-general. Mr
Johan Vande Lanotte, a Socialist MP, replaces interior minister Louis
Tobback, who was elected mayor of Leuven on Sunday.
