I watched with growing dismay the CBS movie debut of "E.A.R.T.H. Force" (not 
presently on CBS' schedule). 
Plutonium bandits? Assault rifles? Paramilitary operations? The producers of 
this farce are clueless to the meaning and practice of "environmentalism." 
If the hours of Environmental Impact Statement reading, public hearings and 
conferences supportive to a legitimate program of "Ecodefense" are insufficient 
to enrapture television viewers nationwide, so be it. Should the program 
survive I propose a name change to "G.R.E.E.N. Scam" -- a term applied to the 
prostitution of "environmentalism" for personal or political gain.
