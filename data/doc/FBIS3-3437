  [Text] William Perry, U.S. Secretary of Defense, having 
concluded his visit to Almaty, flew to visit the former Soviet 
Union's space center at Baykonur. Recently, Kazakhstan 
announced its intention to develop Baykonur jointly with 
Ukraine, thereby, exerting pressure on the Russian side. 
Moscow, in turn, announced its intention to build another major 
space center in the Far East region. The fact the Kazakh side 
organized Perry's visit to Baykonur was seen by ITAR-TASS as 
just another attempt by Kazakhstan to exert pressure on Russia.
