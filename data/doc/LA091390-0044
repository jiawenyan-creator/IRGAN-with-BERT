2 LOYOLA BASEBALL PLAYERS HURT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
Baseball players Tim Williams and Darren Sugiyama of Loyola Marymount were 
injured Saturday night in a drive-by shooting incident. The two, along with 
teammate Todd Gates, were driving west on Manchester Avenue from the 
Westchester campus toward Williams' apartment in Playa del Rey shortly before 
midnight. 
Williams said a car began tailgating them, and when Sugiyama changed lanes to 
let the car pass, it pulled alongside the passenger side and a shotgun blast 
was fired into a side window. 
None of the players were hit by the pellets. Williams, a senior all-conference 
outfielder and one of the team's top pro prospects, was in the back seat and 
was struck by glass from an exploding window. He suffered serious injury to his 
right eye and needed emergency surgery to remove shattered glass. The right 
lens of his eye also was removed, but can be replaced as an implant after some 
healing. 
Sugiyama, a sophomore infielder from Long Beach, suffered cuts around the neck. 
Gates, a sophomore outfielder from Framingham, Mass., was not injured and was 
able to get to a phone and call for help quickly. The players were taken to 
nearby Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, where Williams had surgery at 3:30 a.m. 
The shooting is being investigated by police, but there are few leads. Williams 
described the assailants as three white males and a white female in a blue 
Blazer or Bronco. 
Williams, an Inglewood resident who was a CIF player of the year at Playa del 
Rey St. Bernard High School, was released from the hospital Tuesday. A CAT scan 
revealed no glass remaining after surgery. He said he hopes to return to 
classes next week, but he will probably miss fall baseball practice. 
"Things are blurry but clearing up," Williams said Wednesday.
