  [Text] Hong Kong, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Newly-elected Hong 
Kong affairs advisors at regional levels have pledged to serve 
as a bridge between the Chinese Government and Hong Kong 
residents during the latter half of the transitional period. 
  At a meeting organized by the local branch of the XINHUA 
NEWS 
AGENCY on Thursday [17 March], they shared the views that work 
in many aspects of the preparation for the transfer of power in 
1997 would become more difficult because of lacking a "through 
train" arrangement for the 1994-95 election to be held in Hong 
Kong. 
  Many of them suggested that publicity of the Basic Law, 
known 
as the mini-constitution for the future government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, should be put on the top of 
the agenda and be introduced into school textbook. 
  Kan Chi-ho, an advisor from the Wong Tai Sin District, said 
since work in the latter half of transitional period would not 
be as easy as many local people expected, the preliminary 
committee for the Preparatory Work Committee should speed up 
work in all fields. 
  Another advisor, Ng Siu-cheung, said he would collect 
opinions from grass roots on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements 
for the Legislative Council, two urban councils and district 
boards in a bid to close contacts between the Chinese side and 
local residents.
