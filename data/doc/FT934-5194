FT  01 DEC 93 / BR to sell six repair centres
British Rail yesterday put up for sale its six heavy-maintenance workshops,
which employ 3,500 people throughout the country to perform big repairs to
rolling stock.
The workshops, as well as two small electronic service centres, made an
operating surplus of about Pounds 5m on turnover of Pounds 186m in the year
ended last March. Bids are expected from management buy-out teams and large
rolling stock manufacturers such as GEC Alsthom and ABB Transportation.
The workshops, which carry out engine maintenance, collision repairs and
painting contracts, are being sold off as part of the privatisation of BR.
Light repair workshops will be sold to the private train operators which
acquire the rights to run services on the rail network, but it was thought
unlikely that they would be interested in owning the heavy maintenance
activities.
Details of the sale appeared in press advertisements yesterday inviting
organisations interested in acquiring the operations to contact Lazard
Brothers, the merchant bank.
Once BR gauges the strength of the response it will decide details of the
sale and issue formal invitations to bid next March or April. Mr Bill Tyler,
communications director in BR's vendor unit, said it was likely the business
would be split up among more than one bidder. He thought it unlikely there
would be closures in the works network because it was uneconomic to move
rolling stock requiring significant maintenance long distances.
The plants to be sold are at Doncaster, Eastleigh near Southampton,
Springburn in Glasgow, Wolverton near Milton Keynes, Ilford in east London,
and Chart Leacon, near Ashford in Kent. The electronic service centres are
at Swindon and Eastleigh.
The first four heavy maintenance workshops are part of British Rail
Maintenance. The last two are known as Level 5 depots and are part of
British Rail.
