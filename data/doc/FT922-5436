FT  30 MAY 92 / Belling calls in receivers
BELLING and Company, the UK electric cooker manufacturer whose table-top
Baby Belling has been a mainstay of British bed-sitters for generations, has
gone into receivership.
Mr Paul Jeffery, one of the receivers appointed yesterday from KPMG Peat
Marwick, said: 'The company has been suffering from the effect of a
depressed market.'
The receivers were called in after negotiations with potential buyers fell
through.
The company appears to be another victim of the recession, which last year
forced one of its main competitors, Electrolux, to close a factory in
Birmingham with the loss of 550 jobs.
Belling has been incurring losses for more than three years, and its
indebtedness now stands at about Pounds 25m.
The future of 950 staff at the main site in Enfield, north London, and 300
in Burnley, Lancashire, was unclear last night. 'It is early days, and there
have been no redundancies to date,' Mr Jeffery said.
'We are reviewing the position. My immediate priority is to sell the
business. It is a very well-known brand name and we are anticipating keen
interest in the company. We are seeking buyers for it both in this country
and internationally,' he said.
Belling has made cookers for more than 60 years, and became a household name
with the Baby Belling, a table-top oven with two electric rings. It now
makes a range of cookers, and is one of three UK market leaders in
free-standing appliances.
In 1990 Belling undertook a big redesign and marketing programme, just
before being hit by the recession and a drop in sales of white goods.
Domestic demand for new cookers has dropped by about 30 per cent over the
past three years.
