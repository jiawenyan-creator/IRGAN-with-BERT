  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Labor Minister Chikara 
Sakaguchi said Tuesday [11 January] that he was unhappy about 
the action of a major machine tool company in lowering its 
mandatory retirement age from 60 to 56. 
  Sakaguchi said the move by Okuma Corp. runs counter to the 
law governing employment of senior workers that requires 
employers to make efforts to set the retirement age at 60. 
  "We as the labor ministry will give instructions," Sakaguchi 
told reporters at a press conference. 
  Okuma on Monday said it had lowered its retirement age for 
employees to 56 in a move designed to cut labor costs. 
  "It might not stand to reason to interfere with an agreement 
between labor and management but this is a problem with social 
implications," Sakaguchi said. 
  Many Japanese companies are trying to weather the recession 
by trimming labor costs by means of asking employees to retire 
voluntarily but Okuma is the first to slash the retirement age.
