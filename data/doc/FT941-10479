FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Betacom falls to Pounds 103,000
Betacom, the telephone equipment supplier 66 per cent owned by Amstrad,
reported higher interim operating profits, although the rise was constrained
by supply difficulties with its new product range.
The group reported operating profits of Pounds 43,000 in the six months to
December 31 compared with an Pounds 8,000 loss on turnover from continuing
operations which expanded to Pounds 6.91m (Pounds 6.67m).
However, interim pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 103,000, against Pounds
350,000 a year ago when the outcome was boosted by a Pounds 213,000 profit
on the sale of fixed investments.
Earnings per share fell to 0.15p (0.46p).
