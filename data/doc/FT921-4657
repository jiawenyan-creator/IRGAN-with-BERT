LINCOLN HOUSE, the home furnishing group, yesterday reported that pre-tax
losses fell from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 286,000 in the year to December 31.
The company, which in 1990 was hit by the fall into receivership of Lowndes
Queensway, the home furnishing retailer, said turnover had dropped from
Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 10.3m.
Despite the deepening recession, rationalisation had produced a small
operating profit of Pounds 46,000, compared with an loss of Pounds 1.24m.
Interest payable had fallen from Pounds 479,000 to to Pounds 332,000.
The company said this improvement reflected its shift away from unprofitable
national account business, such as Lowndes Queensway, and the continuation
of tight managerial controls. However, the significant repositioning of the
business which had taken place continued to be hindered the the recession.
There was a loss per share of 1.77p, compared with a loss of 14.59p, and the
company again passed its dividend.
Mr David Harland, chairman, said prospects were much improved from the
traumatic period of 1990 and he believed a reasonable level of profitability
would be achieved when UK and European trading regained momentum.
Lincoln House (Furnishings), the company's largest subsidiary, which
manufactures upholstered furniture, made an operating loss of Pounds 40,000
on sales of Pounds 7.68m. This compared with losses of Pounds 1.32m on sales
of Pounds 12.54m.
Mayers &amp; Shaw, the occasional table subsidiary, made an operating profit of
Pounds 117,000 (Pounds 159,000) on sales of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.79m).
The company said Impala Displays, its display equipment subsidiary, had a
poor year, producing an operating loss of Pounds 31,000 on sales of Pounds
1.19m. In order to save management time and resources for the group's
furniture subsidiaries, Impala was last month sold to its management team.
