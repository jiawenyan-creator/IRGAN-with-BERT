FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Charles Baynes' Pounds 10m purchase as
profits rise
CHARLES Baynes, the specialist engineering and packaging distribution
company, yesterday announced two acquisitions totalling nearly Pounds 10m
and a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.47m to Pounds 5.56m.
The directors said that a one third drop in operating profits under new
accounting rules was a better guide to performance in 1992 than pre-tax
profits up by a quarter.
The group has adopted FRS 3 and has restated its 1991 figures accordingly.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 4.13m (Pounds 6.05m).
It will pay a final dividend of 0.9p (0.85p) bringing the total to 1.43p
(1.35p) out of earnings per share of 2.8p (3.91p).
The company bought Thomson Valves, from Rolls-Royce, for Pounds 7.9m and
Industrial Precision Castings, from Cookson Group, for Pounds 1.9m.
The acquisitions were partly funded by a 12.5m share placing with
institutions, which raised Pounds 6.8m net of expenses. The number of shares
in issue increased by 10 per cent.
