FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (2): The next issue - do you have
a tale to tell?
This review is concerned with the experiences of users, in particular how
and why they choose software and use it to benefit their businesses.
If you are a user with a tale to tell in either of the main application
areas in the autumn issue - human resources and market research databases -
we would be delighted to hear from you.
Software suppliers wishing to contribute information should note that
pre-warned user contacts are a prerequisite and that both user information
and supplier details must be submitted in a particular format. Full details
about the topics in September issue are given on this page, in the
announcement below.
Suppliers interested in contributing should contact the Financial Times
Surveys Department - in writing only, please - saying which topic is of
interest. You will then be sent the relevant forms.
User contacts and information are needed by Monday, July 13 at the latest.
