REGIONAL EARNINGS: TRIO-TECH REPORTS LOSS FOR 1ST QUARTER 
Trio-Tech, a San Fernando company that makes semiconductor testing equipment, 
said it lost $81,000 in its first quarter, which ended Sept. 28, compared with 
$211,000 a year ago. 
Trio-Tech's sales fell 16% to $3.73 million for the period from $4.42 million 
last year. Christopher J. Ebert, chairman of the company, attributed the loss 
to lower-than-expected shipments and higher-than-expected costs at its 
operation in Sunnyvale, Calif. The company said its bank had agreed to extend 
its credit facility and put off loan payments on the debt until January, 1991.
