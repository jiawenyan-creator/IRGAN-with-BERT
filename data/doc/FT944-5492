FT  03 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Perhaps 'splendide isolement' should
be the fate of the UK
Sir, Having read what Patrick Nicholls, a Tory MP and former vice-president
of the Conservative party, thinks of France and the French, it is, I must
say, more and more difficult for a Frenchman to be an anglophile ('Outspoken
Tory resigns party post', November 25).
After all, perhaps the Europeans from the continent should leave Britain in
her splendide isolement.
Just as Talleyrand once said, 'what is excessive is without meaning'. Let us
hope that this view is shared by a majority in Britain.
