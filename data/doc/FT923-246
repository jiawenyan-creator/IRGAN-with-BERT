FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT to administer sales of US
pollution permits
THE CHICAGO Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, has been
designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as the administrator of
its annual sales and auctions of pollution permits or allowances.
The allowances, for sulphur dioxide emissions by electric utility plants,
are to be issued, starting next year, as part of the EPA's acid rain control
programme. The agency aims to halve the level of sulphur dioxide emissions
by the end of the decade.
The CBoT, aiming to be the world's first environmental exchange, petitioned
the EPA for the designation as sales and auction administrator because it
will trade futures in the pollution allowances. The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the US futures industry regulator, has already approved
the CBoT for trading futures and futures-options on the allowances.
The CBoT hopes that this innovative futures contract will begin a whole new
era in the futures industry. Mr Richard Sandor, a CBoT board member and
designer of the contract, said: 'When we've shown how it can be done
successfully in the US, I think the world will follow'.
