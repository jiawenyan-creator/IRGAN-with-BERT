FT  26 APR 94 / Killings by IRA overshadow talks
Northern Ireland's deteri-orating security situation overshadowed
yesterday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in Belfast.
British and Irish ministers condemned the IRA murders of two Protestants in
County Londonderry on Sunday night and said their action was in stark
contrast to those working for peace in the province.
Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who
attended the meeting, said he would continue to press for tougher police
powers - including removal of a terrorist suspect's right to silence - in
spite of speculation that his proposals will be rejected by government.
Sunday's murders were the first civilian killings by the IRA in the past six
months, and there has been a notable increase in loyalist terrorism.
At the meeting Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr
Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, considered a report from officials
on the prospects for political progress based on the framework envisaged by
the three-stranded approach on relationships which was abandoned in November
1992.
It is not expected that progress will be made before the European elections
in June.
Before the conference the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader,
handed in a letter of protest. He criticised Sir Patrick for continuing with
what he described as the destruction of Northern Ireland in cahoots with
Dublin before the IRA's murder victims had even been buried.
Last night, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, warned that the Ulster
peace initiative was 'in danger of going into crisis'.
