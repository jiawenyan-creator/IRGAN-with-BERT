FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach at 10% premium
SHARES OF Stagecoach, the bus and coach operator, closed on their first day
of trading at 124p, a 10 per cent premium on the offer price of 112p.
Mr Philip Stephens of UBS, the stockbrokers to the Perth-based company, said
that Stagecoach regarded the outcome as 'very satis-factory, suggesting that
we priced the issue right'.
Some 6m shares were sold in heavy trading. Nearly 12m shares had been sold
to the public and a further 22m placed with institutions.
Mr Stephens said that some small shareholders had been cashing in their
shares, with institutions buying and selling.
A stockbroker in Scotland, where interest in the issue was strong, said that
many people had been selling their shares because the allocations had been
so small. Most people received fewer than 250 shares in the public issue,
which was subscribed nearly eight times.
