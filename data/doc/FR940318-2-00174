supplementary information: 

The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for final assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings will
consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person as privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee Meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c) (4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.
