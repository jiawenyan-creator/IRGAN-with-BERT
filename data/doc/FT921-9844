FT  10 FEB 92 / British Gas to spin off 15% of Consumers
BRITISH GAS is to spin off to the public a 15 per cent stake in Consumers
Gas, the Canadian natural gas utility which it bought in September 1990.
The secondary offering, in the form of instalment receipts, is expected to
raise between CDollars 150m (Pounds 72m) and CDollars 200m. British Gas paid
CDollars 1.1bn for Consumers, Canada's biggest gas distributor.
The public offering is to comply with conditions by the Ontario government
at the time of the acquisition. British Gas undertook to float at least 15
per cent within two years, and to make available to the public at least half
any extra equity financing over the next 10 years.
The public stake in Consumers could thus rise to about 25 per cent by the
end of the decade.
British Gas is expected to keep the offering to the minimum required under
the 1990 agreement. It said none of the proceeds of the share offering would
be received by Consumers Gas.
A Consumers official said the offering would probably take place within the
next three to four weeks. It will be handled by a group of securities
dealers led by Nesbitt Thomson of Toronto.
Investors are likely to be attracted by forecasts of growing demand for
natural gas and the guaranteed rates of return to regulated gas utilities.
Consumers Gas operations are centred on the industrial region of southern
Ontario. The utility has 1.1m customers and earned CDollars 76m from
continuing operations last year on revenues of CDollars 1.69bn.
British Gas has made few changes at Consumers since the takeover beyond
encouraging an active exchange of research and know-how. British Gas also
has a 54 per cent interest in Bow Valley Industries, a Calgary-based oil and
gas producer.
