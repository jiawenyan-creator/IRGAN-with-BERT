  [Text] Indonesia has urged Britain and Norway not to 
increase oil production from the North Sea oil fields because 
this will result in a drop in oil prices. Indonesia has also 
called on OPEC Secretary General Subroto to contact officials of 
the two countries about the matter. Mining and Energy Minister 
I.B. Sujana told reporters after meeting President Suharto at 
the Bina Graha Presidential Office in Jakarta this morning that 
North Sea oil production has now reached 5 million barrels per 
day. 
  Faisal Abda'u, president director of the State Oil and Gas 
Company, who accompanied Minister I.B. Sujana during the meeting 
with the head of state, said the prices of Indonesian oil during 
the 1993-94 fiscal year averaged U.S. $16.42 per barrel. 
Indonesia produces about 1.3 million barrels of oil per day in 
accordance with the OPEC quota.
