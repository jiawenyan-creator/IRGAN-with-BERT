ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; 
MAN IS ACCUSED OF TRYING TO BURN WIFE 
A Garden Grove man, apparently upset because his wife did not want his mother 
to stay with them during her upcoming visit, was arrested on suspicion of 
trying to burn his wife to death, police said Monday. 
Police Sgt. Gary Walker said that Sang Seon Kim, 30, and Kyoung Hui Yang, 25, 
apparently had been arguing for some time Sunday when they started destroying 
each other's possessions. 
As the dispute grew, investigators said that Kim began collecting books and 
newspapers and piled them on the couple's bed. He dragged his wife into their 
bedroom, poured cooking oil all over the room and then set the bed on fire, 
Walker said, adding: 
"But she was somehow able to get away and make it past the door and outside the 
apartment." Police said she had not been bound. 
When police and firefighters arrived, Yang was crawling down the stairs, 
screaming that her husband was trying to kill her, Walker said. Minutes later, 
Kim came walking out of the smoky apartment and surrendered to police. 
Yang suffered minor cuts and bruises, Walker said. She was taken to Garden 
Grove Medical Center and later released. 
"It was just one of those disputes that got larger and larger," Walker said. 
"He was apparently very upset that his wife refused to let his mother stay with 
them while she visits from Korea." 
Neighbors at the apartment at 9722 Alwood Ave. notified police after hearing 
the couple fighting, Walker said. Police were immediately called again after 
the fire broke out. 
Walker said neighbors had expressed shock about the incident and indicated that 
the newlywed couple were always friendly and quiet. 
Garden Grove Fire Department Capt. Bill Dumasit said the fire caused extensive 
damage to the apartment but never threatened to spread. ERIK HAMILTON
