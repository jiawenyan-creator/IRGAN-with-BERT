FT  25 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Shell
Royal Dutch/Shell's annual figures confirm its happy knack for smoothing out
the inherent volatilities in the oil industry. With its methodical intent,
the group is also busy exploiting opportunities for future growth. Shell's
heritage has left it with a strong presence in promising far east markets.
Last year some 36 per cent of its Pounds 6.3bn capital expenditure and
exploration spending was targeted at the eastern hemisphere, promising to
give it a long-term competitive edge. Shell's Pounds 496m restructuring
charge shows its determination to cut costs and tackle its blighted European
chemicals business regardless of any upturn. High hopes are held out for new
products such as Carilon.
But like judo wrestlers, Shell's stock market detractors can use those very
strengths against it. Shell has been highly rated for increasing its
dividend throughout recession. But that has left it with an uncomfortably
high payout ratio in the absence of strong earnings gains. The 2 per cent
rise in the Royal Dutch dividend may be more indicative of the payout trend
than the currency-inflated 10 per cent rise at Shell Transport and Trading.
Such progress may pale in comparison with others, such as BP, which have cut
their dividend floor.
Shell's low financial gearing will also make its earnings rebound soggier
than those of more indebted rivals. Less adventurous competitors, boasting a
higher exposure to recovering European and US demand, could also win the
short-term applause.
