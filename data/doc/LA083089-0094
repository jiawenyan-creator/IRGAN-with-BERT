A car dealer from Hayward took out a newspaper advertisement apologizing for 
any displeasure he may have caused by hiring a stripper to entertain some 
policemen during a party he gave for them in his luxury box at the Oakland 
Coliseum before an April 26 Oakland Athletics game. The Coliseum and the team 
warned Dale Bridges that "any future actions in violation of the Skybox code of 
conduct will result in immediate termination of his Skybox contract."
