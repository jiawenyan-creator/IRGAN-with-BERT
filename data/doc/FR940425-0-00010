SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
History 


On October 22, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) by amending
the time of designation of Restricted Areas R6302C and R6302D at Fort Hood, TX (58 FR 54531). Interested
parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal
to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the
same as that proposed in the notice. Section 73.63 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in
FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. 


The Rule 


This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations reduces the time of designation for Restricted Areas
R6302C and R6302D, Fort Hood, TX. The FAA conducted a special use airspace review of the Fort Hood Army
Air Field in May 1993. During this review, it was determined that the published time of designation should be amended
to more accurately reflect current user requirements for the airspace. This action reduces the time of designation
of: 1. R6302C from ``2 hours in advance by NOTAM'' to ``07001900 local time, MondayFriday; other
times by NOTAM;'' and 2. R6302D from ``06002100 local time, daily; other times by NOTAM'' to ``07001900
local time, MondayFriday; other times by NOTAM.'' 
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.


Environmental Review 


This amendment reduces the time of designation of Restricted Areas R6302C and D. This amendment does not change
either the dimensions or activities currently conducted within the established areas. Accordingly, this action
is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures
for Considering Environmental Impacts.''
