rubric: "Newspaper Is Illegal But It Does Not Care"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Judicial Chamber for Information 
Disputes under the Russian president completed hearing the case 
of an illegal registration of the AL KODS, a Communist newspaper. 
  The court deemed that the Ministry of Press and Information 
violated Articles 7 and 13 of the law on the mass media in 
registering the publication. They say that foreign citizens who 
are not permanent residents on the territory of Russia cannot 
register their publications. 
  At the same time Shaabad Hafez, citizen of Jordan, has been 
publishing this newspaper for over two years. The Russian Press 
Committee has been ordered to annul the false "certificate of 
registration." 
  The newspaper does not despair nevertheless. An AL KODS fete 
is to take place at the Central Tourist House. Rutskoy, 
Khasbulatov, Umalatova, Terekhov, Baburin, Zyuganov, Nevzorov, 
Prokhanov, Chikin, and the friend of the Arabs, Zhirinovskiy, 
have been invited. It has even been promised that the 
ambassadors of Iran and Iraq will be on hand.
