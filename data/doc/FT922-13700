FT  10 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Multilinguals pick up the
telephone
BUSINESS today is increasingly conducted on a global scale, requiring
efficient communications in many languages. But while the telephone is often
the most convenient medium, few companies can provide multilingual operators
round the clock.
Syntellect, an Arizona-based company, has developed what it claims is the
first multilingual interactive voice response (IVR) system which recognises
and understands six different languages when a caller phones in. Once into
the system, the caller can then select 20 other languages with life-like
speech quality achieved through voice synthesis.
The Global-Series IVR, which is compatible with touch-tone and rotary dial
telephones, works with most computer systems and allows the caller to access
a target database either to input data or to retrieve information and
services. Syntellect: US, 602 789 2800; UK: 0628 487777.
