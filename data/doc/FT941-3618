FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian coal review agreed
Australia's coal-producers and mining unions yesterday agreed to a six-month
review of the nation's export coal industry in an attempt to identify the
main opportunities and impediments to its growth. Coal is Australia's
largest export category.
The study was announced by Mr David Beddall, the federal resources minister,
after a tripartite meeting between government, union and corporate
representatives, in Brisbane yesterday. The meeting had been called by Mr
Beddall after widespread outcry over the annual coking coal settlements
reached between producers and the Japanese steel mills earlier this year.
The contracts, which involved producers taking prices-cuts for the fourth
successive year, as well and reduced tonnages, and led to a six-day protest
strike by coal unions.
Yesterday, Mr Beddall admitted that there was 'a divergence of views on
necessary future action', but added that the industry had 'real prospects
for expansion, particularly in Asian markets'. He added that Japanese buyers
 -who take the lion's share of Australia's coal exports - would be welcome
to make submissions.
