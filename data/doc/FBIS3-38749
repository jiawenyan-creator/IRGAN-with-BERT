  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Hans-Juergen Wischnewski, 
politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and 
former minister of the chancellery, has come out in favor of 
bombing Serbian positions as a reaction to the grenade attack on 
Sarajevo. In the ZDF [Second German Television Channel] cast 
"1130 -- Eser and Guests," he said on Sunday [6 February]: "If 
there is no reaction to that, we can forget everything." 
  Wischnewski warned the West against further inaction. This 
promotes fundamentalism in the Arab states, said the chairman of 
the Middle East Committee of the Socialist International who is 
knowledgeable about the Arab states. The indecision, especially 
by the Western states, gives rise to the impression that the 
Christian world is leaving the Muslims "in the lurch."
