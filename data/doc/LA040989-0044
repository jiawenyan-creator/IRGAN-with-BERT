CITY LINES: BEYOND WESTWEEK 
Beyond the speeches, the symposiums, the awards, the networking and the 
socializing, Westweek is at heart a grand furniture and furnishings show. 
As such, it is a time for interior and industrial designers, architects and 
store owners to see, touch and feel the latest products of an expanding, 
style-conscious industry. 
Eventually, much of what was unveiled in the "to-the-trade-only" showrooms of 
the Pacfic Design Center in West Hollywood during Westweek will find itself 
into the more tony stores everywhere over the next year. 
With that in mind, the following is a sampling of some of the new products that 
were displayed at Westweek. SAM HALL KAPLAN
