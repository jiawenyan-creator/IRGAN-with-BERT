FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: News in Brief
SCOTLAND: An independent Scotland would not automatically qualify for
membership of the European Community, Mr John Major, the prime minister,
stressed in the Commons yesterday.
He told Mrs Margaret Ewing, parliamentary leader of the Scottish National
party, that 'in the unlikely event' of Scotland repudiating the 1707 Act of
Union it would have to re-apply for membership of the EC.
Mr Major explained that the rest of the UK would remain in the EC, and along
with all the other member states would have the right to vote on Scotland's
application to join the EC.
