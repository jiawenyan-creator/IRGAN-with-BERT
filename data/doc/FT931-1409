FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson rises 17% as HK
performs strongly
JARDINE Matheson, one of Hong Kong's oldest trading conglomerates, yesterday
reported a 17 per cent increase in net profits to USDollars 316.8m for the
1992 fiscal year, up from Dollars 270.8m in 1991.
The Hong Kong operations performed strongly, particularly in car sales and
financial services, but group earnings were pulled down by the performance
of its Japanese businesses.
Earnings from north-east Asia fell to Dollars 25.1m from Dollars 61.5m, as a
result of falling sales of wines and spirits in Japan and the impact of the
depressed Tokyo stock market on Jardine Fleming, the group's 50 per cent
owned investment concern.
Jardine was recently the target of a denunciation by China, which claimed
the former opium trading company was a 'bad element in Hong Kong's business
community'.
Mr Nigel Rich, managing director, said Jardine Matheson would continue to
expand its businesses both in Hong Kong and China, pointing out that the
'group has traded in China for more than 50 years, and has been through
difficult times before'. Jardine Matheson is planning to expand its
retailing and distribution businesses across the border, but so far the
contribution from China is minimal.
Net profits were lifted by a Dollars 21.6m fall in tax as a result of
previous over-provisioning. Pre-tax profits from Jardine Pacific, which
includes the group's trading, distribution and construction businesses,
increased by Dollars 31m to Dollars 228.7m, helped by a 156 per cent jump in
profits from motor trading subsidiary Jardine International Motors.
Jardine Fleming's earnings were hit by a sharp fall in profits from
UK-listed Jardine Insurance Brokers. Jardine Strategic, the 52 per cent
owned investment holding company which controls Dairy Farm, Hong Kong Land
and Mandarin Oriental, contributed Dollars 367.1m, up from Dollars 333.8m in
1991.
Jardine Matheson will pay a final dividend of 15 cents, making a full-year
payout of 18.7 cents, up 14 per cent from 1991.
