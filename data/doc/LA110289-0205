FOR THE RECORD 
Drug crimes -- A story in the Oct. 29 South Bay edition of The Times about drug 
dealing in Harbor City incorrectly identified Hector DuBon as assistant 
principal of Normont Elementary School and quoted DuBon about gang shootings 
and other crimes. DuBon is assistant principal of another elementary school, 
elsewhere in Los Angeles, and the remarks he made do not apply to Normont 
Elementary. Rosalie Cochran, principal at Normont, said there have been no gang 
shootings on or near school property, and that her biggest crime concern is 
that students must sometimes walk to and from campus on streets where drug 
dealers operate.
