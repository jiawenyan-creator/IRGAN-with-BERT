FT  31 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
A STRONG futures sector driven by both technical and market factors gave
support to the underlying equity market, although volume, particularly in
options, was quiet, writes Christopher Price.
The March FT-SE future expires at 10.10am today and yesterday's session was
dominated by traders trying to close positions, with at least one big
trading house being caught short. Consequently, March was in demand for most
of the day, with its opening level of 2,435 turning out to be its low point
of the session.
The contract was also helped by a positive performance in the gilts and
short sterling markets. After its recent spate in the doldrums, it traded at
a premium or parity to the cash market for most of the day. March had an
unexciting afternoon session, with a quiet Wall Street failing to impact,
although it picked up in late trading.
March finished at 2,453, up 9 from the previous session and at a slight
premium to the cash market. Volume came to 5,739 contracts.
In the traded options market, there were few large lots traded in the total
of 27,462 contracts. British Steel was the most active stock option with
1,551 lots transacted. Prudential had 1,254 dealt.
