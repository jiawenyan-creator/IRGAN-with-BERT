FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cronite returns to profits
Cronite Group returned to profits in the six months to March 31 with Pounds
311,000 pre-tax against losses of Pounds 2.21m.
The Birmingham-based engineer has received a Pounds 7.3m offer from AFE, a
quoted French engineering company.
Trading profits of continuing activities advanced from Pounds 71,000 to
Pounds 456,000, aided by the release of Pounds 110,000 from provisions.
The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 285,000
(Pounds 663,000). The sale of Cronite Steels at the end of January lowered
borrowings significantly and gearing had been cut further by positive cash
flow, the company said.
Turnover was Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 22.6m) of which Pounds 8m (Pounds 8.38m)
related to continuing activities.
There is no interim dividend.
