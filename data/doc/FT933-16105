FT  06 JUL 93 / Confidence eludes farmers
FARMERS still have some way to go before confidence returns to the
hard-pressed UK agricultural sector, the National Farmer's Union said
yesterday. It said the lack of confidence persisted in spite of a limited
upturn in the past year.
A union official said: 'In some quarters there is more confidence than
before, but we would still be cautious about it.' He pointed out that last
year's devaluation of the green pound, the EC farming currency, had given
British farmers a badly-needed breathing space. But few would use it as a
basis for long-term investment decisions, he added.
Farmers have delayed investing in new equipment and land in recent years
because they have faced low incomes and high interest charges.
The Royal Agricultural Society of England has published a survey showing
that some farmers are more willing to invest in land and machinery than they
were a year ago. The survey, in which 474 farmers were approached in the
spring, found that two thirds have either bought a new tractor in the past
quarter or intend to do so.
Tractor sales were up 17 per cent in the first half of the year after sales
reached a record low last year, according to the Agricultural Equipment
Association.
Farmers at the Royal Show, which opened yesterday at Stoneleigh,
Warwickshire, say that government and EC red tape are among their biggest
problems this year.
Farmers have recently completed the latest EC forms entitling them to
payments for not cultivating some of their land. The Royal Agricultural
Society survey found that on average these forms took a week to complete at
a cost of Pounds 400.
The society also found the dairy sector the most buoyant - reforms of the
Milk Marketing Board should lead to higher milk prices for farmers next year
 -with potato growers the most pessimistic.
