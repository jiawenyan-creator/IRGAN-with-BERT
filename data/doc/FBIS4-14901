  [Text] The city authorities intend to more broadly employ 
internal troops subunits to maintain public order in Moscow. 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has come to learn that the Moscow 
government has asked the Internal Affairs Main Administration, 
by way of additional measures to enhance the maintenance of law 
and order in the capital, to work out in the shortest time 
possible regulations on the employment of Internal Troops 
subunits not only in patrolling streets but also in operations 
conducted by the militia. 
  A series of training sessions and exercises is planned for 
the immediate future to practice cooperation between the 
internal troops and militia in emergency situations. 
  The authorities do not draw a line there. They intend to go 
to Muscovites and residents of areas around Moscow in a bid to 
recruit another 6,000 people to the Moscow militia. As in the 
good old days, plans call for the selection of personnel from 
those proposed by work collectives, or for recruiting them from 
among men on active duty in the army and navy.
