  [Text] Brussels March 23 TASS -- Ukraine initialed the 
agreement of Partnership and Cooperation with the European Union 
[EU] on Wednesday. 
  The document was signed by Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko and European Commission member Leon Britten. 
The date of the high-level signing of the agreement has yet to 
be determined, but Britten and Zlenko said that it will happen 
soon. Britten said that work is currently underway to prepare 
similar documents with other CIS countries, including Russia. 
  The work on the agreement with Ukraine had taken almost a 
year. It allows Ukraine to eventually join the European Free 
Trade Zone. In 1998 the sides will sum up the results of market 
reforms in Ukraine and decide whether or not they should begin 
talks on its participation in the Free Trade Zone. So far 
Ukraine and the European Union have agreed to grant trade 
preferences to each other, lift the existing quotas and agree on 
terms of trade in coal, steel and radioactive materials. 
Ukraine have also pledged to create favourable conditions for 
Western companies. 
  Both sides stressed the importance of boosting and 
strengthening regional cooperation within the former Soviet 
Union. The preamble of the agreement confirms the EU support 
for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  The EU Commission will also issue 1.3 million ECU [European 
currency unit] (1.5 million U.S. dollars) to Ukraine in 
humanitarian aid for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant disaster.
