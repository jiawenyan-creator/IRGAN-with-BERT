'TODAY,' STILL IN ITS SLUMP, REBUFFS 'GOOD DAY' 
NBC's "Today" show, which will welcome Joe Garagiola back in June as its third 
co-host, still has the ratings blues. It was in second place last week for the 
19th straight week, Nielsen estimates showed today. 
ABC's "Good Morning America" remained first in ratings, averaging a 4.8. 
"Today" averaged a 3.2 and "CBS This Morning" a 2.6. Each ratings point 
represents 921,000 homes. 
The 19th week of bad news for "Today" came a day after it was twitted on local 
TV by WNYW-TV's "Good Day New York" show, which last week beat the slumping NBC 
show in local Nielsen ratings. 
The needling occurred Wednesday on the East River, where "Today" was 
broadcasting live from a 160-foot luxury yacht. 
Gordon Elliott, who normally barges into homes for live interviews on "Good 
Day," dogged the "Today" broadcast in a rented cabin cruiser. 
NBC was not amused, said the puckish Elliott, whom viewers saw using a bullhorn 
to hail NBC's show, ask permission to board what he called the "SS Today," and 
interview co-hosts Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville. 
NBC, through the Coast Guard, "formally asked us to stay 100 yards from their 
vessel, which I thought was bad sportsmanship," he groused. "I was going to 
make our show available to help them in the ratings." 
But Elliott can sympathize with ratings woes like those of "Today." He once was 
a host of "Good Morning Australia," which at one time also had ratings 
problems. "It happens to every show," he said.
