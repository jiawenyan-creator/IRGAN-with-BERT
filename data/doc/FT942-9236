FT  17 MAY 94 / Observer: Nice insider
If, as seems increasingly likely, William Donaldson decides not to seek a
second term next year, the New York Stock Exchange may well look no further
than his current number two, NYSE president Richard Grasso, for its next
chairman.
The diminutive Grasso is the ultimate insider (in the nicest possible
sense). He joined the exchange in 1968 as a corporate listings
representative, and has since learnt almost every aspect of the NYSE's
business on his way up.
He has built up close relationships with the frontline troops, the
specialists, who have an important say in the choice of their chairman. 'He
is very much liked on the floor, because he spends a lot of time there and
really understands the needs of the specialists,' one former NYSE executive
points out.
The fact that Grasso looks and talks more like a trader than the current
incumbent also does no harm. During his tenure, the more aloof Donaldson has
never been much of a hit on the floor.
Grasso also happens to be the market's technology chief, which ought to
count for even more. At least he should be aware of the complexities of
dragging the world's largest floor-based exchange into the 21st century.
