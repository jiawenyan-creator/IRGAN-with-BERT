  [Text] Yekaterinburg -- A delegation of Urals 
industrialists and entrepreneurs have returned from Brussels, 
where the highly prestigious industrial exhibition "Eurotex `94" 
was held. 
  Foreign businessmen showed interest in the proposals put to 
them from this previously unknown region. In the very near 
future contracts will be concluded with the Urals 
Electromechanical Plant, the "Uralkhimplast" Association, and 
the Kamensk-Uralskiy Electromechanical Plant. The Urals 
delegation visited NATO Headquarters and reached agreement on 
cooperation in the conversion of the Urals defense sector.
