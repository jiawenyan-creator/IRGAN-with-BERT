SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires that the Attorney General establish aggregate
production quotas for each basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedules I and II. This responsibility
has been delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The
Administrator, in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6,
1994).





The quotas are to provide adequate supplies of each substance for: (1) The estimated medical, scientific, research,
and industrial needs of the United States; (2) lawful export requirements; and (3) the establishment and maintenance
of reserve stocks. 

In determining the below listed proposed 1995 aggregate production quotas, the Deputy Administrator considered
the following factors: (1) Total actual 1993 and estimated 1994 and 1995 net disposals of each substance by all manufacturers;
(2) estimates of 1994 year end inventories of each substance and of any substance manufactured from it and trends in
accumulation of such inventories; and (3) projected demand as indicated by procurement quota applications filed
pursuant to 1303.12 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 

Pursuant to 1303.23(c) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Deputy Administrator of the DEA will,
in early 1995, adjust aggregate production quotas and individual manufacturing quotas allocated for the year based
upon 1994 year-end inventory and actual 1994 disposition data supplied by quota recipients for each basic class of
Schedule I or II controlled substance. 

Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
proposes that the aggregate production quotas for 1995 for the following controlled substances, expressed in grams
of anhydrous acid or base, be established as follows:

Aggregate production quotas for all other Schedules I and II controlled substances included in 1308.11
and 1308.12 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations are established at zero. 

All interested persons are invited to submit their comments and objections in writing regarding this proposal. A
person may object to or comment on the proposal relating to any of the above-mentioned substances without filing comments
or objections regarding the others. If a person believes that one or more of these issues warrant a hearing, the individual
should so state and summarize the reasons for this belief. 

In the event that comments or objections to this proposal raise one or more issues which the Deputy Administrator finds
warrant a hearing, the Deputy Administrator shall order a public hearing by notice in the 

Federal Register

, summarizing the issues to be heard and setting the time for the hearing. 

The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C., 601, 

et seq

. The establishment of annual aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated
by law and by international treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large
manufacturers, their impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator
has determined that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
