Johnny Majors, Tennessee football coach, said that prize recruit Derric Evans 
will not be allowed to play for the Volunteers because of his arrest Tuesday 
night in Dallas. 
Evans and a high school teammate, Gary Edwards, were charged with two armed 
robberies at video stores. Evans was released Wednesday on $50,000 bond. 
Majors said that he would release Evans, a 6-foot-3, 195-pound safety, from his 
letter of intent if Evans asked. That would allow Evans to accept a scholarship 
at another school, but he would have to sit out a year and would lose a year of 
eligibility.
