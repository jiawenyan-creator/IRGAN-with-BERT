  [Text] Military analysts say Canada will have to rely on 
other countries to protect its troops in Bosnia if they are 
attacked by Serbs. Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet says 
Canada is making contingency plans. He wouldn't specify, but 
Mr. Ouellet says Canada is working on both the military and 
diplomatic fronts. Canadian troops in the Muslim enclave of 
Srebrenica are considered to be vulnerable to possible Serb 
reprisals to NATO air strikes.
