FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Harrington pay-out cut after new audit
Harrington Kilbride, the magazine publisher, yesterday revoked its proposal
to pay a 3.2p final dividend for the year to December 31 1993, and instead
recommended a final pay-out of 1p to make a total of 2.7p, a 40 per cent
reduction on 1992's 4.5p total.
The dividend cut followed the publication of the group's re-audited accounts
for 1993, which in turn was necessitated by changes to the provisions
Harrington made for bad and doubtful debts.
In early June it made late extra provisions of Pounds 3m after the accounts
had been announced; this turned pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.42m into losses
and the shares fell 66p to 68p in a day.
Yesterday a further Pounds 500,000 was added to the provision; this resulted
in previously announced operating profits of Pounds 2.68m being restated as
losses of Pounds 824,000. Pre-tax losses totalled Pounds 1.08m, against
profits of Pounds 1.87m in 1992. At December, debtors still owed the company
Pounds 1.36m.
Bonuses which would have been paid to Mr Kevin Harrington and Mr Kevin
Austin, managing and finance directors respectively, will not now be paid.
Harrington, whose shares on September 7 last peaked at 252p and yesterday
closed down 1p at 42p, publishes a wide range of magazines, many of which
are free. These make their money by the sale of advertising space.
Expansion in Eastern Europe and the CIS lay behind much of the provisions,
but the company will now concentrate on conferences on a cash receipts
basis.
Turnover in 1993 was Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 15.4m) and losses per share were
11.4p (earnings 11.8p).
