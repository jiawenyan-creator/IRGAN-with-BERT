FT  09 MAR 93 / Greek bank reform move
GREECE'S central bank yesterday lifted the last remaining restriction on
interest rates by abolishing its 18 per cent minimum rate for deposit
accounts, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The move would contribute to a gradual decline in interest rates, both on
government paper and for commercial borrowing. Banks are expected to trim
operating costs by sharply reducing interest rates for small
account-holders, who will be encouraged to shift their savings to the post
office and other institutions. The central bank is under government pressure
to speed deregulation to compete effectively in the single market. However,
real interest rates are expected to remain high.
