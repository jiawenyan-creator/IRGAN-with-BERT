<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Ethylene
Glycol</DOCTITLE>



The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of Ethylene Glycol, a major constituent of motor vehicle antifreeze-coolant fluids and
also in other commercial products including hydraulic brake fluids, adhesives, printer's inks, and wood stains.
It is also used in the manufacturer of polyester films and fibers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) solid state resins,
plasticizers, elastomers, cellophane, and other products.

Two year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering ethylene glycol in the diet of 60
male mice (0, 6,200, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm) and 60 female mice (0, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm) for up to 103 weeks.
These concentrations correspond to daily doses of approximately 1,500, 3,000, or 6,000 mg/kg body weight for male
mice and 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 mg/kg for females.

Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity

 of ethylene glycol in male B6C3F1 mice receiving 6,250, 12,500, or 25,000 ppm, or in female B6C3F1 mice receiving 12,500,
25,000, or 50,000 ppm. Administration of ethylene glycol resulted in hepatocellular hyaline degeneration in male
mice fed diets containing 12,500 or 25,000 ppm and in female mice fed diets containing 50,000 ppm. An increased incidence
of medial hyperplasia of small pulmonary arteries and arterioles occurred in female mice fed diets containing 12,500,
25,000, or 50,000 ppm ethylene glycol.

The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: two categories for
positive results (``clear evidence'' and `'some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal
evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be
evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study'').
