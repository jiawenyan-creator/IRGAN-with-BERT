FT  02 APR 93 / Government will cap three councils
MR Michael Howard, environment secretary, yesterday confirmed that just
three English councils are to have their budgets limited, or capped, by the
government this year.
The only county to be capped is Gloucestershire, in which no party has
overall control. The two districts to be capped are Castle Point (Tory) and
Harlow (Labour), both in Essex.
At just less than Pounds 18m, Harlow's budget was more than twice what the
government thought it should be.
The small number of councils to be capped - less than half the number of
recent years - is a sign of the government's increasingly tight controls on
local spending.
Separately, Mr John Major yesterday used prime minister's questions to drive
home the claim that Conservative councils set lower council taxes. The claim
is the basis of the Conservative campaign for the county elections on May 6.
The councils have 28 days to challenge the government's decision. The new
limits would cut the council tax on a two-person household in a band D home
(worth between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000) by Pounds 288 in Harlow,
Pounds 55 in Gloucestershire and Pounds 18 in Castle Point.
