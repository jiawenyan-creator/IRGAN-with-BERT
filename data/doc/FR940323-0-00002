ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing an interim regulation to redefine the Rockingham, New Hampshire, Federal
Wage System nonappropriated fund (NAF) wage area for pay-setting purposes. After this change, a new wage area, York,
Maine, will include the same three counties, with York County, Maine, designated as the survey area and Rockingham
County, New Hampshire, and Windsor County, Vermont, designated as areas of application. With the closing of Pease
Air Force Base, there are no longer enough NAF wage employees in Rockingham County to satisfy the requirements established
by regulation for a survey county.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

This interim rule becomes effective on March 23, 1994. Comments must be received by April 22, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Rockingham, New Hampshire, NAF wage area is presently composed of three counties: Rockingham County, New Hampshire
(survey area); York County, Maine (area of application); and Windsor County, Vermont (area of application). After
this change, a new wage area, York, Maine, will include the same three counties, with York County designated as the
survey area and Rockingham County and Windsor County designated as areas of application.



This change was made necessary by the closing of Pease Air Force Base, which left only two NAF employees in Rockingham
County. By regulation (5 CFR 532.219) there must be a minimum of 26 NAF wage employees in the survey area, and a local
activity in the area must have the capability to conduct the survey. Neither of these conditions can now be met by Rockingham
County. However, York County does not meet the minimum requirements to be the survey area. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
has 58 NAF employees and has the capability to conduct the survey. York County also meets the other regulatory requirement
of a minimum of 1,800 private enterprise employees in establishments within survey specifications. There are approximately
23,025 such employees in York County. The remaining employees in the wage area are the 8 Veterans Administration employees
of the White River Junction Medical Center and Regional Office in Windsor County, Vermont, bringing the total wage
area employment to 68.


The full-scale surveys will continue to be ordered in September of even numbered fiscal years_e.g., in September
1994. The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee (FPRAC) reviewed this request and by consensus recommended
approval.


Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking.
Also, pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for making this rule
effective in less than 30 days. The notice is being waived and the regulation is being made effective in less than 30
days because preparations for September 1994 surveys must begin immediately.



Regulatory Flexibility Act




I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they affect only Federal agencies and employees.
