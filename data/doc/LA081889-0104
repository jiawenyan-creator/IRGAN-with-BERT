ISRAEL SEEKS A ROLE IN U.S. SPACE PROGRAM 
Israel, which joined an elite club of world space powers last year by launching 
a communications satellite into orbit, said Thursday that it has asked to take 
part in the U.S. space program. 
Yuval Neeman, head of the Israel Space Agency, told Israel Radio that he raised 
the idea when he met Vice President Dan Quayle in Washington. 
Neeman said Quayle, as chairman of the National Space Council, arranged for him 
to meet American space experts in two weeks.
