<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In conformity with Title 13, United States Code, Sections 182, 224, and 225, I have determined that a 1994 Company Organization
Survey is needed to update the multiestablishment companies in the Standard Statistical Establishment List. The
survey, which has been conducted for many years, is designed to collect information on the number of employees, payrolls,
geographic location, current status, and kind of business for the establishments of multiestablishment companies.
These data will have significant application to the needs of the public and to governmental agencies and are not publicly
available from nongovernmental or governmental sources.

in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96511, as amended. Report forms will be furnished
