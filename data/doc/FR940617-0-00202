 

(5) After the system has been connected as shown in 
Figure 5 in appendix A to this subpart, set the variable 
restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS pump for 
20 minutes. Record the calibration data. 
(6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted 
condition in an increment of pump inlet depression that will 
yield a minimum of six data points for the total calibration. 
Allow the system to stabilize for 3 minutes and repeat the 
data acquisition. 
(7) Data analysis: 
(i) The air flow rate, 

Q



s

, at each test point is 
calculated in standard cubic meters per minute (0 
&cir;C, 101.3 
kPa) from the flowmeter data using the manufacturer's 
prescribed method. 
(ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, 


V



o

, in cubic meter per revolution at absolute pump inlet 
temperature and pressure:

respectively, describing the regression line.




(8) A CVS system that has multiple speeds must be 
calibrated on each speed used. The calibration curves 
generated for the ranges will be approximately parallel and 
the intercept values, 

D

, will increase as the pump flow range 
decreases. 

(9) If the calibration has been performed carefully, the 
calculated values from the equation will be within

percent of the measured value of

M

 will vary 
from one pump to another, but values of

same make, model, and range should agree within

 percent of 
each other. Calibrations should be performed at pump start-up 
and after major maintenance to assure the stability of the 
pump slip rate. Analysis of mass injection data will also 
reflect pump slip stability. 

(d) 

CFVCVS calibration.

 (1) Calibration of the CFV is 
based upon the flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow 
is a function of inlet pressure and temperature:
