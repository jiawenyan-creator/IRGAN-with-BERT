FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: London's buses stay red says buyer
Some of London's double-decker red buses, a symbol of the capital from New
Delhi to New York, changed owners yesterday. But the buyer has pledged to
keep the fleet 'predominantly red'.
The government promised this year that the double-decker bus, a
once-in-a-lifetime ride for many tourists, would retain its traditional
livery after the 10 London bus companies were sold to the private sector.
But some new bus operators have introduced multi-coloured vehicles on their
routes and Londoners fear the loss of a well-loved friend.
The sale of the London Central bus company to the Go-Ahead Group for nearly
Pounds 24m means that four London bus companies have been privatised with
the rest to follow shortly.
Mr Trevor Shears, Go-Ahead finance director, said: 'We have buses in other
parts of the country in nearly every colour you can think of but we will be
keeping the London buses predominantly red as required in our agreement with
London Transport.'
Go-Ahead will also keep the 100 Routemasters, which carry a conductor as
well as a driver, on its busiest routes. London Central operates nearly 500
buses on routes in south-east London as well as in the city centre.
Go-Ahead, based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, has been expanding rapidly,
acquiring bus companies in Brighton and Oxford in recent months.
The sale of Central means that London Buses has made Pounds 87m from the
sale of the four companies, indicating that it will far exceed its initial
estimate of about Pounds 100m from the privatisation programme.
Go-Ahead is paying Pounds 20m cash for London Central and will also repay
Pounds 3.8m of the company's loans. The purchase will be funded by a Pounds
25m secured loan facility.
London Central achieved revenues of Pounds 40.6m in the year to March 1994,
and Go-Ahead hopes to reduce costs to improve on the Pounds 2.54m operating
profits.
