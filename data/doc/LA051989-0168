WORLD; 
ITALIAN PREMIER RESIGNS UNDER FIRE 
Premier Ciriaco De Mita resigned today after repeated sniping by the 
Socialists, his main partner in the 13-month-old coalition government. 
De Mita turned in his resignation as head of Italy's 48th postwar government to 
President Francesco Cossiga. The president asked De Mita to stay on in a 
caretaker capacity. The political negotiations aimed at forming a new coalition 
could take weeks.
