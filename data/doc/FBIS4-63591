  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- "Only irresponsible 
politicians in Ukraine who are seeking to take advantage of the 
situation in the region in order to postpone presidential 
elections and retain power may benefit from creating tension in 
the Crimea," the Russian president's administration chief of 
staff Sergey Filatov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that 
transparent borders would provide the best conditions for 
relations not only between Ukraine, the Crimea and Russia, but 
also all CIS states. He regretted that unlike the rest of 
Europe, CIS countries are moving in the opposite direction, but 
only to realise with time that they will not be able to do 
without integration. 
  "The willingness of some Ukrainian politicians to fence off 
from Russia is conducive to the worsening of the social and 
psychological climate in society," Filatov said.
