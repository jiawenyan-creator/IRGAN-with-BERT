FT  27 MAR 93 / Clarification on public-sector pay
SENIOR civil servants yesterday said that the chancellor had confirmed that
he had committed himself to public-sector pay restraint for one year only.
There has been widespread speculation over recent weeks that this year's 1.5
per cent pay ceiling for public-sector workers might be extended.
But Mr Norman Lamont, in a letter to the Association of First Division Civil
Servants, confirmed that the union's notes of a meeting with him last year
were fair and accurate. These recorded that Mr Lamont said that the 1.5 per
cent ceiling was for only one year and that he did not believe it would be
'practical' for the policy to continue.
