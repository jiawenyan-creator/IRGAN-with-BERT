FT  30 APR 92 / Ontario to increase taxes as deficit grows
ONTARIO's beleaguered social democratic government is to raise taxes in a
budget to be presented in Toronto today.
Despite the tax rises, expected to hit big business and high earners,
analysts are predicting a sharp increase in the budget deficit and borrowing
requirement of Canada's wealthiest province.
Interest rate spreads on Ontario bonds have already widened in anticipation
of the budget, and credit-rating agencies will be watching the budget
closely with a view to a possible downgrading.
The province and its power utility, Ontario Hydro, are among North America's
biggest borrowers on international capital markets. They borrowed about
CDollars 10bn last year.
Ms Hilary Geller of SA Murray, a Toronto lobbying firm, said the government
was likely to expand its borrowing capability by setting up separate
corporations for various public services, such as transport, water and
sewerage.
The budget deficit for the fiscal year to March 31 1993, which was projected
last year at CDollars 8.9bn, is now expected to reach at least CDollars
11bn. The shortfall was only CDollars 3bn in the year to March 1991.
Ontario's economy, which is heavily dependent on the steel, motor and
resource industries, has been hit hard by the recession. The Wefa Group, an
economics consultancy, forecasts GDP growth of no more than 2 per cent in
1992, following two successive years of decline.
Public spending, especially on health and welfare, accelerated sharply under
both the previous Liberal government and the ruling New Democratic party,
which took office in September 1990.
But the fiscal squeeze is now forcing Ontario, like Canada's other
provinces, to tighten its belt. The provincial treasurer, Mr Floyd Laughren,
is expected to announce delays in many projects and to trim the provincial
civil service. Mr Laughren announced earlier that transfers to hospitals,
municipalities and schools will rise by only 1 per cent this year.
