FT  11 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Iosco drops common capital
rules plan
EFFORTS to create world wide minimum capital rules for securities firms, in
progress for more than three years, were finally abandoned yesterday by
securities regulators from around the world.
The failure to reach agreement means that substantial differences are likely
to persist in the way securities markets around the world are regulated,
leading to a continuing flow of financial market activity to more lightly
regulated financial centres.
The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), the body
which represents securities regulators in most of the world's financial
centres, decided to abandon efforts to reach common international capital
adequacy rules after the latest meeting of its technical committee, held in
Trinidad.
The search for common capital rules, mirroring the international agreement
on bank capital reached by the Basle group on banking supervision, was
launched by Iosco in the middle of 1989. Only a year ago, the Iosco
technical committee appeared to have reached agreement in principle on a
standard which also met with the approval of international bank regulators.
However, by last autumn, large differences became apparent between the US
Securities and Exchange Commission on the one hand, and a group of
regulators led by the UK Securities and Investments Board on the other. Mr
Richard Breeden, SEC chairman, held out at that stage for higher levels of
capital than were acceptable to financial centres such as London.
A compromise promoted by the chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange was
rejected yesterday. The US claimed that the proposed capital levels were too
low, while the UK and France maintained they were too high, said Mr Bill
Albrecht, acting chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
who was present at the meeting.
