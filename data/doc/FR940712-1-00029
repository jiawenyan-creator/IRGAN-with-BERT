 

The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the locations identified in the addresses section of this document.
This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Executive Order 12866. Therefore,
review by the Office of Management and Budget is not required prior to publication in the 

Federal Register

.
This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) because the sale of lumber and forest products produced by Indian enterprises
will be conducted as in the past.
The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these proposed regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.
In accordance with Executive Order 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant
takings implications.
The Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects.
The deletion of 25 CFR part 164, ``Sale of Lumber and Other Forest Products Produced by Indian Enterprises from Forests
on Indian Reservations,'' will not create information collection or record keeping requirements which require
approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.
