FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Berliner Bank to raise dividend
Berliner Bank, which earlier this year merged with two others to form
Germany's sixth-biggest bank, will increase its dividend by DM7 to DM9
following last year's high partial operating profits and operating results.
At the same time, Mr Wolfgang Steinriede, spokesman for the board, said the
the group's net profits before risk provisions would total about DM1.2bn
(Dollars 612m), similar to last year.
Partial operating profits, without trading, for 1993 rose by 60.7 per cent
to DM372.4m (Dollars 223.5m), while full operating results rose by 120 per
cent to DM303.2m. Net profits rose by 71 per cent to DM121.1m. Net interest
receipts rose by 34.3 per cent to DM1.33bn, while commission fees increased
by 24.3 per cent to DM254.6m.
Last year's results confirm the bank's success in integrating the Berliner
Stadtbank, its east Berlin counterpart. The takeover of this bank after
German unification included DM7bn of government-guaranteed loans and an
additional capital of DM550m.
However, this year's performance will be anchored on the new structure,
called Bank Gesellschaft Berlin, which for the first time in German banking
brings together the private and public sector.
BGB includes Landesbank Berlin, which owns the saving banks, Berliner
Hypotheken und Pfandbriefbank (a property financing institution) and
Berliner Bank (a commercial bank). All three institutions are owned by the
State of Berlin. Currently, Berlin holds a 78 per cent stake in the BGB.
But Mr Steinriede yesterday said the Berlin Senate intended to reduce its
stake in BGB by about 10 per cent in 1995. By the end of the first quarter
of this year, BGB's total share capital amounted to DM8.3bn.
Berlin's decision to reduce its stake was partly prompted by financial
reasons - the city had a budget deficit of DM7bn - as well as the need to
push Berlin towards becoming a financial centre.
