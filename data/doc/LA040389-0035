MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
KHJ-TV Channel 9's weatherman Andrew Amador has been fired after six years on 
the air. Amador said that the parting came "as a shock" but he described it as 
amicable and said he received a "nice severance." Until Friday, Channel 9 had 
been the only local independent station to still use a weatherperson on its 
newscast, and news director Stephanie Rank Brady said that the station had 
decided to go without a weatherman for the time being. Channels 5, 11 and 13 
currently have one of their anchors give the weather forecast. For now, Channel 
9 will do the same. ALEENE MacMINN and Claudia Puig
