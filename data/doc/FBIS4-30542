  [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
observes the 19th anniversary of the independence of Mozambique 
and the foundation of its Republic. 
  Noting that the Mozambican Government and people have made 
energetic efforts to consolidate the independence of the country 
and build an independent new society under difficult conditions 
of unceasing interference and subversive activities and sabotage 
of the reactionaries within and without, the article says: 
  Measures have been taken in Mozambique to put an end to the 
civil war, ensure peace and achieve the security of the people 
and social development. 
  Pursuing an external policy of independence and 
non-alignment, Mozambique is developing friendly relations with 
surrounding countries and many countries of the world. 
  The Korean people sincerely rejoice over the achievements 
the 
Mozambican people have made in the efforts to build a new 
society, surmounting obstacles and difficulties facing them.

desire of their peoples.

between 
Korea and Mozambique will develop further, the Korean people 
wish new success to the Mozambican people in their work for the 
stability and prosperity of the country.
