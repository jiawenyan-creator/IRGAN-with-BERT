NATION; 
NURSE GUILTY OF KILLING 4 PATIENTS 
A nurse was convicted today of killing four patients by injecting them with a 
powerful drug in a scheme to revive them and look like a hero. 
A jury deliberated eight days before finding 27-year-old Richard Angelo guilty 
of murder in two deaths, manslaughter in one and criminally negligent homicide 
in the fourth. All four deaths occurred in 1987 at a Long Island hospital. 
Angelo also was convicted of assault in connection with the deaths and on three 
counts of assault for giving injections to a patient who survived. He was 
acquitted of assault in connection with two other patients whose deaths could 
not conclusively be linked to injections.
