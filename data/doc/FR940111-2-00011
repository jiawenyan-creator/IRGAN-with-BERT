<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On Tuesday, September 21, 1993, notice was published in the 

Federal Register 

(58 FR 49024) that an application (P2Y) had been filed by Sea World, Inc. for a permit to import one adult male killer
whale (

Orcinus orca

) identified as ``Ulysses'' from the Barcelona Zoo in Barcelona, Spain. 



Notice is hereby given that on January 4, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act
(MMPA) of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et. seq.

) the NMFS issued a permit for the above activities subject to the special conditions set forth therein. 

Issuance of this permit is based on a finding that the proposed taking is consistent with the purposes and policy of
the MMPA. The NMFS has determined that Sea World, Inc. offers an acceptable program for education or conservation
purposes. Sea World, Inc. facilities are open the public on a regularly scheduled basis and access to these facilities
is not limited or restricted other than by the charging of an admission fee. 

The permit is available for review by appointment in the following offices:
