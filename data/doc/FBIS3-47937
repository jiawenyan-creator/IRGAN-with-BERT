  [Text] Washington, Jan. 20 KYODO -- President Bill Clinton 
said Thursday [20 January] the United States must reduce its 
trade deficits and identified Japan and China as "our biggest 
problems." 
  Clinton, speaking on a television talk show, said he is 
particularly distressed with trade gaps which he said are 
"structural and permanent." 
  "Our biggest problems are with Japan and now with China," he 
told the Cable News Network's "Larry King Live," a television 
talk show that is beamed worldwide. 
  "We are working on both of them," he said. 
  Clinton made the remarks in reply to a question from a 
caller 
who asked whether he favors increasing the local content of U.S. 
products in order to reduce the size of the U.S. trade deficit. 
  "I would like to lower our trade deficit, at least that 
which 
is structural and permanent," he said. 
  Clinton said the U.S. Government must, however, be "very 
careful" over the "Buy American" proposal because it might 
violate U.S. commitments under international trade treaties. 
  "We do have certain `Buy American' preferences in our laws, 
but we have to be very careful how far we go without violating 
treaties and agreements we make with other countries which take 
our products freely," he said. 
  Japan and China both run huge trade surpluses with the 
United 
States. 
  According to U.S. trade figures, Japan's bilateral trade 
surplus is running at more than 50 billion dollars a year, while 
China's tops 20 billion dollars.
