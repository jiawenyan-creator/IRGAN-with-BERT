FT  06 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): AT&amp;T news and good jobs data
boost Dow
Wall Street
US STOCK markets overcame early declines and rebounded strongly in heavy
trading, aided by good jobs figures and news of AT&amp;T's big investment in
McCaw Cellular, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.80 ahead at 3,243.84, well
above its low for the day of 3,215. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.23 at
418.34, while the Nasdaq composite climbed 8.56 to 614.08. Turnover on the
New York SE was heavy at 219.7m shares.
Although prices opened lower, buyers quickly returned to the market in the
belief that Wednesday's post-election sell-off had been overdone. Investors
were aided by a better than expected weekly jobless claims report, which
showed that the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance fell
16,000 in the week ending October 24.
The market drew strength from the claims data, which suggested that today's
key employment report for October could beat expectations. Analysts expect
non-farm payrolls to have risen by between 25,000 and 50,000 last month, and
the perception is growing that labour market conditions may be improving
steadily.
Sentiment was also buoyed by Wednesday afternoon's announcement that AT&amp;T,
the country's largest telecommunications supplier, was spending Dollars
3.8bn for a 33 per cent equity stake in McCaw Cellular and an option for
voting control of the wireless communications company.
The deal, which will put AT&amp;T in direct competition with the regional Bell
companies for the first time since the Bell system was dismantled in 1984,
was greeted warmly by investors, who bid AT&amp;T stock up Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 44 3/8 on turnover of 4.8m shares. McCaw, traded on the Nasdaq
market, jumped Dollars 5 1/4 , or 20 per cent, to Dollars 32 in turnover of
8.6m shares.
Retailers were in the news following the release of their October sales
figures. The Gap dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 in busy trading
after reporting a 2 per cent rise in same-store sales, much smaller than
expected, and K-mart declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 27 3/8 on a
disappointing 2.9 per cent increase in same-store sales.
In contrast, Wal-Mart edged Dollars  1/8 higher to Dollars 62 1/8 on news of
a 16 per cent improvement in same-store sales and Woolworth firmed Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 33 1/2 on a 4.3 per cent rise in total domestic sales.
Philip Morris advanced Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 in turnover of 4.8m
shares after a high-profile and potentially costly smoker's lawsuit filed
against the company in New Jersey was dropped by the plaintiffs.

THE TORONTO market ended with a slightly easier bias after active trading
that was boosted by a large block trade in Westcoast Energy shares.
The TSE 300 index was 5.0 easier at 3,339.7 and declining issues led rises
by 306 to 254. Volume came to 37m shares valued at CDollars 366m.
Brascan said its third-quarter loss widened to 61 cents a share from 3
cents. The stock dipped CDollars 1/2 to CDollars 17 5/8.
