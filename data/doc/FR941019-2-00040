<DOCTITLE>National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation; Motion to Vacate</DOCTITLE>


October 13, 1994.


Take notice that on October 6, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo,
New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94693000 a ``Notice of Withdrawal of Pleading'' seeking to withdraw
its ``Request for Authorization Under the Notice Procedures of 157.205'' which was filed August 1, 1994, in
Docket No. CP94693000 (prior notice filing). National Fuel states that its Notice of Withdrawal is
filed in compliance with Condition C of the Commission's Order on Rehearing issued in Docket Nos. CP94112001
and CP8894009 on September 1, 1994 (68 FERC 61,278).
National Fuel's prior notice filing involved a request for authorization to construct and operate a new point of delivery
in the town of Grand Island, Erie County, New York to provide service to an existing customer, National fuel Gas Distribution
Corporation (Distribution), under National Fuel's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP834000.
The prior notice filing was noticed August 4, 1994, and no protests were filed during the notice period which expired
September 19, 1994.
In its prior notice filing, National Fuel noted that it had previously applied for approval under Section 7(c) of the
Natural Gas Act for the acquisition and construction of certain facilities, including the delivery point described
in the prior notice filing. National Fuel explained that it had received conditional approval of the proposal by order
issued June 1, 1994, in Docket Nos. CP94112000 and CP8894008 (67 FERC 61,270 (1994)).
National Fuel stated that it was unable to commence acquisition and construction because it could not satisfy all
the conditions included in the June 1 order and therefore it had filed for rehearing of the June 1 order. National Fuel
asserted that it urgently needed to commence construction of the Grand Island station in order to have the station
in operation by November 1.
National Fuel has now accepted the certificate issued in Docket No. CP94112000, et al., in the June 1
order, as amended by the Commission's September 1, 1994, order on rehearing. However, Paragraph (C) of the order on
rehearing provided that before National fuel may begin construction of the facilities authorized in Docket No. CP94112000,
it must withdraw its prior notice request filed in Docket No. CP94693000.
The Commission will treat National Fuel's Notice of Withdrawal as a motion to vacate the authorization granted pursuant
to 157.205 and 157.212 in Docket No. CP94693000.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said motion to vacate should on or before November
3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have hereto filed need not file again.
