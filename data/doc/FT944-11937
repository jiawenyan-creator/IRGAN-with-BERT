FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Materials up 26%
Mitsubishi Materials, a leading Japanese metals and ceramics manufacturer,
posted firm profits for the half-year to September due to cost-cutting
efforts and an improvement in its financial balance.
Non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
for the first half rose 26 per cent to Y2.6bn (Dollars 26.8m) on a 0.3 per
cent rise in overall sales to Y344bn. While the company saw an increase in
shipments of aluminium cans due to a sharp rise in demand for soft drinks,
declines in product prices offset the gains.
Operating earnings rose 44.8 per cent to Y8.3bn. However after-tax profits
shrank 4.4 per cent to Y1.1bn due to an extraordinary loss of Y6.4bn
stemming from loan-loss reserves. The company faced earnings declines in
spite of a special profit of Y4.6bn from asset and securities sales.
Sales of metals fell 1.4 per cent to Y122.2bn while cement sales declined
4.6 per cent to Y54.9bn. Sales of aluminium cans rose 8.8 per cent to
Y41.4bn while new materials and silicon sales rose 10.6 per cent to Y34.7bn.
For the year to next March, Mitsubishi Materials expects a 35.6 per cent
rise in current profits to Y3.5bn on a 2.6 per cent rise in sales to Y700bn.
