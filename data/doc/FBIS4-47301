  [Abstract] A laboratory goniometer has been developed and 
built by the authors for studying the spatial reflection 
patterns of particularly three- dimensional objects but also of 
predominantly diffusely reflecting objects. Its optical system 
includes an illuminator with a 30 V - 300 W (stabilized) 
incandescent lamp and a photometer with a photomultiplier tube, 
the optical axes of their respective objectives intersecting at 
an angle _a_ at a point 0.6 m equidistant from both. The object 
is placed with its geometrical center at that point of 
intersection. Two sets of diaphragms are provided, one with 1-5 
mm diameters to be placed in the focal plane of the illuminator 
objective and with 3-12 mm diameters to be placed in the focal 
plane of the photometer objective. The object is placed with its 
geometrical center at that point of intersection. Two light 
absorbers, each in the form of a sheave with a set of 
black-coated 30 V-grooves, are placed 0.6 m behind the 
object: one diametrically opposite the illuminator aperture so 
as to completely cover the collimated light beam after its 
passage through the object and one diametrically opposite the 
photometer aperture so as to completely cover its field of view. 
The object is oriented and rotated by means of a device with 
DVSh80-06 stepper motors and three degrees of freedom. Two 
degrees of freedom are with respect to two orthogonal axes: 
rotation about one through any angle within the full 0  
_P_  360 range and about the other through any angle 
within the -88  _th_  +90 range. The third 
degree 
of freedom is added by rotation of the photometer axis about the 
illuminator axis through any angle within the the -22  
_ps_  180 range. Within the interference zone on the 
illuminator and photometer side the range of _P_ angles is 
narrower, depending on both _a_ and _ps_ angles. Goniometer 
control as well as signal recording and processing, including 
digital-to-analog conversion, are automated with the aid of a 
personal IBM PC-XT type computer which executes the operations 
according to a given program and displays the results on the 
screen of a SETU-10 multipurpose monitor. In this way was, for 
instance, tested a conical body. The dependence of its effective 
reflecting surface area on its orientation angle _P_ relative 
to 
the illuminator axis was measured with its position around the 
photometer axis at angle _th_= 0, the position of the 
photometer axis at around the illuminator axis at angle _ps_= 
90, and with three different angular distances between the 
two axes: _a_= 25, 90, 132. The main sources of 
possible errors are: nonuniform luminance distribution over the 
light beam cross-section and nonuniform sensitivity distribution 
over the photometer field of view, instability of both 
distributions, nonlinearity of photometer components, ambiguity 
of object position angles due to inaccurate initial setup and 
backlash in the drive mechanism. The relative mean-square error 
is, however, not likely to exceed 15 % (20 % in 
speckle 
photometry) and the object position angles can be measured 
accurately within 45' relative to both object and photometer 
rotation axes. Figures 3; references 5.
