FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: 89% take up RTZ scrip dividend
THE ENHANCED scrip dividend offered to investors by RTZ Corporation, the
mining group, has been taken up by holders of 89 per cent, or 895m, of the
group's shares. The level of take-up was higher than many expected.
The success of the offer means that RTZ will retain about Pounds 156m of
cash that would have been paid out in dividend and advance corporation tax
due on the dividend.
Under the offer, shareholders could take a dividend in shares of 20.25p, 50
per cent more than the final cash dividend of 13.5p. Shareholders had to
register for the scrip dividend by last Friday.
The dividend has to be approved at today's annual meeting, but the vote is
expected to be overwhelmingly in favour.
Shareholders could also sell their scrip shares through BZW, the
stockbroker, at 19.25p, a 5 per cent discount to the scrip value. BZW said
it had requests for the cash offer from holders of 168m shares, or 19 per
cent of those taking the enhanced scrip.
The number of shares to be issued to satisfy the scrip dividend will be
calculated next week. BZW will have to place Pounds 32m worth of shares. At
yesterday's closing price of 645p, down 4p, that would represent about 5m
shares, or about three times the volume of RTZ shares traded yesterday.
RTZ was the second of the group of companies which introduced enhanced scrip
dividends, following BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance group.
