  [Text] A short time ago, the European Union [EU] Commission 
confirmed that it would refer Greece to court for the embargo it 
imposed against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]. In a news conference in Brussels, an EU 
commissioner said the Commission ratified its decision of last 
week. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described the EU 
Commission decision to take Greece to the European Court for 
adopting measures against Skopje on 16 February as unfortunate, 
inappropriate, and contradictory. Venizelos said: The EU 
Commission will ask the European Court to take temporary 
measures against Greece, something that will undermine 
international mediator Cyrus Vance's initiative and the 
Community's political initiative through EU Commissioner Hans 
van den Broek. The spokesman said the court will give our 
country a new forum to develop its positions further.
