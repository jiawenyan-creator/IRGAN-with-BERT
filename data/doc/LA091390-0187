COMMUNITY DIGEST: MONTEBELLO; 
GROUND WILL BE BROKEN FOR LONG-AWAITED FIRE STATION 
After years of delays, groundbreaking is scheduled at 11 a.m. Friday for a fire 
station on the south side of Montebello. 
The station, at Greenwood Avenue and Date Street, will replace one of 
Montebello's oldest fire stations built in 1944. 
According to the plans, the station will be almost 10 times larger than the old 
station, and will house a captain, engineer and two firefighter paramedics. The 
station also will house the city's fire prevention bureau, emergency services 
section and the police community services office where residents can file 
reports or make complaints. 
The $1.5-million project, which was originally discussed in 1970, is scheduled 
for completion next September.
