Biggest Challenges Facing Late 20th Century"; as released by

  [Text] Istanbul, 29 Mar (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes stressed on Tuesday [29 March] the importance of the 
challenge posed to the modern world by the rise of Muslim 
fundamentalism, believing increased economic cooperation to be 
the best response. 
  Commenting on the favorable results achieved by the Welfare 
Party [RP], especially in certain large cities such as Istanbul 
and Ankara, at Sunday's local elections in Turkey, Mr. Claes 
stressed that religious fundamentalism was "one of the greatest 
challenges facing the West in this late 20th century." 
  "I believe, however, that this rise of fundamentalist 
parties 
does not only reflect a surge in Muslim religious fervor, but 
also draws upon the despair of young generations afflicted by 
the economic and social crisis," the Belgian minister added. 
  He believes the best response to be an increase in economic 
cooperation with countries suffering from a difficult economic 
situation. 
  "Greater solidarity is needed, but I find unfortunately that 
charity is increasingly being used as an excuse for reducing 
this aid," he concluded.
