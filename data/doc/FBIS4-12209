Jordanian House of Representatives arrived in Baghdad this 
afternoon on a visit to Iraq at the invitation of the National 
Assembly. The delegation is led by 'Abd Musa al-Nahar, deputy 
speaker of the Jordanian House of Representatives. 
  In a statement to INA, al-Nahar urged the Arab nation to 
intensify efforts on the Arab and international levels to lift 
the unjust embargo against Iraq and to support the people of 
Iraq to enable them to achieve their legitimate aspirations for 
progress. 
  He also praised the steadfastness of the Iraqi people under 
the leadership of President Saddam Husayn in the face of the 
U.S.- Atlantic-Zionist conspiracy that targets the Arab nation 
and its civilization. He pointed out that the people of Jordan 
view with admiration and appreciation the heroic actions of 
their brothers in Iraq in defense of the nation's honor and 
dignity against the odious foreign aggression that seeks to 
assassinate all human and cultural aspects of life. 
  The delegation is made up of 14 members who represent 
various 
Jordanian political parties.
