FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Disabled training wins
backing
A Labour government would place a statutory obligation on British companies
to provide special facilities and training for the disabled following the
endorsement of two resolutions by the conference yesterday.
Under the resolutions Labour will back 'full and comprehensive legislation'
set out earlier this year in a private member's bill on civil rights for the
disabled.
