  [Abstract] An analysis was conducted on the factors 
affecting retention and exclusion of precursors of recombinant 
human insulin on size-exclusion HPLC. The study involved 
chromatography of 6-17 kD insulin precursor peptides on TSK G 
300 SW columns, using 0.1 M sodium phosphate elution buffers, pH 
7.0, with and without 0.2 M NaCl or 0.2 M sodium sulfate. The 
resultant data demonstrated that K[.sub]d[/] increased with 
an increasing ionic strength, with the most stable separations 
evident at an ionic strength range of 0.1 to 0.4. Addition of 
low concentrations (0.01-0.05%) of 0.1 M SDS led to a 
sharp 
reduction in K[.sub]d[/], with higher concentrations 
(0.05-0.2%) having little further effect. Efficient 
separation 
was also obtained with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride because of 
the greater differences between points corresponding to the 
different K[.sub]d[/] values of the proteins--including 
poorly soluble linear and folded proinsulin. Accordingly, 
size-exclusion HPLC was shown to lend itself to analytical 
determinations at all stages of recombinant insulin production.
