FT  27 APR 92 / S African finance minister to quit
MR Barend du Plessis, the South African finance minister, has announced he
will resign on May 1 due to exhaustion, writes Patti Waldmeir in
Johannesburg.
Mr du Plessis, who had been one of the Pretoria government's chief
negotiators at the multi-party constitutional forum, the Convention for a
Democratic South Africa, has clashed frequently with black politicians in
the transition to post-apartheid rule.
He has come under increasing pressure recently from businessmen because of
the way he handled the introduction last year of value-added tax. After
battling for several weeks with trade unions over the application of VAT to
foodstuffs, Mr du Plessis announced an arbitrary reduction in the rate from
12 to 10 per cent, and certain exemptions. Despite these concessions,
unionists staged a two-day national general strike which paralysed economic
activity.
Mr du Plessis' successor has yet to be named.
