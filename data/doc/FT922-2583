FT  16 JUN 92 / Crane driver continues week-long occupation of crane
Top-level protest: a crane driver was yesterday continuing a week-long
occupation of a crane on building site in London (above) while colleagues
maintained a picket line on the ground. The protest is part of unofficial
industrial action by building workers after talks over union recognition
broke down. The unofficial Joint Sites Committee, which is co-ordinating
action in London, claims it is responding to a unilateral imposition by
employers of a single-union deal with the AEEU engineering and electrical
union.
