MUSIC REVIEWS ; 
PIANIST ALEXANDER SLOBODYANIK AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE 
He's rueful. He's dour. Smiling to an audience hardly occurs to him. He's also 
startlingly handsome in a tall, gaunt sort of way. And when he sits 
picture-perfect at the piano -- as he did Friday at El Camino College -- with 
his flaxen hair caught by the overhead light and his lanky frame fitting itself 
to the instrument, he defines poetic elegance. 
Even if central casting had dreamed him up, Alexander Slobodyanik could not be 
better. 
More to the point: The Soviet pianist's image and art are one, as made evident 
in a program of familiar Chopin, Liszt, Mozart, Mendelssohn and Prokofiev. 
No blandishments marred his musical vision. Neither did sentimentality have a 
place. Pathos was set forth simply and drama took on a dark intensity, whether 
brooding or fiery. Prettiness of tone and sensuality of touch -- for their own 
sake -- were banished. 
Moreover, his prodigious technique could be put to whatever use he chose. In 
the Chopin group, for instance, Slobodyanik went straight to the harmonically 
difficult center, pulling out seldom heard voices. 
He reined in the glitter commonly found in the "Fantaisie-Impromptu" and 
thoroughly Scriabinized the third and fourth ballades -- the F-minor, for 
instance, came off as a darkly roaring epiphany. 
That so hackneyed a piece as Liszt's "La Campanella" could emerge sans 
showiness, reduced to a frenzied, nerve-wracked episode of mania, was a 
testament to the pianist's individuality. 
Conversely, he knew how to roll back. The sad little waltz in the midst of 
Mozart's D-minor Fantasy was laid out with a placid perfection, eloquently 
bespeaking a world of sorrow. 
There were no encores after Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata. But the audience seemed 
satisfied to be sent out on the gust of this acerbic, dense, aggressive music 
-- played with brusque authority and the same breathless spontaneity noted 
before.DONNA PERLMUTTER
