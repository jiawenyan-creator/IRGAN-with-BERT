FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: NAB ready to buy NZ bank
NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB), a leading Australian commercial bank, is
ready to complete the takeover of the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), having
completed a due diligence investigation.
The merger will create the biggest bank in Australasia.
However, the New Zealand Stock Exchange's market surveillance panel has
called for more details of the merger. It said markets and shareholders
should be given more information about the proposed unwinding of Adbro
Investments, the BNZ subsidiary which holds its doubtful debts. The panel
set a deadline of October 2 for the information.
