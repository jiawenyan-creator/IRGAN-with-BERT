  [Text] [Announcer] Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom 
Party of Austria, commented on President Thomas Klestil's 
marital problems today. He does not want to assume the role of 
a marriage guidance councilor, but he believes that Klestil 
should either settle his problems quickly or resign from office, 
he pointed out. 
  [Haider] I believe that political reason commands him to 
settle his matters in a way that restores public respect. The 
public discussion of the private affair of an official figure 
should be prevented. Doing nothing would be the worst thing in 
the current situation. Thus, I think that the damage for the 
country must now be limited. This is the most important thing. 
Our international standing has certainly not improved as a 
result of this affair. For this reason, it is important to 
settle it quickly. I do not want to say any more at present. 
If he is not in a position to resolve the matter, he will have 
to relinquish his office anyway. Somebody else will then have 
to fill this position.
