FT  03 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sellers strike at Ladbroke
MARKETMAKERS attributed the latest sharp fall in Ladbroke to 'just another
bear raid', and said a line of 1m shares was sold into the market and the
broker involved could only manage to place the shares in much smaller lumps.
The leisure group, whose businesses encompass betting shops, hotels and
property development, has suffered from a number of similar raids during
recent months.
The shares fell to 218p before struggling off the bottom and ending a
difficult session a net 13 lower at 219p. Turnover reached 3.1m, well up on
usual levels of business in the stock. No clear reasons were put forward for
the latest slide, but there were persistent rumours of imminent property
revaluations and of a series of possible property sales.
Forte shares were also under pressure, closing 8 down at 225p, albeit on
unremarkable volume of 1.6m. The stock was recently downgraded by a number
of influential analysts.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo dropped in early trading on consideration of a
US report linking its Zantac ulcer drug with higher blood-alcohol
concentration in patients who drink socially. The stock picked up as
investors bought on weakness but fell again on US profit-taking. The shares
were also affected by an easier early showing for Wall Street and closed 15
off at 838p. The US report mentioned Zantac along with SmithKline Beecham's
Tagamet.
However, SmithKline Beecham responded to a New Year's Eve announcement by
the company that its anti-arthritis drug Relifen had received US approval.
The shares were also helped by some switching from the SmithKline units,
which slipped 10 to 4163p. The 'A' shares jumped 57p, some 6 per cent, in
early trading, although they finished the session only 4p up at 900p.
Wellcome reached a new high on appreciation of a US study showing that, when
Wellcome's Aids drug Retrovir is used together with an experimental drug
from Roche, treatment of the disease might be improved.
The shares advanced 32 before ending a net 24 ahead at 1125p. The rise
followed a jump of more than Pounds 1 earlier this week after UK tests
showed Retrovir's performance was boosted when used with Wellcome's Zovirax
anti-herpes drug to treat Aids patients.
Racal Electronics, which recently beat off a hotly contested bid from
Williams Holdings, topped the list of active stocks for the second
consecutive trading session, with turnover reaching 13m shares. The day's
activity included a single trade of 3m shares transacted at 51 1/2 p, plus a
number of deals of around 1m apiece. At the close, Racal was 1 1/2 easier at
51p.
Vodafone sped up to 385p at one point, before settling only 2 firmer at
379p.
BT 'new' were hard on the heels of Racal in terms of volume, with 13m shares
changing hands. The stock finished a half-penny firmer at 122 3/4 p.
ICI was down on the day as investors took profits after recent sharp gains.
The shares, which leapt by 76 points on Tuesday and outperformed a very
strong stock market, were not helped by cautious comment yesterday from Sir
Denys Henderson, the chairman. They retreated 22 to 1188p on a turnover of
1.1m.
Wall Street's early downturn yesterday reversed a gain in BAT Industries,
which lost a net 4 at 624p. Turnover of 6m was boosted by a line of 1m
shares traded at 630p.
Hanson, which closed marginally firmer at 200 1/2 p, saw a line of 8.5m
American Depositary Receipts - equivalent to 42.5m shares - traded at
Dollars 19.5.
British Aerospace fell 14 to 306p. Nomura Research pointed out to clients
the uncertainties over the company's cash position.
Shell Transport gave the best performance of the oil leaders, closing
another 5 ahead at 503p on good turnover of 4.8m, having responded to firmer
crude oil prices.
BP, on the other hand, slipped back 2 to 291p on 6.2m. There were stories in
the market that BP had increased its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices by
around 3 per cent and that Calor Group, a big supplier of bottled gas, may
not be able to pass on such a rise, thereby squeezing its profit margins.
Calor declined 4 to 206p on the rumours.
Lasmo staged a spirited recovery, moving up 5 to 228p on heavy turnover of
3m shares. Dealers noted a number of new year tips for the stock.
