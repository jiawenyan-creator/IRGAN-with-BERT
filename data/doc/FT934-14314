FT  18 OCT 93 / Foreign language drive launched
THE Department of Trade and Industry has launched a campaign to improve
British exporters' language skills after a survey found that a third of
small exporting companies had missed opportunities due to linguistic
barriers.
Only 4 per cent of Dutch companies had missed out for the same reason, while
in Spain, Germany and Denmark the figures were 18 per cent, 15 per cent and
14 per cent respectively, according to research by the Centre for
Information on Language Teaching and Research.
The campaign, launched by Sir Peter Parker, the former chairman of British
Rail, is setting up a National Business Language Information Service, which
will spread impartial information on language training and also offer advice
to companies that need help.
Other measures include a DTI-supported 'language audit' service to help
managers check their own linguistic capability; a British Overseas Trade
Board award for UK companies that show 'outstanding performance in the use
of languages for exports'; and a BBC television programme, to be broadcast
in April next year, which will be aimed at small and medium-sized
businesses.
