FT  31 MAR 93 / Israelis seal off occupied territories
ISRAEL'S inner security cabinet, responding to mounting public pressure to
crack down on Arab violence against Jews, voted yesterday to seal off the
occupied territories indefinitely.
The order will confine 2m Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -
many of whom earn their livelihood in Israel - to the territories.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin convened the inner cabinet after two policemen
were shot dead in a town 30 miles north of Tel Aviv, bringing the number of
Jews killed by Arabs in the past month to 13. It is not yet clear whether
the killers were residents of the territories or Israeli Arabs.
Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, the cabinet secretary, said additional measures would
be taken to enhance security around the country, but refused to elaborate.
The recent wave of violence, which began after 415 Palestinians were
expelled from the occupied territories in mid-December, has made Mr Rabin's
government - eager to revive stalled Middle East peace talks - increasingly
agitated.
Mr Roni Milo, the former police minister and a member of the opposition
right-wing Likud party, blamed the unrest on the new government's more
dovish policies. 'The compromising attitude, the attempt to tell the Israeli
public that if we make concessions, this will bring us peace and quiet - I
believe this is the root of the problem,' he said.
