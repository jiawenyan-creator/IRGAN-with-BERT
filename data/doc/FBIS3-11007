  [Text] People did not come out to vote yesterday the way 
they have in the last 15 years despite the fact there were over 
600 campaigns seeking votes. All the politicians' machinery 
proved ineffective when it came to getting voters motivated. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified person] I do not care if I 
did not vote. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Don't you care? 
  [Unidentified person] No. [end recording] 
  This woman was part of the 68 percent of the population who 
did not vote. If yesterday's elections are compared to those in 
the last 15 years, they represent a setback in voter turnout. 
From 4 million voters in 1978, we went to 5.5 million in 1982, 
nearly 7 million in 1986, over 7.5 million in 1990, and back to 
5.5 million yesterday. Political expert Hernando Gomez Buendia 
commented on this phenomenon. 
  [Begin Buendia recording] A high voter turnout is very 
dangerous because it signifies there is a big conflict and 
people feel threatened by a very serious decision to be made. It 
is normal to have a high abstention rate. In parliamentary 
elections in Colombia, Sunday's figure is not disastrous. [end 
recording] 
  In addition, few people voted yesterday because the 
Congress' 
image does not excite people. There is no faith in parties 
either; the ballots were confusing to many people, and it 
rained. Given these reasons, yesterday's election was not seen 
as a classical game of politics -- a games that fill the public 
stadiums -- but as a game played in the Olaya Stadium.
