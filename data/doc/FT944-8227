FT  21 NOV 94 / Markets: Managing China's emergence - Economic Eye
Two world wars and the great depression of the first half of the century
were caused by the failure to cope with the arrival of the US, Germany and
Japan. The impact of a re-invigorated China could be as disruptive.
Three considerations are relevant to assessing that impact: the scale and
nature of China's prospective economic interaction with the rest of the
world; the extent to which that interaction might be manipulated by the
Chinese government for political ends; and, finally, the degree to which the
economy will give China the basis for enhanced military power.
By 1992, mainland China had become the most important single developing
country in world merchandise trade, its two-way trade being Dollars 165.6bn
(see chart), which was 2.3 per cent of total world trade. But China's total
trade was behind that of Belgium, let alone the US, Germany or Japan.
Meanwhile, China's share of world trade in commercial services was less than
1 per cent. The combined trade of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong was Dollars
383.4bn, which put the 'Chinese economic area' above Italy. But this
includes trade among the three entities. Furthermore, the Chinese government
does not control Hong Kong's trade, let alone Taiwan's.
Between 1980 and 1992 the volume of China's exports expanded at an average
annual rate of 11.9 per cent, while the volume of US exports expanded at 3.8
per cent. If those rates of growth were maintained, China would become the
world's largest single exporter by 2015. China's exports could conceivably
grow this rapidly. But things would have to go perfectly, which is highly
unlikely.
Meanwhile, despite high rates of national saving, China is unlikely to be a
large exporter of capital for decades. China is, however, a large importer
of capital. By 1993, it had attracted almost Dollars 60bn in over 70,000
enterprises.
How far could the government manipulate China's growing presence in the
world economy for political ends?
China's most successful exports have been light manufactures. By 1992, for
example, it had become the world's largest exporter of clothing, which
accounted for 20 per cent of its exports. Yet China has no monopoly power in
such markets. It is its import market that gives it leverage, as does the
inward foreign investment. The value of these chips was made clear by
China's victory in its conflict with the US over renewal of most-favoured
nation treatment. They would also be effective in any struggle over trade
and the environment, or trade and labour standards.
A country's ability to use access to its import market as a weapon depends
on how significant imports are to its economy. The US derives leverage from
the fact that it is the world's largest trader, but has a fairly low ratio
of trade to GDP. Measured at market prices, China's economy is about as open
as that of France and twice as open as that of the US. Measured at
purchasing power parity, however, it is the least open of the economies
shown in the chart.
How is this to be interpreted? The low productivity services that bulk large
in GNP at PPP depend little on trade. But, without trade, rapid growth would
also be unfeasible. China is not dependent on trade if it is content to stay
poor, but it does need trade for rapid growth.
What about China's military potential? The economic bases of military power
are manpower, industrial output, technology, and the ability to divert
resources from civilian uses. The first China has in abundance. But its
industrial output is about 10 per cent of that of the US. Even if it were to
sustain growth at 10 per cent a year, it would take a generation for China
to match the US. Even then, the country's technological level is almost
certain to lag behind those of the US (and Japan).
Such lags might be still more important in determining relative military
capacity then than they are today. Finally, reform has itself been eroding
the government's capacity to obtain resources.
What are the conclusions? First, it should take at least 20 to 30 years
before China becomes a genuine superpower. Even then the US is likely to
remain more militarily capable and economically influential.
Second, even to achieve this China must sustain its performance of the past
15 years. But, as Susan Shirk points out in her important new book, it would
be wrong to assume the transition from communism to the market economy will
continue to go quite smoothly.* Among other problems, the opportunities for
wealth and influence now afforded to officials are themselves an important
obstacle to further reforms.
Finally, China's emergence needs to be managed intelligently. The most
important requirement is for the industrial countries to engage the Chinese
within international arrangements for whose principles they themselves show
respect. In that way, norms of civilised international living should be
incorporated within China, as a result of changes in its own laws.
Thus, even if last week's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum does not lead to free trade by 2020, the forum can play a valuable
role in bringing China closer to its neighbours. China should also be
accepted as a member of the World Trade Organisation provided it adopts
rule-based and transparent trade policies.
Finally, China already seems a more obvious candidate for the group of seven
leading industrial countries than Russia.
