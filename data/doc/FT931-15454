FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US wheat sale plan angers
Australia
AUSTRALIA REACTED angrily yesterday to US plans to sell 500,000 tonnes of
subsidised wheat to Pakistan under the Export Enhancement Program, which
Washington claims is intended to combat European Community export subsidies.
Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, said Australia intended to
register 'very strong concern and anger' with Washington, which also sold
800,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan in October. He said the US
decision had been made on the basis of incorrect information that Australia
would be unable to meet a Pakistani order for 600,000 tonnes of wheat
because of the effects of bad weather on the Australian crop.
Australia supported US attempts to reduce the distorting effect of EC export
subsidies and owed a debt to Washington for securing a breakthrough against
European opposition in the Uruguay Round talks on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, Mr Crean admitted. However, he said it 'makes no sense'
for the US to sell subsidised wheat to Pakistan because the EC was not a
significant alternative supplier.
Mr John Lawrenson, director of the Australian Wheat Board, said the deal was
'a cynical attempt by the US to capitalise on the current problems in the
Australian wheat harvest'.
He described the deal as 'needless, senseless blow to Australian wheat
farmers', which 'calls into question the US commitment to free trade and to
Australia's export earning capacity'.
The wheat board said recently that more than 40 per cent of the Australian
crop might have to be downgraded because of damage caused by severe weather
in late December. The board said sufficient milling wheat would be produced
to meet the Pakistani order, but it expected Pakistan to accept the offer of
cheaper US grain.
