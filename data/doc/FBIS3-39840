  [Text] A Swiss government minister has described as a 
catastrophe the decision by voters to accept a controversial 
proposal banning foreign lorries from driving through the Swiss 
Alps. 
  The economics minister, Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, said the 
electorate had acted like an ayatollah issuing a diktat. In an 
interview with the TAGES ANZEIGER newspaper, Mr. Delamuraz, a 
French speaker, attacked the Swiss Germans who voted 
overwhelmingly in favor of the Alpine initiative. He said the 
French-speaking population was fed up with being dictated to by 
a majority which did not appreciate that Switzerland's future 
lay in Europe. 
  The European Commission has said it will study the 
implications of the vote for Switzerland's future relations with 
the European Union. Under the initiative, all lorries making 
international journeys across the Alps will be forced onto the 
railways by the year 2004.
