  [Text] Following an invitation by Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev, who is in London on a visit, President Berisha 
was received at the Bulgarian Embassy in London this morning. 
  Presidents Berisha and Zhelev exchanged opinions on the 
conflict in former Yugoslavia and the relations with their 
southern neighbors. 
  Concerning bilateral relations between the two countries, 
both expressed the opinion that there are possibilities to 
encourage them further. 
  Today President Berisha also held a meeting with Jacques de 
Larosiere, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development [EBRD], and later with the board of bank directors. 
In his speech, Berisha gave a brief account of the economic 
reforms in Albania and stressed our country's needs and 
priorities, which cooperation with the EBRD can further 
strengthen. 
  In the presence of President Berisha, at the British Foreign 
and Commonwealth Office, bilateral agreements between Albania 
and Great Britain were signed -- an agreement on the 
encouragement and protection of investments, an agreement on air 
transportation, an agreement on tourism, and an agreement on 
education, science, and culture. These agreements were signed 
by Deputy Prime Minister Kopliku for the Albanian side, and, for 
the British side, by Douglas Hurd, secretary of state for 
foreign and commonwealth affairs. 
  After signing the agreements, President Berisha met with Mr. 
Hurd. At this meeting, Berisha again stressed that Albania is 
committed to further strengthening of cooperation with Great 
Britain. He also assured Mr. Hurd that Albania is a factor of 
stability in the region and that it will continue to work for 
stability there. 
  At 1500, 1600 Albanian time, as London is one hour ahead, 
President Berisha left London for home.
