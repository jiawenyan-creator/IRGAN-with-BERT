ASTRO PITCHER GETS OFF SCOTT FREE IN EYES OF HERSHISER, DODGERS 
Every time Mike Scott of the Houston Astros plays the Dodgers, the Dodgers give 
him a bad time and it just isn't fair. 
I heard that Orel Hershiser said Scott cheats. Hershiser has no right to malign 
Scott. Scott is a nice guy, but he doesn't flaunt it like Hershiser.
