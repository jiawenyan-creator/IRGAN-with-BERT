FT  26 NOV 92 / Observer: Lead-free
Time was when generals who ordered their troops not to waste bullets meant
only one thing: use their bayonets on the enemy instead. But those days of
gore are mercifully over, at least in Britain and the Netherlands.
For their armies, saving bullets is now a high-technology business thanks to
former world champion racing driver Jody Scheckter. After retiring from the
professional track in 1979, the South African set up a US company which has
just won contracts worth Pounds 53m from the UK and Dutch defence
ministries.
With the end of the cold war bringing cuts in military budgets, the
Georgia-based Firearms Training Systems company is to supply both countries
with combat-practice equipment that does away with the need to expend costly
conventional ammunition. Projectors are used to simulate a battle in which
the trainees fire at their targets with lasers.
How's that for a game of soldiers?
