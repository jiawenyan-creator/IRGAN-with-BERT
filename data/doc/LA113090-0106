IBM Joins European Research Project: Europe's semiconductor research project 
JESSI opened its doors to a U.S. firm -- IBM Europe -- for the first time ever. 
The Joint European Submicron Silicon group also agreed to formalize its ties to 
the U.S. semiconductor research program, Sematech, it said in a statement 
released in Munich, Germany. But JESSI plans to review the role of British 
International Computers Ltd. following that company's takeover by Fujitsu Ltd. 
of Japan. The move reflects a reluctance among some JESSI members to share 
technology with the Japanese. The $5-billion, eight-year JESSI project was set 
up in 1989 as part of the 19-nation Eureka high-technology research and 
development program.
