BRIEFLY 
Avon Pushed to Buy Back Stock: A group of powerful investors increased its 
pressure on the management of Avon Products Inc. to repurchase $500 million of 
its own shares. 
In a letter to the cosmetics company's chairman, James E. Preston, Chartwell 
Associates said the move would "enhance value for all shareholders." John Cox, 
a spokesman for the New York-based firm, said there was nothing new in the 
recommendation. Chartwell, a limited partnership that includes oil heir Gordon 
P. Getty's Family Trust, controls about 20% of Avon's stock.
