A REMARKABLE PASSAGE FOR INDIA 
India, the largest democracy, has completed another national election that 
appears to be a reasonably faithful reflection of the will of its 830 million 
people. This process, and the post-election statesmanship of the defeated 
leader, provide a model of responsible democratic government duplicated in few 
other developing nations. 
The corruption and violence that marred the voting in some areas must be 
regretted. But it is remarkable in many ways that there was not even greater 
violence in a nation of such overwhelming diversity, disparity, size and 
tension, where wealth and misery are in constant confrontation. 
Rajiv Gandhi will remain as head of the leading party, the Congress Party, 
which had ruled the nation since independence, save for a 30-month period. The 
defeat may not mean the end of the family dynasty established by his 
grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, and continued by his mother, Indira Gandhi, 
until her assassination in 1984. But for the moment, at least, there is the 
prospect of a tenuous coalition of smaller parties that will somehow seek to 
govern that complex nation. The work of the new prime minister, Vishwanath 
Pratap Singh, will be made no easier by the surge of strength on the part of a 
religiously oriented Hindu nationalist party. 
Gandhi has promised constructive opposition. And he has offered sound advice, 
appealing for a continuation of secular government in the tradition of Mohandas 
K. Gandhi and the other founding fathers, who foresaw the peril of religion 
mixed with the politics of a nation where religion historically has been the 
source of communal violence. The grace with which Gandhi has accepted defeat, 
and his counsel to those who now will try to govern, celebrate the democratic 
tradition of India.
