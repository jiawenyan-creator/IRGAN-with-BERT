FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Beckett backs Union proposals
MRS MARGARET BECKETT, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday gave belated public
support to Mr John Smith's proposals for the party's links with the unions,
Philip Stephens writes.
In an attempt to patch up the rift before today's crucial conference debate
on one-member-one-vote, Mrs Beckett was persuaded to give a batch of
television interviews to stress that she backed his stance.
But her comments, which followed several days of apparent equivocation,
failed to convince senior colleagues that she had healed the breach with Mr
Smith.
Mrs Beckett, who is sponsored by one of the main opponents of
one-member-one-vote, the TGWU general union, was privately accused of
putting her own political interests ahead of those of the leader and shadow
cabinet. Senior colleagues said that she might be vulnerable to a challenge
for her post next year, although Mr Smith's aides rejected the idea that he
was ready to withdraw his support.
