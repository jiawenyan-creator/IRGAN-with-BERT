FT  19 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Regional Jet orders give Shorts Pounds 70m
boost
SHORTS, the Belfast subsidiary of Canada's Bombardier, has won up to Pounds
70m of fuselage work for the Canadair Regional Jet aircraft following this
week's announcement of two big orders from Air Canada and Utah-based SkyWest
Airlines.
Air Canada has ordered 24 50-seat Regional Jets from Bombardier worth more
than CDollars 400m (Pounds 205m), with deliveries stretched from May 1994 to
June 1996. The airline has taken options on another 24 aircraft.
SkyWest, a Delta Air Lines connector, said it had placed a USDollars 170m
(Pounds 114m) order for 10 Regional Jets with a further 10 options.
Deliveries are due to start in January.
If the options are taken up it could mean three years' work for Shorts on
the jet programme.
Since its acquisition by Bombardier in 1989, Shorts has doubled turnover,
increased jobs and turned losses into significant profits. It will soon
begin making the complete fuselage of the Learjet 45.
Air Canada has offered to buy rival Canadian Airlines' international
business for CDollars 200m and assume CDollars 800m of debt and lease
obligations for three 747-400s and five 767s, Robert Gibbens reports.
Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman of Canadian Airlines and its parent PWA, labelled
the offer 'outrageous'.
