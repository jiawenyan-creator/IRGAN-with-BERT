SCHWAN SHAKES LOOSE TO HELP WESTLAKE END SIMI VALLEY STREAK AT 31 
This week will be known as the week of broken streaks. 
On Monday, Rio Mesa High ended Buena's 24-game winning streak in the Channel 
League, and Friday night it was Westlake's turn to end an even longer one -- 
Simi Valley's hold on the Marmonte League that spanned 31 games. 
Even before tip-off, Westlake Coach Greg Hess recognized the setting's portent. 
"I think the chemistry is right tonight," Hess said. "This is Friday the 13th 
and their streak is 31, with the numbers and everything we are ready. I wonder 
if the moon is out tonight." 
The moon, chemistry and omens aside, Westlake received 23 points and 12 
rebounds from 6-9 center Kurt Schwan to lead the Warriors past Simi Valley, 
71-56, sending the Pioneers to their first league defeat since 1986. The 
victory moved Westlake (10-6, 3-1) into a second-place tie with Simi Valley 
(11-6, 3-1). 
After Simi Valley grabbed a 12-10 first-quarter lead, Schwan, held scoreless in 
the first 8 minutes, scored 10 points to help Westlake take a 31-26 halftime 
lead. 
Westlake continued to set the pace in the third quarter as Schwan and forward 
Mike Waggoner each scored 6 points to help open a 49-35 lead. 
Simi Valley looked finished when Westlake assumed a 54-35 lead early in the 
fourth quarter, but the Pioneers showed their first signs of life after a 
timeout and battled back on the strength of a full-court press. 
The Pioneers outscored the Warriors, 12-1, to cut Westlake's lead to 55-47 with 
3:30 left, but the Warriors made 10 of 12 free throws to seal the victory. 
Simi Valley Coach Dean Bradshaw seemed to take the loss in stride. 
"Eventually all things must come to an end," he said. "We would have liked to 
remain undefeated, but we are still in control in league play." 
Steve Carnes paced Simi Valley with 17 points and Mike Wawryk came off the 
bench to add 10 points and grab 6 rebounds. 
Chris Coffey scored 16 points and Peter Mladina added 12 for Westlake. 
Hess credited the win to team preparation and defense. 
"It was our psycho 'D' that made us successful tonight," he said. "The guys 
were prepared and we did what we wanted to do." 
The win was Westlake's fourth in 17 games against Simi Valley.
