  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 10 (CNA) -- A delegation of mainland 
Chinese news media leaders arrived in Taiwan Monday [10 January] 
afternoon for a 10-day visit, marking the second formal visit of 
a mainland news delegation to Taiwan. 
  While here, the group will meet with Taiwan's news media 
leaders and travel around the island to learn more about Taiwan. 
  The nine-member group is led by Nan Zhenzhong, vice 
president 
and editor in-chief of the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA), and 
includes the editors-in-chief of the ECONOMIC DAILY, the 
GUANGMING DAILY, and the English-language CHINA DAILY. 
  Also traveling with the seven news professionals are two 
members of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS), a semi-official body set up to facilitate 
cross-Taiwan Strait contacts. 
  The visit was arranged by ARATS Taiwan counterpart, the 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). 
  The cross-strait exchange of news personnel is one of 
several 
agreements reached between SEF and ARATS during a series of 
meetings held last year. 
  Under the agreement, SEF is planning a reciprocal visit of 
news professionals to the mainland. The Taiwan delegation is 
expected to make the trip in March.
