  [Text] Our correspondent in Holy Mecca reported a few 
moments ago that the esteemed leader's Hajj headquarters is 
still surrounded by the Saudi police force. We draw your 
attention to this report: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Today, the Saudi soldiers 
deployed special commandoes outside the headquarters gate to 
prevent headquarters staff and other visitors from entering. 
Thanks to implementation of this order, staff of the esteemed 
leader's Hajj headquarters have been compelled to remain inside 
the building. 
  The Saudi police, after hours of controlling the comings and 
goings and preventing the arrival and exit of individuals from 
the headquarters, permitted individuals to come and go for a few 
hours at 1930 hours local time yesterday evening. Movement in 
and out of the headquarters was banned again at midday today. 
Saudi military helicopters also resumed reconnaissance flights 
and air maneuvers over the headquarters building starting at 
midday today. The Saudi security officials are videotaping the 
esteemed leader's headquarters and anybody coming in or going 
out.
