FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Reduction for Maxwell pensioners
MORE THAN 4,000 Maxwell pensioners are to see their pension payments cut
after June this year. The pensioners may suffer falls in income of a half to
three-quarters.
These are the first people to be told of reductions in their pensions as a
result of the Pounds 450m shortfall in the various Maxwell pension schemes
discovered after the death of Mr Robert Maxwell, the publisher, last
November.
A similar number of people who have not yet retired will see the value of
their deferred pensions fall as well. The people affected are the 8,500
members of the Maxwell Communication Works Pension Scheme (MWS) who have
never worked for Mirror Group Newspapers. Another 2,500 members of the
scheme who have worked for MGN will not be affected.
MGN became responsible for the MWS scheme in 1989 when pension schemes from
nearly 90 companies, nearly all engaged in the printing industry, were
consolidated into one scheme. MGN became the 'principal employer' for the
scheme, although only about 800 of the members were working for MGN at the
time.
The MWS scheme had assets of Pounds 155m but a substantial proportion of the
schemes assets were diverted, leaving a small fraction of the total. Since
the losses were discovered MGN has been financing the pension payments.
However, MGN says it can no longer afford to finance these payments without
jeopardising the pensions of its own employees.
MGN said yesterday it would institute an appeals procedure and open a
telephone hotline for pensioners who feel they have been wrongly excluded.
The MWS scheme will continue to pay reduced pensions from its remaining
assets and any assets recovered will go towards making up those shortfalls.
MGN said pensioners would be entitled to the state guaranteed minimum
pensions.
