FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Environmental side lifts Rentokil
RENTOKIL GROUP, the environmental services and property care concern,
yesterday continued to live up to its promise of delivering at least 20 per
cent growth in profits and earnings by reporting a 27 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 74.7m to Pounds 94.6m, for 1991.
Profits were boosted by strong growth from environmental services, which
contributed Pounds 87.6m (Pounds 62.6m), more than offsetting the decline
from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 5.41m in property profits.
Earnings per share rose to 15.59p (12.22p). Sales totalled Pounds 389m
(Pounds 309m).
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said Rentokil could continue to grow at
this pace because of the worldwide demand for its environmental services.
Sales grew faster outside the UK. While turnover was up 10 per cent in the
UK to Pounds 166.4m (Pounds 151m) it was up 22 per cent in North America at
Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 35m); 40 per cent in Europe at Pounds 112m (Pounds
79.7m) and 57 per cent in Asia, Pacific and Africa at Pounds 68m (Pounds
43.3m).
Year end net cash was Pounds 27.2m after acquisitions costing Pounds 43.6m.
A final dividend of 2.9p makes a total of 4.23p compared to 3.3p. A share
split is also proposed.
