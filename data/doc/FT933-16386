FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Tigers with eastern promise
NAMES full of dragons and tigers paint an exotic, rather threatening picture
of unit trusts investing in south-east Asia - but their performance over the
past decade has earned them a rather more friendly image with many private
investors.
Those dealing in the Far East excluding Japan - principally Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and the
Philippines - have outperformed the average of unit trusts over every period
up to 10 years.
For example, the average growth of funds in the sector over seven years is
254.7 per cent, but the average for other unit trusts over the same period
is 80.9 per cent.
Over five years, all but one of the funds in the sector has done better than
the average of other unit trusts over the same period. Funds invested in the
Far East including Japan have not done quite as well.
The reason is that most of the economies in the region have been
concentrating on industrialisation and development, and growing much faster
than those in the west.
Even though growth has slowed in some countries on the Pacific rim, others -
such as China - have started to boom and the region as a whole shows no sign
of running out of steam. Once recovery takes hold in the west and Japan, the
export-orientated economies of south-east Asia should benefit, too.
'It is difficult to believe that there is anywhere that is as attractive,'
says Peter Chesterfield, Far East director for Abbey Unit Trusts. 'I think
the returns will continue to please.'
Adaline Ko, who manages the South East Asia Growth fund for Save &amp; Prosper,
adds: 'We are still very positive on the region. We feel it is one of the
fastest-growing parts of the world, especially during a recession in the
western world and Japan.'
Many of the region's markets are still classified as emerging markets. They
are in developing countries where the stock market might be small and not
regulated as carefully as in more developed nations. It might not be as
liquid, either. Such markets are seen as riskier - but the rewards can be
high.
The region also has some well established markets, such as Hong Kong and
Singapore. But established markets are no guarantee of stability: the Hong
Kong stock exchange can be particularly volatile.
Unit trusts investing in the Far East usually are either single-country or
regional funds. The former can give high returns if the country's stock
market is going through a boom period, but they can underperform regional
indices seriously during bad patches.
Past performance is no guide to future performance. Take Providence
Capitol's Thailand fund, which was the best performer over the past year,
growing by a very healthy 68.1 per cent.
Over two and three years, though, it languished at 41 and 42 out of around
50 in the performance tables.
Hong Kong-dominated funds had a bad time last year, slipping from the top of
the rankings to the middle. Gartmore's Hong Kong fund is an extreme example
 -it is the best performer in the sector over two, three, five and 10 years,
and second-best over seven years - but it plummeted to 30th over the past
year.
Regional funds can spread the risk more evenly between different countries,
and managers can change the weighting given to each country in the fund
depending on their view of its economy and stock market growth prospects.
Here, a good manager's performance can be more consistent, within the
constraints of the markets as a whole. The drawback is that the diffusion of
risk means these funds cannot take as much advantage of a spectacular rise
in any single market.
Funds in this sector aim to maximise long-term capital growth rather than
provide income. Dividend yields in this area are fairly low, except in the
Hong Kong market.
The usual advice to private investors is to put only a small portion of
their portfolio into a Pacific region fund. Although the markets can produce
good short-term gains, their greater volatility means that a longer-term
approach is the most prudent.
The Chinese economy, for instance, is felt to be overheated at present, and
any cooling measures taken by the Beijing government may have an impact on
sentiment in Hong Kong, where most of the funds have a large proportion of
their holdings. But this should be a temporary setback.
'Although we are happy in the long term, it is not necessarily going to be
smooth all through the years. Occasionally, there will be slow-downs,' says
Ko.
'The problem is that, at this stage, we really cannot say whether China will
come down for a very hard landing or a milder one.'
Simon Nicholson, of Gartmore, adds: 'In general, if you have got a strong
constitution, you should have some money in the Far East. You have got to
have the guts to sit on the tiger and ride it. If the market falls, you
should do a bit more and sit it out.'
Another reason for going into any unit trust with a long-term view is the
initial charge, generally about 5 to 6 per cent of the amount invested: you
need to stay in the fund long enough to recoup your money. Annual charges
are in the 1-2 per cent range.
Unit trusts in this sector do not qualify for full Pep investment, which
means that a maximum of Pounds 1,500 can be put into them using a Pep.
The minimum investment in most of the funds is Pounds 1,000, but some also
offer saving schemes for smaller or more cautious investors.
These start at Pounds 20 a month for the Gartmore Hong Kong fund, Pounds 35
with Save &amp; Prosper, or Pounds 50 a month for the Fidelity South East Asia
fund.
