ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 
COUNCIL ACTS TO BUY 1.3 ACRES AT DEPOT 
The City Council moved this week to purchase property at the city's Amtrak dpot 
for $1 million. 
The 1.3 acres will be leased to one or more businesses interested in selling 
food, gifts, periodicals and other items to train travelers, said Terry 
Swindle, the city's real property agent. 
On Tuesday, the council approved paying $1 million to settle a pending lawsuit 
over purchase of the property. 
Up to $800,000 of the $1 million will be paid by the state. The city estimates 
it will pay about $290,000 for the remaining costs, legal fees and interest. 
Fullerton is negotiating with a local company to provide services at the 
station on Santa Fe Avenue east of Harbor Boulevard. TOM MCQUEENEY
