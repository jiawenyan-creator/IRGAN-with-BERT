FT  23 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): Band has hard act to follow at
Premier Group
After a long search for a new chairman, the Premier Group, one of South
Africa's largest and most successful food and retailing corporations has
announced that Doug Band, currently chief executive of media group Argus
Holdings, will take over from January 1, writes Mark Suzman.
Band will be replacing current chairman and chief executive Peter Wrighton,
who retires at 60. The new managing director will be Gordon Utian, Premier's
longstanding deputy md.
Wrighton's departure after seven years at the helm will mark something of a
break in the South African business scene; he will be a hard act to follow.
He is one of the most widely respected business leaders in the country by
both the stockbroking community, which has watched him lead Premier to 63
per cent compound growth over the past four years, and by the African
National Congress which has approvingly noted his enlightened approach on
hiring black managers and accommodating workers' demands.
By contrast, his successor has, since 1989, been running the Argus group
which recently sold its newspaper interests to Independent Newspapers. He
will stay on until the restructuring of Argus resulting from the sale is
complete while assuming the vice-chair of Premier from July 1. He has a
previous association with Premier from when he was chief executive of retail
and music group CNA/Gallo, in which both Premier and Argus have interests.
'My strength is in retailing and wholesaling. That's what I'll bring to
Premier,' he says.
