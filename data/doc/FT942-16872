FT  08 APR 94 / Council tax bands for 2m homes may be wrong
Two million properties in England and Wales may have been placed in the
wrong council tax band, the National Audit Office says today.
Its figures suggest that 10 per cent of households are paying the wrong
level of tax, with 900,000 homes overvalued, and 1.1m paying too little. The
figures are based on a survey of the real purchase prices of 12,000 banded
properties which changed hands about three years ago - the date on which
valuations were based.
The NAO figures appear to support the 914,000 claims to change bandings
which had been lodged by the formal deadline at the end of November. Only
261,000 cases had been settled by the end of February.
According to the report by Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and
auditor-general, the Valuation Office - an agency accountable to the
Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office - is aiming to have
cleared up 730,000 claims by the end of this year, 21 months after the
households concerned first started paying council tax. The remaining 184,000
properties will be dealt with 'as quickly as possible' in 1995, says the
report.
An incorrect banding can cost a household as much as Pounds 200 a year. The
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy says the average tax
for band G homes in England (valued between Pounds 160,000 and Pounds
320,000 in April 1991) is Pounds 967, while occupants of band H homes
(valued over Pounds 320,000) must pay Pounds 1,161.
Bandings are more accurate for cheaper houses, but mistakes at this level
can also be expensive for households. The difference in council tax between
bands C and D, the two most common bands covering houses valued between
Pounds 39,000 and Pounds 66,000, is Pounds 64 on average.
Sir John also found that competitive tendering for valuers' contracts had
saved the Valuation Office between Pounds 3.9m and Pounds 4.5m in England
alone.
The council tax was introduced in April last year to replace the community
charge, or poll tax. The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation, the
professional organisation for valuers, said mistakes had been made due to
the tight one-year schedule for setting bands. It said: 'The main priority
was to replace the poll tax as quickly as possible.'
In a separate development, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary,
yesterday confirmed that three Labour-controlled councils -
Langbaurgh-on-Tees, Sheffield, and Slough in Berkshire - will be required to
reduce their council tax levels by cutting budgets.
