<F P=106> [Statement by the Amal Movement's leadership on 27 </F>
February-- read by announcer] 
  [Excerpt] The movement's leadership denounces the appalling 
massacre committed by Israel and its agents against our people 
worshipping at Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. It 
believes that this crime is a new link in the chain of Israel's 
daily acts of aggression against our people in occupied 
Palestine and south Lebanon. The movement's leadership stresses 
that the pattern of mass murders is uniquely perfected and 
practiced by Israel, and what happened a few days ago at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and today in Sayyidat al-Najat Church 
are the best proof of this. [passage omitted]
