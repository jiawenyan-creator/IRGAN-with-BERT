FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament deals double blow to Russian sell-off
THE Russian parliament delivered a double blow to the government's
privatisation programme yesterday, suspending a presidential decree central
to the process and annulling a parliamentary law on the sale of state
companies.
Mr Anatoli Chubais, privatisation minister, said the action would 'deal a
blow to millions of people involved in (privatisation)'.
The presidential decree, issued in May, made it compulsory for all state
companies to sell a minimum 29 per cent stake at auctions when going
private. The decree helped boost the value of the privatisation vouchers
issued to all Russian citizens but was opposed by factory directors.
Mr Chubais predicted the parliament's ruling could hurt investor confidence
in the vouchers and precipitate a drop in their value.
The decree also required all small-scale privatisation to be completed by
August 1, a clause western advisers described as one of the most important
catalysts in the highly successful small-scale privatisation process.
Mr Jamie Hamilton, a consultant at the International Finance Corporation,
the private sector arm of the World Bank which has advised the Russian
government on privatisation, said: 'This will be an excuse for vast regions
of Russia to stop privatising.'
About 51,000, a third to a half of small-scale enterprises, have been
privatised.
By suspending part of its legislation on privatisation, the parliament
transferred responsibility for the privatisation process from the liberal
state property committee to the conservative sectoral ministries.
'This is another revanchist attempt by the parliament to destroy the reform
it dislikes most - privatisation,' said Mr Chubais, who stormed out of the
hall in protest.
