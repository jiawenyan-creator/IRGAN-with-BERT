FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Coal contracts too short term
Sir, Michael Smith ('Private bidders' dash for coal', October 13) rightly
points out how critical the future market for coal will be to the success of
the preferred bidders.
By its very nature, coalmining needs long-term investment if it is to
thrive. But investors expect a degree of certainty and, looking ahead, we
see precious little of it.
RJB Mining is effectively set to take over the remaining English coal
fields, and with them the bulk of contracts to supply power generators. But
what will happen when these five-year contracts expire in 1998? In our view,
10 or 15-year contracts are needed and unless these can be negotiated it is
difficult to see there being any incentive for RJB Mining to put in the
long-term investment the industry needs.
Without the certainty of such contracts, we fear there may be a temptation
to focus on immediate high value production at the expense of assets which
need longer-term investment in order to be realised. This may be profitable
in the short term, but is it really the best way of meeting the country's
future energy needs?
