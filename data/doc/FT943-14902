FT  12 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa edges ahead
Johannesburg concluded a slow session generally higher amid support from a
firmer gold price although the strength of the financial rand capped gains.
After losing initially, the overall index added 14 to 5,419, industrials
gained 12 to 6,261 and gold put on 16 to 2,076.
