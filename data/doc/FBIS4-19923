<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Pangalos </F>
Underlines the Importance of a Convergence of Efforts in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] After the latest bloody events and the ongoing 
attacks on Gorazde by the Bosnian Serbs, the European Union 
should carefully reconsider what it can do in the future to 
contribute, in spite of all, to providing a solution to the 
Bosnian conflict. Meanwhile, absolute priority must be given to 
"saving what it is possible to save." Thus, Council President 
Mr. Pangalos summarized at Wednesday [20 April] morning's debate 
in the European Parliament the latest tragic developments in 
Bosnia. 
  Mr. Pangalos affirmed once again that the solution to the 
conflict could only be political and that reaching such a 
solution requires a convergence of all initiatives (European 
Union, UN, Russia, United States). The warring parties are 
trying to take advantage of the divergences in the international 
community to pursue their objectives. According to Mr. 
Pangalos, the only realistic solution would be a partitioning of 
Bosnia, with 59 percent for the Muslims and Croats and 41 
percent for the Serbs. While all were very critical of the 
international community and the European Union in particular, 
MEP's were divided on how to solve the conflict. [passage 
omitted] 
  Mr. Pangalos said Mr. Yeltsin's recent declarations asking 
the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde were of capital 
importance and opened new political prospects. To those 
comparing this war to the Gulf conflict, Mr. Pangalos replied 
that, for geographical and military reasons, the same type of 
interventions could not be envisaged in ex-Yugoslavia. He also 
noted that no one would voluntarily send "thousands and 
thousands" of troops to Bosnia.
