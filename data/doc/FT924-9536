FT  05 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
POLITICAL worries ahead of last night's outcome of the vote on the
Maastricht treaty led to cautious trading in stock index futures, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,740, the December contract on the FT-SE Index was soon
driven lower by independent traders to 2,725 on the nervousness.
With many of the large institutions choosing to stay on the sidelines,
December traded sporadically in a tight range of 2,725 and 2,735 until the
afternoon.
The poor opening on Wall Street, along with weakness in sterling, sent the
contract falling to the day's low of 2,715. A period of sharp swings then
ensued before December closed at 2,728, up 14 from Tuesday's close and some
17 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 17
points. The futures once again traded at a healthy premium throughout the
day, though volume was a poor 6,130 by the official close.
Asda was the most actively dealt stock option and saw turnover of 6,948
contracts. That total included a single trade in which one seller sold 1,000
contracts of the January 45 calls at 5p. This was followed by Trafalgar
House with a total of 1,782 lots, and by ICI at 1,358 contracts.
The total number of option trades by the close reached 29,714, slightly
ahead of Tuesday's figure, although yesterday's turnover of 6,586 lots in
the FT-SE 100 option was poor.
