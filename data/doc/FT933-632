FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sykes shares drop on profit warning
SHARES in Andrews Sykes fell by 30p to 75p yesterday after the specialist
industrial services group confirmed that first-half results would be
'significantly below those of last year', and said it would omit the interim
dividend and defer payment of the preference dividend.
In addition the group, which last year fought off an attempt by Mr Jacques
Murray, the dissident shareholder who holds a 29.2 per cent stake in the
group, to unseat Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and take control of the board,
announced that Mr Peter Webber, chief executive, had stepped down.
Mr David Martin, until recently chief executive of James Neill Holdings,
will succeed Mr Webber who has resigned with effect from November 1.
In a statement explaining the move the group said that considerable progress
had been made over the last two years in integrating the two businesses
brought together to form Andrews Sykes.
In a separate trading statement the group warned that 'an early appraisal of
the second quarter's results' had confirmed that turnover in the main
Andrews Sykes operations had been disappointingly low and therefore the
results would be significantly below last time.
As a result the board had decided to conserve cash and distributable
reserves by omitting the interim dividend and deferring payment of the
preference dividend due in December.
