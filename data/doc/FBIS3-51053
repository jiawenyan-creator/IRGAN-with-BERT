  [Text] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco on 4 January 
named General Nilton Moreira Rodrigues, commander of the 6th 
Military Region based in Salvador, as superintendent of the 
Sudene [Northeast Development Superintendency]. Moreira 
Rodrigues replaces Cassio Cunha Lima, who left the post in order 
to run in the upcoming elections. Moreira Rodrigues met for 
three hours on 4 January with acting Regional Integration 
Minister General Romildo Canhim, who, together with Senator 
Costa (PFL-MA [Liberal Front Party-Maranhao State]), was 
responsible for the naming of Moreira Rodrigues. 
  In the meeting with Canhim and Sudene Deputy Superintendent 
Eliezer Menezes dos Santos, Moreira Rodrigues was handed a 
detailed summary of Sudene's tasks, which include Finor 
(Northeast Investment Fund), the region's projects, and the 
Northeast Constitutional Fund, which is administrated by the 
Bank of the Northeast. On 5 January, Moreira Rodrigues will 
return to Salvador, where he will hand over the 6th Military 
Region. 
  After he is installed as the head of Sudene, which will take 
place some time next week, the general will move to Recife, 
where the organization has its headquarters.
