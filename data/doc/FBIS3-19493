`Relatively Free and Balanced' -- EP Delegation"; as released by 
Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] An EP [European Parliament] delegation led by Mr. 
Robles Piquer (Sp. EPP), in a report on the 7 March elections in 
Kazakhstan, said that they had been "relatively free and 
balanced." According to the report, "despite the limited 
plurality of the candidates, and a number of technical 
irregularities," there had not been, in these elections, 
"large-scale fraud." This assessment is different to that of 
other observers, and in particular that of the CSCE 
Parliamentary Assembly.
