  [Text] According to new legislation, approximately 1.2 
million farm workers have the right to join trade unions and to 
negotiate better service conditions. According to a spokesman 
for COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], the 
legislation follows a long struggle with the South African 
Agricultural Union [SAAU] and the government. The struggle was 
partly won last year after COSATU and Nactu [National Council of 
Trade Unions] forced the SAAU and the government to, among 
others things, extend the law on basic service conditions to the 
agricultural sector. Negotiations on the introduction of labor 
courts are still continuing. 
  [Begin COSATU spokesman Mike Madlala recording in English] 
Farm workers would now be in a position to bargain with their 
own employers, and if there is a deadlock on whatever bargaining 
that is taking place there will be procedures that would guide 
both parties as to what do they have to do in such events. [end 
recording] 
  A spokesman for the SAAU welcomed the legislation and said 
that for the first time there are official deadlock-breaking 
mechanisms.
