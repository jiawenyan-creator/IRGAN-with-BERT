IN BRIEF; 
AT&amp;T BID EXPECTED FOR BRITISH GE 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is expected to take part in a planned 
consortium bid for General Electric Co. PLC of Britain, a respected financial 
daily reported today. 
Analysts said, however, that GEC's defenses against a consortium takeover bid 
was strengthened by its announcement Friday of a merger with the U.S.-based 
General Electric Co. of their European consumer products, medical equipment and 
some electrical divisions. 
The Financial Times reported that AT&amp;T is expected to confirm its 
participation in the dramatic bid for GEC this week following weekend 
negotiations with Lazard Brothers investment firm. 
The Financial Times and other newspapers also reported that the British 
electronics firm Plessey Co. PLC made a bid to acquire GPT, an electronics 
company it jointly owns with GEC, citing a broken agreement between the two 
companies. 
GEC, which itself has made a $3-billion bid with West Germany's Siemens AG for 
Plessey, said it will fight to keep its share of GPT, reports in The Guardian 
and Financial Times said. 
In the United States, AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy declined to comment on 
the reports.
