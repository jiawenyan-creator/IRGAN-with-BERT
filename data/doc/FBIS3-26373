  [Text] Ningbo, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Ningbo, one of 
China's open coastal cities, in Zhejiang Province, has developed 
into a key petrochemical production base. 
  The city has made full use of its natural deepwater port to 
house large modern petrochemical plants, including the Zhenhai 
Petrochemical Joint Enterprise and the Zhejiang Pacific Ocean 
Chemical Company Ltd. 
  One of China's 500 largest industrial enterprises, the 
Zhenhai plant now has an annual processing capacity of seven 
million tons of crude oil, as well as 300,000 tons of synthetic 
ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea. 
  The provincial and city governments and the China

tons this year. 
  In addition, Ningbo has opened an petroleum futures market 
specially for these petrochemical enterprises.
