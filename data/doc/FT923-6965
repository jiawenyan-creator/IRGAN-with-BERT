FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
Presumably not even the chancellor will use yesterday's GDP figures to
herald the end of the recession. The tiny rise in non-oil output is well
within the margin of error, and the contrast with July's retail sales
figures is illuminating. It seems clear that those retailers who stocked up
in anticipation of a post-election recovery have had to cut prices heavily
to move goods. The prospect now is for another round of destocking moving
back up the manufacturing chain, and the economy may well shrink in the
third quarter. Ford's decision to move Dagenham to short-time working may be
mostly related to weakness in the continental car market, but it also seems
likely that August car sales in the UK will be disappointing.
Further out, there seems little to tempt the consumer from his shell. High
real interest rates, fear of unemployment and falling house prices are still
powerful restraints. Added to that, today's broad money supply figures may
well point to low growth - or even no growth - next year.
