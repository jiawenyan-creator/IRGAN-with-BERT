 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable
flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses on certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies,
and modification or replacement, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracks and broken spokes found
on certain main wheel assemblies of these airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to 
prevent loss of a main wheel assembly during takeoff or landing.
