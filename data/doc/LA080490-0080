Florence Arthaud, a 33-year-old Frenchwoman, set a record for a solo sailboat 
crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by nearly two days. 
Arthaud arrived at Lizard Point in southwestern Britain in the pre-dawn hours 
after a voyage of 9 days 21 hours 42 minutes, said Louis Bodin, a friend of 
Arthaud's who helped guide her across the Atlantic. 
Arthaud set out from New York July 24 aboard the 60-foot trimaran Pierre 
Premier. The previous record of 11 days 11 hours and 47 minutes was set by 
Bruno Peyron of France aboard a catamaran in 1987.
