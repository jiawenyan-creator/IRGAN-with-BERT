APPLE COMPUTER'S PROFIT RISES 49% IN FOURTH QUARTER 
Apple Computer Inc.'s earnings rose 49% in the latest quarter, mainly because 
of a gain from selling its stock in Adobe Systems Inc., the company said 
Friday. 
Operating income before the Adobe gain and taxes and interest rose by a 
narrower 2%. 
Chairman John Sculley said the company was recovering from a squeeze on profit 
margins caused by high component costs. Apple was faulted for buying large 
quantities of computer chips at unusually high prices during a temporary 
shortage last year. 
Apple's fourth-quarter earnings, including an after-tax gain of $48 million 
from the Adobe sale, were $161.1 million, up from $107.9 million a year 
earlier. Revenue rose to $1.38 billion from $1.17 billion.
