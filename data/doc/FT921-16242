FT  04 JAN 92 / Call to speed up planning decisions
LOCAL authorities were urged to speed up their handling of planning
applications yesterday following evidence that their record continues to
fall well short of the government's target.
The proportion of decisions taken within eight weeks in the April to June
period last year was, at 60 per cent, a significant improvement on the 52
per cent a year earlier, and 48 per cent in the corresponding period of
1989.
However, it remained far below the target set by the government that
authorities should make a decision on 80 per cent of applications within
eight weeks.
The number of planning applications received by authorities between April
and June last year fell by 6 per cent compared with the same period in 1990,
but the number of decisions taken also fell by 11 per cent.
Commenting on the statistics published yesterday, Mr Tim Yeo, environment
minister, said that he was encouraged by the latest performance figures,
which showed that the trend towards quicker planning decisions was
contin-uing.
'But there remains much room for improvement,' he said.
'There has been a steady and significant fall in the number of planning
applications in recent quarters - the April-June 1991 figure of 137,000
compares with a peak of 178,000 in the January-March quarter of 1989 - but
performance has not improved as much as I would have expected in these
circumstances.
'Moreover, the average of 60 per cent of decisions within eight weeks
conceals a very wide range of performance between the consistently best- and
worst-performing authorities.
'This degree of variation is a cause for concern, especially where local
planning pressures appear similar.'
Mr Yeo urged local authorities to take advantage of the fall in the number
of new applications to speed up their handling of cases, and to ensure that
their management of the development control process was as efficient as
possible.
