COLLEGE TO RAISE FEES FOR PARKING 
The Santa Monica College Board of Trustees voted this week to double fees for 
on-campus parking from $20 per semester to $40, beginning in the spring 
semester, to help finance parking structures now being built. 
"The district cannot afford not to do this," college President Richard Moore 
said. 
The higher fees, he said, will enable the college to repay what it borrowed 
from the state to build the parking structures. Even with the rate increase -- 
which will affect students, faculty and staff -- the college district will have 
to pay about $250,000 of the cost of the structures, Moore said. 
Students who participate in the college's Rideshare program and car-pool with 
at least two other students will be guaranteed on-campus parking and will pay 
only $20 per semester. 
Financial aid recipients will also pay $20 per semester. Rates for the summer 
session will be half the regular semester rates.
