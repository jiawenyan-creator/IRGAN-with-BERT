Final rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document amends Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adjudication regulations concerning diseases subject
to presumptive service connection in former prisoners of war by stating that the statutory term ``beriberi heart
disease'' includes ischemic heart disease in former prisoners of war who had experienced localized edema during
captivity. The effect of this amendment is to broaden VA's interpretation of that term based upon new epidemiological
evidence.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1970, Congress passed Public Law 91376, 3, 84 Stat. 787, 788 (1970), which established a presumption
of service connection for seven categories of diseases and conditions, including ``beriberi (including beriberi
heart disease),'' developing to a ten-percent degree of disability at any time after active service in the case of
a veteran held as a prisoner of war in World War II, the Korean Conflict, or the Vietnam War who suffered from dietary
deficiencies, forced labor, or inhumane treatment in violation of the Geneva Conventions. The intent of Congress
was to recognize diseases suffered by former prisoners of war during captivity for which there is no medical documentation.


Concern remained, however, as to the problems encountered by these veterans in their efforts to prove service connection
for disabilities attributable to the conditions of their capture and imprisonment. Some claimed that their ability
to prove service connection for disabilities was hampered because there are inadequate medical records and that
certain disabilities which were considered to be minor at the time of release from service were becoming more serious.
Congress therefore enacted the Former Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 1981, Public Law 9737, 95 Stat. 935, which
eliminated the requirement that former prisoners of war must have suffered from dietary deficiencies, forced labor,
or inhumane treatment during confinement in order to qualify for the presumption of service connection.
Beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Early thiamine deficiency is characterized
by anorexia, irritability, and weight loss. Later, patients experience weakness, peripheral neuropathy, headache,
and tachycardia. Advanced thiamine deficiency presents with involvement of two major organ systems predominantly:
the cardiovascular system (the syndrome known as ``wet beriberi,'' i.e., beriberi heart disease) and the nervous
system, both central and peripheral (known as ``dry beriberi'').

In 1992, the Medical Follow-up Agency of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, issued a study entitled
``The Health of Former Prisoners of War'' which reported the results of a medical examination survey of former World
War II and Korean Conflict POWs and comparable control groups. That study found what it termed a noteworthy association
between ischemic heart disease and earlier reporting of localized edema of feet, ankles and legs_presumably due
to beriberi heart disease (wet beriberi)_while in captivity. While there is no known satisfactory explanatory biological
mechanism linking beriberi or malnutrition and subsequent chronic heart disease, the examination data from the
current study provides epidemiological evidence to suggest there is a connection between conditions during captivity
and the later development of ischemic heart disease. According to the study, the reporting of edema in prison camp
indicates a specific nutritional deficiency, beriberi, and the location of edema in the feet, ankles and legs is presumably
related to beriberi heart disease in prison camp which is caused by thiamine deficiency.
