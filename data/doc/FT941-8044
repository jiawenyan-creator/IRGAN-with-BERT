FT  22 FEB 94 / Malaysian poll row resolved
A confrontation between the federal Malaysian government and a local
political party in the east Malaysia state of Sabah came to an end yesterday
with the appointment of Mr Joseph Pairin Kitinhan as state chief minister,
writes Kieran Cooke.
Mr Pairin's United Sabah Party (PBS) won state elections at the weekend but
Mr Pairin had to wait for nearly 36 hours outside the local governor's
residence before being sworn in.
