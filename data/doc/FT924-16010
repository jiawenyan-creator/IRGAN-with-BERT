FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: NAB ready to complete takeover
of NZ bank
NATIONAL Australia Bank (NAB), a leading Australian commercial bank, is
ready to complete the takeover of the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ), having
completed a due diligence investigation.
The merger will create the biggest bank in Australasia.
However, the New Zealand Stock Exchange's market surveillance panel
yesterday called for more details of the merger. It said markets and
shareholders should be given more information about the proposed unwinding
of Adbro Investments, the BNZ subsidiary which holds its doubtful debts.
The panel set a deadline of October 2 for the information.
NAB said it had 'satisfied' itself that the net tangible assets of BNZ and
its subsidiaries at March 31 were not less than NZDollars 600m (USDollars
323m) after applying its accounting and asset quality standards. NAB
announced its proposed takeover in August, but said it was conditional on
the due diligence process.
