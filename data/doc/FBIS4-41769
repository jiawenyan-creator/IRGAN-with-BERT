  [Text] French scientists have offered their Ukrainian 
colleagues assistance in resolving the problem of disposing of 
radioactive waste from atomic electric power plants. France has 
enormous experience -- in that country, atomic electric power 
plants produce 70 percent of all the electricity being consumed. 
Accordingly, an efficient system of disposing of radioactive 
waste was created there. France's major company dealing with 
these problems has agreed on concrete cooperation with 
representatives of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy, 
Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of 
Geological Sciences during negotiations in Paris.
