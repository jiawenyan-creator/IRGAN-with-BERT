METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY IN DRUG MONEY CASE SUES OVER 
SEARCHES 
A suspended Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, who is scheduled to stand 
trial with eight other narcotics officers in a money-skimming scandal, has 
filed a lawsuit contending that local and federal investigators violated his 
civil rights in searching his two homes. 
Deputy Terrell H. Amers and his wife, Genevieve, filed suit Thursday in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles claiming that their Pomona home was illegally 
searched and the couple was harassed, coerced and threatened last September 
during a nine-hour ordeal. 
The Amers said another home in Arizona was searched a month later without a 
valid warrant. Named as defendants in the suit were the county of Los Angeles, 
Sheriff Sherman Block and a dozen local and federal agents investigating the 
money-skimming allegations. 
Amers and the other indicted narcotics officers are scheduled to stand trial in 
October. The deputies, who had worked on an elite team investigating major drug 
cases, are accused of stealing more than $1.4 million from suspected drug 
dealers and money launderers.
