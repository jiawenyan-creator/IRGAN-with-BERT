  [Text] Berlin -- Owing to environmental protection measures 
and production cuts, pollution has decreased considerably in the 
new laender since unification. According to a report by the 
Halle Economic Research Institute, the average production of 
dust and sulfur dioxide decreased by 50 percent in areas with 
high pollution, and by a third in areas less exposed to 
pollution. It was, above all, the conversion of coal-fired 
heating systems to oil and gas- fired ones in more than one 
million private households that has caused this positive effect. 
  In the electricity sector the funds for fighting dust, 
sulfur, and the disposal of ash, gypsum, and water are expected 
to increase to 20-30 percent of the basic investment. Of the 28 
billion German marks of investment in plants expected by 1997, 
some 40 percent will, however, have to be used for repairing the 
power network.
