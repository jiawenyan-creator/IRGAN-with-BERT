FT  05 MAY 92 / French government likely to secure comfortable debate
majority
DESPITE uncertainty over the votes of the right-wing Gaullist RPR party, the
French government is likely to secure a comfortable majority in this week's
debate in the National Assembly on revising the constitution, as the first
step to ratifying the Maastricht treaty on European union, writes Ian
Davidson in Paris.
The leaders of the RPR opted last week to play down the treaty's
significance and urged members to support it in principle.
But among the Gaullist rank-and-file serious reservations remain about some
constitutional aspects of the treaty, and the group has said it will table
amendments to the government's constitutional revision bill.
However, the government can count on overwhelming support from members of
the Socialist party, as well as almost all of the centre-right UDF umbrella
grouping and the UDC centrist group, both of which are traditionally
pro-European.
