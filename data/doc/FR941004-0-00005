the last 4,500 landings, perform either an initial eddy current inspection or visual inspection to detect fatigue-related
cracking of the forward upper skin panel of the horizontal stabilizer, in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC10
Service Bulletin 5525, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994. 





Note 2:

 Eddy current inspections performed in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5525,
dated October 25, 1993, are considered acceptable for compliance with this paragraph. 



(1) If any crack is detected, prior to further flight, repair the crack in accordance with a method approved by the Manager,
Los Angeles ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. 
(2) If no crack is detected, perform repetitive eddy current inspections thereafter in accordance with the service
bulletin and in accordance with the following schedule: 
(i) If the initial inspection was performed using visual techniques, perform an eddy current inspection within 1,000
landings after the visual inspection. Thereafter, repeat the eddy current inspection at intervals not to exceed
4,500 landings. 
(ii) If the initial inspection was performed using eddy current techniques, repeat the eddy current inspection thereafter
at intervals not to exceed 4,500 landings. 
(c) For Model DC1030 and 40 series airplanes: Prior to the accumulation of 17,500 total landings,
or within 120 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, unless previously accomplished within
the last 4,500 landings, perform either an initial eddy current inspection or visual inspection to detect fatigue-related
cracking of the forward upper skin panel of the horizontal stabilizer, in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC10
Service Bulletin 5525, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994. 





Note 3:

 Eddy current inspections performed in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5525,
dated October 25, 1993, are considered acceptable for compliance with this paragraph. 



(1) If any crack is detected, prior to further flight, repair the crack in accordance with a method approved by the Manager,
Los Angeles ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. 
(2) If no crack is detected, perform repetitive eddy current inspections thereafter in accordance with the service
bulletin and in accordance with the following schedule: 
(i) If the initial inspection was performed using visual techniques, perform an eddy current inspection within 1,000
landings after the visual inspection. Thereafter, repeat the eddy current inspection at intervals not to exceed
4,500 landings. 
(ii) If the initial inspection was performed using eddy current techniques, repeat the eddy current inspection thereafter
at intervals not to exceed 4,500 landings. 
(d) For all airplanes: Install the preventative modifications specified in McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service
Bulletin 5524, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994; and McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5525,
Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994; in accordance with the following schedule. Accomplishment of these preventative
modifications constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by this AD. 





Note 4:

 Accomplishment of these preventative modifications in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin
5524, dated October 25, 1993; or McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5525, dated October
25, 1993; as applicable; is considered acceptable for compliance with this paragraph. 



(1) For Model DC1010 and 15 series airplanes: 
(i) Prior to the accumulation of 21,000 total landings, or within 5 years after the effective date of this AD, whichever
occurs later, accomplish the preventative modifications of the forward spar upper cap on the horizontal stabilizer
in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5524, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994.

(ii) Prior to the accumulation of 19,000 total landings, or within 5 years after the effective date of this AD, whichever
occurs later, accomplish the modification of the forward upper skin panel on the horizontal stabilizer in accordance
with McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5525, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994. 
(2) For Model DC1030 and -40 series airplanes: 
(i) Prior to the accumulation of 44,250 total landings, or within 5 years after the effective date of this AD, whichever
occurs later, accomplish the modification of the forward spar upper cap on the horizontal stabilizer in accordance
with McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5524, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994. 
(ii) Prior to the accumulation of 26,500 total landings, or within 5 years after the effective date of this AD, whichever
occurs later, accomplish the modification of the forward upper skin panel on the horizontal stabilizer in accordance
with McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5525, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994. 
(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall
submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then
send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. 





Note 5:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Los Angeles ACO. 



(f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be
accomplished. 
(g) The inspections and modifications shall be done in accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin
5524, Revision 1, dated August 3, 1994; and McDonnell Douglas DC10 Service Bulletin 5525, Revision
