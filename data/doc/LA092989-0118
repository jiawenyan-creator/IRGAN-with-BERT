SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DESIGN REVIEW LAW REJECTED 
The Hermosa Beach City Council defeated by a 4-1 vote Tuesday a proposed 
ordinance that would have increased the city's design control and environmental 
review of large-scale commercial developments. 
The vote overturned the recommendations of the Planning Commission and of 
Planning Director Michael Schubach, who had recommended adoption. 
Under the proposed ordinance, the council and Planning Commission would have 
been given discretionary review power to assess projects such as hotels, office 
buildings and retail developments for their impact on noise, traffic, parking 
and the surrounding neighborhood. 
Currently, such projects are subject only to administrative review, meaning 
that no additional environmental assessment is necessary if the project meets 
the city's building and zoning standards, Schubach said. 
Mayor June Williams voted in favor of the proposed ordinance, arguing that the 
city needs increased discretionary review power to reduce the impact of large 
projects throughout the city. 
But other council members criticized the ordinance, saying it was too 
restrictive and would place city officials in the position of evaluating the 
aesthetics of projects, rather than assessing their conformity to zoning and 
building standards.
