FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Greene King extends Pounds 100m bid for
Morland
GREENE King, the south of England's largest regional brewer, yesterday
extended its contested bid for its Oxfordshire-based rival, Morland, after
receiving acceptances from shareholders holding 46.22 per cent.
Greene King said its offer and cash alternative, which value Morland at just
over Pounds 100m, have been extended until July 2.
The acceptances included a 28.5 per cent stake Greene King acquired from
Whitbread Investment Company last month and a further 14.9 per cent stake
which Whitbread Investment has agreed to sell to Greene King if there is no
higher bidder.
Whitbread Investment had to reduce its stake in Morland by November to
ensure that its associate brewer, Whitbread, did not have to free more of
its pubs from tied beer supplies. Morland described independent
shareholders' response to the bid as 'paltry'.
Greene King is offering nine new convertible preference shares for every two
Morland shares, equivalent to 486p a share at yesterday's closing prices.
There is a cash alternative of 450p. Morland's shares were unchanged at 465p
while Greene King's shares held also steady at 523p.
