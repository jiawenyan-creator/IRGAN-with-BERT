FT  25 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: EOE to launch Flex options
Amsterdam's European Options Exchange will launch a new series of puts and
calls on Dutch state bonds today, designed to enable investors to tailor the
options to their individual requirements, Reuter reports from Amsterdam.
The options - to be known as Flex for flexibility - will allow customers to
choose the expiry date, exercise price and the exact underlying security the
option may be delivered against.
The new options, to be traded via a specialised EOE floor broker, will be
guaranteed by the clearing institution of the exchange, the EOE said.
