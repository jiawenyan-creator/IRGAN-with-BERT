SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 


In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 2796527966, Docket No. 940341), we amended the pink bollworm regulations
in 7 CFR part 301 by removing Craighead, Cross, Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas; Concordia
Parish in Louisiana and Washington County in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas in 301.522a.
We also stated that the interim rule would remove Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States quarantined to
prevent the spread of the pink bollworm since there would not be any areas in those States regulated because of the pink
bollworm. We stated that change would affect 
301.522a; it should have stated it would affect 301.52(a). However, we inadvertently left that
action out of the amendatory section of the interim rule. This final rule corrects that omission. 

Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before August 1, 1994. We did not receive any comments
by that date. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. 

This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866. 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301
