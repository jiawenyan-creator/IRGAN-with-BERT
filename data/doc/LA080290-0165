PICO RIVERA HIRING 'MAINTENANCE' AIDES TO CURB CRUISING BY YOUTHS 
City officials are interviewing candidates to become bargain-rate soldiers in 
the war on the city's legendary cruising problem. 
The city plans to hire 15 to 20 "maintenance aides" to set up or move 
traffic-control barricades at the direction of officers from the Sheriff's 
Department and California Highway Patrol. 
The aides will work from about 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Wednesdays and weekends and 
save the city up to $200,000 in salary costs. 
Local law-enforcement agencies typically set up barriers to prevent cruisers 
from entering residential neighborhoods and to keep the traffic flowing. On a 
busy cruising night, up to 100,000 youths will descend on Whittier and Rosemead 
boulevards to show off their cars and socialize, slowing traffic to a crawl. 
Pico Rivera spent about $400,000 last year to control cruising. The city had 
been paying public-works employees overtime to set up barriers. That cost the 
city about $18 an hour per worker.
