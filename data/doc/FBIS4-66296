Research Center of the State Planning Commission: "Comments on 
Fixed Asset Investment Scale"] 
  [Text] China is now at the juncture of switching to a 
socialist market economy. With regard to its present scale of 
fixed asset investment, different views exist among economic 
theorists and comrades in charge of macroeconomic management. To 
sum up, there are two points at issue: One, is the present scale 
of fixed asset investment too large? Two, under the current 
conditions, how should the state control the investment scale? 
  Following is my personal view on these two questions: 
  First, let us look into the question of whether or not our 
present scale of fixed asset investment is too large. The answer 
depends on the method and standard used in measuring the scale 
of investment. 
  One method is to use the comparable price in comparing the 
current year's investment with the preceding year's. That is, 
the actual investment scale and percentage of increase are 
obtained after the current year's amount of investment is 
adjusted for inflation. Then, the appropriateness of the 
investment scale is determined. This method is upheld by some 
economists, and to apply the method, the State Statistical 
Bureau has compiled a fixed asset investment price index. The 
1993 Statistical Communique pointed out that the country's fixed 
asset investment totaled 1.1829 trillion yuan. Although this 
figure appeared to be 50.6 percent more than the preceding year, 
the communique said, the actual increase was only 22 percent 
after adjustment for inflation, using the fixed asset investment 
price index (23.4 percent) -- this was even less than the 23.7 
percent increase registered in 1992. From this, we cannot 
conclude that our fixed asset investment in 1993 was too large. 
In fact, the 1993 Statistical Communique never said that the 
investment scale that year was too large. It only said that "the 
scale of fixed asset investment projects under construction was 
too large." The investment scale and the scale of investment 
projects under construction are two different things. According 
to the 1993 Statistical Communique, the state-owned units' fixed 
asset investment projects under construction totaled 2.327 
trillion yuan. After deducting the projects completed that year, 
the unfinished work at the end of that year was in the amount of 
1.32 trillion yuan. Based on the fact that fixed investment 
projects costing 832.1 billion yuan [figure as published] were 
completed by state-owned units that year, the above-mentioned 
unfinished work would take only one year and seven months to 
complete. This was a marked advance, compared with the situation 
existing several years ago when it would take two to three years 
or even a longer period to complete the unfinished investment 
projects. Viewed in this way, even the scale of the investment 
projects under construction was not too large as of the end of 
1993. 
  Another method is to compare the investment with GDP, using 
the current prices. This gives the ratio of fixed asset 
investment to GDP. Thus, by looking at the investment amount in 
relation to the country's economic strength, we can find out 
whether our investment scale is commensurate with our national 
power. 
  Based on statistical data, the investment-to-GDP ratios for 
the last three years are listed below:

  In 1993, the ratio of total fixed asset investment to GDP 
was 
37.7 percent, and that of state-owned units' fixed asset 
investment to GDP was 26.5 percent. This, I think, is indicative 
of an overly large scale of investment for the following reasons: 
  First, judging from our experience with respect to the 
investment-to-GDP ratio, we have now gone beyond the rational 
limit. 
  Practical experience over the past 15 years since the start 
of reform and opening-up shows that when the ratio of total 
fixed asset investment to GDP exceeds 30 percent and the ratio 
of state-owned units' fixed asset investment to GDP exceeds 20 
percent, the relations between the various sectors of our 
national economy would be strained and even become imbalanced. 
The present strained relations between the various economic 
sectors are due to this reason. 
  Second, the actual investment in 1993 greatly exceeded 
the target. 
  According to the 1993 plan adopted by the First Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress, the nation's total fixed 
asset investment was 800 billion yuan, and the investment rate 
should be no more than 30 percent. Of the total investment, the 
portion made by state-owned units was set at 565 billion yuan 
and that by collectively owned units and individuals 235 billion 
yuan. However, the actual total investment was 382.9 billion 
yuan more than the planned figure, or an overage of 47.9 
percent. The state-owned units' actual investment was 267.1 
billion yuan, or 47.3 percent, more than the plan, while the 
actual investment by collectives and individuals showed an 
average of 115.8 billion yuan, or 49.3 percent. The investment 
rate -- which was limited to 30 percent in the 1993 plan -- 
refers to the proportion of total fixed asset investment to 
national income. According to statistical data, the investment 
rate for 1992 was 39.5 percent. The rate for 1993 is estimated 
at about 42 percent, even outstripping the record registered for 
the "Great Leap Forward" period. This was a matter of rare 
occurrence since the founding of the People's Republic. 
  Third, never before had so much currency been put 
into circulation--an indication of the overly large scale of 
investment. 
  Calculated at the current price level, the 1993 GDP 
increased 30.6 percent, while the nation's total investment in 
fixed assets rose 50.6 percent. This was the chief reason for 
the soaring demand for currency. The following shows the sharp 
increase in the amount of currency put into circulation as a 
result of the rapid expansion of investment: In 1992, 115.8 
billion yuan of currency was put into circulation. In 1993, the 
amount put into circulation soared to 152.9 billion yuan, 
hitting a record high. This was even more than the total for the 
last five years of the 1980's (115.3 billion for 1985-1989). By 
the end of 1993, the amount of currency in circulation reached 
586.5 billion yuan. Compared with the preceding year, the 
increase was 35.3 percent. This was another big hike following 
the 36.5 percent increase registered in 1992. It was also 
another peak in the last few decades only next to the 1988 
record (which had a 46.7 percent increase). 
  Fourth, the extent of inflation was also indicative of 
the overly large scale of investment. 
  The increase in currency necessitated by the swelling 
investment has resulted in rising commodity prices. In 1993 the 
price index for the people's daily necessities (covering prices 
for both commodities and services, equivalent to the consumer 
price index in the West) rose 14.7 percent, following the 6.4 
percent hike registered in 1992. The retail price index rose 5.4 
percent in 1992 and climbed further by 13 percent in 1993. Last 
year the inflation rate reached two digits, being the fourth 
such occurrence in the 40-plus years since the founding of the 
People's Republic. This is a matter deserving serious attention. 
As there is a time gap between a large supply of currency and 
the appearance of its effect on commodity prices, the large 
amount of currency put into circulation in 1993 is expected to 
drive up the prices in 1994. Such being the case, we will still 
have a serious inflation problem this year. 
  Fifth, our country's investment scale is larger than 
that of foreign countries (regions). 
  Now, in developed countries, the ratio of fixed asset 
investment to GDP is generally about 15-20 percent. Japan has 
the highest ratio, which is around 30 percent. This 
investment-to-GDP ratio is related to the stage of economic 
development. Among the newly emerging industrial countries 
(regions), let's take the Republic of Korea as an example. In 
the 1970's when its economy was taking off, the highest 
investment-to-GDP ratio was only about 33 percent. At that time, 
Taiwan Province had a ratio of about 28 percent (in 1992, it was 
22.8 percent). 
  How should the state control the investment scale at 
present? This is a major question concerning macroeconomic 
regulation and control under the new circumstances, which has 
not been satisfactorily resolved. 
  Some people say that at this time the state should not, and 
cannot, control the scale of investment. In my opinion, however, 
control is necessary. Due to a lack of sufficient studies on the 
concrete measures to be taken, here I can only offer some 
guideline suggestions: 
  First, we should establish a clear-cut principle based 
on which the state makes guidance plans as to the scale of 
investment under the market economic system. 
  We may follow the experience of Western market-economy 
countries (regions). That is, we may include in the state plan 
an absolute amount of total investment (including the amount of 
fixed asset investment and the increase in working funds) and a 
total investment ratio, which is the proportion of total 
investment (fixed asset investment and increase in working 
funds) to GDP. This will bring the investment scale more or less 
into line with our national strength. This is a reform of the 
state plan. To do so, the statistical department should first 
work out the pertinent investment ratios for the basic period to 
be used in planning. 
  Second, the state should formulate a more specific 
industrial policy to guide investment. 
  The industrial policy should be carried out in every 
locality. Certain economic levers should be adjusted to 
accommodate the implementation of the industrial policy and 
facilitate the fulfillment of the country's investment plan. 
  Third, the central bank should beef up control over 
loans for fixed asset investment. 
  The central bank should strictly carry out the state budget 
concerning loans for fixed asset investment. This budget, 
included in both the state investment plan and the bank's credit 
plan, must be strictly adhered to; no one is allowed to overrun 
it. No financial institutes should arbitrarily extend loans for 
fixed asset investment. Without proper approval, no locality and 
department should issue bonds, experiment with the shareholding 
system, or raise funds to finance construction projects. 
Projects using foreign capital must be carried out in accordance 
with the state plan. As for projects built with direct foreign 
investment, it is imperative to strengthen their guidance and 
subject them to a standard control procedure. 
  Fourth, different investment-control methods should be 
used for different investors. 
  In fact, our present macro-control over investment is still 
concentrated on state-owned units. It has not touched the 
investment made by the large variety of new economic sectors 
that have emerged since the start of reform and opening-up, such 
as the privately and individually owned economic sectors, 
township enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign 
cooperative enterprises, wholly-foreign-funded enterprises, as 
well as joint enterprises owned by the state and collectives, 
state and individuals, and collectives and individuals. In 
reforming our economic management system, we should shift our 
main attention to these new economic sectors so as to truly 
reinforce macro-control over investment.
