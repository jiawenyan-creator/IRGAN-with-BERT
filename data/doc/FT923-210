FT  30 SEP 92 / IMF concern over reform in Russia
RUSSIA'S economic reforms are seriously at risk and inflation could reach
'dangerous levels by the end of the year', a senior official of the
International Monetary Fund told Russian deputies yesterday, writes John
Lloyd in Moscow.
Mr Hernando Cota, deputy head of the bank's European division, said that
while the IMF supported the policy and many of the actions of the
government, 'in recent weeks we feel seriously concerned that both budgetary
and credit policies are going off track'.
Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, in charge of relations with the international
financial institutions and permanent representative to the IMF, said that
the key imperative was to bring the countries within the rouble zone under
control.
The Russian administration is to be overhauled soon, according to the news
agency Itar Tass. Almost 100 committees would be axed, together with six
ministries, including the ministry of industry.
