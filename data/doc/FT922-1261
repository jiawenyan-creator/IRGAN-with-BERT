FT  23 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Weakness in yen and dollar
THE DOLLAR strengthened against the yen but weakened against European
currencies yesterday, writes Peter Martin.
Across most markets, however, trading was thin, with dealers already
influenced by the G7 meeting in two weeks' time.
Record low figures for Japanese money supply growth and a drop in the Nikkei
stock market index below the 16,000 level for the first time since 1986 left
the yen languishing. The dollar ended Tokyo trading on Monday at Y127.47, up
from the Y127.00 reached late on Friday in New York.
Paul Chertkow of UBS in London said the Japanese government would do what
was necessary to strengthen the stock market, which meant a fiscal stimulus
package around the time of the G7 meeting. In the meantime, he said, the
Japanese authorities would want to keep the yen strong against the dollar to
allow a cut in the official discount rate (ODR) later on.
'The interesting thing is that today the Bank of Japan's money market
actions suggest a slight tightening,' said Gerard Lyons of DKB
International, in London. 'That suggests that the authorities are not keen
to relax monetary policy ahead of the G7 meeting.'
In European trading, the yen weakened further, moving through the Y81.00
level against the D-Mark. It closed at around Y81.10, compared with Y80.82
on Friday.
Against European currencies, the dollar continued its weakness of recent
days. It opened at DM1.5735, down from Friday's DM1.675, then moved to
DM1.5660 by the London close. Technically minded traders were testing the
DM1.56 level, said UBS's Paul Chertkow, with the thought of a possible move
back to DM1.5350, seen earlier in the year. In New York the dollar finished
at the DM1.5660 London close.
Among EMS currencies, there was little change. The D-Mark continued to edge
down in the wake of Irish voters' endorsement of the Maastricht treaty, but
still retained much of the strength acquired after Denmark's 'no' vote.
The lira, which had to be defended by the Bank of Italy in the middle of
last week, slipped to DM756.25 from Friday's DM757.30. As some commercial
banks raised lending rates, the lira escaped from the bottom of the EMS by
the close, to be replaced by sterling. The Portuguese escudo, at the top,
was 5.81 per cent above its central sterling rate. The pound was steady at
DM2.9153.
South Africa's financial rand fell sharply, as the African National Congress
called an emergency meeting for today to discuss whether to pull out of
constitutional talks. The financial rand closed 6.7 per cent down at R3.84
to the dollar, from a Friday close of R3.60. The discount to the commercial
rand widened to 27 per cent, the highest this year.
