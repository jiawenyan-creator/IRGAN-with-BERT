PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO FIGHT DRUGS 
I admire President Bush for wanting to keep his word to the American people in 
regards to not raising new taxes, but never has a President been given the 
opportunity to "break" his word and find the majority of the people ready to 
say "we back your retraction." Now having declared war on drugs, he must put 
aside his promise or that war will be lost. Who is paying the $7.9 billion 
inadequate budget he now proposes? The taxpayer! 
The taxpayer wants to win this war and would rather win without having other 
vital domestic programs cut to finance it. Does President Bush honestly believe 
we want the addicts, pushers and drug lords to continue destroying our nation 
while he wrings his hands in frustration, telling us, "I must keep my word at 
all costs?" This is war! 
When he finds the budget he has proposed is woefully inadequate, America may 
have to admit we have lost another war. 
Come on, Mr. President, ask us for permission to break your promise. You will 
get a resounding cry of support -- provided the tax monies are used effectively 
against what is proving to be the great threat to America at this time -- 
drugs! 
Let's not lose this one!
