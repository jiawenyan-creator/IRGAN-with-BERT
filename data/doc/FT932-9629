FT  13 MAY 93 / Competition policy is 'vague and misdirected'
THE OBJECTIVES of UK competition policy are 'vague and misdirected' and the
inquiry process is 'laborious and secretive', a report by the London
Business School says, Robert Rice writes.
The report, based on a study by Professor Kim Warren of recent Monopoly and
Mergers Commission inquiries into petrol, beer, soft drinks and coffee,
questions the analytical standards and balance applied to information
collected by inquiries.
Prof Warren says that problems with competition inquiries result from
reliance on simplistic ideas of how the competitive process works.
MMC investigations assume that competition invariably benefits consumers. In
reality, he says, the competitive process can itself destroy the rivalry on
which consumers' ability to choose depends. Policy aimed at consumers'
interests must go beyond issues of price and address availability, quality,
choice and service.
