STATE JUNIOR COLLEGE TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
VALLEY'S CLARKE MAKES HER POINT -- 5,000 TIMES -- IN HEPTATHLON 
Melanie Clarke had difficulty concentrating Saturday during the second day of 
the heptathlon in the state junior college track and field championships at 
Santa Barbara City College. 
Her problem wasn't caused by nervousness, but rather by soreness in her lower 
back from an injury sustained in the high jump during the first day of the 
heptathlon. However, the soreness proved to be about the only challenge the 
Valley College freshman faced. 
The former El Camino Real High standout amassed 5,034 points to become the 
first athlete in five years to surpass the 5,000-point plateau in the state 
meet. 
Edwina Ammonds of King's River finished second with 4,698 and Donna Lee of Long 
Beach City placed third with 4,528. 
"(My back) hurt, but I just tried to block it out," said Clarke, who began the 
day 135 points ahead of Ammonds. "I couldn't focus on the long jump. I wanted 
to jump in the 18s, but I was just out there jumping. My mind wasn't on the 
meet." 
In the team competition, Taft won the men's title, outscoring Long Beach, 
96-90; Mt. San Antonio outpointed Long Beach for the women's title, 85-74. 
While Clarke was dominating the multi-event competition, several area athletes 
in individual events were having their problems. In the 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles, for example, Larry Sanders of Taft handed Glendale's Marty Beck his 
first loss of the year, running 51.06 seconds to Beck's 51.22. 
Glendale's Dave Swanson placed second in the high jump (6 feet 11 3/4 inches) 
and Simone Cain of Ventura finished third in the 400 (55.36) and fourth in the 
200 (24.23). 
However Marji Gilles of Glendale, who tied for fifth in the heptathlon, came 
back to win the triple jump, bounding 37-3 1/4. 
Gil Carrillo of Moorpark (6,359) and Ryan Rapoza of Ventura (6,267) placed 
fifth and sixth in the decathlon and fifth and eighth in the open javelin with 
throws of 189-9 and 184-8. 
Jaime Galindo of Ventura placed fifth in the 5,000 in 14:52.41. Noureddine 
Morceli of Riverside, the 1,500 winner in 3.47.65 and the national junior 
college record-holder at 5,000, won the longer race in 14:13.45. 
After posting the top marks in three of Friday's four events, Clarke, who has 
qualified for next month's TAC junior nationals in the 400, high jump, long 
jump and heptathlon, failed to place first in the long jump, javelin, and 800 
meters on Saturday. 
But she finished well enough. Clarke leaped 17-9 in the long jump, the 
second-best mark in the field, and recorded a personal best in the javelin at 
111-9, the fourth-best toss in the field. 
Entering the 800, the final event, Clarke held a commanding 272-point lead over 
Lee and 328 points over Ammonds. 
Lee needed to beat Clarke by 25.9 seconds to win the competition, which proved 
to be too much. 
Clarke led through the first lap and went on to place second in 2:22.12. 
Ammonds was third in 2:22.7 and Lee took seventh in 2:41. 
"It's great to win, but I would have liked to have been in the other events 
too," said Clarke, who had to pull out of several individual events after 
hurting an ankle in the Southern California meet. Clarke cleared 5-8 in the 
heptathlon high jump Friday -- a mark that would have won the open high jump by 
more than two inches.
