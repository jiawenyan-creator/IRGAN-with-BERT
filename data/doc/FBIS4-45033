  [Text] A financial protocol to the value of 200 million 
French francs has been ratified today in Paris between the 
Algerian and French Governments. The protocol was signed for 
the Algerian side by the director general of foreign financial 
relations at the Ministry of Finance. 
  This agreement would allow Algerian operators to obtain 
French-made pharmaceutical products for a period of three years. 
This agreement acquires a special significance because it comes 
at a time when Algeria is preparing itself for starting talks at 
the beginning of June with the Paris Club on rescheduling its 
general debts.
