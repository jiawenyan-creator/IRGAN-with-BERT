FT  11 MAR 93 / Syria accused over human rights
Syria may have the world's worst record of human rights abuses against
scientists over the last 10 years, with hundreds of political arrests and
widespread torture, the US National Academy of Sciences said, Reuter reports
from Washington.
Over the last decade, 287 scientists, engineers and health professionals
were imprisoned, usually without charge or trial, and 20 are believed to
have died or 'disappeared' while in captivity, the report said.
Many of the scientists were arrested after protesting at Syria's prolonged
state of emergency and calling for human rights reforms.
