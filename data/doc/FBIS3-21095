  [Text] The international value-added services market is 
growing around a new supplier of services. After the 
Worldsource consortium led by AT&amp;T, the Unisource alliance 
formed by the Netherlands, Swiss, and Swedish telecom 
organizations, and the pact between BT [British Telecom] (UK) 
and MCI (United States), DBP [Deutsche Bundespost] Telekom and 
France Telecom announced another alliance in Brussels last 
month. Subject to the approval of the European Union -- 
expected this spring -- a joint venture with ECU1 billion 
working capital and headquarters in Brussels will be formed 
employing 4,000 people. The corporation will be owned on an 
equal- shares basis and will incorporate only those divisions of 
the parent companies that are already working under competitive 
conditions. It will thus comprise a value-added data service 
network (without voice transmission) for major clients' 
commercial, cross-border communications; a European backbone 
network will become the core of the VANS [value-added network 
service] network. DBP Telekom and France Telecom estimate that 
they already have a 10-percent share of their target market, 
which they intend to build up rapidly on an international basis. 
For this they will need a strong overseas partner, and AT&amp;T's 
assent is hoped for. This would create a consortium of the 
three largest telecom operating organizations in the world. The 
prospect is already arousing skeptical comment in the United 
Kingdom, where it is feared that DBP Telekom and France Telecom, 
which are still state-owned, will distort competition in this, 
to date, largely market-led sector. There is also a "vision," 
says DBP Telekom chief Helmut Ricke, of a subsequent 
interlinking of capital between DBP Telekom and France Telecom. 
The alliance may at least be seen as a further step forward in 
the long-standing collaboration between the two corporations, 
which looks set to continue.
