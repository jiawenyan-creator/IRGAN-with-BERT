FT  02 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Steady performance in S Africa
Johannesburg made a slow start to the week, with prices ending mixed as
bullion and world bourses failed to give them direction. However, the
continued threat of labour unrest, and increased political and crime-related
violence, was said to be dampening enthusiasm for industrials.
The overall index ended 1 lower at 5,651, industrials eased 7 to 6,400 and
golds put on 4 at 2,142.
Gencor lost 10 cents at R11.80 as demand slowed after the announcement of
its purchase of Billiton. Randgold ended unchanged at R9 after news that a
foreign consortium was bidding for management control of the group.
