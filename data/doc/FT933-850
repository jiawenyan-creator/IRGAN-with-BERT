FT  27 SEP 93 / Observer: Sea change?
Sir William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, does not exchange a view over
Hong Kong harbour for a squint at the Pool of London until the week after
next, but the fall-out of the chairman's relocation to England has already
begun.
After his nearly 15 year-stint at Midland, and his subsequent elevation to
head group public affairs at HSBC Holdings following the takeover, Alan
Macdonald is off. 'I've seen five chairmen and as many chief executives and
here was yet another one,' he says ruefully, admitting that the timing of
his exit was not quite of his choosing.
'Messages would arrive from Hong Kong; the role became less that of an
adviser, more one of carrying out instructions in the military,' says
Macdonald, who in his time was a not uncontroversial boss himself.
When Sir William touches down, Midland staff had better study his photo,
because unscheduled visits to outlying branches are apparently his sort of
thing, while their boss, Midland chief Brian Pearse, has to get used to
having Purves down the street.
A member of Hong Kong's executive council, the chairman may also prove an
intimidating prospect to British regulators and legislators.
Meanwhile, Macdonald is unlikely to be the last to move on as Purves puts
his feet under a desk which no longer commands that cherished view of
international shipping plying its trade.
