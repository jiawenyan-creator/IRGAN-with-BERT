FT  15 OCT 92 / Actors' union and BBC in payments row
EQUITY, the actors' union, has decided to end its agreement with the BBC
covering payments for programmes sold to satellite channels and overseas
broadcasters.
The row has blown up over payments to actors for programmes to be shown on
UK Gold, the new satellite channel founded by the BBC and Thames Television.
Mr Ian McGarry, Equity general secretary, said that members of the union's
council 'went bananas' when they heard actors were being offered 4 per cent
of their original fee for two showings on UK Gold.
Mr McGarry will announce today that the union is serving the required
six-month notice to end the multi-media agreement covering programme sales
first agreed in 1986. That gave actors 17 per cent of gross sales figures.
'This is the worst row we have had with the BBC,' Mr McGarry said.
There was disagreement last night on whether UK Gold would be affected.
Mr Derek Lewis, the executive responsible for launching the channel, said UK
Gold had a 10-year programme supply agreement with the BBC and he had been
assured that the agreement would be honoured.
Equity insists that it has no agreement with the BBC for UK Gold and is
taking legal advice on whether the programmes can be broadcast.
The union argues that there is an important difference between sales of
individual programmes in an open market and supply deals for programmes
between the BBC and UK Gold.
Mr James Arnold-Baker, managing director of the commercial arm of the BBC,
is in Cannes, selling BBC programmes. Such deals amount to Pounds 70m a
year. He said: 'We think we are selling a lot of programmes, but whether we
can fulfil the contracts is another matter.'
