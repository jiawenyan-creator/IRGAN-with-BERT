  [Text] Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, in a speech to the State Duma during the 
presentation of candidates for the post of House Speaker, said 
that in all countries, the party winning a majority vote was 
automatically entitled to form a new government or to the post 
of parliamentary leader. 
  Zhirinovskiy said his recent tour of Europe "gave the 
jitters 
to the whole of the continent, diplomats and politicians alike" 
who were ready to part with billions of dollars to fulfill all 
conditions so that Russia could follow the path it opted for on 
December 12. 
  In reply to an earlier proposal from deputy Viktor Mironov 
that all candidates for the post of Speaker undergo a 
psychiatric test, Zhirinovskiy promised that all of the deputies 
would undergo one with the help of his security services. He 
said he would obtain all evidence of "who is suffering from what 
and for how long." The LDP leader said he did not think himself 
fit for a dispatcher's role and would await a new election 
instead. 
  In reply to an uproar in the house, Zhirinovskiy shouted 
"Shut up." 
  Addressing members of the Russia's Choice [RC] faction, the 
LDP leader said their time was up and now was the time for his 
party. "You are 30 percent behind us now, the gap will increase 
to 60 percent in spring and 90 percent in autumn," he told RC 
members. Zhirinovskiy said the presence of Gaydar, Kozyrev, 
Chubays and Fedorov in the government was having an adverse 
effect on his health and that he would temporarily opt out of 
the bout for the post of Speaker, biding his time until 
presidential elections in 1996. 
  In reply to Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays' gesture to the 
chairman indicating that Zhirinovskiy's time was up, the LDP 
leader shouted from the rostrum: "You will be pointing to your 
watch at Lefortovo prison!"
