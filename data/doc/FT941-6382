FT  02 MAR 94 / Gummer rejects plan for county
Mr John Gummer, environ-ment secretary, yesterday signalled that the
government will persist with plans to abolish the two-tier system of local
government in England by rejecting the Local Government Commission's plan to
leave the status quo intact in Gloucestershire.
He told Sir John Banham, the commission's chairman, to review the county's
structure again. Gloucestershire is the third county on which Mr Gummer has
asked the commission for a second opinion.
However, it is the first time Mr Gummer has rejected plans for a commission
proposal since January's High Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully in
telling the commission that he expected it to recommend all-purpose unitary
councils, rather than the status quo, in all but 'exceptional'
circumstances.
Mr Gummer said local residents should be given another chance to reach a
consensus. Sir John had already commented that he was 'unhappy' with the
proposals, and that local authorities had given 'no coherent lead to local
people'.
The county has received 1,300 submissions from interested parties, and
received responses to leaflets on the proposed changes from more than 30,000
local people. It found that in each of Gloucestershire's six districts the
status quo was the single most popular option.
The Association of District Councils, which supports unitary councils,
backed Mr Gummer's decision. It said local MPs had come out in favour of the
unitary case.
