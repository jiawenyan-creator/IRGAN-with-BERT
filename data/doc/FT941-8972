FT  17 FEB 94 / Pru chief backs regulation shift
Changing to regulation of retail financial services through a single-tier
regulator directly accountable to parliament need not involve years of
delay, Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's largest
life insurer, said yesterday.
Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee's
inquiry into financial regulation, Mr Newmarch called for a single-tier
regulator which would set minimum standards of adequate protection and leave
it to competitive pressures to bring about other improvements.
He agreed, however, that even a single-tier regulator could involve a
further structure of a network of practitioners to ensure industry
involvement.
Regulation would be better carried out through an agency rather than
government itself since the industry was so complex.
The delay and uncertainty that a further shift in the regulatory regime
would mean is one of the arguments used by supporters of the proposed
Personal Investment Authority.
Mr Steven Howarth, consultant to the chief executive, said the Financial
Services Act 1986 gave ministers most of the powers needed to regulate the
sector and it could be a question of 'stripping out excrescences', rather
than 'going back to a blank sheet of paper'.
Attacking the present system for imposing bureaucratic burdens, Mr Newmarch
said it cost Prudential an extra Pounds 7m last year to meet regulators'
requirements - the equivalent of employing 80 people.
Challenged by MPs when he said that the problem over the mis-selling of
personal pensions to people transferring out of an occupational scheme was
'around the margin', Mr Newmarch said that the study by accountancy firm
KPMG Peat Marwick into pension transfers was a criticism of the 'process
rather than of poor selling'.
