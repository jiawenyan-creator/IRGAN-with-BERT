  [Text] Moscow April 29 TASS -- "The signing of the Treaty 
on Social Accord in Moscow on Thursday is a historical event for 
our country" declared Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev on 
Friday. He said that an absolute majority of the heads of 
political parties, socio-political organisations, territories 
and regions had signed the document. 
  Speaking before the beginning of his talks with South Korean 
Defence Minister Yi Pyong-tae, who is in Moscow on an official 
visit, Grachev expressed the hope that other socio-political 
organisations would sign the agreement in the near future. 
Those who did not sign the document will be regarded by 
Russians as forces "which are not striving towards accord and 
peace". 
  Touching on the May 1 Labor Day holiday, which last year was 
marked by a bloody confrontation between demonstrators and 
police, Grachev hoped that everything would be peaceful this 
time.
