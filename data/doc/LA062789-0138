PAPANDREOU TALK WITH COMMUNISTS FAILS TO BREAK NINE-DAY DEADLOCK 
Ailing Premier Andreas Papandreou today failed to gain Communist support in 
forming a coalition government that would lead Greece out of a nine-day 
political deadlock. 
Negotiations between the premier's Panhellenic Socialist Movement and the 
Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress ended at noon without an 
agreement. 
Papandreou, who met with the Communists for an hour, was forced to appoint a 
representative to negotiate on his behalf. The 70-year-old premier was admitted 
to General State Hospital on Thursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months 
after undergoing heart surgery. 
Papandreou is heading a caretaker government because no party received a 
majority in elections on June 18 to the 300-seat Parliament. 
After the meeting today, Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said that the 
Socialist proposals "were equally interesting" as those made to him last week 
by the conservatives, who finished first in the elections but failed to build a 
coalition. Florakis did not disclose the proposals. The conservative New 
Democracy Party had proposed a government in which the leftists would control 
the justice and interior ministries. 
If the three major parties cannot form a coalition government, new elections 
will be called.
