FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (2): New names cross the North
Atlantic - The changing shape of competition on key routes
ANY PASSENGER who shunned the North Atlantic during the recession, but who
now decides that business prospects are good enough to return to the skies
to search for new orders overseas is likely to encounter a rather different
world. In the space of less than a year, the shape of competition on North
Atlantic routes has changed radically. The collapse of Pan Am last year
showed that the North Atlantic is no friend to an airline in trouble, while
the other grand old name of the business, TWA, is languishing under the
protection of US bankruptcy laws. These two have been replaced on the North
Atlantic by the two biggest US airlines, American and United.
It is more than just a change of names. American and United are the fit
survivors of the viciously competitive US domestic market: United has more
than half as many employees again as British Airways, it has almost 500
passenger aircraft and carried 170,000 passengers a day even in last year's
depressed market.
American is the bigger of the two across the Atlantic. If the name is
unfamiliar to any European business passengers it is because a year ago it
had less than one third of its present capacity operating on routes between
North America and the UK. American and United have announced their arrival
in Europe with a storm of advertising and promotion. Passengers are still
scarce, and ticket discounting widespread, but two are determined to grab
market share.
The potential rewards are high in this, the busiest of long-haul air
corridors. There is already evidence that the arrival of the two newcomers
is heralding rising prices across the North Atlantic. Published fares in
1992 are 8-10 per cent higher than last year, says Mr Paul Karos, airlines
analyst at First Boston in New York. Although discounting means that
published fares bear little resemblance to the actual prices paid for
tickets, it is easy for airlines to rein back the discounts if business
picks up.
The conditions for such a recovery are in place. Not only is there optimism
about the prospects for the world economy as a whole, but capacity can be
filled more quickly because the Boeing 747 fleet operated by TWA and Pan Am
has been replaced by a mixture of smaller Boeing 767s, DC-10s, as well as
747s.
Capacity will be most intensively utilised on flights to and from the UK,
says Mr Karos, partly because of the change of aircraft. This conclusion is
supported by a Financial Times survey of the cost of business class and
first class flights between various European centres and New York (see
table). London has the most expensive fares, Paris is in second place, and
Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam are close behind.
Flights from the UK are more than just the cherry on the North Atlantic
cake. The UK is by far the biggest European market for non-stop flights to
and from the US. One third of all transatlantic capacity uses UK airports.
British Airways is the biggest operator, taking 40 per cent of that market.
In second place is American Airlines with 14 per cent, United has 11 per
cent and Virgin 10 per cent, according to a Reuters survey.
Although airlines are trying to push fares higher, discounting is rife:
there has already been one vicious price war this year on the North Atlantic
which saw some fares fall by a third in one week.
Competition is also likely to intensify on fronts other than just fares.
European airines are catching up with their US counterparts in one of main
marketing weapons used by US airlines: frequent flyer programmes. These have
been enormously popular - Iata says that 97 per cent of business travellers
resident in the US are members. The figures are much lower in Europe partly
because European carriers have in the past participated with limited
enthusiasm as junior partners with US carriers.
This is changing. 'We are now seeing the European carriers launching their
own programmes,' says Mr David Coltman, vice-president of United Airlines'
Atlantic division.
British Airways is leading the way. Until a year ago, BA participated in
frequent flyer programmes operated by United Airlines, American Airlines and
others. In the spring of 1991 it began its 'Air Miles' promotion. It has now
linked it with other incentives aimed at business travellers, such as use of
executive lounges.
Both Air France and the German carrier Lufthansa are said by industry
sources to be preparing to launch similar schemes.
Frequent flyer programme are popular with passengers, but they have their
dangers for the industry. Airlines acknowledge privately that the backlog of
free seats to be redeemed could squeeze out fare-paying passengers.
One solution is to have strict time windows on when the free seats offers
can be exercised. But this might reduce the attractiveness of the schemes.
Marketing strategists are also aware that as more airlines jump on the
frequent flyer programme bandwagon, their effectiveness as marketing tools -
to differentiate between rival airlines - diminishes.
In the knowledge that frequent flyer programmes could become progressively
less effective, US carriers have been carrying out their own private surveys
of what UK business passengers value on transatlantic flights. The most
requested items include sleeper seats, seat selection at time of purchase,
not having to sit next to anyone, and a special lounge.
Virgin Atlantic's launch last week of a Mid Class, with wider seats for
economy class passengers who have paid full price for their tickets,
reflects these priorities. But Virgin's is also a move that should raise the
average fare it receives for a ticket. As such, it is part of the
industry-wide strategy of raising fares.
This strategy can only be helped if economic recovery pushes up demand. In
an increasingly liberalised environment, competition is the main force that
might limit the rises.
'The new US rivals are stronger than the companies they replace,' admits Mr
Paul Griffiths, Virgin Atlantic's commercial director.
Business passengers must hope that the market will make sure any price rises
are small and accompanied by genuine improvements in service.
