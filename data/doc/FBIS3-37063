  [Text] Moscow February 12 TASS -- A Cyclone-3 space booster 
rocket carried six satellites in the Cosmos series -- the 
Cosmos-2,268 -- Cosmos-2,273 of the low-orbit satellite 
communications system, at 11.54 Moscow time from the Plesetsk 
cosmodrome on Saturday. 
  The launch was conducted by Russia's Space Defence Forces 
(SDF) in the interests of the Russian Defence Ministry. 
  The launch was successful. All the six satellites are 
following flight paths close to the pre-calculated ones and are 
being controlled by the main centre for Cosmos satellite control 
and testing, a spokesman at the SDF press centre told ITAR-TASS. 
  The Cosmos-2,269 has become the 1,800th satellite launched 
into a low-earth orbit from Plesetsk over the 28 years of the 
existence of Russia's northern cosmodrome.
