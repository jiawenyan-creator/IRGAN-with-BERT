FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Putting the colour into
plastics
Speciality inks which change colour when exposed to sunlight can now be
incorporated into plastics, such as polypropylene, to create novelty
products - lunch boxes or toys.
Developed in the US and launched in the UK by Sunshine Promotions of London,
the range of 16 inks can also be used on clothing, paper or packaging. The
photochromic inks begin life as crystals, which are broken down and mixed
with a medium before application.
