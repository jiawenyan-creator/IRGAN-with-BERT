THE STATE 
A judge in Oxnard declared a mistrial for a defendant in a drug possession 
trial when three jurors made an unauthorized visit to the alleged crime scene 
to see how long it takes a toilet to flush. The jury foreman told Ventura 
County Superior Court Judge Robert Bradley that the jurors visited an apartment 
to test the truth of defendant Nelson Cortez's testimony that he was awakened 
by the sound of a toilet flushing. Cortez had said he went into the bathroom 
and was immediately arrested by waiting police after officers found a bag of 
cocaine in the bowl. Based in part on their investigation, the panel voted to 
convict Cortez, the foreman said. Bradley declared the mistrial because the 
apartment visit was "serious misconduct." Jurors had been told not to visit the 
crime scene.
