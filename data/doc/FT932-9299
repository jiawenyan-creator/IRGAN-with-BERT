FT  14 MAY 93 / Technology: Time to recycle plastic
A breakthrough has been achieved in recycling the plastic commonly used in
food and beverage containers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
Food authorities in the US and Australia have approved a method of
sandwiching recycled PET between virgin layers of the plastic, allowing
material collected from consumers to be used again by the food industry.
The technique - called the Multilayer Repete System - has been developed by
two packaging subsidiaries of the UK industrial conglomerate BTR,
Continental PET Technologies of the US and ACI Petalite of Australia, in
conjunction with an equipment designer, Husky Injection Mouldings of Canada.
It permits the co-injection moulding of two materials into a three-layer
structure in which the recycled PET is laminated between an inner and outer
layer of virgin PET to form the wall of a container.
To win regulatory consent, the middle layer of recycled PET was
intentionally tainted with abnormally high levels of contaminants. Tests
showed that the surrounding layer of virgin material effectively prevented
the migration of contaminants which might survive the washing and moulding
processes.
The 'letter of no objection' issued by the US Food and Drug Administration
was conditional on the recycled PET being separated from food by a virgin
layer of PET at least 1/1,000in thick. By the end of this month, equipment
to mould simultaneously up to 48 types of container will be in production.
Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'The Multilayer Replete System
provides the potential to increase significantly plastics recycling and we
are continuing to develop the technology to broaden its range of packaging
applications.'
In Australia, ACI pioneered the development of PET recycling via kerbside
collections throughout Australia. Its PET recycling plant at Wondonga in
Victoria - the largest in the southern hemisphere - recycled more than 100m
bottles in 1992.
