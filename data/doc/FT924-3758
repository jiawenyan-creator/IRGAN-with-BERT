FT  05 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Abbey National
Abbey National did the decent thing by waiting until its downgrading had
been announced by Moody's before launching yesterday's Pounds 103m share
placement. Just the same it has netted a handsome price. Its shares have
risen more than 40 per cent since September's devaluation, which makes one
wonder whether, like HSBC last month, it has chosen a high point on which to
raise some cash.
Though falling interest rates have made for a wider retail margin, this may
not be so easy to maintain once interest rates have stopped declining. And
the overall group margin will fall this year, thanks to the Abbey's
increasing involvement in treasury business and the effect of lower interest
rates on its free capital. Falling house prices mean second-half provisions
will be higher than the first half's Pounds 138m. They could still be high
next year as rising unemployment continues to depress the housing market.
All of which limits Abbey's growth prospects, in spite of its undoubted
basic strength.
On a historic multiple around 13, Abbey is still trading at a discount to
the market, but the yield of 3.8 per cent looks skimpy. As for the the
proceeds of yesterday's issue, the new accounting rules may mean the profit
has to be taken above the line, but the longer-term benefit to earnings will
still be marginal.
