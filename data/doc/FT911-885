FT  09 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Revised pay offer averts strike at The
Guardian
A DISPUTE over a proposed pay freeze at The Guardian newspaper ended
yesterday. Journalists voted to accept a revised offer of a flat-rate Pounds
500 increase rather than starting a strike in a week, writes John Gapper.
Leaders of the National Union of Journalists chapel (office branch)
recommended that the 250 journalists accept the offer, under which they will
receive a Pounds 500 advance on a scheme linking pay to advertising revenue
in the next year.
Mr Seumas Milne, father of the chapel (chairman of the office branch), said
the decision was 'not a victory, but a draw'. He said the journalists had
managed to break the pay freeze, although the offer was inadequate.
Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, said the deal was an attempt to
adjust to a difficult financial climate by offering more pay if revenue
improved.
Under the offer, journalists will receive an extra Pounds 310 for each
Pounds 800,000 which the newspaper gains in advertising revenue during
1991-92 above its budgeted advertising level.
The Guardian has also guaranteed a minimum pay rise of 5 per cent in the
next annual settlement due next January. It had been attempting to impose a
pay freeze on all employees because of the sharp downturn in advertising
revenue.
