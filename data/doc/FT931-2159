FT  22 MAR 93 / Shephard says plans for jobless may grow swiftly
THE SCHEMES to help the unemployed that were announced in last week's Budget
could be expanded swiftly, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary,
said yesterday.
But such a move could be at the expense of existing programmes for the
unemployed.
The measures, including a Community Action programme which will provide
benefit plus Pounds 10 for 60,000 people who want to work part-time and
receive help with job-hunting the rest of the time, were widely welcomed for
their new approach, but criticised for being too small-scale.
Apart from Community Action, the other main scheme announced in the Budget
is called Learning for Work and funds 30,000 unemployed people to pursue
full-time vocationally relevant education.
Mrs Shephard said on BBC television's On The Record: 'If we find that these
measures work better for unemployed people and, indeed, as investments in
the economy, then certainly what I would look at is reviewing what we are
already doing, and perhaps switching from some of those ways of helping
unemployed people into these new ways.'
The Employment Department believes that results from the four pilot
'Workstart' projects will come through quickly enough to enable it to bid
for an expanded programme in the autumn spending round negotiations. The
initial Pounds 2.6m scheme will give an employer a one-year subsidy of
Pounds 60-a-week for taking on someone who has been unemployed for a long
time.
Mrs Shephard said the four pilot schemes would be deliberately varied to
give the widest possible range of circumstances for testing the idea.
Two will be run by the Employment Service and the other two by the Training
and Enterprise Councils. Half the schemes will be for people who have been
unemployed for more than two years and the other half for people who have
been unemployed for more than four years. The 1,000 places will not
necessarily be divided equally between the four schemes.
