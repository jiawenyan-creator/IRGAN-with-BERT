FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: New medical cover
CORNHILL Insurance is moving into the private medical insurance market for
the first time, in a link-up with Deutsche Krankenversicherung, the largest
health insurer in Europe. It is launching a range of three policies under
the name Cornhill HealthCare Options.
Option A is a comprehensive plan, covering in-patient and out-patient
treatment at a wide range of hospitals. It also covers physiotherapy,
chiropractic and osteopathy. Treatment for chronic and incurable illnesses
is covered after a person has been continuously insured for five years.
Option B provides cover of up to Pounds 12,500 a year in mid-range hospital
accommodation, which can be increased if complications arise.
Option C limits cover to Pounds 10,000 a year in lower-priced accommodation,
but the limit can be raised if there are complications. Unlike most low-cost
plans, immediate private treatment is not dependent on NHS waiting lists
being longer than six weeks.
All the plans include Pounds 50 a night cash benefit if the customer is
treated as an NHS patient, and emergency cover up to certain limits in EC
countries. Option A would cost Pounds 84.90 a month for a healthy
45-year-old, option B Pounds 57.83, and option C Pounds 39.87. The maximum
age at entry is 59.
Private Patients Plan has revamped its range of medical insurance policies,
introducing two low-cost schemes. The Premier and Classic plans are
equivalent to existing comprehensive schemes, while Secure is a low-cost
option with a six-week rule. The new options are Select and Value. Both
operate a six-week rule.
Select covers out-patient treatment, psychiatric treatment, home nursing,
private ambulances, medical travel insurance, and a parent accompanying a
child aged under nine into hospital. There is no overall limit on claims.
Value limits cover to Pounds 10,000, Pounds 20,000 where complications
arise.
