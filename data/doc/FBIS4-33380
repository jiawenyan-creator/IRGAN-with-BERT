  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Jun (DPA) -- A group of 
Colombian and Panamanian ham operators today "saved" a group of 
Cubans who were fleeing their country aboard a boat that was 
attacked by seamen of Fidel Castro's regime, privately owned 
Radio Caracol has reported. 
  According to the radio station, which cited Colombian ham 
operator Jorge Villa, "they monitored the call for help on a 
shortwave frequency from a group of Cubans when the boat in 
which they were escaping was attacked by a Cuban gunboat." 
  The ham operators immediately contacted a U.S. military 
base, 
explained what had happened, and gave the location of the Cubans 
who were quickly aided by a Coast Guard vessel and two 
helicopters. The attacking gunboat returned to its Cuban base, 
the Caracol report states, citing the ham operators. 
  The boat was carrying approximately 70 Cuban refugees who 
decided to flee to the United States. The report does not 
indicate the final destination of the Cubans or their identities.
