  [Text] The gang of apostasy and secession in the [Yemeni] 
Socialist Party [YSP] leadership has prevented a food convoy 
from entering Aden. Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, instructed the Government to 
prepare this convoy within 24 hours, send it to Aden, and 
distribute it free of charge among the residents of Aden, the 
economic and commercial capital. 
  Deputy Prime Minister brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Qadir Ba Jammal 
explained that in implementation of the instructions of the 
brother chairman leader, the Government prepared a convoy of 100 
trailers carrying large quantities of various foodstuffs. 
  In a news conference attended by correspondents from the 
local, Arab, and international media in Sanaa, the brother 
deputy prime minister denied the allegations and falsehoods 
circulated by the trumpets of the gang of apostasy and secession 
to the effect that the aircraft of the forces of unity and 
constitutional legitimacy are launching raids on the Aden 
refinery. He said the forces of unity and constitutional forces 
are careful not to harm this refinery or other vital economic 
installations.
