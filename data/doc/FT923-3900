FT  10 SEP 92 / Poland may host Ford component factory
FORD, the US car maker, is considering setting up its first automotive
components joint venture in Poland.
It is negotiating the setting up of a plant near Warsaw to make seat covers
for use in its west European car assembly plants. If agreed, the project is
expected to involve an investment of about Dollars 50m (Pounds 25.1m).
Ford made its first move into component manufacturing in east Europe in
1990, with an Dollars 80m investment in Hungary for a plant to produce
ignition coils and fuel pumps. This plant, which began production earlier
this year, also supplies Ford vehicle assembly plants in western Europe.
The negotiations in Poland are part of a wider study undertaken by Ford of
Europe into the restructuring of its seat manufacturing operations. It is
considering contracting out seat assembly to an outside supplier to replace
its present in-house operations.
A decision is expected before the end of the year.
If Ford opts for an outside supplier, it is expected that the seat-making
operations would still be located close to the existing vehicle plants to
ensure quick delivery.
In the UK a move to out-source seat making would affect 220 jobs at Ford's
Dagenham plant and 270 at Halewood.
Honda of Japan is to build a plant in Belgium to supply aluminium intake
manifolds to its engine and car assembly plant in the UK.
