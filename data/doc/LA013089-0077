John H. Cleveland of Washington became the second Teamsters vice president to 
resign, clearing the way for him to be dropped as a defendant in a government 
racketeering case. The action by Cleveland and Robert H. Holmes, a vice 
president in Detroit, was part of an agreement with the Justice Department, 
said Deborah Corley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in New York. 
Corley said the agreement would be submitted for court approval. Holmes' 
resignation was announced as Teamsters leaders met in Washington to discuss a 
government proposal to settle the racketeering case. Cleveland made no public 
announcement of his resignation, but a union source confirmed Corley's account. 
The union rejected the settlement.
