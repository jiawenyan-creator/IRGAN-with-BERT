REGISTRATION OF ASSAULT GUNS 
In response to "Gun Owners Ignoring Law on Registration," Part A, Nov. 28: 
The Department of Justice claims that owners of these guns are not registering 
them as required. 
I sent in the form and my check two months ago, and have heard nothing. I can't 
believe they are that inefficient (not even cashing the check). I rather expect 
to see a lot of "sorry, we never received it" advice after Jan. 1, while lists 
of would-be registrants are sent to local police departments for weapons 
seizure at the first excuse. Those who are registering should do so by 
registered mail.
