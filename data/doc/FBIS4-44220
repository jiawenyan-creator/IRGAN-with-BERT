  [Text] Spanish Economics and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes 
has spoken to the relevant committee in the Senate about several 
topics related to his department such as the dollar's problems 
and the consequences on financial markets. Over to our reporter 
Manuel de Ramon. 
  [de Ramon] Financial markets might have just been through 48 
hours of instability. Calm might return slowly to the financial 
world. This is what Economics Finance Minister Pedro Solbes has 
just said in the Senate. However he admits that the problems 
were caused by the dollar's bad standing and that means that 
everything hinges on the dollar's value stabilizing. Over to 
Pedro Solbes. 
  [Begin Solbes recording] This morning it seems as though 
things are somewhat calmer. However it is true that we have 
just weathered a complicated 48 hours, very difficult hours. 
  It is true that the dollar is the root cause of this 
problem. 
And until its value stabilizes , until the U.S. markets become 
calmer, all the rest will continue to live with this unstable 
tendency. [end recording] 
  [de Ramon] Furthermore, Pedro Solbes has repeated that he is 
confident that the Spanish economy will grow over the next year 
by between 2.5 and 2.6 percent. After 1996 the rate of growth 
should be higher. 
  Minister Solbes believes that the Bank of Spain will 
maintain 
interest rates because there is no reason to change them.
