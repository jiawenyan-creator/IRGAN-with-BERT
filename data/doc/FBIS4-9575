  [Text] [Announcer Dorota Warakomska] Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejdzyk has addressed the prime minister with a request 
for the nomination of Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] Deputy 
Danuta Waniek as deputy minister in his ministry. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The head of the defense 
ministry 
called the candidature of Danuta Waniek a promising one. 
  [Begin Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk recording] This 
is a person who has a good legal preparation, with significant 
experience, and parliamentary experience, too. I judge that she 
will cope excellently with the fundamental issues that will be 
in the sphere of her responsibility. At issue here are the 
legislative processes that are so very important for the Army 
and for its reform and that have been so consistently neglected 
over these past few years. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] Danuta Waniek is the first person proposed 
by 
the SLD for a post of deputy minister in a presidential ministry 
and accepted by the head of the ministry in question. The 
president, despite his earlier opposition, expressed consent, 
after the Wednesday meeting with the SLD Parliamentary Club, for 
the introduction of representatives of the coalition into the 
Defense Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. 
  SLD Deputy Zbigniew Sobotka is being named as the most 
serious candidate for deputy minister of internal affairs, 
whereas Marek Siwiec, a member of the National Radio and 
Television Broadcasting Council [and also the editor in chief of 
the TRYBUNA daily and a SLD deputy], is being nominated for 
deputy foreign minister.
