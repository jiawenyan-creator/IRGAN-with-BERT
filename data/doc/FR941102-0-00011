 

The proposal generally exempted from the 16.3 registration statement and prospectus requirements offers
and sales of bank securities to sophisticated purchasers that satisfy the requirements of SEC Regulation D (17 CFR
230.501 through 230.508). SEC Regulation D sets forth rules governing the limited offer and sale of securities without
registration under the Securities Act, providing a safe harbor for compliance with sections 3(b) and 4(2) of the Securities
Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(b) and 77d(2)). 

The proposal also exempted from the 16.3 registration statement and prospectus requirements offers and sales
of bank issued securities in transactions that satisfy the abbreviated disclosure requirements of certain SEC rules.
Those rules require only limited disclosure to purchasers because of the particular circumstances of the types of
transactions. The rules include Rules 144 (17 CFR 230.144_Persons deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore
not underwriters), 144A (17 CFR 230.144A_Private resales of securities to institutions), 236 (17 CFR 230.236_Exemption
of shares offered in connection with certain transactions), and Regulation S (17 CFR 230.901 through 230.904_Rules
governing offers and sales made outside the United States without registration under the Securities Act of 1933).
In addition, the proposal exempted transactions that complied with the requirements of SEC Rules 701, 702T, and 703T
(17 CFR 230.701, 230.702T, and 230.703T), which cover offers and sales of securities pursuant to certain compensatory
benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation. 

The commenters largely agreed with the OCC's approach. Two commenters recommended that the OCC also exempt transactions
that comply with the SEC's Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through 230.263). Regulation A permits unregistered, public
offerings of up to $5 million in securities under certain specified conditions. 

The final rule adopts the exemptions from the registration and prospectus requirements included in the proposal,
and also includes an exemption for transactions that comply with Regulation A. (This exemption is discussed further
under ``Small Issues (16.8)'' of this preamble). This approach treats banks comparably to other corporations when
issuing small quantities of securities. 



Sales of Nonconvertible Debt (Section 16.6) 



The proposal provided an optional abbreviated registration system for offers and sales of nonconvertible debt if
those transactions met certain requirements. Offers and sales that met those requirements were deemed to be in compliance
with the Registration statement and prospectus (16.3), Form and content (16.15), and Periodic and current reports
(16.20) provisions of part 16. 

In particular, the proposal specified that: (1) The bank issuing the nonconvertible debt must have securities registered
under the Exchange Act or must be a subsidiary of a bank holding company that has securities registered under the Exchange
Act; (2) The insured depository institution subsidiaries of the registered bank holding company must constitute
at least 80% of the bank holding company's assets; (3) The debt must be offered and sold only to accredited investors
(defined in 17 CFR 230.501(a)); (4) The debt must be offered and sold by a reputable and experienced underwriter, not
affiliated with the bank; (5) The debt must be sold in minimum denominations of more than $100,000 and the notes cannot
be exchanged for notes in smaller denominations; (6) The debt must be rated investment quality; (7) Each purchaser
must receive an offering document describing the terms of the debt and incorporating the bank's latest Call Reports
and the bank or holding company's Exchange Act filings; (8) The offering document and any amendments must be filed
with the OCC within five days after first use; and (9) Any required filing fees must be submitted. 

The OCC designed the requirements of the abbreviated registration system to ensure that potential purchasers of
debt subject to the abbreviated registration system had access to necessary information on the issuing bank and commonly
controlled depository institutions, as well as the appropriate knowledge and experience to evaluate that information.


The OCC requested comment on whether this abbreviated registration system was necessary or appropriate. The OCC
received 11 comments on this issue. Although the commenters generally favored the abbreviated registration system,
they expressed different perspectives about the specific requirements of the system. A number stated that the OCC
should eliminate the requirement that nonconvertible debt be sold by an underwriter unaffiliated with the bank.
Several commenters agreed that the OCC needed to revise the abbreviated registration system to address the special
circumstances of federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.
