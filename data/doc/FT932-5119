FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: Reneging on radicalism
Sir, The Liberal Democrats' policy paper on housing ('Lib Dems suggest early
end to mortgage tax relief', June 1) shows how much the party is distancing
itself from its radical foundations. Opposition parties are now pursuing
strategies for electoral popularity above all else, fudging answers to the
most fundamental questions of reform. By the time of the next general
election the UK may be faced with a choice in which the incumbent government
presents the only radical agenda.
The opposition parties' failure to tackle the issue of the mortgage interest
subsidy that seriously distorts the UK housing market demonstrates their
political timidity. It is a tribute to Mr Lamont that in 1991 he restricted
the subsidy to the basic rate. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, would
be wise to continue with the course of reform this autumn.
The economic recovery is likely not only to raise the cost of reform but
also to make it more politically difficult. The 1991 Budget was, amid the
country's economic ills, highly radical, redirecting the economy towards
greater fiscal efficiency and macroeconomic stability. Mr Lamont will have
been sacrificed in vain if this radicalism is curtailed in the name of
electoral popularity.
