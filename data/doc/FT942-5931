FT  02 JUN 94 / People: Holder moves up at General Accident
Barrie Holder, 48, General Accident's finance director, has been appointed a
deputy chief executive. This increases speculation that he might take over
as chief executive of Scotland's largest insurer when Nelson Robertson, 60,
retires.
Holder, a Yorkshire-born accountant, joined GA in 1967. He spent a year in
New Zealand in 1989 sorting out GA's expensive acquisition of New Zealand
Insurance. He is the group's finance director and has now added
responsibility for the group's fast-growing life operations to his
portfolio.
Australian Bob Scott, 52, who has been responsible for reorganising the
group's sluggish UK business, has also been appointed a deputy chief
executive. His responsibilities have been extended to include the
international division. Although Scott only joined GA following its 1987
takeover of NZI, his rapid promotion suggests that he has impressed the
group's traditionally conservative directors.
Meanwhile, New Zealander Russell Evans, 55, another NZI veteran who is now
in charge of GA's corporate planning, has been appointed a general manager.
GA Life's general manager, Bill Jack, a 49-year-old Glaswegian, has been
appointed general manager (life) of the parent company.
