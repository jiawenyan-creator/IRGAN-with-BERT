<F P=106> [Report by V. Kornev (Federation of Independent Trade Unions </F>
of Russia Information Center): "Siren Will Call to Strike"] 
  [Text] At a meeting with journalists, Nikolay Zinovyev, 
secretary of the Russian Association for the Defense Sectors of 
Industry Executive Committee, confirmed the defense sector 
workers' readiness to conduct an all-Russia protest action 9 
June. 
  "In accordance with the draft budget," he stated, "the funds 
allocated by the treasury for the purchase of weapons and 
military hardware will be decreased by a factor of five and a 
half. The state order in this sphere is at present funded by 3 
percent, and the state's debt to the defense sectors this year 
was 1 trillion rubles." 
  A number of trade unions in the association have adopted a 
decision not to stop production for 10-15 minutes, as had been 
announced earlier. After all, strikes in the defense industry 
are banned by law. 
  Nevertheless, a protest action will take place. After a 
signal from the plant sirens, defense industry workers in the 
Russian regions held meetings and rallies between 1000 and 1300 
Moscow time.
