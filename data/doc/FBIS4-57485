  [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (EFE) -- Today, the Christian 
Social Revolutionary Party (PRSC), which proposed the reelection 
of President Joaquin Balaguer, challenged the alliance between 
the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party [PRD] of Jose 
Francisco Pena Gomez and the Democratic Union (UD) before the 
Central Electoral Board (JCE). 
  In a document presented to the JCE, the PRSC said the 
alliance of the PRD with the UD, which is led by Fernando 
Alvarez Bogart, has a form defect because, when it was 
registered, other political parties were not informed as 
required by law. 
  Alvarez Bogart is Pena Gomez' vice presidential running mate 
and, according to the official JCE vote count, has obtained over 
51,000 votes. Alvarez Bogart was a member of the PRSC, from 
which he resigned when Balaguer, 87, announced his decision to 
run for reelection. 
  The PRSC challenged the PRD-UD alliance three months after 
the electoral campaign began and four days after the general 
elections, at which point the JCE has not yet reported the 
official provisional results of the vote count. According to 
the latest official JCE report, with 97.65 percent of the 
polling stations accounted for, Balaguer was ahead of Pena Gomez 
by only 29,590 votes, or 1.01 percent of the vote.
