FT  03 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Thailand issues offshore bank
licences
THAILAND has granted offshore banking (OBU) licences to 47 local and foreign
banks, out of more than 50 applicants, as part of a scheme aimed at making
the country a regional financial centre.
The Thai finance ministry said those granted licences under the Bangkok
International Banking Facility (BIBF) include 12 foreign banks with branches
in Thailand, 20 foreign banks with representative offices or with no prior
presence, and all 15 local commercial banks.
Foreign bankers had assumed that fewer than 10 of the Thai banks would be
granted OBU licences because the smaller operations might be unable to meet
required capital adequacy ratios.
Under BIBF, banks will be able to take advantage of tax incentives for
regional activities, although it is not clear if Thailand will be able to
compete against centres in Singapore and Hong Kong.
The corporate income tax rate under BIBF will be 10 per cent instead of the
usual 30 per cent. Bangkok Bank said in a research paper that BIBF would
reduce the cost of foreign funds brought in to finance the Thai current
account deficit.
