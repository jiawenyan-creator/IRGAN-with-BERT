FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: TransAtlantic improves to Pounds 30m
TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the property and life assurance group which obtained
a London listing last year, yesterday announced a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 28.1m to Pounds 30.2m for the six months to June 30.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said there had been 'solid progress' by the
property sector and an 'excellent advance by Sun Life in a very challenging
life insurance environment.'
'Taking into account our ambitious future plans, the company looks forward
to realising some of its exceptional potential in the period ahead,' he
said.
TransAtlantic is owned jointly by Liberty Life, the South African life
assurance company, and Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest
insurer. It owns 50 per cent of Sun Life Holdings, the UK life insurer, and
Capital &amp; Counties, the property company.
On June 2 the group announced that it held 3.01 per cent of Sun Alliance,
the UK insurer, as a 'strategic' investment. It said it was currently
concentrating its efforts in North America in its investigation of
opportunities to develop its interests in the international life insurance
business.
Property investment income from Capital &amp; Counties increased from Pounds 33m
to Pounds 36m.
Sun Life's new business results showed a growth in regular premiums of 36
per cent from Pounds 42.1m to Pounds 57.2m and a growth in single premiums
of 23 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn.
Net assets per share at June 30 stood at 272p, compared with 307p a year
earlier and 274p at December 31 1992.
A substantial take-up of the scrip dividend alternative for the 1992 final
resulted in a reduction in the tax charge from 30 per cent to 18 per cent.
This helped earnings per share rise 18 per cent from 5.08p to 5.98p. An
unchanged interim dividend of 6p is declared.
