CONTEMPORARY CRAFTS MARKET RETURNS 
Southern California's accelerating arts scene is graced this weekend by the 
return of the Contemporary Crafts Market, a voluminous look, under one roof, at 
up-to-date American crafts and their progenitors. The market continues today, 
11 a.m.-8 p.m., and Sunday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m., at the Santa Monica Civic 
Auditorium, corner of Pico Boulevard and Main Street in Santa Monica. 
Among featured crafts will be precious and ornamental designer jewelry (more 
than 50 jewelers working in a variety of media are represented), handblown and 
etched glass, fine-wood furniture, crystal, handmade musical instruments, 
ceramics, textiles and wearable art, with artists on hand to discuss their 
wares and talents. Door-prize drawings -- including a gold-and-aquamarine ring 
by gold artist Glenn Dizon -- and live entertainment by T. Lou and his L.A. 
Zydeco Band also spice the occasion. 
"Our exhibitions in Santa Monica," said Roy Helms, director of the market, "are 
revealing the outstanding workmanship of the country's most dedicated craft 
artists, and we now see the positive impact on the West Coast art community." 
Admission to the market is $3.50. Information: (213) 829-2724.
