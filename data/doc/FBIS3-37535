  [Text] Groznyy February 17 TASS -- The dead body of 
Georgia's former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia was air-lifted 
today from Western Georgia to the capital of the Chechen 
Republic in southern Russia. 
  The corpse was dug up from the grave made under a barn in a 
remote Georgian village of Djikhaskari, a member of the Chechen 
delegation who witnessed the exhumation told ITAR-TASS on 
Thursday. 
  In conformity with the will of the late president's family, 
the exhumation was atttended only by official representatives 
from Georgia, Lithuania, and the russian regions of Chechnya and 
Ingushetia. No autopsy was made and the commission limited 
itself to "strictly visual" identification. 
  Later the body was transfered to the Georgian town of Senaki 
where it was identified by three Georgian medical scientists. 
  Gamsakhurdia will be eventually reburied in Groznyy 
according 
to the will of his next of kin. The former Georgian president 
spent the bigger part of his political exile in Russia's 
break-away Republic of Chechnya after he was toppled in January 
1992. 
  Last autumn, he returned to western Georgia in a bid to 
restore his presidential status, but his supporters were ousted 
from Georgia by the army loyal to the existing Tbilisi 
government of Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  Gamsakhurdia then reportedly took his life after being 
cornered by his enemies in a west Georgian village.
