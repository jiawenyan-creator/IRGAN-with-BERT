SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
The jury in Richard T. Silberman's money-laundering trial finished its fourth 
day of deliberations Friday, completing its first week of debate without a 
decision in the complex case. 
The jury passed no notes Friday and gave no indication when it might conclude 
its work. The jury resumes deliberations Tuesday. 
Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., is awaiting a verdict on seven felony counts. He is accused of laundering 
$300,000 that an undercover FBI agent allegedly told Silberman was the proceeds 
of Colombian cocaine dealing. 
If convicted, Silberman faces up to 75 years in prison. His trial, before U.S. 
District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, began May 1.
