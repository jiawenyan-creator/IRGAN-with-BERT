SUPERSONICS SIGN MCDANIEL FOR FIVE YEARS 
The Seattle SuperSonics, who lost unrestricted free agent Tom Chambers to the 
Phoenix Suns last year, announced Wednesday they have re-signed restricted free 
agent Xavier McDaniel to a five-year contract. 
Two years ago, center Alton Lister of the SuperSonics was a restricted free 
agent and got a multimillion dollar offer from the Suns. Seattle matched the 
Suns' offer sheet. 
SuperSonic President Bob Whitsitt said McDaniel's signing was essential to the 
team's future because "he's one of the players we've said we want to build this 
team around. 
"We made a commitment to him and to his teammates. We're just going to keep 
going toward our goal and that's to win a championship." 
McDaniel, a 6-foot-7 forward from Columbia, S.C., and Wichita State, had said 
he knew he would sign again with Seattle. He said he did not think about going 
out and getting an offer sheet. 
"A lot of things go through your mind during the course of a year," he said. 
"But we pretty much had everything agreed on and it was just a matter of time 
until we got everything done. By All-Star break, I knew I would be a Seattle 
SuperSonic. I should (be) set for life." 
McDanielaveraged 18.7 points in the playoffs this year and 20.5 points during 
the regular season.
