TIME MAGAZINE TO WORK WITH PBS 'NEWSHOUR' 
Time magazine has agreed to provide PBS' "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" with 
periodic documentary reports and occasional reports from Time correspondents, 
officials said Friday. 
"NewsHour" now has 11 correspondents worldwide, with contributions from 
reporters at PBS stations around the United States. 
Under the agreement, Time will supply the program with documentary reports 
co-produced with "NewsHour" and will provide Time correspondents for live 
interviews when breaking news warrants.
