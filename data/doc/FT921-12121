FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Citicorp unveils new guidelines
on lending
CITICORP, the largest US bank which is struggling to cut costs and contain
loan losses, has introduced a new set of US corporate lending guidelines
that aims to improve loan pricing and reduce concentrations in specified
sectors.
The new lending guidelines, contained in a 50-page spiral-bound set of
photocopied text and graphs known inside the bank as the 'blue book', comes
in the wake of sharp criticism on Wall Street of the bank's credit policies.
Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister who on March 1 takes over
as a new vice-chairman of the bank, will oversee implementation of the new
lending policies, which are to be phased in over the next 18 months.
Mr Ruding will have responsibility for Citicorp's corporate banking
business, which until recently was known as the Japan, Europe and North
America (Jena) division.
Last year, the Jena division suffered losses of more than Dollars 1bn -
nearly four times higher than a year earlier.
At the end of 1991, Jena had Dollars 79bn of total assets, of which Dollars
7.7bn were non-performing loans. The biggest problem area was in US
commercial real estate, where Dollars 4.8bn of the Dollars 13bn loan book
was classified as non-performing.
Mr John Reed, the Citicorp chairman, has taken personal charge of the US
commercial real estate loan portfolio, which is excluded from the new
guidelines. The new lending system is intended to cover some Dollars 55bn of
US corporate loans.
