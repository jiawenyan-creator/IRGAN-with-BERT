  [Text] Brazilian industries have had to undergo deep 
structural changes in order to adapt to the crisis and to the 
opening of the market to imported products. The private sector 
has managed to preserve the working capital, has postponed 
investments to increase its operating capacity, and has 
channeled its resources into improving quality and productivity 
so as to be able to live with high inflation rates. 
  According to Price Waterhouse Director Celio Lora, the 
country has the capacity to make investments. The Brazilian 
potential for domestic and loan capital ranges between $120 
million and $150 million, which awaits only some indications 
that the economy has been stabilized, and businessmen's trust. 
<H5>  Financial System </H5>
  Mailson da Nobrega, former [finance] minister and 
consultant, 
is of the opinion that no organized company "would try to enter 
the financial system in order to make a profit." Da Nobrega 
notes that the climate of economic uncertainty has brought about 
the postponement of a considerable number of projects. "And 
liquid companies have decided to wait until things clear up," he 
said. 
  Technological modernization and the reorganization of the 
industrial infrastructure are the main areas in which industrial 
investments are made using domestic capital. Brastemp Director 
Ruy de Campos Filho states that "we are never going to waver on 
whether or not to invest because of the ups and downs of 
inflation, which is an everyday occurrence in our country." 
<H5>  Productivity </H5>
  Brastemp has planned to invest $35 million in 1994. Campos 
Filho reported that those financial resources will be earmarked 
for the replacement of obsolete machinery and for technological 
development. He notes that the company is not contemplating 
increasing its operating capacity. Data provided by Lora 
indicate that productivity has improved over the last year, thus 
confirming the adjustments made by companies in their industrial 
infrastructures. 
  Lora stated that several economic indicators reveal the 
effects caused by optimizing operations. The idle labor force 
level fell from 23 percent in 1992 to 18 percent this year. 
Idle capacity also declined from 32 percent in 1992 to 28 
percent in 1993.

  The vice president of the National Confederation of 
Industries (CNI), Mario Amato, states that "despite everything, 
industries are trying to find a way to survive." In his view, 
"being an entrepreneur is at present a curse." Living with the 
crisis has forced companies to devise new operational mechanisms 
in trying to downsize their structures. "We do not take in new 
employees because we do not know what is in store for us," he 
says. The purchase cycle has been shortened, orders are made 
only "in time of need," and intermediation is on the increase. 
  Angelo Andrea Matarazzo, chairman of the Matarazzo 
Metallurgical Company, believes that the profile of Brazilian 
companies has changed. Their structures have become less 
cumbersome and less expensive; their hierarchical levels have 
been simplified; and they have a greater capacity to quickly 
react to their clients' requests and to maintain strict control 
of their stocks. "My company has been getting ready for this 
for a long time," notes Matarazzo. He states that clients' 
purchasing habits have been changed due to recession. Companies 
are no longer in a position to program orders, and decisions are 
made on a short-term basis.

  According to Da Nobrega, agricultural companies, for 
example, 
have developed financing mechanisms to be able to operate 
without the benefits of the government's rural credits. Farmers 
who grow agricultural products for export such as soybeans, 
oranges, and coffee have managed to close deals on the futures 
market for their products, and have adopted innovative measures.
