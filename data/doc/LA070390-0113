BOMBS WRECK BANK, TWO OFFICES IN SPAIN 
Three bombs wrecked a bank and two employment offices in the northwestern 
Spanish ports of La Coruna and El Ferrol on Monday, officials said. 
No one was hurt. Officials said the attacks bore the hallmarks of the 
little-known Guerrilla Army of the Free Galician People, which campaigns for 
the independence of the impoverished northwestern region of Galicia.
