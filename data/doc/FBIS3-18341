  [Text] Britain and the United States have launched an 
initiative to help rebuild war-torn Sarajevo, Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd told MPs today. 
  In a Commons statement, Mr Hurd said the initiative had been 
taken after talks between President Clinton and the Prime 
Minister, who is currently in the United States. 
  The aim was to "normalise" life in the city. 
  "A joint British-U.S. civil planning mission will be 
established to work with the Sarajevo City authorities, the EU 
[European Union] and the UN to assess the requirements for 
restoring public utilities in the city." 
  The move follows the lifting of the seige of Sarejevo after 
NATO forces threatened military intervention. 
  Mr Hurd was reporting on yesterday's incident in which four 
aircraft in breach of the no-fly zone were shot down by NATO 
planes. He said the action should leave the warring parties "in 
no doubt of our earnest in implementing decisions in Bosnia. 
We shall continue our active work with the international 
community on how to build on the progress in Sarajevo and reach 
a negotiated settlement." 
  The UN would be drawing up plans to assess the feasibility 
of 
breaking the seige of other cities and towns, including Mostar, 
Vitez and Maglaj. 
  "Reports are coming in from Moscow that the Bosnian Serb 
leader, Mr Karadzic, has reached agreement with the Russian 
foreign minister on how Tuzla airport might be reopened with 
Bosnian Serb consent. If confirmed this would be a welcome 
step."
