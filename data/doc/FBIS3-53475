  [Text] Cairo, Jan 16 (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first 
Foreign [Ministry] undersecretary and director of the 
Presidential Office for Political Affairs, today said contacts 
between President Husni Mubarak and the Palestinian leadership 
would continue over the coming few days. 
  These contacts aim at giving peace efforts an impetus to 
help 
reach a PLO-Israel Agreement on issues regarding transfer of 
power to the PLO in Gaza and Jericho as a step towards 
establishing Palestinian functions in other parts of the West 
Bank within five months, al-Baz said. 
  Egypt will pursue efforts and contacts with all parties 
concerned to overcome difficulties blocking application of the 
Palestinian- Israeli Declaration of Principles, he told MENA.
