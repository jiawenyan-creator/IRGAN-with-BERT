  [Text] London, April 16 (XINHUA) -- A British Sea Harrier 
warplane was shot down over the Moslem town of Gorazde in 
Eastern Bosnia this afternoon, the REUTER NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  Reports said the pilot has been rescued. 
  It was the first NATO jet to be shot down since the 
alliance's monitoring of the U.N. No-Fly Zone over Bosnia in 
April 1993. 
  The BBC radio reported that the U.N. forces in Bosnia had 
asked for NATO air strike to stop Serb offensive on Gorazde.
