FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Only the cynics find crumbs of comfort
 -John Authers looks at the stock market's leaders and laggards over the
year's first half
STOCK MARKET cynics have had a good six months. Some would claim that making
money out of equities is all about following bid rumours, and nothing to do
with the homework of share valuation.
Such cynics might also claim that no shares beat the market indefinitely,
and companies which come out top one year will be bottom the next.
This caricatured view is too extreme to be sustainable, but the London stock
market's performance over the first half of this year shows why people might
believe it.
Midland Bank has more than doubled in price since January 1. This has little
to do with fundamentals, as the bank has long been regarded by the City as
British banking's weakest link. Not, on the face of it, the soundest of
investments.
But once Midland decided to throw in the towel and give up its independence,
long-suffering shareholders enjoyed a bumper time. The shares leapt 76p to
329p after the agreed offer by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank was announced, to
the surprise of the market, on March 17.
Speculation at the time correctly suggested that a contested bid would
develop which limited profit-taking.
It also meant that the offer from Lloyds Bank, when it was finally announced
on April 28, did not lead to much reaction in the share price  - by now the
news was in the price, which only rose 13p to 394p.
The shares still strengthened 31p to 452p on June 2, when Hongkong Bank
announced its improved offer.
Rumours that Midland would surrender to a takeover bid had circulated the
market for a long time before March. However, the rumours were not reflected
in the price. Midland shares did look cheap at the beginning of the year.
But it would have been hard to justify as a 'blue chip' stock. Those who
could afford to take on slightly more risk and regarded Midland as a
'special situation' would have done well.
Some of the year's other top performers also benefited from bid rumours.
Guardian Royal Exchange produced results which were better than expected,
but lingering speculation that European predators are planning a competitive
bid for the company has done much to prop up the company's price throughout
the year.
Meanwhile, there is a startling addition to the group of laggards - British
Petroleum. Few companies can seem so eminently suitable for widows and
orphans to invest in as BP, but shares tumbled 30.55 per cent in the first
six months of the year.
Again this was due primarily to an event which took the market by surprise -
the Dallas-like boardroom coup which ousted chairman Robert Horton last
week.
This should not have had any great effect on the underlying value of the
company but the share price dropped 34p to 209p the following day. BP had
not had a good six months - which helps to explain Horton's departure - but
it would not have fallen into the laggards' column without this sudden
shock. More grist to the mill of those who believe the market is a
speculators' casino.
Other disquietingly big names among the laggards include Barclays, British
Aerospace and BET.
BP's announcement also brought back worries about dividends. Royal Insurance
passed its dividend earlier this year, while many others, including British
Steel, renowned for its high yield, made substantial cuts to pay-outs. This
has led, according to Maureen Hyland, equity strategist at James Capel, to a
switch into defensive sectors from capital goods 'recovery' sectors which
had put in strong growth at the beginning of the year. For example, Other
Industrial Materials rose 18.65 per cent, Motors rose 17.16 per cent, and
Textiles 16.05 per cent.
Dividend worries and a desire for security primed the sector which seems to
be the big gainer of the year - water. Four water companies are in the top
ten, aided by the election, which removed the political risk affecting the
sector, while water is easily the strongest sector, with a rise of 31.44 per
cent (the next, food retailing, registered 20.87 per cent).
People are unlikely to stop drinking water and, with dividends well
protected, this sector might take over as the destination for income
investors.
But Nick Train, of GT Management, has doubts - his advice to those who want
to invest in water for the safe dividends is to buy a gilt instead. The
yield will be higher while political, social and economic pressures should
all conspire against the cosy and protected monopoly profits on which water
companies can now rely.
Further evidence to support the cynics comes when this year's
weak-performing sectors are compared with last year's.
Twelve months ago, the headline for this story was 'Game, Set and Match to
Wellcome'. Pharmaceutical companies came first, second, third and sixth over
the first six months of 1991, and the Health &amp; Household sector was the top
performer with 36.1 per cent growth. It retained this ranking over 12
months.
So far this year, the sector is third from bottom, having dropped 15.63 per
cent. Wellcome, Glaxo and Fisons, pharmaceutical companies all, are in the
bottom ten.
This is in spite of the market's overall poor performance. Pharmaceuticals'
strength last year was based on its defensive qualities. Whatever the health
of the economy, people will always fall ill.
Particular problems with Wellcome, gearing up for its current massive
flotation, and Fisons, which plummeted 29 per cent in one day after issuing
a profits warning, hampered the sector.
Property was the weakest sector, with a fall of 19.38 per cent. A bad six
months when the problems of Canary Wharf were only the most eye-catching to
hit the sector, made this almost inevitable.
Otherwise the performance of the entire market has been a rag-bag, with few
clear trends. The market has done nothing special, with the FT-A 500 Share
up just 2.52 per cent over six months, and the FT-A All Share up 2.44 per
cent.
All this in spite of the euphoria which greeted the Conservative election
victory in April. Then, the FT-SE shot up 136.2 to 2,572.6, the biggest
one-day rise since October 1987.
The main FT-SE index had risen only 8.3 per cent during the Tories'
1987-1992 term, and many observers felt that the time had come for shares to
take off again.
Amid the euphoria there was a spate of new issues, unequalled since the 1987
bull market. The list included Wellcome, Guinness Peat Aviation and the
Daily Telegraph.
The excitement lasted six weeks. Then reality intruded. Train put it this
way: 'That mood has unwound in the last six weeks as we have come to realise
that interest rates are not coming down, and that the rest of the world is
still struggling under these extraordinary high real interest rates.'
He remains pessimistic for the future, pointing out that UK pension funds
already have around 80 per cent of their funds invested in equities - he
does not see where extra money is going to come from.
The GPA flotation was pulled while the Telegraph's new issue flopped and the
market descended into formless wandering. If you look at the market over a
six-month period, the general election need never have happened.
A strong economic recovery would shake the market out of its worried state,
and cause a switch into 'recovery' stocks, such as those involved in
manufacturing, according to Hyland. She remains optimistic that a recovery
will fuel the market out of its wandering.
There is a little cheer to be had from the smaller stocks. Proteus, a
pharmaceutical company which has announced both a loss and a rights issue
this year, is the only stock of any size to beat Midland. It is using
computer technology in transatlantic joint ventures to develop drugs for
fish, and DNA-binding products, and has seen its share price rise by 157.44
per cent over the first six months of 1992. As it is still producing losses,
this at least reflects a refreshing lack of cynicism in the market.
Then, Yuletide cheer, in this sceptical age, delivered growth of 69.62 per
cent for Park Food Group, which specialises in distributing Christmas
hampers. Sales increased 14.7 per cent for Christmas 1991, so there was some
festivity about.
Some other leading smaller companies, such as Amstrad, boosted by satellite
dishes, and First National Finance, were recovering from serious share price
falls last year.
The year's financial tragedies helped turned some smaller companies into
laggards - the property sector's dismal performance accounts for Regalian,
Kunick, and Greycoat, and will also have harmed the construction companies
BM and Birse.
It is not hard to guess at the reasons for the 59.55 per cent drop in the
price of Sturge Holdings, an underwriting agent at Lloyd's. Meanwhile,
Harland Simon, the control systems specialist which lags everyone having
dropped 89.01 per cent, could in part blame Robert Maxwell for the profits
warning it posted in February.
Contracts with Mirror Group Newspapers and Maxwell Communications took
Pounds 2m out of predicted profits, while Pounds 750,000 was put aside to
cover disputed debts to the two Maxwell companies. This time last year,
Maxwell Communications was one of the 'leaders', having grown 35.1 per cent
in the first six months of 1991.
No wonder some are cynical about the stock market.
