FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US data put bourses back on
upgrade
After their enthusiastic reaction to the US election results, bourses pulled
back a little yesterday morning, as if they had decided to wait for next
Tuesday's FOMC meeting and the forecast rise in US interest rates, writes
Our Markets Staff.
However, the atmosphere changed with the fall of 0.5 per cent in the US
producer price index in October, following a similar drop in September. 'It
is the first back-to-back fall in PPI that we have had in three years,' said
Mr John Blackley at James Capel yesterday. Capel's economists were still
looking for a US rate increase next week, he added, but there was now a
feeling that maybe 50 basis points would be enough.
FRANKFURT's Dax index moved from a session's fall of 14.07 at 2,082.40,
through a post-bourse low of around 2,076 to an Ibis-indicated close of
2,098.04. Turnover fell from DM8bn to DM5.7bn.
The main impetus for the afternoon upsurge came from traders who had to
cover their short positions earlier in the week; some of them were taking a
positive attitude to the market by the end of the day.
Financials did well, Allianz and Deutsche Bank showing gains of DM28 to
DM2,408 and DM8.70 to DM759.20 at the end of Ibis trading. Cyclicals were
muted or worse, Linde, the engineer, falling DM20.50 to DM895.
Results news was good for Veba, where a 49 per cent jump in profits took the
energy based group up DM8.80 to DM522, but bad for Siemens, although it
recovered to close just 40 pfennigs down at DM625 after hours. Meanwhile,
German newspapers picked up a dated but derogatory story from the US on
Schering's BetaSeron prospects, and the pharmaceuticals group dropped
DM18.50 to DM960.50.
PARIS remained firm in spite of falling back slightly at the close. The
CAC-40 added 4.49 at 1,948.35 in turnover of some FFr4bn.
French financial markets will be closed today for the Armistice Day holiday.
Carrefour, the retailer, went against the trend, losing FFr127 or 5 per cent
at FFr2,171, as speculation mounted that a report damaging to the group was
to be published in one of the domestic newspapers during the session. In the
event no such article appeared and the company said that it planned to ask
the stock market authorities to investigate the fall in the share price.
Eurotunnel advanced 2 per cent to FFr20.95 in very high volume as local
investors took up positions ahead of the official opening of the Channel
tunnel to fare paying rail passengers on Monday.
ZURICH talked about switches as the SMI index closed 12.3 higher at 2,602.7.
Swiss Re registered rose SFr26 to SFr783 ahead of an analysts' meeting with
the company and Zurich Insurance balanced this, to an extent, with a fall of
SFr6 to SFr1,235.
Similarly, pharmaceuticals dealers said that investors were moving into Ciba
and Sandoz, up SFr15 to SFr764 and SFr6 to SFr667 respectively, and out of
Roche certificates, which fell SFr55 to SFr5,890.
AMSTERDAM retreated as overall activity was affected by weakness in Royal
Dutch after the oil group reported its third-quarter results. The AEX index
dipped 0.80 to 410.74.
Royal Dutch left analysts with contrasting views. There were some who
considered that operating income was below expectations, while others, such
as James Capel, believed that they were 'pretty solid'. Nevertheless, the
view of the Dutch investor was to sell on the day, and the shares lost Fl
2.30 at Fl 189.00.
Lehman Brothers commented earlier this week that it was maintaining its
overweight position in Dutch equities on the basis that the quality of
earnings and dividend growth made the market attractive relative to markets
such as Germany, Belgium or Italy.
The one major worry clouding the horizon, said Lehman, remained the market's
historic exposure to the US. 'Of the main nine European equity markets, the
Dutch would be the most vulnerable to the expected correction in US equity
prices.'
MILAN was supported by domestic strength in bonds as well as external
factors which helped the Comit index to a gain of 5.28 at 636.17.
Cir saw one of the best performances, rising L77 to L1,932, with rumours
continuing that the group might soon dispose of one of its assets.
In the insurance sector, Fondiaria impressed with a gain of L420 to L11,720
amid various reports that the company might launch an offer for the 10 per
cent of its subsidiary Fondiaria Assicurazioni that it did not already own.
Credito Romagnolo added L290 at L16,900 on speculation that Cariplo, the
savings bank, might launch a counter-offer to the bid announced by Credito
Italiano, up L33 at L1,659. Ambroveneto, which is also subject to a takeover
bid from BCI, fell L65 to L4,385, while the predator gained L50 at L3,635.
MADRID came back from a day's holiday and reflected two days of gains: the
general index, covering the two-day period, rose 5.49 or 1.9 per cent to
299.34; the Ibex, real-time index, traded in Barcelona and Valencia on
Wednesday, showed a one-day rise of 25.12 or 0.8 per cent at 3,232.29.
Turnover was Pta36.4bn. Banks, weak in the morning, were no better than
mixed at the end of the day, and ADR stocks were only a little better than
that on average. The most sizeable gains came from the construction sector,
which has tended to exaggerate sentiment: Cubiertas moved ahead Pta450 to
Pta8,750, FCC Pta560 to Pta12,790 and Huarte Pta65 to Pta1,460.
