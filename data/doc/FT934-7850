FT  18 NOV 93 / Observer: Clear enough
As South Africa's leaders put the finishing touches to the interim
constitution, would-be designers of a new national flag have been flooding
the multi-party negotiating council - in charge of picking a fitting
post-apartheid emblem - with their ideas.
Bombarded by some 70,000 submissions from the public, the council whittled
them down to six - and then discarded those, calling in ad agencies
(including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Ogilvy &amp; Mather) for a rethink. But
Observer just can't understand why the powers that be did not go ahead with
an early entry; a see-through piece of plastic, depicting transparency in
government.
