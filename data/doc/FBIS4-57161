  [Excerpt] The executive branch has suddenly decided to 
replace retired General Marcial Samaniego, defense vice 
minister, for "sidestepping the appropriate bureaucratic 
channels" in proposing the dispatch of Paraguayan troops to join 
UN peace missions abroad. The news was confirmed by Defense 
Minister Hugo Estigarribia. Gen. Cesar Rafael Cramer was 
installed this morning, replacing Samaniego. 
  "Regrettably some bureaucratic channels, such as the 
president of the Republic and the foreign minister, were 
sidestepped. Gen. Samaniego, in eagerness and good faith, 
omitted going through these channels and committed the country 
on his own. The president then replaced him," the defense 
minister said, in explaining why Decree 3582 was issued. 
  Samaniego had spoken to the military person responsible for 
UN peace missions without communicating this to other state 
authorities. Besides, Samaniego also announced an Armed Forces 
"social action" plan in the country's conflictive areas, which 
was understood as a sort of sly and improper military 
intervention in domestic affairs. [passage omitted]
