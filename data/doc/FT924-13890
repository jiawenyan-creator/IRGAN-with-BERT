FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Exports offset Highland home downturn
STRONG growth in export sales of The Famous Grouse scotch whisky helped
Highland Distilleries to recover from first-half setbacks and increase full
year pre-tax profits 2 per cent from Pounds 28.16m to Pounds 28.74m.
Exports of the company's premium scotch brand rose 29 per cent in value and
16 per cent in volume compared with overall industry export gains of 12 per
cent and 4 per cent respectively.
Earnings per share for the year ended August 31 were maintained at last
year's 15.1p. A final dividend of 4.55p (4.14p) lifts the total payout to
6p, an 8.9 per cent increase.
Operating profit declined from Pounds 22.41m to Pounds 21.92m on turnover 4
per cent higher at Pounds 169.4m (Pounds 163.37m).
Export sales of Famous Grouse amounted to Pounds 25.5m compared with Pounds
19.9m in the previous year. Distribution through Remy Cointreau secured
increased sales in a number of European markets including France, Sweden,
the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal.
Highland now exports 37 per cent of its whisky. Overseas sales of Famous
Grouse have risen from 50,000 cases in 1975 to 750,000 cases.
Volumes declined 6 per cent in the UK market where overall Scotch sales were
11 per cent down - a trend which provoked strong criticism of the UK
government's taxation policy on spirits from Mr John Goodwin, chairman. 'The
complicated and illogical tax system reduces UK employment and damages the
balance of payments,' he complained.
Famous Grouse, the best-selling whisky in Scotland with a 24.5 per cent
share, consolidated its number two position in the UK as a whole, raising
its market share from 13.3 per cent to 14.2 per cent. Prices were increased
11.5 per cent in the UK and 8.6 per cent overseas.
Sales outside the group of new and mature whisky for blending were 30 per
cent lower than last year as customers reduced stocks. Industry production
was cut 7 per cent in the first half of 1992 following last year's 4.4 per
cent reduction. Highland's distilleries are now running at 60 per cent of
capacity.
Cash flow generated Pounds 10m of funds and net gearing was reduced from 13
to 6 per cent.
