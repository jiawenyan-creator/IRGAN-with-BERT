FT  30 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Mobile phone row in UAE
Mobile phone dealers in the United Arab Emirates face losses running into
millions of dollars because of a precipitate decision by the country's state
telecommunications monopoly to ban new customers from its mobile phone
network.
Would-be subscribers in the UAE have been told to wait for the launch of a
new, more expensive digital cellular network later this year, although the
existing analogue network is believed to have spare capacity.
Etisalat, the UAE's state telecoms monopoly, announced the ban in a
newspaper advertisement early last month.
According to Middle East Mobile magazine, the announcement has left mobile
phone dealers with useless stock worth around Dollars 5.4m for the analogue
network.
Dealers are threatening to sue Etisalat for compensation.
Two digital networks, built to the pan-European GSM standard, are under
construction in the UEA, one by AT&amp;T, the US supplier, the other by a
consortium of Motorola of the US and Siemens of Germany. Both will be
operated by Etisalat.
