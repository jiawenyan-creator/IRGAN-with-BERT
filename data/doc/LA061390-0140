NIBBLES AND BITS 
San Francisco-based Community Arts Inc. has been chosen by the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors to curate the inaugural exhibit of an arts program at the 
new John Wayne Airport Terminal, slated to be dedicated Sept. 7. The nonprofit 
firm has been coordinating San Francisco International Airport's exhibition 
program for 10 years, a county official said Tuesday. 
The inaugural exhibit, expected to last through December, will focus on Orange 
County artists. 
Seminal British punk-era band Wire will not perform Friday at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre as originally announced. No replacement has been set for Wire, 
which was scheduled to open for Erasure. A spokeswoman for Avalon Attractions, 
which books Irvine Meadows shows, did not give a reason for the change. 
"Parents Come Out," a video that profiles six families and how they cope with 
the news that a child is gay or lesbian, will air today through Friday on 
Irvine's public-access cable station, Channel 3. The 30-minute video was 
produced by the San Francisco chapter of Parents and Friends of Gays and 
Lesbians. The screenings, at 8 p.m. today and 7:30 p.m. Thursday and Friday, 
are sponsored by Irvine Citizens United, a group formed last year to combat 
Measure N, the Irvine initiative that eventually eliminated protections against 
discrimination based on sexual orientation from the city's human rights 
ordinance.
