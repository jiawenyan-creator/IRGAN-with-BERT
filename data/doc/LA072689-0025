MUSIC REVIEW; 
WEISS DUO CLOSES CHAMBER SERIES 
Imaginative programming is seldom the hallmark of summer concerts, particularly 
outdoors. It has been at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, however, where the 
Weiss Duo Monday gave the third and final concert of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic-sponsored chamber music series. 
Walton's 1950 Sonata is a quirky, two-movement vehicle for heated abstraction. 
It makes vague points with passionate relish, in a sort of rhetorically 
impressionistic style. 
Violinist Sidney and pianist Jeanne Weiss supported Walton's diffuse music with 
considerable eloquence, particularly in the more introspective variations of 
the second movement. They have recorded the piece and bring obvious affection 
and well-practiced team-work to the work. But the results proved stubbornly 
underwhelming Monday. 
Chavez's 1924 Sonatina is much more articulate, and provided the duo with fully 
realized opportunity for direct, serious communication. The Philharmonic 
concertmaster brought interpretive nobility and technical flamboyance to the 
task. 
For all the violinist's strength in urgent sentiments and virtuoso flourishes, 
it was the Andante cantabile movement that succeeded best in the Opus 18 Sonata 
by a young Richard Strauss. There the Weisses combined in quiet instrumental 
song of pointed, unexaggerated charm and sophisticated color. 
Mozart's comparatively innocent Sonata in C, K. 296, received lithe, blithe, 
eminently stylish playing from Jeanne Weiss. Her husband's effort sounded 
rather square, however -- sturdy, but truly comfortable only in the sweetly 
poignant middle movement. 
Elegant lyricism was the Weisses' strength, as they proved again in their 
Rachmaninoff encore, "Daisies."JOHN HENKEN
