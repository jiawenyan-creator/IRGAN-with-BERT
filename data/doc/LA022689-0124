TELEVISION ARREST 
It was with sad resignation that I read about Paul Bloom, Channel 39's reporter 
for the "Crime Watch" program, and his decision to have William Hammond 
arrested during a television interview ("Activist Couple Question Ethics of TV 
Reporter in On-Camera Arrest," Feb. 11). 
Bloom has been dropped as anchorman and now appears to be joining a growing 
trend toward sensationalist (I hesitate to use the word) journalism. In his 
defense, Bloom avers that Hammond was "a wanted criminal" and he was only doing 
his civic duty by setting up the public arrest of this man. It also seems clear 
that Bloom believed this leader of San Diego's homeless to be a "dangerous" man 
who should be returned to prison. 
One can only wonder, then, that if these assertions are true, why didn't Bloom 
urge Hammond's immediate arrest prior to air time? Surely if the authorities 
felt him to be a major threat to society, hopefully they wouldn't have waited 
until the taped interview. To wait, however, until the time of the interview 
and then in a coordinated fashion have the arrest be the highlight of the 
program can only underscore the desire of this reporter to join in a growing 
trend with others who seek to be more TV "personalities" than empirical, 
critical and professional purveyors of the news.
