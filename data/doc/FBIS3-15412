  [Text] Riga March 4 TASS -- Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs called for flexible tactics in negotiations with 
Russia for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia. "A 
reasonable compromise with Russia not only meets the interests 
of Latvia but is of importance for Europe as well," he said. 
  On Thursday the Sejm members discussed the condition set by 
the Russian side during the discussion on the troop pullout and 
concerning a strategic facility, the radar at Skrunda. 
  Russia agrees to withdraw troops by August 31 if the radar 
remains operational for another five years and two months and if 
social guarantees for the military pensioners and members of 
their families are ensured. Otherwise, troops will be withdrawn 
according to the time-table drawn up by Russia, said Sergey 
Zotov, leader of the Russian delegation at the negotiations. 
  Sejm members' opinions over the issue diverged and they 
decided to examine it once again soon.
