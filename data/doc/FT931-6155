FT  03 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC asks Gatt to probe steel row
THE European Commission yesterday announced further moves under the disputes
procedure of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to resolve EC-US
tensions provoked by Washington's decision to impose preliminary duties on
some steel products.
The Commission said it had formally requested consultations under Gatt's
anti-dumping code, to check whether US actions on steel were consistent with
Gatt rules.
The announcement in Brussels came amid renewed challenges to ways the US
Commerce Department calculates alleged material injury to the US steel
industry, and extent of EC producer subsidies.
Despite the critical tone, EC officials stressed that Brussels intended to
avoid escalating the steel dispute and was deliberately avoiding talk of
retaliation.
The consultations under Gatt aimed to 'clarify' rather than reach a final
agreement on steel subsidies, they said.
One way of avoiding definitive anti-dumping duties would be for Gatt members
to forge a multilateral steel agreement, phasing out steel tariffs in return
for banning most subsidies. The US government could then ask US steel
producers to drop their complaints against foreign producers.
The US International Trade Commission will vote on whether the steel
industry has been injured on July 27.
