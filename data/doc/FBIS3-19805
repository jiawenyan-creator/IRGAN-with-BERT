  [Text] Leipzig (DPA) -- The German Social Union (DSU) 
plans to run in all elections this year. For the first time the 
party will put up candiates for the local and landtag elections 
in Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and Rhineland-Palatinate, DSU Federal 
Chairman Robert Rink said at the DSU Federal Congress in Leipzig 
on Saturday [19 March]. He once again defended the expansion of 
his party to the old laender, which was decided last year. As a 
result, the then sister party Christian Social Union stopped its 
support, but now the DSU can work independently, stressed Rink.
