SOVIETS ADMIT RADAR STATION VIOLATED PACT 
The Soviet Union acknowledged today that a radar station in Siberia violated a 
1972 superpower arms treaty and that the leadership had known this for some 
time. 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the Soviet Parliament that the 
Kremlin had breached its own demands for strict adherence to the Anti-Ballistic 
Missile Treaty. 
The admission about the radar station at Krasnoyarsk, he said, was proof that 
the main plank of foreign policy was "not to conceal, (but) to acknowledge and 
to correct mistakes." 
"All these years we have been fighting for preservation of the ABM treaty as a 
basis for strategic stability," he said in an overview of foreign policy 
achievements. 
"Yet at the same time, the construction of this station equal in size to the 
Egyptian Pyramids constituted an open violation of ABM." 
The United States had argued that some of the systems at Krasnoyarsk violated 
the treaty and had demanded that it be dismantled before a treaty on strategic 
weapons could be concluded. 
The Soviet Union halted construction in October, 1988, and initially offered to 
turn the station into a space research center before agreeing to dismantle its 
disputed sections. 
American and Soviet officials held several rounds of talks on the installations 
until late last year, when the State Department announced that Moscow had 
agreed to destroy those systems Washington had considered violated the accord. 
Shevardnadze said the Soviet leadership had taken four years to "sort out 
matters with this station."
