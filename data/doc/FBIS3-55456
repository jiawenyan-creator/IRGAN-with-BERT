  [Text] The president of Estonia, Lennart Meri, has called 
upon NATO not to react to the warnings of the Russian president. 
If NATO wants to survive it must prove that it is Manfred 
Woerner, not Boris Yeltsin, who holds the NATO council, the 
Baltic News Service quotes the Estonian president. In Lennart 
Meri's opinion the Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas 
acted very correctly in making an official request for Lithuania 
to be admitted to NATO. According to the Estonian president, 
there is a vacuum of security in the Baltic states at present, 
and certain forces in Russia may be tempted to fill it.
