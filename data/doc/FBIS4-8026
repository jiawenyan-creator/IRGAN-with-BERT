  [Text] A high-level NATO delegation led by General George 
Joulwan, supreme commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, 
arrived in Tirana today on an official visit. The high-level 
NATO official was received at Rinas airport, according to NATO 
protocol, by Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, the chief of the 
Army General Staff, and other top Defense Ministry officials. 
The ambassadors of NATO countries and military attaches of NATO 
missions in Tirana were also present at the welcoming ceremony 
at the airport. 
  The arrival in Tirana of the supreme commander of the Allied 
Forces in Europe was assessed by foreign and domestic observers 
as a meaningful gesture toward our country. According to them, 
General Joulwan's visit to Tirana will strengthen the foundation 
of the close military cooperation between Albania and the 
Atlantic alliance. This cooperation is believed to be improving 
with this visit. 
  Meanwhile, official talks between the two delegations 
presided over by Zhulali and Joulwan have started at the Defense 
Ministry. The supreme commander and our defense minister plan to 
hold a meeting after the open talks.
