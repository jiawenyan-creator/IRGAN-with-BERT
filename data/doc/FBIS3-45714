  [Text] Munich, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met 
here today with Edmund Stoiber, governor of Germany's Bavaria 
state. 
  Official sources said that during the meeting they exchanged 
views on issues of common concern in a sincere and candid way 
and the meeting proceeded in a friendly atmosphere. 
  Stoiber said, China is playing a more and more important 
role 
in the world economy and the state of Bavaria intends to enhance 
its relations with the nation. 
  He told Qiao that he was deeply impressed by China's rapid 
economic growth and is expected to visit China within this year. 
  China has a huge market, which is of great significance to 
Germany, and especially to the economic development in Asia and 
the rest of the world in the next century, he said. 
  The governor also appreciated China's unremitting efforts in 
seeking peace in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Later this afternoon, Qiao met with Dr. Heinrich von Pierer, 
chairman of the Siemens company. The company now has more than 
20 joint or invested enterprises in China. 
  During German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to China last 
November, the two countries signed a protocol on the joint 
construction of the Guangzhou sub-way project and a loan 
agreement. 
  Qiao said Siemens is a very good cooperative partner of 
China. The future for cooperation between the two sides is 
bright. 
  Pierer said Siemens is looking attentively at China's 
economic reform. 
  "We are full of confidence in China's future," he added.
