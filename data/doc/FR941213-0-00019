Subsection 16(c)(3)(A) is amended by deleting the word ``or'' and replacing that word with ``and.'' As amended, subsection
16(c)(3)(A) provides that Phase III bond may be released only after: (A) the operator has successfully completed
all surface coal mining and reclamation activities required in IC 134.1, 310 IAC 12, ``and'' the permit. The
Director finds this change to be no less stringent than SMCRA at sections 509(a) and 519(c)(3), and no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(3).



2. 310 IAC 125145Prime Farmland; Special Performance Standards



Indiana has deleted subsection 145(c) which was approved by OSM on August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41039). Deleted subsection
145(c) contained the following language: ``Soil reconstruction shall be carried out in accordance with the specifications
of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture establishing prime farmland
soil reconstruction specifications for Indiana.'' In its submittal of this amendment Indiana tated that the language
quoted above was omitted because of ongoing litigation concerning the language of subsection 145(c). The litigation
which Indiana referred to above is 

Indiana Coal Council, Inc. 

vs. 

Babbitt

, No. IP931328C (S.D. Ind. filed October 1, 1993).

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.4(b) provide that the regulatory authority within each State shall use the soil-reconstruction
specifications established by the SCS to carry out the State's responsibilities concerning prime farmland. Prior
to the #931 program amendment Indiana had no counterpart to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.4(b). Indiana
added a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) at 310 IAC 125145(c) in amendment #931, and OSM approved
the addition. In the #943 amendment, Indiana has removed the counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b), due to the lawsuit
cited above.

The lawsuit cited above involves the following. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has held that
the SCS's specifications for prime farmland soil reconstruction must be promulgated as ``rules'' under the Federal
Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 

et seq.

, and must be subject to public comment prior to becoming effective. 

In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation II

, No. 791144 (D.D.C. October 1, 1984), slip. Op. pp. 2324. The Indiana Coal Council, Inc. (ICC) contends
that an Indiana counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) should not be approved by OSM until after the SCS has complied with the
requirement to subject its ``specifications'' to public comment.

OSM had required that Indiana promulgate a regulation addressing the requirements of 30 CFR 823.4(b). (57 FR 41873,
September 14, 1992). When Indiana proposed 310 IAC 125145(c) as the counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b),
OSM removed the required amendment at 30 CFR 914.16(l). (58 FR 41042, August 2, 1993.) Since Indiana has now deleted
310 IAC 125145(c), the State's program again lacks a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b). Therefore, the
Director finds that the deletion of 310 IAC 125145(c) renders the Indiana program less effective than
the Federal regulations. Consequently, the Director is requiring that Indiana amend its program to include a counterpart
to 30 CFR 823.4(b) or to otherwise require that any prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications promulgated
as rules for the State of Indiana by the SCS be incorporated by reference into the Indiana program.
