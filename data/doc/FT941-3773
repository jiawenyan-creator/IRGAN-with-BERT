FT  15 MAR 94 / Sacked dockers battle for shares
Former Medway Ports dockers - who recently won an industrial tribunal ruling
that they were unfairly dismissed - are taking legal advice on whether they
can apply for restitution of shares in the company. They were obliged to
sell the shares when they lost their jobs.
They hope to use Section 459 of the 1985 Companies Act - which relates to
unfair treatment of minority shareholders - to apply for rectification of
the shareholders' register.
About 270 dockers were dismissed in November 1992 because they refused to
accept new conditions of work. The company's articles obliged them to sell
back shares - either given to them or purchased at Pounds 1 each at
privatisation in March 1992 - to the company at Pounds 2.50, a price set by
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. The company was bought by Mersey Docks and
Harbour Company last September for Pounds 103m, valuing each share at Pounds
37.25.
The sacked dockers won a ruling for unfair dismissal in March, and are to
receive Pounds 10,000 compensation each. Many held shares they sold at the
low price. They are also seeking legal advice over whether to pursue a claim
that KPMG was negligent in valuing the shares at Pounds 2.50.
