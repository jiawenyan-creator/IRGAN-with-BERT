FT  19 JAN 94 / Major mounts counter-attack
Mr John Major yesterday sought to deflect continuing attacks on his
government's moral standing by accusing the opposition of spreading 'smear
and innuendo' without regard for truth.
The allegations followed claims by Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall
North, that voters were concerned about 'financial sleaze' prompted by
government policies.
'The one 'back to basics' attitude people so desperately want - crave for -
is simply the restoring of integrity to public life,' Mr Winnick told MPs at
question time.
Mr Major said Labour MPs should 'look at their own colleagues, who spread
smear and innuendo on a week-by-week basis with complete disregard for the
truth.
'Smear and innuendo are the hallmark of political cowardice and they have
become the trademark of the opposition,' he told cheering Conservative MPs.
The prime minister's supporters said his comments marked the beginning of a
determined attempt to regain the political initiative after the
embarrassments of the past two weeks.
Officials released a list of seven alleged Labour smears from a file kept by
researchers at Conservative Central Office.
The most serious relates to claims by Mr Clive Soley, a Labour backbencher,
that the Saudi royal family made a Pounds 7m donation to Conservative party
funds via Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The allegation, which was made under the protection of parliamentary
privilege, has never been repeated outside the Commons.
A senior Conservative official said Mr Major had been angered by opposition
attacks on the government's moral standing, including a weekend interview in
which Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, described ministers as 'ruthless,
arrogant, hypocritical and deceitful'.
The official said that the alleged smears were 'clear examples' of the
Labour party making allegations without evidence.
The list, however, was dismissed as 'pathetic nonsense' by Labour. Officials
said there would be no relaxation of attempts to embarrass the government.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, renewed claims that Sir
Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, had refused to answer questions
about the relationship between Mr Gerry Malone, the party's deputy chairman,
and Mr Asil Nadir, fugitive head of the collapsed Polly Peck empire.
Mr Dobson released a letter to Sir Norman seeking confirmation that Mr
Malone had a meeting with Mr Nadir while he was on bail pending trial on
theft charges.
