<F P=106> [Report by Charima Reinhardt: "Army To Shrink Further"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 14 Apr -- In the view of Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU), the Bundeswehr 
is to be reduced to 320,000 troops. Government circles in Bonn 
confirmed on Thursday [14 April] that the security policy 
guidelines announced by Ruehe, to be presented at the end of 
April, also provide for basic military service to be reduced 
from 12 months to 10. 
  The decrease in the number of troops by another 50,000 would 
mean the closure of some additional Bundeswehr sites, and thus a 
new debate on stationing troops. This is one of the reasons why 
resistance to Ruehe's plans is emerging from within the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Social Union]. 
  The CDU/CSU defense experts will meet in Siegen on 24 and 25 
April to work out a sort of counterconcept. The defense experts 
reject Ruehe's argument that a 370,000-strong army cannot be 
financed in view of the shrinking defense budget. They say 
there are a number of other ways to economize. 
  Ruehe, who has had to revise his Bundeswehr concept several 
times because of the budget cuts, considers the guidelines as a 
basis for discussion. There will not be a final concept before 
the October Bundestag elections. The guidelines have been 
agreed upon within the government in principle. This would mean 
that Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU) has approved a further cut in 
Bundeswehr troops. At the Munich military defense meeting back 
in February, Kohl had signalled that he wants to stick to 
reducing the Bundeswehr by about half a million to 370,000 
troops.
