  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, in a statement 
today, demanded that the Pyongyang trip of Yi Ki-taek, president 
of the South Korean Democratic Party, be realised 
unconditionally without any hindrance. 
  Recalling that Yi Ki-taek expressed more than once his wish 
to visit Pyongyang, the spokesman said: 
  "Should he visit Pyongyang and discuss the outstanding 
issues 
of the nation including the problem of national reunification 
and jointly seek a solution, a new progress will, no doubt, be 
made in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the 
development of the North-South relations. 
  "The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, are blocking the 
Pyongyang trip of the opposition political figure, arguing that 
he `might fall a prey to the strategy of the North.' This is a 
very improper act." 
  The spokesman expressed the belief that Yi Ki-taek would 
visit Pyongyang in a short time and do a good work for the 
nation.
