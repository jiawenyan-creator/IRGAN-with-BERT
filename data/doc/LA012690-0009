JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE 
The verdict is in. Not only was Peggy McMartin Buckey found innocent, but the 
other five female teachers who were originally prosecuted were dismissed 
because of "incredibly weak evidence." 
These innocent defendants have suffered greatly because of this modern-day 
witch hunt. It is fortunate that our legal system prevented their unjust 
conviction in view of the tremendous adverse publicity generated by the media. 
I think that it is both just and reasonable that the City of Manhattan Beach 
and County of Los Angeles consider appropriating a substantial sum of money to 
compensate these defendants for their huge financial losses. They can never be 
compensated for the suffering which they have had to endure due to their 
prosecution. 
As to Ray Buckey, a cloud of doubt still hangs over his head, but he has 
already suffered five years of jail and has not been convicted of any crime. 
The remaining charges against him should be promptly dismissed.
