FT  23 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises for first
time in four days
The overnight rise on Wall Street, the yen's decline against the dollar and
the settlement of the political row lifted the Nikkei index for the first
time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average rose by 165.03 to 19,964.39 after a high of 20,071.51 and a
low of 19,833.27. Arbitrage buying and purchases by overseas investors
featured in the morning session but, later, profit-taking by corporations
and dealers eroded some of the gains.
Investors were relieved by the agreement reached on Thursday night within
the ruling coalition over a common platform. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign
minister, will be elected as prime minister in the lower house next Monday,
and parliamentary budget talks are expected to resume around May 9, after
the Golden Week holidays.
However, many market participants were worried about the supply and demand
situation, and large-lot selling by institutional investors and corporations
around the 20,000 level.
Volume totalled 300m shares against 246m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 8.30 to 1,615.80 and the Nikkei 300 rose 1.80 to 295.63.
Advances led declines by 687 to 305 with 184 unchanged.
In London, the ISDE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.02 to 1,317.78.
Arbitrage buying supported financial stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan rose
Y20 to Y3,190 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank gained Y40 to Y1,940. Nomura
Securities rose Y30 to Y2,310 and Nikko Securities gained Y10 to Y1,240.
Material stocks, bought as laggards, were also higher. Showa Shell Sekiyu
rose Y30 to Y1,430 and Hitachi Chemcial gained Y30 to Y1,120.
Retailers, which announced weak annual profits earlier this week, declined.
Daiei fell Y30 to Y1,720.
The OSE average rose 68.60 to 22,152.03 on volume of 32.1m shares.
