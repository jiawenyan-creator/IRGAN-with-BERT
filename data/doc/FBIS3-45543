  [Text] Singapore, January 12 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
judiciary official has said that China and Singapore should 
cooperate in judicial field. 
  This was suggested by Ren Jianxin, the visiting president of 
the Supreme People's Court (SPC) of China, when meeting 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong today. 
  During the meeting, Ren said since cooperations in economic, 
scientific and technological fields between Singapore and China 
are expanding, there will be some cases that have to be resolved. 
  During Ren's meeting with Singapore Chief Justice Yang Pung 
How earlier today, the two sides agreed that China and Singapore 
should increase personnel and information exchanges and, in the 
due course, conclude an judicial agreement so as to defend 
foreign investors' lawful rights and legitimate private 
properties. 
  Goh said the planned judicial cooperation between the two 
countries would play a great role in promoting economic 
cooperation between China and other countries, which, in turn, 
will attract more foreigners to do business and to invest in 
China. 
  Ren and his 8-member delegation arrived here from Indonesia 
on Tuesday for a four-day official visit here at the invitation 
of Yang Pung How. 
  The Chinese SPC president will call on Senior Minister Lee 
Kuan Yew tomorrow.
