Confront `Mobile' Demonstrations"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Well-informed sources have confirmed 
that a state of high alert has been announced in the Sudanese 
police, as `mobile' protest demonstrations have spread. 
  The sources linked the announcement of the high alert with 
the movement of protest demonstrations from the city of Medani 
in central Sudan to al-Husayhisah, Abu Haraz, Rufa'ah, 
al-Hilaliyah, and then al-Kamilin. 
  Several Sudanese sources inside and outside the country said 
yesterday that demonstrations have reached the city of Atbara, 
the largest industrial city in Sudan. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT could not confirm reports that 
demonstrators burned down some railroad maintenance workshops in 
Atbara. 
  Sudanese authorities fear the possibility of the 
demonstrations, staged to protest deteriorating living and 
economic conditions, moving to Khartoum, especially after what 
happened in al-Muradah district a few days ago and what happened 
in Omdurman a few weeks ago. 
  In the context of the measures taken as a result of these 
developments and demonstrations, al-Jazirah University Director 
Mubarak 'Ali Majzub issued a decision dismissing 29 male and 
female students from the university, from which protest 
demonstrations were launched in Medani last week. [passage
