  [Text] Interior Minister Manuel Antonio has just told Radio 
Mozambique that there will be no general strike within the 
Mozambican Police force. He was reacting to a letter sent to 
him by members of the police force. In a letter published by 
the weekly SAVANA newspaper, police agents said they would be 
going on general strike as of 1 May and presented demands such 
as salary increases and promotions. 
  Interior Minister Manuel Antonio said the letter had been 
written by an opportunistic group, including some officers, that 
have infiltrated the police force. [passage indistinct]
