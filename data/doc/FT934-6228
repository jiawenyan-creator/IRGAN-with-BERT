FT  25 NOV 93 / Reformers lead in Russian poll
A new, authoritative poll taken in Russia's cities and towns shows a clear
lead for the liberal reformist Russia's Choice political bloc headed by Mr
Yegor Gaidar.
But the poll also shows the grouping headed by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky not far
behind, with both of them far ahead of the rest of the field.
The survey, to be published today in the newspaper Sevodnya, shows Russia's
Choice on 29.2 per cent, and Mr Yavlinsky's group on 20.5 per cent. The
Russian Communist party is next - on 7.7 per cent.
One of the surprises of the poll is the very low showing of the Party of
Unity and Accord, headed by deputy prime ministers, Mr Sergei Shakhrai and
Mr Alexander Shokhin. They poll a mere 3.7 per cent, well down the field and
below the 5 per cent minimum vote needed for the party to have seats in the
state duma, or lower house.
The strong showing of Mr Yavlinsky's party, which has campaigned on a
programme of more moderate reform with an accent on wider privatisation and
ending monopolies, as well as (on the part of some of its leading
candidates) opposition to the draft constitution, points to a powerful role
for the group's leaders in the next parliament - if they can sustain this
momentum. Mr Yavlinsky has had talks with Mr Gaidar on co-operation but with
no result so far.
Without an official name, Mr Yavlinsky's party is nicknamed Yabloko (Apple),
as a pun on the acronym of its leadership; Mr Yavlinsky, Mr Yuri Boldyrev, a
scientist, and Mr Vladimir Lukin, former Russian ambassador to the US.
The supply of energy to industry and homes in Russia over the winter is at
risk - under the twin pressures of cuts in the budget and threatened
mineworkers strikes.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister and acting head of the
government in the absence on holiday of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
has warned of shortages by early next year unless billions of roubles are
provided to energy producing industries.
