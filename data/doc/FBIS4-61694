  [Text] Simferopol -- President Yuriy Meshkov is planning 
to move to the first session of the newly elected Crimean 
Republic Supreme Soviet, due on 10 May, a package of five draft 
laws representing a concept for the peninsula's state and legal 
structure. This was announced yesterday by Oleg Rumyantsev, 
former Russian Federation people's deputy and secretary of the 
Constitutional Commission of the Russian Federation Congress of 
People's Deputies. At present, he is an expert on this problem 
in the Crimea presidential administration. The drafts that 
Yuriy Meshkov is to submit to the Crimean parliament bear on 
Crimean citizenship, its treaty-based relations with Russia and 
Ukraine, and also restructuring its executive power branch, 
according to Mr. Rumyantsev, toward creating "a strong 
presidential republic." The concept for Crimea's state and 
legal structure, commissioned by Mr. Meshkov, has been worked 
out by the Reform foundation under Academician Stanislav 
Shatalin.
