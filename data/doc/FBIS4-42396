  [Excerpt] Bonn/Mulhouse (DPA) -- The Federal Government is 
pressing for an early achievement of the stability criteria for 
European monetary union. However, Bonn Government spokesman 
Dieter Vogel said on Monday [30 May] that there has not been a 
formal agreement with the other partner countries to give up the 
earliest possible date possible under the Maastricht Treaty, 
1997, and to start monetary union not before 1999. At the 
Franco-German Financial and Economic Council in Mulhouse 
(Alsace), Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that Germany would 
fulfill the Maastricht criterion regarding the deficit quota by 
1996 at the latest. In the medium term, the conditions for the 
debt level would be achieved, too. 
  According to Vogel, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who also 
attended the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse, left no doubt 
that stability in European Union countries must have precedence 
over the timetable. In financial circles in Bonn, it has been 
said that under the Maastricht Treaty it has actually been clear 
that the majority of partner countries could not fulfill all 
criteria for debt level, deficits, and interests before the 
second possible deadline in 1999. [passage omitted]
