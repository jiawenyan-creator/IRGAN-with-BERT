FT  05 FEB 94 / Fashion: The global wardrobe in the office - Frankfurt
The preponderance of hefty game stews on Frankfurt lunch menus clearly
indicates it is still winter. But demand persists for grilled freshwater
fish and salad. This, with women eaters' determination to show off large
areas of their tanned chests, demonstrates a reluctance to part with warmer
days.
The appearance of lacy white vest-tops in the upper reaches of deep cut
lightweight suits shows, however, that the chill is making itself felt.
Lovats, murky blues, browns and greenery-yellery checks and tweeds now
shroud both sexes lunching in and around the city's Fressgasse (stuff-ing
alley to be literal).
But the cut of the season's day clothes is as conventional and as straight
as the predominantly male customers from the surrounding financial district.
They eat, all year round, in double breasted greys and pinstripes festooned
with redundant buttons.
The Hugo Boss look - captured in suits which appear to be designed by an
engineer - has a firm hold. But there is still a touch of devilry in the
detail. While Frankfurt women appear to be breaking off their long-standing
daytime love affair with shoulder pads, there is no shortage of garish
jewellery and accessories.
Beneath the tables, the diversity of expensive footwear reminds the observer
that the British style shoe shop has yet to arrive in Germany. And beneath
the chins of the men dangle reminders that somewhere in the German soul lies
a sense of the frivolous. Brash, unsuitable ties - penguin and teddy bear
motifs seem popular - remain the norm. The colour is still to be found, but
you have to look increasingly hard to spot it. The conjunction of recession
and the opening of the don't-flaunt-it epoch has left its mark in the
Fressgasse.
