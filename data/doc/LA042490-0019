UNITED STATES' ROLE IN TERRORISM BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT 
Kenneth Freed's article "Killing Fields of Guatemala Persist Despite U.S. 
Effort" (April 14) was gratifying for one reason: the fact that it appeared at 
all. Some 100,000 Guatemalans dead and 40,000 disappeared in 26 years is indeed 
staggering. 
Yet the story continues to go largely unreported in the U.S. press. 
Surprising? It shouldn't be. The CIA helped overthrow Arbenz's democratically 
elected government in 1954 for advocating land reform and human rights (a fact 
omitted from Freed's otherwise good piece). Since then U.S. tax dollars have 
paid for death-squad thugs to "disappear," torture and murder anyone they deem 
"dissident." 
The ambivalence of the U.S. Embassy official quoted on whether human-rights 
progress is "still a requirement of U.S. aid" to Guatemala belies our foreign 
policy's double standard: We champion popular movements that overturn "hostile" 
communist tyrants, but criticize rebellion against "friendly," right-wing 
butchers and murderers.
