FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities jump
Firm government bonds and hopes of a pre-summer fall in interest rates sent
regional electricity (rec) and water utilities bounding forward.
The recs were particularly strong, although analysts denied this had much to
do with prepayment of bills by consumers attempting to beat the VAT
deadline. 'They are looking cheap on a yield basis and doing some catching
up,' was the view from one market salesman.
Among the best performers, London forged ahead 29 to 600p, Norweb 30 to
661p, South West 28 to 651p and Yorkshire 27 to 624p.
Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, was the top performer in the
Footsie as the shares bounced back from recent underperformance on a strong
set of figures, ending the session 31 stronger at 666p.
The group, increasingly perceived as a media conglomerate, produced a higher
than expected dividend and profits up 38 per cent to Pounds 208.6m. Adjusted
for exceptionals the headline figure was some Pounds 20m higher. Although
one analyst was encouraged to bring his estimate for 1994 profits down from
Pounds 270m, most edged upward. SG Warburg increased its full-year estimate
by Pounds 23m to Pounds 255m and Goldman Sachs by Pounds 7m to Pounds 247m.
Royal Doulton, which was demerged from Pearson last year, gained 19 at 253p
on well-received figures.
Reed International moved forward 4 to 835p as it was announced that Reed
Elsevier had bought OIP Group, a French exhibitions organiser.
Insurers, many of which went ex-dividend yesterday, were restrained by a
Sunday newspaper article claiming that they were resisting payment of valid
claims. Legal &amp; General lost 1 1/2 at 483p and Prudential 5 1/4 at 312p.
Continued speculation that Great Universal Stores is building up a war chest
was enlivened by rumours that the secretive stores group had sold its entire
gilts portfolio for Pounds 350m. If true, it would take the company's cash
pile to some Pounds 1.7bn - with the market split over whether it will be
used to buy back shares or for an acquisition. Strong suggestions of a
buy-back were heard last week. Another avenue could be for the company to
bolster its significant property arm prior to a flotation.
Next, which reports results today, was one name touted as a potential
target. The shares advanced 3 to 225p. GUS, which rose smartly last week,
slipped back 5 to 579p.
Further bad news over Zantac, Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer drug, saw the
company's shares decline 4 to 621p. A newspaper report said Astra, of
Sweden, would get approval in the UK today for a new product involving
Losec, Zantac's competitor.
Holliday Chemical slipped 9 to 201p after announcing a one-for-four rights
issue at 180p to raise Pounds 35.8m. The company is buying the European
industrial pigments business of Reckitt &amp; Colman for Pounds 52m. Reckitt
shares, which went ex-dividend, added 17 at 608p.
Speculative buying helped Merrydown, the cider company which recently issued
a profits warning and lost its finance director last week, recover some
ground. Rumours persist of interest from a large brewing group. The shares
moved up 6 to 139p.
Dairy group Robert Wiseman rallied from a 7p discount on its market debut to
close 3 ahead of its offer price at 103p.
A 15 per cent profits forecast formed the cornerstone of Westland's defence
document against the GKN bid and the shares responded favourably, closing 7
1/2 up at 325p. GKN eased 3 to 551p. Analysts said the Westland document
bolstered the belief in the market that GKN will have to increase its
290p-a-share offer.
Smith New Court was said to have been active in placing a large line of
shares in Trafalgar House. The stock was steady at 100p.
Conglomerate Hanson retreated 5 1/2 to 269 1/2 p, with dealers citing
Kleinwort Benson as a big seller.
British Aerospace softened a penny to 506p. After the market closed, the
company warned that its foreign ownership had risen to 29 per cent, just a
half-point below its allowable level.
