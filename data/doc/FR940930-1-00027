<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

EPA is proposing to delete acetone from the list of toxic chemicals subject to section 313 of the Emergency Planning
and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) in response to a petition filed by Eastman Chemical Company and Hoechst
Celanese. Specifically, EPA is granting this petition by proposing to delist because the Agency believes that acetone
does not meet any of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria for remaining on the list. Moreover, as published elsewhere
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, EPA is proposing to add acetone to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of A Volatile Organic Compound
(VOC) under the Clean Air Act. VOCs contribute to the formation of ozone in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), and
ozone is known to cause significant adverse effects on human health and environment. EPA has previously determined
that VOCs meet the criteria for listing under EPCRA section 313. Therefore, finalization of this proposed rule is
contingent upon the finalization of the proposed rule to exclude acetone from EPA's definition of a VOC.

I. Introduction



A. Statutory Authority



This proposed rule is issued under sections 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99499).



B. Background



Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 13106. Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals
that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add or delete
chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. EPA has added and deleted chemical from the original
statutory list. Under section 313(e), any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the
list. EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation
of why the petition is denied.

EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 

Federal Register

 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for submitting
petitions. On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA published guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to
delete individuals members of the section 313 and metal compound categories.



II. Description of Petition



On September 24, 1991, EPA received a petition from Eastman Chemical Company and Hoechst Celanese to delete acetone
from the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. The petitioners contend that acetone should be deleted from the
EPCRA section 313 list because it does not meet any of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria and because acetone's low
photochemical reactivity does not present substantial concerns for formation of tropospheric ozone or other air
pollutants.

Acetone is high volume chemical that is widely used as an industrial solvent and chemical intermediate, and which
is regulated under several environmental statutes other than EPCRA. Acetone is on the list of hazardous substances
(40 CFR 302.4) under section 102(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9602, with a reportable quantity of 5,000 pounds. Due to its ignitability acetone is regulated
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6901 

et seq

., as a hazardous waste and its implementing regulations at 40 CFR 261.33.
