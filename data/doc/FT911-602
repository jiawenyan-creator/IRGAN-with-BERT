FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Etam says it will reject full offer from
Oceana
THE BOARD of Etam, the women's fashion chain, has said that it will reject a
takeover bid from Oceana Investment Corporation, if the vehicle for a South
African retailing concern goes ahead with a full offer.
Oceana, a vehicle for the Lewis family which runs the Foschini fashion
stores in South Africa, increased its stake in Etam to 25.1 per cent this
week via a tender offer at 185p per share, which was about 11 per cent
oversubscribed. It is still considering its next move.
If it makes a bid, the maximum price is 185p - as it was for the tender
offer - valuing Etam at Pounds 121m.
Etam said the offer had been an unwelcome distraction. 'Tenders were only
received by Oceana in respect of shares representing less than 22 per cent
of those subject to the offer. We believe that this represents a substantial
vote of support for your board.'
