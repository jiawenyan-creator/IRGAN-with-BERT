NATION IN BRIEF; 
NEW YORK; 
DOCTOR WITH AIDS PRESSES HER LAWSUIT 
Lawyers for an AIDS-afflicted doctor suing New York City for negligence 
asserted that they had proved a city hospital was careless in disposing of 
infectious wastes. Dr. Veronica Prego claims that she contracted the disease 
from a needle left carelessly at Kings County Hospital. A professor at the 
Columbia University Graduate School of Business testified that Prego could have 
made up to $30 million in her normal estimated working lifetime of 32.8 years 
had she not become infected.
