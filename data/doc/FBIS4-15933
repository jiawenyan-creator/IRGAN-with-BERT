  [Text] Mirny, Arkhangelsk Region, April 12 TASS--The Topol 
(Poplar) missile complex, which has no analogues in the world, 
is not only operational with Strategic Missile Forces (SMF) to 
ensure Russia's worthy parity but is also used for peaceful 
purposes, Lieutenant-General Yuriy Zhuravlyov, chief of the 
state test site of the SMF, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  The launch of a "Start" communicaitons satellite 
demonstrated 
the Topol's unique resources in the peaceful uses of outer 
space. A heavy-duty communications satellite is to be launched 
soon, Zhuravlyov said. 
  Within the framework of Russian defence-industry conversion 
to civilian uses, experts consider the possibility of using the 
test site facilities for participation in commercial launchings, 
in which many countries show interest. If only initial funding, 
which will subsequently bring in revenue quickly, is essential 
for implementing conversion programmes. The allocation of funds 
for the needs of the state test site of the SMF has been now 
reduced to the minimum, Zhuravlyov lamented.
