FT  25 NOV 92 / Brooke sees pivotal role for BBC: Green paper lays out
options for redefining status
NOT ONLY is the cover of the government's consultation document on the
future of the BBC, published yesterday, green but there are elegant green
stripes down the side of every page just to remind readers of its intent.
The Future of the BBC is that rare breed of government green paper - a
document genuinely seeking consultation and debate over the future of an
important national institution.
In the document's 43 pages, there are many 'coulds', few 'shoulds' and a
forest of question marks. Its spirit is best captured by what could almost
be turned into a BBC2 media quiz - in the 20 Questions set out by the
government.
The questions range from the difficult to the tricky - from pondering the
objectives of public-service broadcasting to whether there should be
improved parliamentary scrutiny of the corporation.
One underlying theme can be detected. The green paper leans towards
redefining the status quo - a BBC that may end up trimmed and more efficient
but still recognisably the BBC. There is no hostility towards the
corporation.
There are radical options laid out, such as taking advertising; a much
smaller, cheaper BBC broadcasting largely bought-in programmes; and a Public
Service Broadcasting Council that might distribute licence-fee money to
anyone wanting to make public-service programmes. But the more radical the
suggestions, the more the potential flaws are pointed out.
The tone is set by Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, in the
foreword: 'The government believes the BBC should continue as a major
broadcasting organisation and it should have special responsibilities for
public-service broadcasting', although he emphasises that change is
inevitable.
The changes the government is seeking for the BBC include: Aiming for
sustained improvements in organisation and efficiency whatever its
programming role.
Giving value for money and demonstrating clearly that it is doing so,
however the corporation is eventually financed.
Developing a range of output and performance measures and indicators
covering the efficiency of its activities, quality of service, audience
reactions and financial performance.
Creating a more flexible organisation - the BBC has been criticised for
unnecessary bureaucracy and over-rigid decision-making.
The biggest question of all is what role the BBC should have as a programme
maker in an increasingly competitive broadcasting environment.
With the greater choice available to viewers and listeners, the BBC could
concentrate in future on providing news and current affairs and programmes
unlikely to be broadcast by others.
'The BBC would broadcast few general entertainment programmes but more
programmes for minority audiences,' the document suggests. If the range of
programmes were limited, the number of BBC services could be reduced. No
popular music might mean dropping two out of its five domestic radio
services. No entertainment, and the BBC could be chopped back to one
television channel. Another possibility would be for the BBC to lose its
local radio stations.
On the other hand, if the aim were to encourage people to widen their
interests, that would be less likely to be achieved by narrowing the range
of programmes 'and reducing the number of popular programmes which attract
more people to watch or listen to a service'.
On the second big question - how BBC services are to be financed once the
government decides what BBC services should be - the green paper is
open-minded but not completely so.
It does say that 'so far no one has devised an obviously better system' to
the licence fee, but none of the obvious alternatives such as advertising,
subscription or mixed financing are warmly embraced.
The government sees the BBC not so much as a monopoly, but more as a
conglomerate carrying out a variety of functions. If it were to operate
efficiently in future these strands of activity might have to be
disentangled and decisions taken on whether all should continue to be
carried out by people employed by the BBC.
The BBC could sell its studio services in the marketplace but many of the
functions that support the programme makers could be privatised or put out
to tender. Commercial activities such as publishing and programme sales
could be expanded to generate more money or put in the hands of other
organisations for a fee.
The government is also interested in what the role of the BBC governors
should be. Some believe the governors interfere too much in the running of
the BBC. On the other hand, the governors and the board of management could
be merged. The government wants a clearer remit and leans towards a
supervisory rather than a managerial role.
One clue to the likely outcome of the discussion is a story told by Mr
Brooke yesterday. In his career he has worked abroad four times and as a
result he said he had 'a profound admiration for the services the BBC
provides'.
