FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Metro Radio shares fall on drop to Pounds
670,000
METRO RADIO Group, the USM-quoted local radio station operator, saw its
shares drop 18p to 196p when it announced a fall in profits for the half
year to March 31.
The pre-tax line was down from Pounds 709,000 to Pounds 670,000. The interim
dividend, however, is maintained at 1.5p.
Metro is based in Newcastle and in October 1990 acquired Yorkshire Radio
Network for Pounds 16m.
Trading profits were 4 per cent ahead at Pounds 815,000 (Pounds 782,000) on
turnover up 19 per cent from Pounds 5.84m to Pounds 6.96m. Higher net
interest charges of Pounds 145,000 (Pounds 73,000), reflecting the YRN
acquisition, caused the pre-tax profit fall. Earnings per share were 2.64p
(3.05p).
Mr Neil Robinson, chairman and chief executive, said that a considerable
investment in the YRN business since acquisition, particularly in Sheffield,
was now bringing higher audiences, revenues and profitability. The
investment would mean revenues could be increased in future without
expanding the cost base.
In the Yorkshire area sales were up 54 per cent but were 6 per cent lower in
the north-east of England. Group advertising revenues were up 16 per cent
and accounted for Pounds 5.94m of total turnover.
Mr Robinson, who is shedding his chief executive role at the end of the
year, said that the second half of the financial year had 'started fairly
well' although trading conditions were not consistent with variations from
month to month and market to market, making it difficult to give a clear
indication of the year's outcome.
Mr John Josephs is to become group managing director, while his role of
finance director will be taken by Mr Eric Lawrence, currently financial
controller.
