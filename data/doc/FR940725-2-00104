<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Expanding the Services Provided by Members Registered as ``Stock Services''</DOCTITLE>



July 18, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change






Currently CBOE Rule 6.77, ``Stock Execution Services,'' states that a stock service is a member registered with the
Exchange for the purpose of providing stock execution services to market makers on the CBOE's floor. The CBOE proposes
to amend CBOE Rule 6.77 to replace ``stock service'' with ``order service firm'' and to allow order service firms to
take market maker orders for the purchase or sale of commodity futures contracts and options thereon and forward the
orders to the appropriate futures exchange. In addition, the CBOE proposes to adopt CBOE Rule 6.78, ``Letters of Guarantee
Required of Order Service Firms,'' which requires an order service firm to have on file with the Exchange and in effect
an Order Service Firm Letter of Guarantee issued for the service firm by a member of the Options Clearing Corporation
(``OCC''). Under proposed CBOE rule 6.78(b), the letter of guarantee must provide that the issuing clearing member
accepts financial responsibility for all orders handled by the order service firm on the CBOE floor and for all financial
obligations of the order service firm to the Exchange. 


The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.




(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to permit members that are registered as ``stock services'' under
CBOE Rule 6.77 to expand the scope of their activity on the floor of the CBOE to encompass order handling services in
connection with commodity interests. Currently CBOE Rule 6.77 provides that a member organization that is registered
with the CBOE as a ``stock service'' may provide stock execution services to market makers on the floor of the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal would revise CBOE Rule 6.77 to permit designated member organizations also to take orders for the purchase
or sale of commodity interests from market makers on the floor of the Exchange and forward such orders to the appropriate
futures exchange. The execution of all orders to purchase or sell commodity interests would occur on a futures exchange
that has been designated as a contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''). To reflect
more accurately the expanded scope of activities permitted under CBOE Rule 6.77, the term ``stock service'' would
be deleted from CBOE Rules 3.1, ``Public Securities Business,'' 6.20, ``Admission to and Conduct on the Trading Floor,''
and 6.77 and replaced with the term ``order service firm.''

The services provided by these firms generally consist of taking orders for the purchase or sale of stocks and forwarding
these orders to broker-dealers for execution.


</FOOTNOTE>


The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate market making capacity in stock index options. Market
makers in stock index options are subject to the risk that market price will change before they can liquidate their
positions, and hedge this risk by executing transactions in related commodity interests.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change would facilitate the ability of market makers in stock index options to execute hedging transactions
by providing them with a more efficient means of effecting such transactions.
