MORNING REPORT: ART 
Sly Sues: Sylvester Stallone has sued an art broker for $5 million, claiming 
she led him to pay millions of dollars more than he should have for several 
artworks. The fraud and breach-of-contract suit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, charges that New York-based art consultant Barbara Guggenheim 
persuaded Stallone to pay $1.8 million for a painting she told him was an 
excellent investment. After buying it sight unseen, the star of the "Rocky" and 
"Rambo" movies said he discovered that it was damaged, 25% to 30% of it had 
been restored or retouched and that its previous owner had tried for some time 
to sell it. The suit also charges that Stallone believes he paid too much for 
several other works bought through Guggenheim. CLAUDIA PUIG
