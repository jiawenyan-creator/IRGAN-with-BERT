  [Text] The demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border will 
make it possible to normalize the situation in the border region 
where passions are now flaring up, Genrikh Kireyev, ambassador 
at large of the Russian Foreign Ministry, is convinced. The 
diplomat, who heads the Russian side of the demarcation 
commission, held a briefing here today. In particular he said 
that an expedition will be undertaken this month to Ussuriyskiy 
Rayon where specialists intend to cite arguments to prove 
Russian ownership of 10 square kilometers of hunting grounds 
which China is claiming.
