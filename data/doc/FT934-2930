FT  10 DEC 93 / Romanians sign a new agreement with IMF
Romania yesterday signed a letter of intent for a new stand-by arrangement
with the International Monetary Fund, signalling an end to months of
uncertainty over the government's commitment to reform.
The IMF board is expected to approve loans worth Dollars 700m under its
stand-by and systemic transformation facilities early next year if the
Romanian parliament accepts the reform programme agreed yesterday with the
Fund.
IMF officials said the principal aim of the programme was to curb inflation
sharply and restore domestic confidence in the leu, the Romanian currency.
Inflation hit 314 per cent in the year to October, its highest level since
the 1989 revolution. Economists have warned that, unless action is taken
quickly, the country could slip into hyper-inflation.
Mr Maxwell Watson, the IMF's chief negotiator with Romania, said the
programme's main structural objectives were enterprise restructuring,
financial sector reforms and measures to protect competition. He said the
IMF was still working with the left-wing minority government on improvements
to the social security system and on fiscal measures to fund emergency
heating and other supplements to help the most needy through the winter.
The agreement with the IMF comes at a critical time for the government. It
is under increasing attack from pro-reform opposition parties seeking a
no-confidence vote, and from trade unions which in recent weeks have
organised the biggest street demonstrations since 1990.
