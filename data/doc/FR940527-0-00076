 

IV. Modifications to, and Clarifications of, the Recommendations in the Final Recommended Decision


13. After reviewing the Final Recommended Decision, we have concluded that we must modify and clarify our understanding
of some of the Joint Board's recommendations to ensure that the new market structure will operate in the public interest.
In our judgment, these clarifications and modifications are consistent with the objectives established by the Board
and are consistent with the reasoning contained in the Final Recommended Decision.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 The State Joint Board Members have participated in the deliberations on this order, pursuant to Section 410(c) of
the Communications Act.

</FOOTNAME>
In this order, we modify the date recommended by the Joint Board for the beginning of the transition (March 1, 1994)
to adjust for the period that the Joint Board's recommendations were under consideration. Because the first phase
of the transition will begin July 1, 1994, other dates have been adjusted to provide for a one and one-half year first
phase and a two and one-half year second phase.

A. Transition Payment and Reduction of Alascom Plant Accounts


14. In the Final Recommended Decision, the Joint Board recommended that in applying the transition payment installments,
the ``Central Office Switching'' Account 2210 should be designated first for reduction and then should be reduced
by an amount that would result in little or no intrastate cost shift if ATT decreased its usage of Alascom switches.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Consistent with the Joint Board's objective of reducing Alascom's plant balances to reduce potential intrastate
cost shifts, we clarify that the amount necessary to reduce Central Office Switching so as to produce little or no increase
in intrastate revenue requirements be taken entirely from the first $75 million installment. The remaining depreciable
accounts will be reduced proportionately using both the balance of the first installment and all of the second $75
million installment. As a result, the potential for significant intrastate cost shifts if ATT decreases its
usage of Alascom switches will be significantly diminished at the time of the first installment.

15. The Final Recommended Decision did not consider how ATT will account for the $150 million payment to Alascom.
We conclude that the cost increase associated with the payment made by ATT to Alascom is an extraordinary cost
beyond the control of ATT that is eligible for exogenous treatment under 61.44(c)(5) of our price cap
rules,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 and direct ATT to make preliminary filings forty-five days prior to filing tariff modifications that reflect
ATT's transition payment. ATT shall include in its tariff filings the apportionment and explanation
of the exogenous revenue requirement effects of each payment upon each rate that ATT proposes to modify as a consequence
of this decision, and shall also include in that filing the anticipated cost reduction associated with the termination
of the JSA.

B. ATT's Purchase of Alascom's Services


16. The Board recommended that during the second phase of the transition ATT should be obligated to purchase
a fixed dollar amount of service from Alascom. The fixed dollar amount of service would decline in six month increments
until it reached zero at the termination of the second phase of the transition period. The Board recommended this continuing
obligation after the JSA terminates to avoid precipitous intrastate cost shifts if ATT does not continue to
purchase Alascom services. The Board concluded that the ATT must purchase requirement along with other transition
mechanisms will maintain the goals of universal service and revenue neutrality. We adopt these goals and the approach
recommended by the Board, but conclude that the fixed dollar amount ATT must purchase as calculated using the
Board's methodology must be adjusted as discussed below.
17. In the Final Recommended Decision the Board recommended the following methodology for calculating the fixed
dollar amount of service that ATT must purchase during the second phase of the transition period. The amount
that ATT must purchase for each period of the second phase was to be computed by applying a declining percentage
for each six month period to a baseline revenue amount. The annual baseline revenue amount was to be calculated as a
function of the demand for interstate transport and switching MTS minutes for the last 12 months that the JSA was in
effect, multiplied by the new tariff rates for Alascom's Common Carrier Services.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 The percentage used to calculate the fixed dollar amount of service for each six month period was to decline to zero
in six month increments.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The required percentage for each six month period was to be applied to one-half of the annual revenue baseline to calculate
the fixed dollar amount of services ATT must purchase for each six month period.


<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
These new tariffs, as noted elsewhere in this order, would reflect Alascom's reduced costs after application of the
transition payment installments.

The percentage of the baseline revenue amount to be used for each six month period is as follows: 90% during the first
period; 80% during the second period; 65% during the third period; 45% during the fourth period; and 20% during the
last period. Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93 J2 at n. 181.

18. ATT states that the must-purchase requirement ``would require ATT to pay for services which it may
not be able to use.''
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 ATT argues that the only way to interpret the must-purchase requirement in the Final Recommended Decision is
to equate the demand used to calculate the annual baseline revenue with the ATT demand for interstate services
for which ATT bills pursuant to its own tariffs during the last 12 months of the JSA. Alascom argues that the Board
intended the demand calculations to be based on the jointly provided services provided by both ATT and Alascom.
