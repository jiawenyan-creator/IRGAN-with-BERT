Reopening of comment period and notice of public hearings.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 12, 1992, the FAA issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to assess the impact of changes
in aircraft flight patterns caused by implementation of the Expanded East Coast Plan over the State of New Jersey.
The comment period on the DEIS closed on November 23, 1993. On September 30, 1994, the FAA issued a Supplemental Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) to afford the public an opportunity to review and comment on (1) a proposed
mitigation measure, (2) analysis of the proposal by the New Jersey Coalition Against Aircraft Noise (NJCAAN) to route
aircraft departing Newark International Airport over the ocean twenty four hours a day, and (3) other new and updated
information developed in response to comments on the DEIS. The SDEIS was issued for public comment for 60 days, on September
30, 1994.



In response to requests from several members of the New Jersey congressional delegation, the FAA is reopening the
comment period on the SDEIS on December 12, for an additional 60 days. This will afford the New Jersey Citizens for Environmental
Research additional time to review data and documentation concerning the SDEIS provided between early September
and October 28 and provide comments on behalf of the NJCAAN.

Because the comment period is being extended, the FAA will now be able to conduct additional hearings in Morris and
Bergen Counties as requested by several members of Congress. Additional hearings will facilitate comments by citizens
potentially affected by the Solberg mitigation proposal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The most useful comments are those which are as specific as possible and provide facts and analysis to support the reviewer's
recommendations or conclusions. Reviewers should structure their participation so that it is meaningful and alerts
the FAA to the reviewer's position and contentions. This ensures that substantive comments are made available to
the FAA in a timely manner so that the FAA can respond to them. Objections not raised at this stage may be waived.



The FAA will consider comments received after the close of the comment period to the extent practicable. The FAA will
issue a Final EIS that includes corrections, clarifications, and responses to comments on the SDEIS.





Issued in Washington, DC on December 6, 1994.
