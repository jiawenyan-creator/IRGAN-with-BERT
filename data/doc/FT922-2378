FT  17 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Norwegian gas plant contract
NORSKE Shell, the Norwegian arm of the international oil group Shell, has
awarded Norway's largest-ever single contract to a joint venture between M W
Kellogg, the US engineering company, and Aker, the Norwegian industrial
group, to construct an onshore gas processing plant, writes Neil Buckley.
The NKr4bn (Pounds 355m) plant will process gas from the Troll field,
Europe's largest offshore gas field, which is capable of meeting 10 per cent
of gas demand of western Europe from 1996.
