  [Text] Our first item today is a rather unusual one. It's 
about AIDS and the Russian Army. Here, as usual, is our science 
correspondent Boris Belitskiy. 
  Belitskiy: Well, this is, of course, a delicate 
subject. But still, we managed to obtain the main facts from 
Colonel (Viktor Kolkov), the chief medical officer at the 
Defense Ministry. 
  Col. (Kolkov) told us that there are today no cases of full- 
blown AIDS in the Armed Forces. However, 15 Army men have 
tested HIV-positive since 1989. 
  Five of them continue to serve in the forces, but are under 
constant medical supervision and have to take laboratory tests 
regularly. The others have been discharged or else seconded to 
civilian institutions, where they continue to be under medical 
surveillance. 
  The colonel believes there's a fairly high risk of infection 
among Army men, especially when they are sent to regions with a 
high incidence of the disease, or when wounded or sick men have 
to take drugs that contain donor blood. 
  As for an official policy of the military authorities 
towards 
infected army men, there doesn't seem to be such a policy, as 
far as we could ascertain. In practice, there are no 
restrictions of any kind on the service of those who test 
HIV-positive. Dismissal is the result, not of the diagnosis, 
but of the general impairment of health that follows infection, 
making further service in the forces impossible. In future, 
however, I wouldn't rule out a stiffening of this policy, as the 
number of infected people in the Army increases parallel with 
such an increase in society.
