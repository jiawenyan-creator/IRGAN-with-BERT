  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 16 (AFP)--The Commercial Bank of 
Palestine, the first all-Palestinian bank on the occupied West 
Bank, will begin trading on March 15 with capital of 14 million 
dollars, businessman Suhayl Jad'awn told AFP on Wednesday [16 
February]. 
  The headquarters will be in Ramallah, with branches in Gaza 
and Jericho to open once autonomy begins, said Jad'awn, one of a 
dozen Palestinian investors in the venture, which has Israeli 
approval. 
  The 38-year-old from Ramallah, who has just married PLO 
chairman Yasir 'Arafat's adopted daughter, said the bank has 
obtained a four-million-dollar loan from the French government 
for private sector industrial projects. 
  About 70 people will be employed by the Commercial Bank, 
most 
of whom have worked in Israeli establishments. 
  Until December last year, when the Israelis gave their 
blessing, only the Arab-Cairo Bank, a Jordanian body, was 
authorized to operate on the West Bank. 
  On the Gaza Strip, the Palestine Bank, set up by 
Palestinians 
in 1964 but closed in 1967, resumed operations in 1985. 
  Another new project, the International Palestine Bank, is 
underway with a 40-million-dollar investment put up by Israeli, 
Spanish and Moroccan banks and a group of Palestinians. 
  Last December, Israel and Jordan agreed that Jordanian banks 
which worked in the occupied territories before the 1967 Middle 
East war could resume trading.
