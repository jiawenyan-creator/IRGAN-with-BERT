FT  22 JUL 93 / Science research reforms detailed
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday unveiled details of reforms aimed at directing
academic research in engineering and biology more closely to the needs of
industry.
The changes to science and technology research councils' areas of
responsibility, outlined in a white paper in May, include the dismantling of
the Science and Engineering Research Council and the creation of research
councils for biotechnology and biology (the BBSRC), and particle physics and
astronomy. (the PPSRC).
Other areas of the Science and Engineering Research Council's responsibility
will go to existing research councils in medicine, the natural environment
and engineering and physical sciences.
After the changes, which take effect from April next year, grant committees
will not have to divide one budget between such different areas as radio
astronomy and manufacturing technology.
The new research councils will also allocate research grants guided by the
advice of technology foresight exercises also established by the white
paper. These exercises are scheduled for next year to identify promising
areas of research for British industry.
