  [Text] Moscow 31 March, TASS -- "For Russia to join the 
NATO Partnership for Peace initiative, a consensus of the entire 
society will be needed. Otherwise, damage will be done to civic 
accord. This process may take six to seven months," Russian 
Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said. 
  Speaking at a press briefing at the Kremlin on Thursday, 
Kostikov said, quoting President Boris Yeltsin's opinion, that 
the "Partnership for Peace formula does not quite correspond to 
the magnitude and the political and military might of Russia." 
  Joining the alliance will narrow down Russia's possibilities 
for manoeuvering in settling conflicts, Kostikov continued. 
Additionally, Russia's accession to the bloc could limit its 
rights in arms trade. Therefore, the president believes that 
certain conditions should be agreed before Russia joins the NATO 
Partnership for Peace programme in order to determine the pluses 
of such a move for Russia, the spokesman added. 
  Kostikov said the sincerity of the Partnership for Peace 
authors has been called into doubt by the NATO decision to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the second 
front in the World War II without Russia's participation.
