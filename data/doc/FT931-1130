FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Second-half drive helps Henlys cut loss by
Pounds 6m
HENLYS GROUP, the car and bus business which last summer escaped a hostile
Pounds 32m bid from its rival T Cowie, reduced pre-tax losses by Pounds 6m
to Pounds 848,000 over 1992.
After losing nearly Pounds 900,000 in the first half, the group fulfilled
its bid-defence promise that it would break even in the second half.
It also carried out its plan to pay an unchanged dividend of 3p by
maintaining the 2p final. This was in spite of losses per share of 3.3p
(16.7p).
Henlys, which did not report under the new FRS 3 accounting rules, took an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.23m mainly for defence costs. Cowie retains
a 9.9 per cent stake.
At the operating level the group advanced to a Pounds 3.8m profit (Pounds
556,000) on turnover of Pounds 331.1m (Pounds 334.4m). This included Pounds
1.04m in fees for management consultants. Exceptional costs were cut by
nearly Pounds 2m to Pounds 950,000, which related to teething problems on
new bus and coach ranges at the Scarborough factory.
The Plaxton coach and bus division has been the source of the group's
problems. Last year the division cut operating losses to Pounds 1.97m
(Pounds 2.95m) on sales of Pounds 65.9m (Pounds 93.4m).
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said the UK market for luxury coaches had
declined from 1.4m in 1989 to 600,000 last year. The group had been left
with Pounds 32m of unsold vehicles when the market collapsed in 1990.
After closures and other cuts which would reduce annual costs by Pounds 5m,
the division was expected to return to profit this year.
Motor retail pushed up operating profit to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.5m) with
the help of acquisitions. The group represented 14 manufacturers on 24
sites.
Net debt fell by Pounds 4m to Pounds 26.4m, gearing of 58 per cent, after an
inflow of Pounds 2.5m from disposals.
