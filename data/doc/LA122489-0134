DRIVING IN THE CAR-POOL LANE WITH CHILDREN AS PASSENGERS 
Re children as passengers in cars: Children who go to private schools or 
preschools are in a car with one adult because the parents car-pool rather than 
have five cars go separately! 
Sometimes several adults go in one car, not to conserve car numbers on the 
highways but just to be social when they are all going out to dinner, etc., 
together. Should they also be out of the car-pool lane? 
Anyway, until the car-pool lanes are overcrowded, which I have not seen yet, 
the mothers or fathers with children should be using the car-pool lanes. At 
least it gets a couple of more cars out of the non-car-pool lanes.
