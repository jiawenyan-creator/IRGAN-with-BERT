  [Text] Prague, Feb 22 (CTK) -- Industry and Trade Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy told CTK today that so far no one has discussed 
the possibility of exporting spare parts for Czech-made T-72 
tanks to Iran. 
  The current issue of the political weekly RESPEKT reports 
that in January, Jan Vlcek, director of the arms maker 
consortium the RDP Group, wrote to Dlouhy to ask for his help in 
obtaining a license to export arms to Iran. 
  According to RESPEKT, Dlouhy sent Vlcek's letter to the 
Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministries and is still awaiting 
their replies before commenting definitively. 
  The letter also mentioned financial advantages for the Czech 
Republic in such a deal. The project would last for five years 
and bring in about $500 million, an amount that would help 
rejuvenate stagnant arms makers supplying components for the 
T-72. 
  This could also "fundamentally influence the employment 
situation, especially in the Moravian region," Vlcek said in 
this letter. It would also activate the arms industry in 
general and open the way to cooperation between Czech 
manufacturers and those in NATO countries. 
  The Czech Republic has announced its desire to become a full 
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance as soon as possible.
