FT  05 SEP 94 / Observer: Caught Knapping
This week's TUC conference should be good news for Jimmy Knapp, the signal
workers boss. Not only is he president of the shindig but his troops are
supposed to be on strike next Thursday, when most delegates like to slope
off early.
If the Preston-to-Blackpool branch line is shut it should boost attendance
on Friday, the last day of his conference. Even if the line remains open the
brothers are not going to cross the signal workers picket line to catch the
Preston train, are they?
The only worry is the possible strain on union finances if delegates insist
on taking taxis home. Standard fare from Blackpool to Birmingham is Pounds
100 and double that for Blackpool to London. Of course, there is always the
bus, lads.
