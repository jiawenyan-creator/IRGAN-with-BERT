FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Vard may agree to demands for
EGM
Vard, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, is expected today to
announce an extraordinary general meeting to consider demands of disgruntled
shareholders seeking to force a sweeping reorganisation of the board to
reflect recent changes in the group's ownership structure.
Shareholders have expressed dissatisfaction with the way Vard is being run,
frustration over losses and claims that the board has failed to implement a
strategy to dispose of assets in order to reduce the group's debt.
However, US-based Radisson Diamond is reported to be seeking to acquire one
of Vard's three cruise lines for an estimated Dollars 250m. Mr Torstein
Hagen, a Vard board member and member of the board of Kloster Cruise, the
group's cruise unit, is also reported to be considering a separate bid.
Mr Knut Kloster Jr, a Vard board member and chairman of the board of Kloster
Cruise, was forced recently to make a large disposal of Vard shares,
shrinking his stake to just over 7 per cent and thereby reducing his
influence over the group.
Following the disposal, Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, emerged as
Vard's biggest shareholder, owning just under 10 per cent of the share
capital.
Vard's divided board could see the exit of Mr Terje Mikalsen, chairman, Mr
Kloster Jr, Mrs Trine Kloster, his mother, and close friend Mr Joergen Heje.
Mr Trygve Hegnar, a board member and second biggest shareholder - who is
aligned with dissident shareholders - is said to harbour hopes of becoming
chairman, while Uni Storebrand is widely expected to demand board
representation.
Shareholder frustration swelled in January when a Dollars 565m deal to
dispose of two of the group's three up-market cruise lines collapsed, but
became exacerbated by last month's announcement of deeper losses in 1993.
