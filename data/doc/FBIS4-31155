  [Text] In today's edition of the "Signals of the Day" 
program on the First Program of Polish Radio, Grzegorz Kolodko, 
deputy prime minister and minister of finance, denied the claims 
of certain economists that drift is the characteristic of 
economic policy, which in their view threatens the slowdown of 
the economic reforms. 
  [Begin Kolodko recording] Of course, I do not agree with so 
critical a judgment. I can cite judgments that write with 
euphoria of the economic program of this government, which I 
regard as an exaggeration in the other direction. This is not 
drift. We are sailing forward fairly efficiently. We have 
caught the wind in our sails. It is difficult to gain control 
over certain processes. Others are altogether well controlled by 
us, which does not mean that there are not problems. 
  It is difficult to describe as drift a situation in which we 
have a growth of production over the five months of this year by 
10 percent in real terms. It is difficult to describe as drift 
a situation in which we have inflation over the first five 
months of the year that is all the time high [as heard] because 
there is no doubt that certain positive processes that are 
taking place in our economy are also the achievements of 
decisions and activities that were undertaken in the past. And, 
altogether, I would propose that we consider things less in 
terms of the category of the achievements of this or that 
government because these are, above all, the achievements of 
hard-working people. And, if the government will not hinder 
them in their work and will just create good conditions for 
them, which we are very concerned about doing, then I judge we 
will have cause for satisfaction. [end recording]
