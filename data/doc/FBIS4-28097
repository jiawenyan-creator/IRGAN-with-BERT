  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- A Chinese environmental 
delegation began meetings Monday [6 Jun] to seek funding from 
Japanese aid agencies and businesses for a 4 billion dollar 
sustainable development plan for China. 
  China's Agenda 21, developed with the UN Development Program 
(UNDP), contains 64 priority projects and over 500 total 
projects for sustainable and environmentally sound development 
in the next century, said Shi Han, a delegation member. 
  The delegation, led by Shi Jianmin, vice minister of China's 
State Planning Commission, arrived in Japan on Sunday. 
  It is scheduled to meet with several governmental and 
business organizations including the Foreign Ministry, the 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry. 
  China hopes to use part of the Agenda 21 funds to help make 
its industry more energy-efficient. It also wants to launch a 
clean-coal technology exchange with Japan, Shi said.
