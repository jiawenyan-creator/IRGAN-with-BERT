FT  20 MAY 94 / Major adamant on disabled bill
Ministers remain determined to block legislation outlawing discrimination
against the disabled amid signs that it could be debated in the Commons
today.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, told MPs yesterday that the private
member's bill that became the subject of a row recently over government
wrecking tactics was 'unworkable in a number of areas'.
Mr Major told MPs that the government would instead proceed with its own
plans on rights for the disabled, offering proposals 'that genuinely will
work and will help disabled people'.
At question time in the Commons, Mr Major said that the bill, backed by a
Labour MP, 'would impose immense costs and it would open up enormous scope
for litigation'.
But Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, may face renewed
difficulties over the bill today as backbench Labour MPs attempt to bring it
back to the Commons.
Mr Scott recently admitted that he had inadvertently misled the House when
he claimed that his department had not helped backbenchers draw up wrecking
amendments.
Friends of Mr Scott said yesterday that the minister would not bow to
pressure to resign. He insists that, although officials in his department
helped parliamentary counsel to draw up amendments, they did not directly
advise backbench Tory MPs.
It is understood that a number of disabled groups are supporting Mr Scott,
in the belief that he is one of the few government ministers who backs the
introduction of rights for the disabled.
