FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Lawson Mardon to axe 600 in
restructuring
LAWSON MARDON, the international packaging group, is cutting 600 from its
total payroll of 7,600 over the next 18 months and has taken a CDollars 31m
(USDollars 26.2m) special restructuring charge.
Mr Lawrence Tapp, president, said Lawson's organisational structure has been
outdated by the global recession and intense international competition .
Including the special charge, Lawson posted a 1991 loss of CDollars 10.8m,
or 38 cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 25.5m, or 89 cents, in
1990. Revenues were CDollars 1.2bn against CDollars 1.1bn.
The company, 52 per cent held by Cragnotti Financial of Ireland, will
consolidate five divisions into three main operating units  - two in Europe
and one in North America.
The company is a leader in European flexible packaging, especially for food
products.
The European units will be known as LMG Packaging and LMG Folding Cartons
and the North American unit LMG Packaging and Labels. The job losses will be
spread right through the company's operations as support staff are merged.
Lawson expects to trim annual operating costs by about CDollars 4m.
Commercial printing and finishing operations in Toronto and New Jersey are
being sold. A Toronto packaging plant has been moved to New York state.
