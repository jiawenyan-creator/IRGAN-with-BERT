FT  08 JAN 94 / Inkatha leader spurns elections
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's conservative Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party
said yesterday it would not take part in South Africa's first all-race
elections in April, Reuter reports from Durban.
The African National Congress, Inkatha's bitter rival, is widely tipped to
win the elections. Inkatha has been aligned with some right-wing parties
opposed to the elections.
