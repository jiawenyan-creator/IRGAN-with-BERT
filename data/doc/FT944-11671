FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: African Oxygen rises 8% to R136m
for year
African Oxygen, the South African engineering company with interests in
gases, welding and healthcare, has reported an 8 per cent increase in
after-tax profit to R136m (Dollars 39m) for the year ending in September, up
from R123m previously.
Turnover rose 19 per cent to R1.44bn from R1.2bn while trading profit jumped
15 per cent to R266m from R232m. However, net interest paid increased 37 per
cent to R44.6m from R32.7m, reflecting a rise in net borrowings to R385m
from R228m which the group attributed to a more aggressive investment
policy.
Mr Royden Vice, executive chairman, said he thought the results were
encouraging given the difficult political and economic environment of the
past year in South Africa.
He said he was particularly pleased with the acquisition of the LPG cylinder
business from Engen during the year, which makes Afrox the leading
distributor of liquefied petroleum gas in the southern Africa region.
Of the group's three main divisions, healthcare performed best and was
strengthened by the acquisition of three hospitals. Gases and welding had a
more difficult time, but Mr Vice said both had picked up recently as a
result of Afrox's involvement in several domestic capital projects.
Mr Vice said he was confident that next year should see a marked
improvement. 'Provided the economy grows and violence can effectively be
stemmed, 1995 should reflect an improved performance in all three business
areas.'
