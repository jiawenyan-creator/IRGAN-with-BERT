  [Abstract] Since pipe fittings 10-25 mm in diameter made 
from rods of 25Cr17Ni2Nb-Sh ball bearing steel 
(0.22-0.28% C, 
16-17.7 % Cr, 2.3-2.8 % Ni, 0.05-0.1 % Nb, 
0.30-0.7 % Mn, 
0.30-0.70 % Si,  0.015 % S,  0.008 
% P) for high-pressure 
conduits are being joined to the main by electrical brazing with 
a high-frequency current, it has been found necessary to 
determine the causes of embrittlement during that process. Two 
kinds of specimens were prepared for the study: 1) smooth rods 6 
mm in diameter with a neck 4 mm in diameter formed by cutting a 
notch; 2) smooth rods 6 mm in diameter without a notch. Some 
specimens of each kind were produced from blanks according to 
scheme A: heat treating the blanks by quenching from 980C + 
tempering at 700C, then machining them on the lathe with 
attendant formation of a cold-hardened layer. Other specimens of 
each kind were produced according to scheme B: machining 
annealed blanks on the lathe, then heat treating the finished 
rods by quenching from 1000C under vacuum + tempering at 
710C. The initial hardness of all specimens was 31.8 
Rockwell C. Also tubular specimens with a 15 mm inside diameter 
and a 5 mm wall thickness were prepared, according to scheme A. 
Mechanical tests and microstructural examination identified 
stress concentrators such as nonmetallic inclusions and 
cold-hardening as the causes of embrittlement. Simulation of the 
brazing process with inclusion of subsequent cooling in air or 
in a copper ``refrigerator'' revealed no anomalous changes in 
the impact strength and thus no temper embrittlement of 
specimens with a crack which had been quenched in oil and 
subsequently tempered to various hardness numbers within the 
25-35.8 Rockwell C range. Overheating during brazing was, 
however, found to increase the degree of embrittlement almost 
linearly with rising temperature: from 2.6% at 755C 
(A[.sub]c1[/]) to 28.6% at 860C (A[.sub]c3[/]. 
Recommendations for abating embrittlement of pipe fittings made 
of this steel are: designing them with large fillet radii, 
producing them in accordance with scheme B, and brazing them on 
at temperatures not higher than 800C. Figures 2; tables 3;
