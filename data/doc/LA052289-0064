THE STATE; 
THIRD CONDOR CHICK HATCHED 
A California condor chick was coaxed from its egg at the San Diego Wild Animal 
Park -- the third successful hatching this year in a captive breeding program 
aimed at saving the giant vulture from extinction. The chick named Kaduku was 
the first conceived by a pair of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo and changed 
biologists' notions about when condors reach sexual maturity, said animal park 
spokesman Tom Hanscom.
