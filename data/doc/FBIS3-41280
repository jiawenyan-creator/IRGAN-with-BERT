  [Text] At the end of January two suspected drug dealers 
were arrested in Vienna's 10th district carrying heroin with a 
black market value of about 1 million schillings. One of the 
suspects, a father of four from Turkey who has heavy debts, has 
admitted that he wanted to sell the drugs to an Austrian client. 
The second man vehemently denies having known this. 
  According to an official of the Vienna Security Bureau, an 
arrest warrant has been issued for the suspected mastermind of 
the drug deal, 25-year-old Turk Huseyin C.
