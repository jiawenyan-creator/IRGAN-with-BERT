  [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
said that Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari 
had postponed his visit to Cambodia because the military leader 
was not ready to pay the visit now. Regarding the postponement 
of the visit to Thailand by Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun 
Sen to discuss border problems, Prasong said that we are working 
with Phnom Penh authorities on a new schedule because of the 
Thai prime minister's planned visit abroad. 
  [Begin Prasong recording] We want Cambodia to understand our 
good intentions. Thailand wants to see the Cambodian problem 
settled through national reconciliation. We do not want to see 
conflicts or fighting. Thailand is willing to provide 
assistance to help bring in national reconciliation in Cambodia. 
We do not have a policy of supporting the Khmer Rouge or any 
particular faction. Our policy is to help them settle their 
problems in line with the Paris Peace Agreement. Other 
countries should refrain from acting in a way which can 
aggravate the conflict. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Supreme Command Information Department Director 
Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani said that the Supreme 
Commander had indefinitely postponed his visit to Cambodia 
because senior Cambodian leaders had accused Thailand of 
supporting the Khmer Rouge. Thailand has a policy of not 
supporting any Khmer faction, and has persistently adhered to 
that policy. On 12 April when an armed force crossed into Pong 
Nam Ron District of Chanthaburi Province, the Thai side disarmed 
and pushed them back. Lt. Gen. Anuson believes that the 
cancellation of the supreme commander's visit to Cambodia and 
the cancellation of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's visit to 
Thailand will not cause military tensions.
