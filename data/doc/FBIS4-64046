  [Text] Ukrainian people's deputy Leonid Kuchma, leader of 
the inter-regional bloc of reforms and candidate to the 
Ukrainian presidency, believes that "one should rule out any 
military solution to the Crimean issue." "A treaty is the only 
way to settle the conflict," says Kuchma's statement distributed 
on Thursday. 
  In his opinion, "it is possible and necessary" to preserve 
the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine's borders 
by establishing relations with Crimea on the basis of a treaty 
minding the Constitutions of Ukraine and Crimea." 
  Kuchma underlined that the Crimean parliament had no legal 
right to adopt a decision on restoration of Crimea's 
Constitution dated May 6, 1992 "without preliminary negotiations 
with Kiev." 
  The Crimean deputies, he says, "appeared in a trap prepared 
by those political forces which want to destabilize the 
situation in Crimea in order to cancel the presidential 
elections and the elections of Ukraine's local power bodies 
scheduled for June 26." 
  At the same time, Kuchma believes that several Ukrainian 
political forces "who constantly speak about the need to deprive 
Crimea of its autonomy, should carry their share of 
responsibility for this tension." 
  "Everything that is going on in Crimea over the last two 
years is being done with the silent consent and approval of 
Kiev," stresses the statement. Kuchma places "a substantial 
share of responsibility" on several Russian politicians of 
"chauvinist orientation" who provoked the Crimean radicals to 
urge immediate rejection of Ukrainian jurisdiction. 
  Kuchma concluded that "all attempts of the new states on the 
territory of the former USSR to solve the problems of autonomy 
by coercive means had led to war and only after bloody battles 
the parties saw the need to sit at the negotiating table."
