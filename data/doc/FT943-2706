FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Expiry date for warrants - At a
Glance
Holders of warrants in Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust (Temit)
have less than two weeks to sell or exercise their warrants before they
expire. The warrants, carrying the right to buy Temit shares at Pounds 1.27
by September 30 this year, were issued in a March 1990 rights issue, as part
of a package of five shares and 2.19 warrants, priced at Pounds 6.33 for the
package. The shares were trading this week at Pounds 4.185, and the warrants
at Pounds 2.93, making a total of Pounds 27.34 for the original package.
If warrant holders do not act before September 30, the warrants will be
exercised on their behalf, the resulting shares sold, and the proceeds
returned to the warrant holders, less costs. If holders do not exercise the
warrants themselves, they will miss out on a bonus issue of new shares and
warrants.
