FT  28 OCT 92 / Dan-Air job loss aftermath feared
THE takeover of Dan-Air by British Airways is having repercussions on
employment in the UK aviation industry beyond the 1,600 Dan-Air job losses
expected after the BA rescue.
FLS Aerospace, the UK-based aircraft maintenance subsidiary of FLS
Industries, the Danish industrial conglomerate, said it was being forced to
shed about 700 jobs - or 27 per cent of its UK workforce - as a direct
consequence.
Davies &amp; Newman, Dan-Air's parent company, sold the financially troubled
airline's engineering division in January last year for Pounds 26m to FLS.
Under the deal, FLS was entrusted with the maintainance of Dan-Air's fleet.
Only six months ago, Dan-Air extended the contract by three years, but FLS
said BA's agreement last Friday to take over Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1
had made void the deal. As BA had switched the bulk of Dan-Air's fleet
maintenance to its own engineering division, FLS said it would have to cut
staffing by about 700 over the next three weeks.
Although BA has just signed a five-year maintenance contract with FLS
involving mainly widebody jets, FLS said the contract would cover only 25
per cent of its original Dan-Air workload.
BA has said it will keep only 12 of Dan-Air's 38 narrowbody aircraft
establishing a low-cost short-haul Gatwick operation employing between 400
and 600 of Dan-Air's permanent staff of 2,000.
BA's Dan-Air rescue is facing escalating opposition from smaller UK airlines
which claim that it will seriously undermine competition and the
government's multi-airline industry policy.
British Midland Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Air UK and Britannia are jointly
lobbying against the deal, calling for an investigation by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
BA has warned that it will not complete the Dan-Air rescue if it is forced
to lose routes or landing slots or if the deal fails to win rapid regulatory
approval.
