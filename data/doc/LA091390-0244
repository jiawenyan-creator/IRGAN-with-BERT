QANTAS JET, C-5 IN NEAR COLLISION 
A giant U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy transport plane missed a Qantas airliner with 
382 people aboard by only 50 feet in a near collision over southern Thailand, 
the Australian airline said today. 
"Qantas has launched a full investigation into a near miss between one of its 
(Boeing) 747-400s and a United States Air Force C-5 Galaxy over Thailand on 
Tuesday," said the statement issued by the Qantas office in Bangkok. 
Qantas said the C-5, the largest aircraft used by the U.S. Air Force, was 
heading in a northerly direction when it passed directly above the Qantas 
aircraft, which was heading east on a flight from London to Singapore.
