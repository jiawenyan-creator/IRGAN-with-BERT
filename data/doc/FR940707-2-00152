<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations was established in accordance with the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (FACA) Pub. L. 92463. Pursuant to Section 10(a) of FACA, this is to announce that the Commission
will meet at the time and place shown below:



Time and Place




The meeting will be on Monday, July 25, 1994 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. in Room N3437 AD, U.S. Department
of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.



Agenda




The agenda for the meeting is as follows:


The Commission is seeking proposals and options to deal with the problems identified in its Fact Finding Report related
to the appropriate coverage of labor relations and employment law with respect to (1) the dividing line between employee
and individual contractor (part of ``contingent workers''), and (2) the proper scope of the exclusion of managers,
supervisors and salaried employees from the protection of such laws.


The Fact Finding Report identifies some of the facts and questions relevant to these issues at varying points including
the following pages: 2122, 3940, 5557, 9395, 110111, 123125.


The Commission invites the views of interested parties about both problems cited above that are reported to arise
under current law and the recommendations they would make to deal with these problems. The Commission would also welcome
comparisons of the current treatment of these questions under the National Labor Relations Act and various forms
of employment regulation (such as FLSA, OSHA, ERISA and civil rights law).



Public Participation




The meeting will be open to the public. It will be in session from 9:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. when it will adjourn. Seating
will be available to the public on a first-come, first-served basis. Disabled individuals wishing to attend should
contact the Commission no later than July 25, 1994, if special accommodations are needed.


The Commission welcomes by July 18 written statements of proposals to deal with the issues identified above. The Commission
may schedule, time permitting, the authors of such statements for a brief presentation and questions on July 25th,
if they indicate they would like to appear, in addition to organizational representatives invited to present proposals
to the Commission. Individuals who wish to submit written statements should send 15 copies on or before July 18, to
Mrs. June M. Robinson, Designated Federal Official, Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, U.S.
Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, telephone (202) 2199148.
