FT  09 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses produce limited
response to US vitality
BOURSES, even the late closing ones, had little time to respond to the
mid-morning access of vitality on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS saw the CAC 40 index rise 9.14 to 2,004.26, but dealers said business
was flat and dull as market turnover fell from FFr3.8bn to FFr2.6bn. Volume
in Suez, still the bourse's speculative lead, dropped considerably on the
day.
However, a selection of speculative feelers were put out in the advertising
and television business. Havas, the media and leisure group, rose FFr17.90
to FFr491.90 as gossip moved between the possibility of a share swap with
CEP Communications (which rose FFr9 to FFr424), or a merger with Canal Plus,
the television group. Canal Plus closed FFr22 higher at FFr1,380.
FRANKFURT shrugged off light early losses to end with the DAX 12.00 ahead at
1,694.82. Banks were mostly higher on interest rate hopes following the
Bundesbank's repo rate move last Friday, and chemicals were relatively weak
as the market waited for dividend cuts from the big three this week.
However, the main gains of the day covered a wide spectrum: Schering, in
pharmaceuticals, up DM11.50 to DM770, Volkswagen DM6.40 better at DM288.40,
Karstadt in retailers DM11 higher at DM794 and Linde, in engineering,
DM10.50 higher at DM799.50.
Schering, which has risen DM35 over the past three days, has been seeing
fund managers, said Mr Rod Hinkel at Hoare Govett, and its chickens may come
home to roost when it sees analysts, and produces DVFA earnings in just
under two weeks' time. Karstadt seems to have responded to some Kaufhof
sales figures and VW, the subject of analytical argument, has just attracted
a buy note from one broker.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index close 7.66 higher at 1,227.85 on hopes for
lower European interest rates, a strong rise in the dollar and some
speculative buying.
Societe Generale de Belgique closed BFr100, or 4.5 per cent higher at
BFr2,345. Rumours included a raid on its parent company, Suez, stories that
Suez might want to sell its 61 per cent stake and talk of SGB selling parts
of its industrial portfolio, notably a stake in its non-ferrous metals
subsidiary unit, Union Miniere. Arbed, in which SGB has a 26 per cent stake,
closed BFr120, or 4.2 per cent better at BFr2,980.
AMSTERDAM was led ahead by a round of short-covering, particularly in
cyclicals, and the CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 102.6. Philips was busy,
rising 50 cents to Fl 23.30, as domestic and foreign investors began to look
at the rest of this year, and 1994. Among cyclicals, DSM added Fl 3.40 to Fl
76.90 and Akzo put on Fl 3.30 to Fl 150.00.
The conglomerate, Begemann, shed Fl 1.50 to Fl 37.50 after two subsidiaries
took the market by surprise and sought protection from creditors. The
retailer, Ahold, added Fl 1.20 guilders to Fl 94.90 after
better-than-expected results from its 73 per cent owned subsidiary,
Schuitema, the wholesaler.
MILAN remained unfazed by the quickening pace of political developments and
the corruption scandal and it was, instead, technical considerations that
left shares lower after their strong showing last week.
The Comit index fell 7.34 to 528.13, reflecting declines in blue chip issues
ahead of the expiry later in the week of March options. Fiat settled down
L52 to L5,878 and Generali shed L550 to L36,900.
Shares of construction companies, however, went against the trend in
response to government measures announced over the weekend to unblock
contracts for public works, stalled for almost a year in corruption tangles.
The cement maker, Italcementi, gained L299 to settle at L11,117 while the
holding company, Italmobiliare, firmed L900 to L41,500. Mr Salvatore
Ligresti's Grassetto jumped L840 to settle at L6,900 while his Premafin
Finanziaria development company settled L550 higher at L6,000, amid
continuing speculation about an impending sale.
MADRID closed at a new high for the year, the general index rising 2.02 to
240.54 on the strong peseta, a jump in construction stocks and optimistic
inflation forecasts.
The construction sector was boosted by government plans to increase spending
on infrastructure, Ocisa leading with a Pta280, or 15 per cent rise to
Pta2,150. In contrast, the electrical utility, Iberdrola lost Pta16 to
Pta734 in 5.25m shares, accounting for 18.3 per cent of the total Pta21.2bn
turnover figure.
STOCKHOLM found support in demand for heavy engineering shares and the
Affarsvarlden index rose 7.06 to 1,039.0. The machine tool group, Sandvik,
saw its B shares add SKr10 to SKr475 in response to Friday's preliminary
1992 earnings report and favourable 1993 forecasts.
Volvo continued to gain ahead of its full-year figures due on Thursday.
Volvo's B shares were up SKr6 to SKr415 in continued heavy trading.
B shares in the medical equipment group, Gambro, rose SKr 2 to SKr338 after
it reported a 27 per cent rise in 1992 pre-tax profits.
OSLO climbed to a 1993 high in active trade, boosted by the central bank's
move, after the market closed on Friday, to cut its key overnight lending
rate by 25 basis points to 9.0 per cent. The all-share index rose 8.4 to
420.4 in turnover of NKr535m.
