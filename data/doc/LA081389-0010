FIVE SUMMER STORIES 
Kudos to you for devoting an entire issue to new California prose. The mix was 
excellent. The magazine should now give equal time to the poetry of our region. 
Certainly this would include more of author Kate Braverman ("Falling in 
October"), but let us have a summer reader representing the best of eclectic 
Los Angeles to round out the sampling of the major new voices of Californian 
writers.
