FT  07 DEC 92 / International Company News: Management shake-up for Dow
Chemical
DOW CHEMICAL, the second biggest US chemicals group, has unveiled a
reorganisation aimed at creating a more flexible management structure to
improve international competitiveness.
The company, which suffered a 35 per cent decline in third-quarter net
income to Dollars 145m, called the reorganisation a streamlining.
At the heart of the changes is a new division of management responsibilities
for Mr Frank Popoff, the chairman, and Mr William Stavropoulous, who becomes
president and chief operating officer next April.
Mr Popoff will be responsible for all Dow divisions as well as the Marion
Merell Dow pharmaceuticals subsidiary. Mr Stavropoulous will be responsible
for three core global businesses.
A six-person executive committee, including Mr Popoff and Mr Stavropoulous,
will take responsibility for long-term business strategies and finance.
Dow will discontinue its corporate product department and replace it with
global core business groups focused on plastics, chemicals and performance
products.
These will be headed by new group vice-presidents who will report to Mr
Stavropoulous.
Dow's management of Canada, Mexico and the US will be consolidated into a
North American area, to be based at corporate headquarters in Midland,
Michigan.
'Our present organisation has served us well over the past three decades,'
Mr Popoff explained yesterday.
'The new organisation will serve Dow's needs by maintaining flexibility to
adapt to change and enhancing global competitiveness,' he added.
