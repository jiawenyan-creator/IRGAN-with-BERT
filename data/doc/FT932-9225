FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Rank slightly ahead this year
Rank Organisation, the leisure and entertainments group, yesterday told a
meeting of financial analysts that up to the middle of April trading results
from continuing operations were marginally ahead of last year.
Trading conditions had not altered significantly since January, when the
group announced lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 230.1m (Pounds 250.5m) for
the year to October 31.
Results from UK businesses had been mixed. Trading in North America
continued to improve, but other markets remained difficult.
Rank Xerox's and Fuji Xerox's first quarter results to January 31 were lower
than last year as market conditions remained difficult in Europe and the Far
East.
However, there had subsequently been some signs of improvement in Japan.
