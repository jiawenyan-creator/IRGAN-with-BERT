FT  05 APR 94 / Review body tells Bar to reform complaints system
Big changes to barristers' working practices are recommended today by an
independent body set up to review professional standards at the Bar.
The review body, chaired by Lord Alexander QC, chairman of National
Westminster Bank and former head of the Bar, says in an interim report that
the Bar's complaints and disciplinary system should be modernised.
It recommends a complaints procedure separate from the disciplinary system
so that the Bar can deal more effectively with allegations of poor service
and pay compensation to victims of shoddy work. It adds that the Bar
compares badly with other professions in this area.
In an attempt to cut the number of briefs returned just before a trial, the
review body says barristers should be required to tell clients in writing
why they cannot continue with a case.
That would allow the client to take action if the reason for returning the
brief was inadequate, and would change the ethos towards returning work that
had been accepted.
The review body also calls for greater transparency in the way barristers
charge for their services so that clients know from the outset the basis on
which they will be charged.
It seeks barristers' views on other issues including:
Whether the rules prohibiting barristers from seeing witnesses in advance of
trials should be abolished.
Whether judges should be encouraged to take a more active role in reporting
long-winded or inept counsel.
The development of best-practice guidelines setting out counsel's
responsibilities in civil and criminal cases.
Whether contracts between barristers and solicitors would raise standards.
Whether junior barristers should be required to complete a probationary
period during which their work would be monitored.
Whether the 'cab rank' rule, under which barristers must accept a case if
they are qualified to conduct it, is still necessary.
