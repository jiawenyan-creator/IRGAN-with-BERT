DR. NEIL SOLOMON: FAT IN FISH 
Question: Is there much difference in the amount of calories and fat to be 
found in different kinds of fish? My family enjoys red snapper and swordfish, 
for example, and I could prepare either one. 
Would the calories and fat make any difference? 
Answer: A 3-ounce broiled serving of red snapper provides 104 calories and 1.2 
grams of fat. A similar portion of swordfish provides 128 calories and 4.3 
grams of fat.
