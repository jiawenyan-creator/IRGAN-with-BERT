FT  18 NOV 94 / Handful of mid-term poll results undecided
A handful of results from last week's mid-term elections remained undecided
yesterday, making the final size of the Republican majority in the House of
Representatives still in doubt.
But Mr Parris Glendening, the Democrat, finally felt secure enough to
announce his transition team as governor-elect of Maryland. With only 1,400
absentee ballots to be counted, his lead of 5,405 votes seemed unassailable,
although Mrs Ellen Sauerbrey, the Republican, still refused to concede
defeat and was alleging unspecified voting irregularities.
In California, Congressman Michael Huffington, the Republican, also had not
conceded to Senator Dianne Feinstein, though her lead had widened to nearly
138,000 votes with just over 500,000 still to be counted.
The outcome of one House race, in Connecticut, seems certain to be decided
either in the courts or in the House itself. The final tally gave
Congressman Sam Gejdenson, the Democrat, a four-vote lead, double the first
count, over Mr Edward Munster, but state officials refused to certify the
result.
In 1984, an equally close race in Indiana was eventually decided by the
House itself, then under Democratic control, in favour of the party's
candidate, Mr Frank McCloskey, after a recount had given the edge to a
Republican.
In California, Washington and New York, three first-term Democrats - Jane
Harman, Elizabeth Furse and Maurice Hinchey - were clinging to tiny leads,
but all less than the number of votes still to be counted and with
challenges on the cards. If these three and Mr Gedjenson survive, the House
line-up would be 230 Republicans, 204 Democrats and one independent.
Likely to be announced today is the result for the Alaskan governorship now
held by Mr Walter Hickel, an independent. The last count gave Mr Tony
Knowles, the Democrat, a 517-vote lead over Jim Campbell, the Republican,
with about 9,000 ballots outstanding.
