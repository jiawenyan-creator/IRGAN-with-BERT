FT  20 OCT 92 / Technology: Apple ties up to dock
Apple Computer has introduced a new option for the growing numbers of
'two-computer' users. The Macintosh Duo Dock system eliminates the task of
switching files and data between a desktop PC in the office and a notebook
computer used when travelling.
The new system lets users insert - or dock - a specially designed version of
the Macintosh Powerbook notebook computer into a desktop receptacle with
connections to a full-sized display and keyboard, printer and other
peripherals.
Thus, the PC user no longer needs two computers. He or she can carry the
portable Powerbook on business trips and then slot it into the Duo Dock when
returning to the office.
Other computer makers already offer similar docking systems, but Apple
appears to have developed the most practical solution to a problem that is
becoming increasingly widespread with the growing use of portable PCs.
'Users get a Macintosh desktop computer and a Macintosh Powerbook computer
in a single system,' says Randy Battat, vice president of Apple's portable
computing division. 'They can keep all their files with them and eliminate
the file management problems that come from working on two separate
computers.'
Unlike other docking stations, the Duo system allows users to go from
desktop computer to notebook computer in one simple step.
In particular, it eliminates the need to reconfigure applications programs
each time the computer is taken in or out of a docking bay.
The disappointing aspect of the announcement is that existing versions of
the Powerbook do not fit in the new Duo Dock.
Apple is offering two docking systems. The Duo Dock is designed for offices
with local area networks. It is priced, in the US, at Dollars 1,079. The Duo
Mini Dock, for individual users, will be priced at Dollars 589 and will be
available in December.
