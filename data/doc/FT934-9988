FT  08 NOV 93 / Observer: Gifted with hindsight
Gerald Hines, the Texas property developer spearheading a DM550m hotel,
office and residential complex in east Berlin, has long been prospecting
this side of the Atlantic. Progenitor of the 'galleria' concept in the US,
Houston-based Hines Interests has skilfully ridden out the worst ravages of
the American real estate slump. For the dapper, 68-year-old vegetarian is
that rare breed, a cautious developer. He abhors debt and building on spec
without big tenants lined up.
But, having developed some 92m square feet in America, he faces a period of
scant new construction. He is redoing a resort in Aspen, Colorado, but
otherwise the focus is mostly abroad - Mexico City, and now Europe.
Hines has plenty of connections with the old continent. The Royal
Dutch/Shell pension fund has invested in many a project. Twenty years ago
Deutsche Bank also identified his properties as sound homes for its clients'
funds - though ironically it is Commerzbank and Hypo Bank, as former owners
of part of the Berlin plot, who win the financing of Hines' first German
foray.
While Jeffrey Hines, a son from his first marriage, is now president of the
company, Gerald continues to take an active role in his favourite projects -
such as Berlin. With a young German second wife, whose father was born in
Berlin, Hines has thrown himself into the highly politicised negotiations of
buying land in Berlin. He also had a hand in selecting as one of the
architects Josef Kleihues, who has come to the attention of a wider
international audience with his design for the new Museum of Contemporary
Art in Chicago.
However astute and conservative he may be, it emerges that Hines was not all
that far off making his debut in Europe with a rather different project -
Canary Wharf, before Olympia &amp; York appeared on the scene. 'When we saw the
access problem, we decided to pass' is the official line from Houston.
