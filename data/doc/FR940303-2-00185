 

B. Engine and Transmission Technology


Some manufacturers made significant improvements in engine technology for MY 1993. Chrysler's Dodge Intrepid,
Chrysler Concorde, and Eagle Vision offer a 3.5L, 24-valve V6 engine combined with a new 42LE electronic 4-speed
transaxle to propel the LH cars. Chrysler claims that these are the most technologically advanced, responsive, and
reliable powertrains in its history. This SOHC engine delivers a peak 214 hp at 5,800 revolutions per minute (rpm)
and 221 foot-pounds (ft.-lbs.) of torque at 2,800 rpm.
Instead of using the usual transverse position of front-wheel-drive engines, Chrysler went longitudinal, or north-south,
in part to allow for later adaptation of future rear-to or 4-wheel-drive versions.
Ford improved its MY 1993 Mark VIII with a new DOHC 32-valve all-aluminum version of its 4.6L modular V8 engine.
The engine is rated at 280 hp at 5,500 rpm, with a torque rating of 285 ft.lbs. at 4,500 rpm, about 33 percent more
power than the 4.6L SOHC engine in its 210 hp dual exhaust form. The new engine is the first DOHC, 4-valve V8 engine
mass produced by Ford, and the first Ford all-aluminum V8 production engine. The engine features improved
durability, quality and reliability, improved fuel efficiency through reduced friction and optimized combustion
chamber design, and use of advanced technology in design and manufacturing.
GM's powerful, 2-door sporty coupes, the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, were redesigned for MY 1993 with
an OHV 3.4L 6-cylinder engine, that develops 160 hp at 4,600 rpm and 200 ft.-lbs. of torque at 3,600 rpm, an increase
of 20 in both hp and ft.-lbs. of torque compared to last year. The added power is the result of a 2 millimeter (mm) increase
in bore to 91.9 mm, a rise in compression ratio to 9:1 from 8.5:1 and the addition of sequential fuel injection in place
of multipoint fuel injection.
GM's Chevrolet and GMC truck divisions have a new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission in full-sized
pickups. The new 4L 60E transmission replaces the nonelectronic 4-speed unit.
The Geo Prizm has a Toyota-built electronically controlled 4-speed automatic with lockup torque converter. The
new transmission is coupled to a 1.8L DOHC 4-cylinder engine delivering 115 hp at 5,600 rpm and 115 ft.-lbs. of torque
at 4,800 rpm.
