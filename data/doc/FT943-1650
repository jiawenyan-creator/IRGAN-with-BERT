FT  23 SEP 94 / British Steel to raise prices
British Steel is raising list prices on its strip products - one of the
manufacturing industry's most important raw materials - by between 7 per
cent and 10 per cent from January 1, the sixth increase since the beginning
of last year.
The rise, foreshadowed in September when British Steel raised prices for
both strip and plate products, amounts to Pounds 25 a tonne - but the
company said it would not raise strip prices again before the end of next
June.
The latest increase would restore UK strip prices to their previous peak in
June 1990, before the recession, and would mean that prices have risen 46
per cent since the low point in March last year. Strip products are used in
the automotive, domestic appliance and many other industries.
British Steel's action is bound to heighten concern among smaller steel
users about raw material price increases, which they are often unable to
pass on to their larger customers. Big steel users negotiate their own
long-term contracts.
Last night, British Steel played down the effect of the rise on the UK
inflation rate. Each 1 per cent increase in steel prices, if fully passed
on, would add only one two-hundredths of a percentage point to inflation, it
said.
Defending the rises, it said that in spite of the company's low cost base,
its profitability was still not high enough. Strip mill product prices were
still 'substantially lower' than those in the US and Japan, it said. Demand
had risen over recent months, particularly in the UK, and was likely to
continue to strengthen with the next 18 months. Also, there was continuing
evidence of steel shortages at some European mills and a number of blast
furnace relines.
The UK steelmaker is also reviewing its carriage rates - unaltered since
1989 and typically between Pounds 5 and Pounds 10 a tonne for big customers.
The percentage rise, to be announced next month, would not be substantial,
it said.
