A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements: Existing Sources and New Dischargers 


1. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit and 
lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is authorized 
to discharge treated groundwater and storm water that has been 
contaminated by Automotive Gasoline. It is anticipated that these 
contaminated waters will be treated by air stripping, followed by 
activated carbon adsorption, if necessary, or equivalent treatment 
to meet the following effluent limitations. 
Such discharges shall be limited and monitored by the permittee as 
specified below:

 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will 
constitute a violation of Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 
(July 11, 1993) 624.244(3)(a) and the terms of this permit. The 
testing for this requirement must conform with Part V of this permit. 

For fresh waters and coastal waters, the pH of the effluent shall 
not be lowered to less than 6.0 units for fresh waters, or less than 
6.5 units for marine waters, or raised above 8.5 units, unless the 
permittee submits natural background data in the NOI request 
confirming a natural background pH outside of this range. If 
natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling 
data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be less 
than 6.0 units for fresh waters, or less than 6.5 units in marine 
waters, the pH shall not vary below natural background or vary more 
than one (1) unit above natural background for fresh and coastal 
waters. If natural background of the receiving water, as revealed 
by sampling data from the permittee in the NOI request, is 
determined to be higher than 8.5 units, the pH shall not vary above 
natural background or vary more than one (1) unit below natural 
background of fresh and coastal waters. The acceptable pH range 
will be included in the letter granting permit coverage and on the 
DMR. The pH shall be monitored once every month by grab sample, or 
continuously with a recorder. (See item I.B.4). 
In accordance with FAC 62302.500(1)(ac)(42593), the discharge 
shall at all times be free from floating solids, visible foam, 
turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on 
surface waters. 
Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements 
specified above shall be taken at the following location(s): 
Nearest accessible point after final treatment but prior to actual 
discharge or mixing with the receiving waters.

2. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit 
and lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is 
authorized to discharge treated groundwater and storm water 
that has been contaminated by Aviation Gasoline, Jet Fuel or 
Diesel. 
It is anticipated that these contaminated waters will be 
treated by air stripping, followed by activated carbon 
adsorption, if necessary, or equivalent treatment to meet the 
following effluent limitations. Such discharges shall be 
limited and monitored by the permittee as specified below:
