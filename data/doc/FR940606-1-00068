Safety Standards for Self-Propelled Vessels Carrying Bulk Liquefied Gases 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to amend its regulations concerning safety standards for self-propelled vessels carrying
bulk liquefied gases. These amendments are necessary because the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Code
on which many of these regulations are based has been amended. This proposal would make the changes necessary to align
these regulations with the IMO Code and to clarify certain provisions in the existing regulations.

Dafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Thomas J. Felleisen, Project Manager, and Mr. Stephen
H. Barber, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. 



Background and Purpose 



On November 12, 1975, the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (now the International Maritime
Organization or IMO) adopted the ``Code for Construction and Equipment of Ships Carring Liquefied Gases in Bulk''
(Gas Carrier Code), Resolution, A.328 (IX) without amendments. Coast Guard regulations based on this code were put
into effect May 3, 1979 (44 25986), Since 1975, the Gas Carrier Code has been amended four times: April 19, 1978 (see
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) XXXVIII/22), May 8, 1979 (see MSC XL/26), May 20, 1980 (see MSC/Cir. 284), and June
14, 1983 (see MSC/Cir. 356). 

IMO's amendments to the Gas Carrier Code include corrections and clarifications, incorporation of standards for
new or novel containment systems, improvement of the carriage requirements for several of the more hazardous cargoes,
expansion of the list of chemicals to which the code applies, and revisions to align the Gas Carrier Code with the ``International
Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (IBC) and the ``International
Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefield Gases in Bulk'' (IGC). 

These amendments were developed by the IMO Subcommittee on Bulk Chemicals, the body responsible for maintenance
of the Code. The Coast Guard actively participated in the development of these changes to the Gas Carrier Code by submitting
position papers when the amendments were proposed. This rulemaking would revise the Coast Guard regulations in 46
CFR part 154 to reflect these amendments. 

One of the most notable revisions would be the inclusion of standards for internal insulation tanks in new 154.454
through 154.458, as well as in several existing sections. These standards would be included in order to bring the U.S.
regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with the Gas Carrier Code. 

Part 154 would be revised to include carriage requirements for seven cargoes previously regulated only under 46 CFR
part 153. The cargoes are diethly ether, a mixture of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide containing not more than 30%
ethylene oxide, isoprene, isopropylamine, monoethyamine, propylene oxide, vinyl ethyl ether, and vinylidene
chloride. These cargoes are being added in order to bring the U.S. regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with
the Gas Carrier Code.
