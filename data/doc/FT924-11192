FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall appointments to CST board
Jupiter Tyndall yesterday won its argument with CST Emerging Asia Trust when
three Jupiter nominees were appointed to the board.
Jupiter, which manages and owns 29.9 per cent of CST has been locked in a
long running disagreement with the trust. Jupiter sought to replace the
trust's board while CST threatened to sack Jupiter and liquidate the trust.
Yesterday, CST's resolution to wind up the trust failed to win shareholders'
support
As a result, Mr John Craig, deputy chairman of Jupiter, Mr Michael Heathcote
Amory, managing director, and Mr James Roe have joined the board.
