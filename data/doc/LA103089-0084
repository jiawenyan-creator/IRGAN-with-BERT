NATION; 
BUSH TO STUMP FOR GOP HOPEFULS 
President Bush will campaign next weekend to boost Republican candidates in 
Virginia, New Jersey and possibly New York before next week's election. 
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced today that Bush will 
travel Friday to Richmond and Norfolk, Va., for fund-raising events for 
gubernatorial candidate Marshall Coleman and other Republican candidates. 
Afterward, he will fly to Bloomfield, N.J., to attend a rally for Rep. Jim 
Courter (R-N.J.), who is running for governor. 
Fitzwater also hinted that Bush may also campaign Sunday for former U.S. Atty. 
Rudolf Giuliani, who has an uphill battle in the contest for mayor of New York 
with David Dinkins.
