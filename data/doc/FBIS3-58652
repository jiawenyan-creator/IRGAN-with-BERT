  [Text] The "Popular Party" was formed at the Sturzo 
Institute today, 75 years after the appeal [made by Christian 
Democratic Party, DC, founder Father Sturzo] to the "free and 
strong." [Education Minister Rosa Russo] Iervolino, [DC Chamber 
of Deputies spokesman Gerardo] Bianco, and [DC Deputy Gabriele] 
De Rosa were alongside [DC Secretary Mino] Martinazzoli. Among 
those invited were Giovanni Spadolini and Giorgio Napolitano, 
the speakers of the two chambers of parliament, as well as 
members of the old DC, including Amintore Fanfani, Paolo Emilio 
Taviani, Emilio Colombo and Ciriaco De Mita. Shortly before, 
Martinazzoli had alluded to the absence of the centrist faction. 
He said the Italian Popular Party was being born "without some 
friends who, for reasons I am not politically able to decipher, 
have decided not to participate in this undertaking. This makes 
me bitter, but this defection can in no way convince me to give 
up ideas I believe to be right even as far as the outlook is 
concerned."
