FT  08 APR 93 / Plea to drop Clifford charges
THE US Justice Department yesterday asked for the dismissal of federal
charges against Mr Clark Clifford and Mr Robert Altman over the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International scandal, writes George Graham.
The department said it had decided to ask for the dismissal because of Mr
Clifford's ill health, and so as not to interfere with a parallel
prosecution of Mr Altman and Mr Clifford on charges in New York state.
The two men were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of deceiving US
bank regulators over BCCI's covert takeover of First American, a Washington
bank.
Their federal trial was due to start on June 1 but a senior department
official told a federal court in Washington that it was near-certain Mr
Clifford's ill health would not let him stand trial then. The Democratic
former defence secretary, 86, recently underwent a quadruple heart by-pass.
Mr Altman's New York trial, on fraud and bribery charges to do with BCCI,
began last month and is expected to last about two months.
Even if it were ended before the federal trial's scheduled start,
preparations for the latter would burden both the New York prosecutors and
Mr Altman's defence, said the official.
