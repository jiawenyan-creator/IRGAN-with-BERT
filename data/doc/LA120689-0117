ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 
2 BARS FACED WITH NEW RESTRICTIONS 
Two Newport Boulevard bars must operate under new restrictions, aimed at 
appeasing neighbors, or lose their entertainment permits. 
The City Council voted to extend the use permit for Henry 'N Harry's Goat Hill 
Tavern at 1830 Newport Blvd. for three months only. In addition, the owners 
were ordered to correct a number of electrical violations and take steps to 
control customers. 
Police records indicate that between September, 1988, and September, 1989, 
there were 57 reports involving the tavern. 
The council also extended the permit for Hogue Barmichael's bar at 1976 Newport 
Blvd. until March. The bar also was ordered to close the dance floor at 11 p.m. 
on Friday and Saturday nights, restrict the line outside to 20 people and 
improve parking. 
Owner Jules Boryczewski said the restrictions will, effectively, force him out 
of business.
