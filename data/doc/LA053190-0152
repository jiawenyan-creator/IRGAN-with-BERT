METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOVIETS UNVEIL PLAN FOR BANKING PARTNERSHIP 
Soviet officials announced Tuesday the formation of a partnership with American 
investment bankers to attract as much as $100 million in private investment to 
support the expansion of small business in the Soviet Union. 
"Our task is precisely to use the experience of American small businesses to 
facilitate our own growth," Valentin M. Vologhzin, chairman of the Committee 
for Economic Reforms for the USSR, told a news conference at Los Angeles City 
Hall. 
The committee, represented by a five-member delegation making an 11-day visit 
to Southern California, signed the agreement last month in Moscow with Acquest 
International. The agreement was expanded this week to provide for the 
formation of a $100-million capital fund that is to be matched with Soviet 
funds.
