FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Enichem reveals record net loss
Enichem, the chemicals subsidiary of Italy's state-controlled Eni group,
yesterday announced a record net loss for 1993, after deliberately taking
into account heavy extraordinary charges to prepare for a four-year
restructuring programme.
In 1993, the group lost L2,668bn (Dollars 1.7bn) - even higher than the
L2,200bn loss Enichem itself predicted last November - compared with
L1,560bn in 1992. Charges relating to research and plant maintenance, the
reduction of fixed costs, the closure of the least-efficient factories, and
redundancies amounted to L1,013bn.
Enichem forecast a 'drastic reduction of losses for 1994', and said it could
begin to break even in 1995 or 1996. Much depends on the health of the core
markets of base chemicals, polyethylene and elastomers, which will be left
over once asset sales are completed.
To help Enichem through the worst, its parent company is expected to back a
large increase in capital - possibly as much as L3,000bn - at a shareholder
assembly at the end of next month. Any such cash injection will be carefully
analysed by the European Commission for possible state aids.
Enichem's revenue fell to L10,643bn in 1993, although that figure was
roughly in line with 1992 when adjusted for disposals.
The group has already embarked on a four-year programme of restructuring and
L2,500bn of asset sales in an attempt to bring down its debt. Net financial
debt stood at L8,252bn at the end of last year, compared with L7,391bn a
year earlier. The company said it wanted to bring debt down to around 1.5 or
1.6 times shareholders' funds, instead of the present 3.4 times.
Servicing the debt cost Enichem L805bn last year, although that was L88bn
less than in 1992. Even before financial charges, the operating loss was 86
per cent higher than in 1992 at L572bn compared with L308bn.
