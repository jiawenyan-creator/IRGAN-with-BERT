  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman 
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress 
[NPC], met here today with Sakhat Muradov, chairman of the Grand 
National Assembly of Turkmenistan. 
  During the meeting, Qiao said that China hopes to maintain 
the good-neighborly relations with Turkmenistan on the basis of 
the five principles of peaceful co-existence and to strengthen 
cooperation with it in various fields including politics, 
economy, science and technology, culture and education. 
  Qiao Shi said that China's cooperation with foreign 
countries 
has been greatly enhanced over the past 15 years when China has 
been implementing the reform and open policy and the country has 
made great achievements in the introduction of foreign funds and 
technology. 
  Briefing the guests on China's legislative system, Qiao said 
that the NPC has played a major role in promoting the country's 
building of democracy and the legal system. 
  It is necessary to draw on foreign experience in the 
development of both democratic politics and the economy, Qiao 
said. But that does not mean copying foreign models wholesale 
and every country has to develop according to its own conditions. 
  Muradov said that Turkmenistan attaches much importance to 
developing relations with China and is closely watching China's 
economic growth, adding that China's experience might be useful 
in developing its own economy. 
  During the meeting, the two sides expressed the hope for 
increasing exchanges between the two parliaments in the future.
