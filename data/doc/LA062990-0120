GLENDALE'S SWANSON WILL END LONG WAIT AND SIGN WITH CSUN 
Apparently ending a lengthy recruitment, Dave Swanson said he will sign 
scholarship papers with Cal State Northridge this morning. 
Swanson, a Glendale College high jumper and basketball player, said his 
scholarship papers arrived in the mail Thursday. 
After waiting several days for the package, Swanson will return to the CSUN 
basketball office to sign the papers. 
"I feel great," Swanson said. "I'm getting some sleep now." 
Swanson said he will receive a full scholarship, which will include a 
combination of track and basketball aid. He turned down a partial scholarship 
offer to compete in track for UCLA. 
"Northridge was a place where I could do both," said Swanson, who has two years 
of eligibility in each sport. "I'm going to give a total commitment in 
basketball; however, track is something I've really learned to love." 
Swanson spent his freshman year at Northridge. He redshirted in basketball and 
was a Division II All-American in track. Swanson, an Alemany High graduate, 
then transferred to Glendale. He redshirted his first year in track before 
setting a personal record of 7-0 3/4 this spring when he finished second in the 
state junior college championships. 
A 6-foot-5 swingman, Swanson started two years for Glendale's basketball team 
and was the second-leading scorer last season at 17.5 points per game.
