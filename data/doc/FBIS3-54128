  [Excerpt] Israel will demand from the United States 
military superiority along the northern border within the 
framework of any agreement on a Golan Heights withdrawal, 
political sources in Jerusalem disclosed at the weekend. Israel 
will be opposed to strategic parity and will demand means to 
assure the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] qualitative 
superiority. Israel will demand demilitarization of the Golan 
Heights area from which it will pull back, and even beyond that 
into Syrian territory, but will insist on its demand that there 
will not be equal footing [last two words in English], which 
would mean demilitarization of the Upper Galilee. 
  The framework of the security package Israel will demand 
will 
include, as already reported, a demand for early warning 
stations deep inside the territory to be evacuated, a move which 
would permit a territorial concession. When Ambassador Itamar 
Rabinovich, head of delegation to the talks with Syria, meets 
his Syrian counterpart Muwaffaq al-'Allaf in Washington 
tomorrow, he will insist on first discussing the security 
arrangements. [passage omitted]
