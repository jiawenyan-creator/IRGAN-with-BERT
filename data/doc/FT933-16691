FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major attacks Labour over policy on
Northern Ireland
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday triggered a rare political row on Northern Ireland
at Westminster by angrily denouncing an idea floated by Labour that
responsibility for the province should be shared between London and Dublin.
He cheered Unionist MPs by saying Conservatives stood 'four square' behind
the union with Britain. But the prime minster's comments infuriated
nationalist MPs and could set back still further the chances of round-table
talks on Northern Ireland resuming this year.
Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
said Mr Major was 'playing politics' while lives were being lost.
Last night Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, wrote to Mr John
Smith, Labour leader, asking for clarification of Labour's Ulster policy.
Earlier Sir Patrick said uncertainty about Northern Ireland's constitutional
status 'must make the task of the security forces harder.'
The government has in the past tried to act as a neutral 'facilitator' in
negotiations and has enjoyed backing from Labour for its efforts. It has
said Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK as long as a majority of
the population want that.
But Mr Major firmly rejected 'shared responsibility' which, he said, would
have to be imposed against the wishes the province's population.
