FT  18 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Indoor water park at North Shields
LAING NORTHERN has won a contract, worth about Pounds 6m, to construct an
indoor water park for Tyneside Waterpark at North Shields with Tyne &amp; Wear
Development Corporation and TSB as financiers.
Work has started and completion is scheduled for summer 1993. The building,
part of the 200 acres Royal Quays development, will be rectangular in shape
with a concave curved roof. A spine wall will separate the main volume of
the building from the flume tower and run out area.
Most of the construction will be at ground floor level with two-storey
accommodation against the spine wall.
The building will be entered at one end directly into the first floor. At
this level there will be the control, administration, cafe, bar and support
spaces.
The building is designed to take 12 rides: six 'speed' slides; five
conventional flumes and one river ride. Initially there will be four flumes,
the river ride and two 'speed' slides - the 'Twister', which will be 85
metres long with a take-off height of 12.5 metres.
