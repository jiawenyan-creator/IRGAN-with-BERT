CUBAN PRESS RIDICULES PROFESSIONAL BOXING IN THE SOVIET UNION AS 'CIRCUS' 
Cuba's Communist Party daily Granma published an article today ridiculing a 
professional boxing tournament held in the Soviet Union, saying it was more 
like a circus show than a boxing competition. 
It was a rare outburst of criticism for an event hosted by the Soviet Union, 
Cuba's principal political ally and main trading partner. 
The article by Nadia Diaz, Granma's correspondent in Moscow, described what it 
said was the first professional boxing tournament held between the Soviet 
Union, the United States, Mexico, Italy and France. It was shown on Soviet 
television Saturday. 
"What my eyes witnessed this Saturday on Moscow television was something that I 
wouldn't like to put a name to so as not to hurt the feelings of our beloved 
brother nation," Diaz wrote. 
But she went on: "In reality, what I saw was more of a circus show than a 
boxing bout."
