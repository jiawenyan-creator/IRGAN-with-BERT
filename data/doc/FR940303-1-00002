The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Jet
Route J512 from the Kalispell, MT, VOR/DME to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, excluding that airspace within Canada.
This action would enhance traffic flow between the United States and Canada. This action would also amend V351
from Kalispell, MT, to the United States/Canadian Border to reduce controller workload. Jet routes and domestic
VOR Federal airways are published in paragraphs 2004 and 6010(a), respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17,
1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993.
The jet route and domestic VOR Federal airway listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
