  [Text] Jerusalem (DPA) -- Deutsche Aerospace [Dasa] Chief 
Juergen Schrempp sees possibilities for more intensive 
cooperation between his corporation and the Israel high-tech and 
armament industry. Schrempp, who arrived in Jerusalem on Monday 
[14 February] for a brief talk with Israeli head of government 
Yitzhaq Rabin, told the press afterwards that both sides could 
benefit from such cooperation. 
  The Dasa chief had visited, among other things, the Israeli 
aviation corporation Israel Air Force Industries (IAI) and the 
armament company Rafael. He noted that the high-tech companies 
have excellent quality, which need not shy away from 
international comparison. Both sides would benefit from an 
exchange in the field of technology. As fields of cooperation 
he cited defense technology, satellite technology, and aircraft 
construction. Schrempp spoke of efforts by Airbus to sell planes 
to the Israeli El Al airline. Smaller planes could be of 
interest for El Al, if regional aviation becomes more important 
as a result of a stable peace in the Middle East. 
  In his talk with Schrempp, Rabin explained his government's 
interest in balancing the high deficit in his country's trade 
balance with Europe. However, politics can provide industry 
only with a framework, which then has to be fleshed out by the 
companies themselves, Rabin noted.
