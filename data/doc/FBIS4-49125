  [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- Construction of Taiwan's 
first software industrial park will begin Thursday [5 May], the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs said Monday. 
  Occupying an area of 4.03 hectares in the Taipei suburb of 
Nankang, the software complex calls for a total investment of 
NT$7.1 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (US$267.92 million), of 
which US$5 billion (US$188.67 million) will come from a 
syndicated bank loan, ministry officials noted. 
  Shih Cheng Development Co. is in charge of the project, 
which 
aims to build a first-class research and development environment 
for the software industry and thus help upgrade Taiwan's 
industrial base, they said. 
  The park will be completed in 1995, and is expected to have 
6,000 software workers.
