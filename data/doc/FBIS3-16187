  [Text] Almaty, 15 Mar -- A big fire has occurred at 
Baykonur cosmodrome. It started in the annex to one of the 
assembly and testing complexes and then spread to the 
headquarters of the military unit serving it. This is reported 
by the republic's press today, quoting news sources. 
  The preliminary damage amounts to some 3 billion rubles. Of 
the technological equipment only the telemetric apparatus 
suffered. At the cosmodrome there is another complex -- a 
back-up one. Experts state that the fire which occurred will 
not affect the execution of the space program. So the launch of 
the next "Progress" cargo spacecraft planned for 18 March will 
not be postponed.
