SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.
