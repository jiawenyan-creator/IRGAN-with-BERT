FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Weak demand blamed for Fortnum &amp; Mason
setback
WEAK retail demand was yesterday blamed for a Pounds 294,000 fall in interim
pre-tax profits at Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly department store.
Fortnum said lower profits of Pounds 1.51m for the 28 weeks to January 23,
down from Pounds 1.8m last time, were also due to repair and maintenance
costs and advertising expenditure.
In spite of a slight increase in turnover, up Pounds 169,000 to Pounds
15.6m, Mr Gary Weston, chairman, said trading conditions remained gloomy.
The Piccadilly store saw sales decline 0.5 per cent although this was offset
by improved exports. Overall, exports rose 13.7 per cent - with sales in the
US more than doubled, France up by 49 per cent and Japan 28 per cent.
Earnings were 235p (279p) and the interim dividend was unchanged at 86p.
