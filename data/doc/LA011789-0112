'NOVA' DOESN'T MAKE 'HOT ENOUGH' CLEAR ENOUGH 
"Hot Enough for You?" asks the title of tonight's edition of PBS' "Nova," 
suggesting that the generally excellent science show's consideration of "the 
greenhouse effect" might be informal, lively, clear and to the point. 
Unfortunately, it's none of those things. If you're expecting "Nova" to 
condense and explain all of the confusing, conflicting, uncertain and worrying 
claims about how atmospheric pollutants may be heating up the earth and causing 
other havoc, you're going to be disappointed. A muddled subject has resulted in 
a muddled show (at 8 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, 9 p.m. on Channel 50). 
In the first half-hour, we're deluged with various voices, speculations, 
mind-boggling figures, pessimistic scientific studies, inconclusive scientific 
studies, technical talk and a lot of "maybes." 
Several scientists voice their theories about the possible effects of carbon 
dioxide and other fossil-fuel wastes in the atmosphere: The overall temperature 
of the earth might go up, or maybe just temperatures in certain areas; the sea 
level could rise; there may be heavy crop damage, starvation, etc. 
"Hot Enough for You?" lacks both the perspective and the tools -- a few 
graphics would have been nice -- to make all of this comprehensible, or at 
least to sort out the more viable theories from the more far-fetched ones. 
The program is a bit better in the final 15 minutes or so, where it considers 
potential solutions -- from practical if controversial ones, such as more (and 
safer, less costly) nuclear energy, to extremely unlikely ones such as planting 
250,000 acres of forest for every conventional-fuel energy plant. TERRY
