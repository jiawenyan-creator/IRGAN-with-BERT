FT  14 OCT 93 / Business braced for rate increases of 22%
MANY businesses in England and Wales could face rises in the uniform
business rate of more than 22 per cent next April as a result of yesterday's
retail price index figures.
The RPI increased by just 1.8 per cent, but those still adjusting to the
business rate from the old system may face additional transitional payments
of up to 20 per cent.
Mr Robin Goodchild, head of research at Gerald Eve, a London-based firm of
rating surveyors, warned yesterday that retailers and other businesses would
face rises of up to 22.15 per cent unless the November Budget deferred the
transitional increases.
Mr Goodchild said: 'This isn't going to help the recovery. Retailers are
certainly struggling.'
The arrangements, which were announced when the rate was introduced, limited
transitional rises to 20 per cent a year.
Coupled with the increase in the rate of inflation to 1.8 per cent, the
maximum business rate rise next year could be up to 22.15 per cent.
Any rises in the rate itself are limited by law to the increase shown by the
RPI figures in the previous year. The rate will be 42.3p in England and
44.8p in Wales from next April 1 unless ministers make any adjustments. That
compares with the rate in England of 41.6p this year and 40.2p last year,
and in Wales of 44p and 42.5p respectively.
About 500,000 of the 1.8m business premises in England and Wales are still
subject to transitional arrangements.
The last two Budgets deferred increases caused by transitional payments,
keeping the increase in rates to businesses to the rate of inflation for
last year and this year.
Retailers were particularly affected because the value of shops rose by a
greater level than other commercial premises between the rate valuations in
1973 and 1980. The next valuation is due in 1995.
Mr Goodchild said businesses were likely to lobby the government to limit
rate increases to inflation again.
