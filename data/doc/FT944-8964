FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: RJB confident of clearing debts incurred in
British Coal offer
RJB Mining expects to have cleared all debts incurred in its bid for the
English regions of British Coal by the end of 1998, and is looking for
pre-tax profit margins of about 18 per cent in 1999.
The forecasts form part of presentations to City institutions which the
company and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its adviser, have started in the last
few days.
Some of the figures in the presentation are expected to be altered before
the company issues its prospectus for the issue of shares, which is likely
to be next month.
In particular, the Pounds 914m tender which secured the government's backing
for RJB as preferred bidder for the three English coal regions, may be
revised downwards when the company completes its 'due diligence' of its
proposed acquisition.
However, RJB and BZW are telling potential investors they are not expecting
material changes. They say that even if Pounds 914m is the final price, the
company is making significant profits.
Profit before interest and taxation of the regions being acquired is
forecast at Pounds 171m in calendar 1995, followed by Pounds 224m, Pounds
229m, Pounds 185m and Pounds 207m in subsequent years, giving a total of
Pounds 1.016bn.
Pro-forma net interest payments in the first three years are Pounds 55m,
Pounds 36m and Pounds 18m, but then the company expects to receive Pounds 1m
in interest in 1998 and Pounds 13m in 1999.
Cumulative cash flow over the five years is Pounds 1.36bn, starting with
Pounds 255m in the first year.
RJB says it intends to appoint further non-executive directors. It aims to
'retain and integrate' senior managers inherited from British Coal and
devolve operational responsibility to colliery management.
It says there will be no significant change to pay and conditions of the
7,000 employees it takes on from British Coal.
Employees will be offered up to 2.5 per cent of the shares being issued. RJB
has used Caminus Energy, which was employed by the government last year in
its coal review, to make forecasts for the coal market.
These show that the worst possibility is that the English generators will
buy only 27m tonnes of coal in the year 2000.
This assumes that 8m tonnes of orimulsion will be burnt and 18 giagwatts of
electricity generated by gas-fired generators. RJB's key assumptions,
however, are that the electricity market will be larger than this. Its key
assumption is that it will be able to sell 34m tonnes in 1999 to all
markets. Average cost per tonne in that year is forecast at Pounds 30.50.
