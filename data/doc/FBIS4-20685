<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Attempts to treat wastewater using new anaerobic digestion 
techniques have attracted great interest. 
  Certain wastewaters generated from pulp and paper mills have 
been treated, or attempted to be treated, by anaerobic 
digestion.[.sup]1-8[/] Treatment of sulfite or 
thermomechanical pulp discharges by anaerobic digestion has been 
proven to be successful, and is noted for its low cost and 
energy efficiency.[.sup]6-8[/] In Japan, however, dissolved 
sulfite pulp and thermomechanical pulp account for only 1.7 
percent and 7.3 percent of total pulp output, respectively. 
Treatment by anaerobic digestion has not yet been applied to 
discharges from kraft pulp mill plants, the combined output of 
which comprises a more than 75 percent share of overall pulp 
production.[.sup]9[/] 
  Evaporator condensate (EC) from the kraft pulp (KP) 
production process contains methanol as the main carbon source. 
Methanosarcinaceae, Methanococcaceae were 
known as methanol-utilizing methanogens.[.sup]10[/] Anaerobic 
digestion of these discharges has been difficult because 
sulfides or terpene-like oils, which are characteristic 
components in the wastewater, inhibit methanogenic 
growth.[.sup]4-5[/] As the shapes of these methanogens were 
irregular cocci and they did not make granulation like 
filamentous methanogen, application of porous materials or 
membrane system has been considered to be effective for their 
microbial retention. 
  In this paper, removing the oils, such as terpenes or sulfur 
compounds by microfiltration (MF) membrane and by a gas 
stripping system, the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of 
evaporator condensate was investigated using a fixed-bed reactor 
packed with porous pumice stone and ultrafiltration (UF) 
membrane modules for microbial retention. 
<H5>  Experimental </H5>
  Wastewater Characteristics and Additional Mineral 
Salts 
  Some analytical results of EC discharges are listed in Table 
1. The discharges contain high concentrations of organic matter, 
mainly methanol, and are discharged at relatively high 
temperatures (40-80C). They also contain foul-smelling 
sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan 
(MM), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), 
lignin-like materials, and small amounts of terpene 
oils.[.sup]4[/] 
  Since the raw EC did not contain minerals or nutrients, some 
mineral salts and nutrients were added to the raw EC as the 
previous report.[.sup]11[/] 

  Pilot Scale (5 m[.sup]3[/]) Bioreactor 
  A schematic diagram of the pilot plant is shown in Figure 1. 
The effective volume of the bioreactor was 5 m[.sup]3[/], and 
the fixed-bed was constructed with 3 m[.sup]3[/] of pumice 
stone (mean diameter: 3 cm, pore size: 50-100 m, the average 
void ratio: 76 percent). One m[.sup]3[/] of plastic support 
media (pole ring size 1 inch; specific surface area, 207 
m[.sup]2[/]/m[.sup]3[/]; void volume, 90 percent) was also 
packed to avoid channeling. Activated anaerobic sludge was 
inoculated as a seed sludge. EC from the KP plant was stored in 
a raw wastewater tank (a). After automatic pH adjustment in an 
oil separator (b), sulfur compounds in the wastewater were 
stripped and removed by evolved gas from the bioreactor (c). 
Concentrated oily materials were sent to a drain tank. Oily 
compounds were separated by a MF membrane module (e: pore size, 
0.2 m, made of Teflon). Filtrate was sent to a preparation 
tank (d), where the pH was adjusted to between 6.8 and 7.0 by 
injecting doses of NaOH. The prepared wastewater was sent to the 
anaerobic bioreactor. The temperature of the bioreactor was 
monitored and maintained at 53C by thermostat. A UF 
membrane module (h: Kurita Water Treatment; graduatable 
molecular weight, 2 x 10[.sup]6[/]; made of polysulfone) or 
inorganic membrane module (g: Toto Kiki; pore size, 0.16 m; 
made from alumina) was provided for cells retention and 
recycling. Evolved biogas was desulfurized (i) and then burned 
(k).

  Analyses 
  Analyses of methanol, acetate, propionate, gas components, 
sulfur compounds, total organic carbon (TOC) and BOD were 
measured by the same methods described in the previous 
report.[.sup]11[/] 
  HRT (d), TOC loading (kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d), BOD loading 
(Kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d), gasification based on TOC (percent), 
gasification based on BOD (percent), gas yield based on TOC 
(m[.sup]3[/]gas/Kg-TOC), and methane yield based on TOC 
(m[.sup]3[/] CH[.sub]4[/]/Kg-TOC) were calculated as the 
previous report.[.sup]11[/] 
<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  Performance of Pilot Plant With MF Membrane 
  A creamy-oily constituent of EC, which included sulfur 
compounds, a small amount of many kinds of terpenes, their 
alcohols, and their aldehydes, was suspected as the inhibitor of 
the methane fermentation process.[.sup]4[/] As the result of 
a feasibility study on inhibitor removal, a MF membrane made by 
Teflon was selected for its resistibility, and confirmed that 
about 90 percent of the oily substances could be removed. 
  The results of continuous operation of the pilot-scale plant 
with the MF membrane are shown in Figure 2. Continuous feeding 
of the raw wastewater was started at 10 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d 
(4.2 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d). After 1 month, the loading had 
increased to 21.2 kg BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (7.0 kg 
TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d), and 87.4 percent gasification based on 
BOD (78.8 percent of gasification based on TOC) and 91.8 percent 
BOD removal were attained. MLSS in the bioreactor also increased 
to 7.1 g/l with the UF membrane module system. After 1 month 
run, acetic acid was generated and gas production declined 
(Figure 2, arrow A). Afterwards the loading was reduced from 
25.2 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (8.1 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) to 
6.5 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (2.1 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) 
(Figure 2, arrow B). 

  There was some recovery, and the loading was slowly 
increased 
for a while, but the generation of volatile fatty acids 
continued and digester efficiency declined again (Figure 2, 
arrow C). The cause of the decline in digester efficiency was 
suggested to be that the concentration of inhibitive sulfur 
compounds in raw EC increased, and the sulfur compounds were not 
removed sufficiently by MF membrane (Table 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-68A>      Figure 2.Continuous Operation of the Bioreactor of with </FIG>

   Performance of the Bioreactor With MF Membrane and 
Stripping System 
  To remove the inhibitive sulfur compounds in raw EC, a 
stripping system using evolved gas from the digester was fitted 
to the oil separator. Under the stripping condition of 20 
m[.sup]3[/] of evolved gas/m[.sup]3[/]-raw EC, and at an 
oil separator tank temperature of 60C, more than 80 percent 
of sulfur compounds were removed, but most of the methanol, the 
substrate for methanogen, remained (Table 2). Using this 
pretreated EC as a feed for the digester, continuous operation 
was carried out at a feed rate of 10 m[.sup]3[/]/d. 
  After loading was started at 30 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (9.3 
kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d), it was increased to 35 
kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (10.6 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d). No 
methanol remained in the effluent. Actual total gas and methane 
gas yield based on supplied TOC corresponded to the theoretical 
values, 1.45 m[.sup]3[/]/kg-TOC and 1.08 
m[.sup]3[/]/kg-TOC, respectively. The generation of volatile 
fatty acid was less than 300 mg/l through the operation period. 
The average loading was 35.5 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (10.7 
kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) and the average BOD removal was 93 
percent through this operation period. The MLSS was kept at more 
than 7.6 g/l (Figure 3).

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-71A>      Figure 4. Effect of UF membrane for microbial </FIG>



  The carbon and sulfur balance between pretreated EC, 
effluent 
and produced gas are shown in Table 3. From these data, it can 
be seen that 76.9 percent (41.2 kg/d) of supplied carbon (53.6 
kg/d) was changed into biogas, and 5.6 percent (3.0 kg/d) of it 
was thought to be changed biomass. Since DMDS was not found in 
the biogas as an effluent, DMDS seemed to have been changed into 
mm and H[.sub]2[/]S on the basis of the material balance. 
About 86.4 percent of inlet sulfur was contained in the evolved 
gas. 

  Effect of UF Membrane for Microbial Retention 
  A UF membrane was fitted to the fixed-bed bioreactor, and 
was 
able to provide effective microbial retention (Figure 3, max. 
9.4 g/l). The performance of the pilot-scale fixed-bed 
bioreactor with and without the UF membrane was compared (Figure 
4). When the loading was increased without the presence of the 
UF membrane, methanol remained at 15 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d 
(5.5 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) loading. 

  By fitting the UF membrane to avoid microbial wash out, a 
loading more than 2 times as high (35.5 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d, 
10.7 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d) could be attained without residual 
methanol in the effluent. 
  Effect of Interruption by Feed Stoppage 
  Discharge of EC from the KP mill was sometimes stopped for 
various reasons, such as overhauling of the plant, machine 
repair, and so on. The stability of digester performance against 
interruption by feed stoppage was examined. After interruption 
by feed stoppage for 40 days, anaerobic digestion of EC was 
restarted at a loading of 10 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (4.2 
kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d), and after 2 days, the loading was set 
at 20 kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d (6.8 kg-TOC/m[.sup]3[/]/d). In 
the first 4 days, about 100 mg/l of acetic acid and propionic 
acid was generated, but no remarkable difference in digester 
performance was observed compared with the performance before 
the stoppage (Figure 5).

  Economic Feasibility Study 
  The running costs of three methods (case 1, aerobic 
treatment 
system; case 2, anaerobic treatment with UF membrane + post 
aerobic treatment system; and case 3, anaerobic treatment 
without UF membrane + post aerobic treatment system) for the 
treatment of pulp and paper wastewater are compared in Table 4. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The general assumptions for the treatment costs calculation 
were as follows: In the case 1, wastewater mixture (200 
mg-BOD/l, 160,000 m[.sup]3[/]) was treated at loading of 1.2 
kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d using a 27,000 m[.sup]3[/] aeration 
tank; in the case 2, EC (25 g-BOD/m[.sup]3[/], 400 
m[.sup]3[/]/d) was treated by anaerobic digestion at 35 
kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d using a 290 m[.sup]3[/] digester with 
UF membrane, and in the case 3, the EC was treated at 15 
kg-BOD/m[.sup]3[/]/d using a 670 m[.sup]3[/] digester 
without UF membrane, and in the case 2 or 3, the other 
wastewater was treated by aerobic treatment. In the aerobic 
treatment process, half the weight of influent BOD was converted 
to sludge (in the case 1, excess sludge yield was 16t dry-SS/d; 
in the case 2 or 3, excess sludge yield was 11.85t dry-SS/d). 
Evolved methane gas was 3,100 m[.sup]3[/]/d, and the energy 
was converted as the price of heavy oil. The conversion rates 
were as follows: electric power, &yen;16/kwh; price of heavy oil 
(&yen;25/l, 10,000 kcal/l); heat of methane combustion, 8,000 
kcal/l; UF membrane replacement (&yen;20,000/m[.sup]2[/], 
every three years); chemicals (N,P manure &yen;85,000/t, 
NaOH-&yen;69,000/t); treatment of excess 3 sludge, 
&yen;10,000/t; labor cost (1 person/year, &yen;4,015,000/year). 
  Anaerobic treatment with UF membrane + post aerobic 
treatment 
was more economical than aerobic treatment only, and reduction 
in total cost of &yen;194,000/d and &yen;1.22/m[.sup]3[/] 
wastewater were achieved because of energy recovery by evolved 
methane gas, with less production of excess sludge and less 
electric power consumption. In the case 3, total cost was 
reduced by &yen;0.13/m[.sup]3[/] wastewater compared with 
that of case 2 because of less electric power consumption and no 
membrane replacement cost.
