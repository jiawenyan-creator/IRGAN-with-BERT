ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
SHOP . . . : In a big spread headlined "Orange County: Retail Squeeze, Plenty 
of Juice," Monday's Women's Wear Daily concedes South Coast Plaza's status as 
"California's most successful mall" and says the recently remodeled Fashion 
Island is "gaining steam." 
It also reports MainPlace/Santa Ana sales running 12% ahead of last year. 
"Retailers say Orange County isn't overstored yet because the population is 
rich, growing and glitzy," the article says. Another reason: "Tourists 
represented just 3.5% of the traffic at South Coast Plaza four years ago, but 
now they account for 22%." Catherine Gewertz and Tony Marcano
