  [Text] Prime Minister Esko Aho calls for a speedy adoption 
of Russia as a member of the Council of Europe. Speaking at the 
Council of Europe session in Strasbourg today, Aho stressed that 
Russia and the other applicant countries should be adopted as 
members as soon as the conditions are fulfilled. He pointed out 
that only membership will guarantee commitment to the Council of 
Europe's principles. 
  According to Aho, the Russians have clearly chosen democracy 
and entry into the Council of Europe would be a significant step 
on this road. Aho, who addressed the parliamentary general 
assembly, believes it is vital both for Russia and the rest of 
Europe that Russia should take a full part in the European 
process. He emphasized that Russia must not be isolated or 
allowed to drift into isolation.
