FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Airtours shares slip below underwritten
level
SHARES IN Airtours, locked in a Pounds 212m hostile bid for rival holiday
company Owners Abroad, yesterday slipped back below the level at which its
partial cash alternative has been underwritten.
In thin trading, the shares closed down 4p at 284p, below the 288p price at
which Barclays de Zoete Wedd and British Linen Bank have underwritten the
issue.
Owners Abroad's share price was unchanged at 116p, a 10p premium to the
current value of Airtours' paper offer.
City analysts said technical swapping from Airtours ordinary shares to
convertible stock could explain part of the fall from a level of about 300p
last week.
The fall could also reflect growing anticipation that the Department of
Trade and Industry will not recommend Airtours' bid for referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
A referral could mean that Airtours will withdraw from the bid. If
successful, Airtours and Owners Abroad would have combined sales of about
Pounds 1.6bn  - a dramatic increase in the size of the company.
Even if there is no referral, the Owners Abroad share price suggests
Airtours may have to increase its 3-for-8 share offer, or sweeten the deal
to include a more generous cash alternative.
