The chairman of the National Mediation Board halted talks between troubled 
Eastern Airlines and its largest union and returned to Washington. Chairman 
Walter Wallace could not be reached for comment, but an Eastern executive said 
Wallace gave as his reason the failure of efforts to keep the talks with the 
machinists union secret. Wallace arrived Friday for the talks at a hotel in Key 
Largo, Fla. The sessions were aimed at ending a contract stalemate that has 
clouded the future of the airline, which is a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp. of 
Houston.
