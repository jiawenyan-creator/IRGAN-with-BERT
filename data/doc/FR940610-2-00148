According to the provisions of section 10 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92463), notice is hereby
given that meetings of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee will be held on_




Thursday, July 7, 1994

Thursday, July 21, 1994

Thursday, Aug. 11, 1994

Thursday, Aug. 25, 1994




The meetings will start at 10:45 a.m. and will be held in Room 5A06A, Office of Personnel Management Building, 1900
E Street, NW., Washington, DC.

The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee is composed of a Chairman, five representatives from labor unions
holding exclusive bargaining rights for Federal blue-collar employees, and five representatives from Federal
agencies. Entitlement to membership on the Committee is provided for in 5 U.S.C. 5347.

The Committee's primary responsibility is to review the Prevailing Rate System and other matters pertinent to establishing
prevailing rates under subchapter IV, chapter 53, 5 U.S.C., as amended, and from time to time advise the Office of Personnel
Management.

These scheduled meetings start in open session with both labor and management representatives attending. During
the meeting either the labor members or the management members may caucus separately with the Chairman to devise strategy
and formulate positions. Premature disclosure of the matters discussed in these caucuses would unacceptably impair
the ability of the Committee to reach a consensus on the matters being considered and would disrupt substantially
the disposition of its business. Therefore, these caucuses will be closed to the public because of a determination
made by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management under the provisions of section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (Pub. L. 92463) and 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B). These caucuses may, depending on the issues involved,
constitute a substantial portion of the meeting.

Annually, the Committee publishes for the Office of Personnel Management, the President, and Congress a comprehensive
report of pay issues discussed, concluded recommendations, and related activities. These reports are available
to the public, upon written request to the Committee's Secretary.

The public is invited to submit material in writing to the Chairman on Federal Wage System pay matters felt to be deserving
of the Committee's attention. Additional information on these meetings may be obtained by contacting the Committee's
Secretary, Office of Personnel Management, Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, Room 1340, 1900 E Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20415 (202) 6061500.
