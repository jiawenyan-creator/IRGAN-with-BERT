A 7-year-old boy was killed, his mother seriously hurt and four other children 
either critically or seriously injured Tuesday when an alleged drunk driver 
plowed his car into a crowd of children in Florence, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
The driver, whose name was not released, allegedly drove over a curb in the 
1300 block of East 65th Street and into the woman and several children playing 
in and around a fenced-in front yard, said Sgt. Craig Boyett. 
Only the name of the dead boy, Pedro Hernandez, was released. A 33-year-old 
woman identified as his mother received serious chest injuries. The victims 
were taken to several area hospitals, County firefighter Leo Campos said. 
The 23-year-old driver, apprehended by witnesses when he tried to bolt from the 
car, was booked in the jail ward of County-USC Medical Center, Boyett said.
