BALANCE KEYS ESTANCIA VICTORY 
People know the Estancia High School football team can run the ball. Friday 
night the Eagles showed they could kick it, too, in a 26-7 victory over Laguna 
Hills at Orange Coast College. 
Senior tailback Josh Wojtkiewicz carried the ball 17 times for 138 yards and 
two touchdowns. His running mate, senior Gary Burrows had 69 yards on 14 
carries. 
But Estancia (2-0) also benefitted from kicker Alex Vazquez and the passing of 
senior quarterback Danny Ucker. 
Vazquez had two 23-yard field goals and two extra points and Ucker completed 14 
of 17 passes for 131 yards. 
"Our goal this year was to have a balanced attack," said Estancia Coach John 
Liebengood. "That way, people can't key on (Burrows) and (Wojtkiewicz)." 
Credit also goes to the Estancia defense. It shut down Laguna Hills most of the 
night with one mistake. 
Laguna Hills tailback Darrin Chapman broke loose on a trap up the middle and 
dashed 71 yards for the loser's only score early in the third quarter. 
"We've given up seven points in two games, so I think you could say our defense 
is strong," said Liebengood. "Except for that trap, we stopped them all night."
