FT  21 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt
After watching to see how far US short-term rates would rise last week, the
German bond market will have its attention more sharply focused on domestic
matters in the next few days.
The rates of money supply growth in October and inflation in November are
expected to show a slight improvement when announced this week.
M3 should ease to an annualised growth rate of just above 7 per cent, with
yearly west German inflation likely to slip to 2.7 per cent.
However, this does not mean Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting is likely
to decide on a small cut in key interest rates before raising them again in
1995.
The Bundesbank, as Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its president, said on Friday, wants
more progress by the government towards solving its fiscal problems and more
moderate wage rises to squash inflation.
The 75 basis point rise in the US federal funds target did not help the case
of those looking for one last German rate cut.
Nor has the criticism by the government's council of economic advisers (five
wise men) of the Bundesbank's pragmatic monetary policy.
Its latest report said there was no scope for more interest rate cuts in
1995; slight increases would probably be necessary.
