 The 

Report and Order

 establishes the amounts of the regulatory fees for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 and the rules for the payment of such fees for
fiscal years 1994 and thereafter.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>

Section 9 of the Act was added by section 6002(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (hereinafter ``1993
Budget Act''). See Pub. L. No. 10366, Title VI, 6002(a), 107 Stat. 397 (approved August 10, 1993). Section 9
is codified at 47 U.S.C. section 159.

As discussed below, we will establish the accounting systems necessary to make adjustments in the Schedule of Regulatory
Fees required for the assessment of fees in future years in a subsequent and separate rulemaking proceeding. See 47
U.S.C. 159(b)(3), (i).

2. The rules we adopt below are designed to ensure that (1) collection of fees does not adversely affect the Commission's
regulatory activities, (2) the most effective means possible are employed in the collection and deposit of fees,
and (3) the paperwork (and financial burden) on the public resulting from our collection process is kept to an absolute
minimum. The accomplish this goal, we have, to the extent possible, modeled our regulatory fee rules upon the rules
that we previously established to govern the collection of fees filed with applications and other filings. See 47
CFR 1.1101 

et seq.

 Moreover, in the course of fashioning rules to govern regulatory fees, we have revised several rules in order to improve
the collection process related to these fees and, wherever possible, to ease the burden on those entities subject
to the payment of these fees. Implementation of rules governing the collection of regulatory fees also furthers the
National Performance Review goals of reinventing government by requiring beneficiaries of the Commission's services
to pay the costs associated with these activities.


II. Background


3. Section 9(a) of the Communications Act requires the Commission to collect regulatory fees to recover the annual
cost of its enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, and international
activities. 47 U.S.C. 159(a). 47 U.S.C. 159(b)(1)(A). The Schedule of Regulatory Charges sets forth in section 9(g)
the categories of regulated entities subject initially to the regulatory fee requirement and designates the fees
to be collected for each subject category of regulatee. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). The Schedule of Fees sets forth annual regulatory
fees for specific categories of regulatees in Private Radio, Mass Media, Common Carrier and Cable Services.

</FOOTNAME>
Congress included the regulatory fees for cable services in the Schedule of Regulatory Fees as a subpart of the fees
established to recover appropriations related to the regulation of mass media services. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). Because
we recently established a Cable Services Bureau to administer the regulation of cable television operations, we
have amended our rules to set forth separately the regulatory fees applicable to cable services. See section 1.1155,
47 CFR 1.1155.
</FOOTNOTE>


4. Section 9(f)(1) requires the Commission to adopt rules to implement the assessment and collection of the annual
regulatory fees. 47 U.S.C. 159(f)(1). On March 4, 1994, we adopted a 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 (``

NPRM

'') to implement section 9 of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In the 

NPRM,

 we concluded that Congress intended the Commission to rely upon the Schedule of Regulatory Fees enacted in section
9(g) to recover costs for FY 1994.

 FCC 9446, released March 11, 1994.
</FOOTNOTE>


5. In addition, the 

NPRM

 proposed rules providing for: (1) Exemptions from the regulatory fee requirements for governmental entities, nonprofit
entities, amateur licensees, noncommercial educational broadcasters, and licensees in the public safety services,
(2) standards for waiver, reduction and deferment of regulatory fees, (3) procedures for the payment of regulatory
fees, including the timing and method of payments, and the location for submission of payments, and (4) procedures
to assure timely payment of regulatory fees, including announcements in the 

Federal Register

 of the filing times for the fee payments, and penalties for late payment and nonpayment of fees.


III. Discussion


A. Assessment of Regulatory Fees for FY 1994


6. The 

NPRM

 proposed that for FY 1994, the Commission would utilize the Schedule of Regulatory Fees established by Congress in
section 9(g) of the Act. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). In response to this proposal, several commenters suggest that we amend the
Schedule of Fees for FY 1994. They contend that fees in the Schedule are too high, that the schedule provides the wrong
mechanism for assessing fees, and that additional services should be included in the fee schedule.
