  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Seeking to build a united 
and democratic Europe, member states of the Council of Europe 
should show a constructive approach to the problem of admitting 
Russia to their organisation, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing today, following the recent 
statement of British Member of Parliament D. Atkinson at a 
recent session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe. 
  According to Demurin, the British MP rather unceremoniously 
linked the problem of Russia's joining the Council of Europe 
with the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of 
foreign states, specifically, Baltic countries. Atkinson's 
"ultimatum" was regarded by some mass media organs as the 
putting forward by the Council of Europe of additional 
conditions for Russia's admittance, which are hampering and 
making more difficult the settlement of the problem of Russia's 
membership, he said. 
  The Russian side hopes that Atkinson's statements reflect 
his 
own opinion and not the feelings that predominate in the Council 
of Europe. "This is the only way it should be, because the 
attempts to link artificially two entirely different problems 
are just senseless," the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
stressed.
