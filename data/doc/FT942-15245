FT  16 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): Inkatha parade puts
Johannesburg on alert
South Africa's commercial capital, Johannesburg, is bracing for further
violence after the youth wing of the Inkatha Freedom party said yesterday it
would stage a mass protest in the city from Monday, write Patti Waldmeir in
Durban and Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
The Inkatha Youth Brigade said it would enforce a work stayaway on Monday,
adding: 'Anyone who comes to town will do so at their own risk.' It was not
clear that the national leadership of Inkatha supported the stayaway. But
after the last Inkatha march on Johannesburg, in which 53 people died,
residents of the city are likely to take the new Inkatha threat seriously.
Inkatha protest actions will take place in Johannesburg throughout next
week, the last week before polling starts in the first all-race elections.
Mr Charles Loliwe, the Youth Brigade's Johannesburg chairman, said Inkatha
would march on the headquarters of the African National Congress, the
offices of the Independent Electoral Commission, police headquarters and the
South African Broadcasting Corporation. It would also stage a sit-in at the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Police said such marches would be illegal under emergency regulations.
