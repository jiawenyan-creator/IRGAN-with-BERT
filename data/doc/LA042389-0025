ADP LEASES 'CUSTOM' BUILDING IN SAN DIMAS 
Automatic Data Processing Inc. has arranged to lease a 200,000-square-foot, 
two-story office building in San Dimas through what is described as "the 
largest build-to-suit office transaction in the San Gabriel Valley." 
Total lease consideration was estimated at $40 million. 
The ADP division that will occupy the offices is one of the nation's largest 
providers of payroll-related tax filing services. It serves more than 100,000 
employers and processes payroll-tax payments for more than 6 million employees. 
The office building is expected to be under construction in June, with 
completion of the first 150,000 square feet in May or June of 1990. The 
additional 50,000 square feet will be designed while work is under way on the 
first phase. 
Commerce Construction Co., a subsidiary of Majestic Realty Co., is designing 
and building the structure in the Walnut Creek Business Park, a 45-acre, 
425,000-square-foot project of Majestic Realty. The ADP division occupies space 
in two buildings in the business park, where construction began in 1980.
