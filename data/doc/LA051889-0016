TROUBLED TEENS 
Although I agree with much of Richard Polanco's (D-Los Angeles) remarks ("Bad 
Medicine for 'Troubled Teens,' " Op-Ed Page, May 7) regarding forced private 
hospitalization for "troubled teen-agers," I believe he misses the real mark. 
Troubled teen-agers come from troubled parents. Unless we "hospitalize" the 
troubled parents we will never solve the problems of the troubled teen-ager. 
But how can we ever expect such actions from the legal system when it 
represents some of the worst troubled parents?
