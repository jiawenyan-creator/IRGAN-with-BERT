THOUSAND OAKS, WESTLAKE STRUGGLE TO 41-41 STANDOFF 
It took Westlake High eight years to have an opportunity to win a Marmonte 
League title, but a 69-second drive by Thousand Oaks has put the Warriors' 
title hopes on hold for at least another week. 
Thousand Oaks running back Greg Buchanan scored on a two-yard run with 16 
seconds left, and quarterback Scott Peterson added the two-point conversion to 
forge a 41-41 tie in front of an overflow crowd of more than 5,000 at Thousand 
Oaks High. 
Westlake (8-0-1 overall, 5-0-1 in league play) must defeat Royal (7-1-1, 4-1-1) 
next Friday at Moorpark College if the Warriors are to claim their first title 
since 1982. Thousand Oaks (6-1-2, 4-0-2), which can still win its second 
consecutive title, will play host to Agoura next Friday. 
Westlake trailed by 13 points midway through the third quarter before rallying 
behind three consecutive scores to take a 34-27 lead with 7 minutes 10 seconds 
left. 
Thousand Oaks pulled within one, 34-33, on a four-yard pass from Peterson (10 
completions in 24 attempts for 131 yards) to Jeff Watts with 3:51 left. 
Peterson's two-point conversion pass fell incomplete in the end zone. 
Westlake came back with a 43-yard touchdown pass from Todd Preston (16 of 25 
for 282 yards, three touchdowns) to Seamus Gibbons on third and four with 1:16 
left. Preston's conversion gave Westlake a 41-33 lead and the Warriors appeared 
to have the game in hand. 
But Thousand Oaks was grimly determined. The Lancers took over at their 31 with 
1:09 left and Peterson hit Jeff Trevathan for a 15-yard gain, then found Jeff 
Watts for 16 yards to Westlake's 30. 
After an incomplete pass, Peterson scrambled 21 yards to Westlake's nine, then 
dashed six yards to the three with 24 seconds left. After a pass-interference 
call, Buchanan scored. 
The game was an offensive display from the start, and the teams combined for 
820 total yards. Preston set school single-season records for touchdown passes 
(20) and passing yardage (2,055). 
Thousand Oaks took a 6-0 lead on Buchanan's one-yard run with 5:49 left in the 
first quarter. The drive included a 15-yard completion from Peterson to Shane 
Graham on third and six from Westlake's 27. 
Westlake drove 66 yards in four plays, only to turn the ball over when Thousand 
Oaks' Dan Fitzgerald recovered Reuben Allen's fumble at the Lancers' 16. 
On Thousand Oaks' second play from scrimmage after the turnover, Cory Bowen 
broke four tackles on a 76-yard run. Fitzgerald's conversion extended Thousand 
Oaks' lead to 14-0 with 7:38 left in the first half. 
Westlake, which punted three times and fumbled on its first four drives, 
reached the end zone on its fifth drive, which was set up by Vince Bruno's 
fumble recovery at the Lancers' 32. Preston scored on a nine-yard run. 
Westlake tied the score when Allen -- 178 yards rushing -- bolted 50 yards with 
2:10 left in the half.
