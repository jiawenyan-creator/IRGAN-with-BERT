  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japan's government 
ministries will examine the nation's system of public charges 
and compile a report perhaps by the end of June, ministers 
agreed Tuesday [31 May]. 
  Economic Planning Agency (EPA) chief Yoshio Terasawa told a 
regular news conference that ministers at a gathering after the 
morning cabinet meeting agreed to his proposal that the 
government broadly examine the system for setting such fees. 
  The EPA director general said his proposal followed up a 
general agreement for a project team to review the system in the 
wake of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's abrupt May 18 decision to 
freeze rate hikes for the rest of the year. 
  Each ministry and agency will inspect and report on the fee 
system within its jurisdiction, and the cabinet councillors' 
office on internal affairs within the prime minister's office 
will compile a general report for related cabinet members, 
Terasawa said. 
  He said the ministers have yet to decide how to handle the 
report but that Moriyoshi Sato, head of the Hokkaido and Okinawa 
Development Agencies, asked that they finish their work by the 
end of June. That is when the government has vowed to complete 
a set of market-opening and deregulation measures. 
  Farm Minister Mutsuki Kato also suggested comparing Japanese 
fees for such services as buses, subways and electric power with 
those in other countries, according to Terasawa.
