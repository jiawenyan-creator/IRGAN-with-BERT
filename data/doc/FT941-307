FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Casino defies sector weakness
with rise
Casino, the French food retailer, last year managed to shrug off the
pressures on the French supermarket sector with a 2.3 per cent increase in
net profits, to FFr451m (Dollars 78.8m), against FFr441m in 1992.
The group, which expanded dramatically in 1992 with the acquisition of the
Rallye hypermarket chain, has since been rationalising its interests by
selling peripheral businesses and reorganising core food retailing
busi-ness.
Mr Antoine Guichard, chairman, said its French stores had been affected by
the recession, which had triggered a price-cutting battle in the supermarket
sector. However, he said Casino was making progress with its expansion plans
in the US and Mexico.
Turnover rose 2.7 per cent to FFr72.52bn, with operating profits increasing
by 12.8 per cent to FFr1.27bn.
However, the increase in net profits was constrained by a sharp reduction in
exceptional profits, which fell to FFr9m from FFr94m in 1992. Earnings per
share rose 24.5 per cent to FFr6.61.
Casino plans this year to limit capital spending to FFr1.85bn, against
FFr2.19bn last time.
The group's main initiative is an experiment with 'AS des Prix', a new
discounting concept being tested in the Lyon area. If successful, it will be
adopted over the next two years by all Super Rallye stores.
