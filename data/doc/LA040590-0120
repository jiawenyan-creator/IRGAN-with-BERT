BEST BETS: TOURS; 
WALKING IN AN INDIAN'S SHOES AT THE MUSEUM 
Put on your strolling shoes this weekend and join two tours organized by the 
Ventura County Parks and Recreation Department. 
Discover archeology unique to the Ventura area during a walking tour from 1 to 
2 p.m. Saturday at the Albinger Museum, 113 E. Main St. 
Site manager Richard Senate will lead the tour through the remnants of ancient 
Indian civilizations and Chinese habitats from the 1800s. 
"We will discuss the cultures that prospered in the area and the reasons why 
they eventually died out," Senate said. 
Tour participants will get a special look at the foundations, discovered in the 
early '70s, that once housed Spanish missionaries. 
"Regular visitors to the museum would not otherwise come in contact with these 
sites," Senate said. 
Sunday is the day to see historic plants at the Olivas Adobe Historical Park, 
4200 Olivas Park Drive, Ventura, during a walking tour from 1 to 2 p.m. with 
conservationist and botanist Susan Stephenson. 
Flowers, vines and cacti, along with the mightiest tree and the smallest 
sprout, will have their "roots" traced back to 19th-Century rancho days. 
Special focus will be placed on herbs and their use in rancho-style cooking. 
There is no charge for either tour. For information, call 644-4346.
