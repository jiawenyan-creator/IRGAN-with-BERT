LAZERS PLAY HOST TO BALTIMORE TONIGHT 
Having defeated the San Diego Sockers Thursday, the Lazers will try to make it 
two in a row tonight when they play host to the Baltimore Blast at 7:30 at the 
Forum. 
That won't be easy for the Lazers, who have a 7-10 record and haven't put 
together a winning streak of any kind since opening the Major Indoor Soccer 
League season with two straight victories over the Sockers. 
The Blast (11-4) is in first place, leading the sixth-place Lazers by 5 games. 
Despite the victory over the defending champion Sockers, the Lazers have lost 4 
of their last 6 games. Against the Blast, they are 0-2, having been outscored, 
11-4.
