  [Text] Baku February 1 TASS -- Azerbaijan puts the fullest 
responsibility for the growing tensions in the zone of 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on Armenia, says a statement of 
the presidential press service circulated here on Tuesday 
evening. 
  Armenia "will not give up attempts to expand the so-called 
"security zone" in Nagorno-Karabakh by occupying new Azerbaijani 
regions", the press service said. 
  "Within the framework of this annexationist policy, the 
military and political leadership of Armenia undertook an 
unsuccessful attempt at intervention into the Beilangan and 
Tertery districts of Azerbaijan last December," the press 
service said. 
  According to the statement, this action made Azerbaijan 
resort to defensive counter measures and resulted in numerous 
casualties and a new spiral in the armed confrontation between 
the two states. 
  On the other hand, the press service once again stated that 
Azerbaijan came out against the war and would insist on a 
peaceful settlement to the conflict based on "withdrawal of the 
Armenian forces from all occupied territories and respect for 
sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-violation of 
Azerbaijan's borders". 
  In this connection, the Azerbaijani president calls on the 
Armenian leadership to give up the fruitless policy of armed 
conflict which brings ever increasing sacrifices and 
tribulations to the Armenian people, the press service said. 
  The president also calls on Armenians living in 
Nagorno-Karabakh who are citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
to reject participating in military operations on the part of 
the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia and surrender arms, 
according to the statement. 
  He guarantees that as Azerbaijani citizens they will 
exercise 
their constitutional rights to a safe and peaceful future within 
the bounds of a single and indivisible Azerbaijan.
