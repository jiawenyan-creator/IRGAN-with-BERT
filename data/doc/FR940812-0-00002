SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule has been determined significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has been reviewed
by OMB. 




This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 


The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certified that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, P.L. 96354
(5 U.S.C. 601). 


The final rule reflects fee increases needed to recover the costs of services rendered in accordance with the Agricultural
Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946. The inspection, grading and certification program for processed fruits and vegetables
and related products is voluntary. 


The AMA authorizes official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of processed food products
including processed fruits, vegetables, and processed products made from them. The AMA provides that reasonable
fees be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered.
This final rule amends the schedule of fees and charges for inspection, grading, and certification services to more
nearly reflect the costs currently associated with the program. The amendment includes the addition of the new Section
52.47 pertaining to charges when service is canceled or changed in order to manage the program in the most cost effective
manner. Former Section 52.47, which was removed, pertained to microbiological and other types of testing functions
which were transferred to the AMS Science Division.
