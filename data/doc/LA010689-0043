THE WORLD 
The U.S. Air Force is considering moving some jet fighter training missions to 
Morocco as a way to ease the burden over densely populated West Germany, the 
Air Force's European chief said. Gen. William L. Kirk, in an Associated Press 
interview, staunchly defended the need to continue low-level training missions 
in Central Europe. The training missions have caused controversy in West 
Germany because of military jet crashes in the country. Talks with Morocco are 
at a "very preliminary stage," Kirk said in his office at the U.S. air base in 
Ramstein. The base was the site of a fiery crash of an Italian air force stunt 
team that killed 70 people at an air show in August. Five West Germans and the 
pilot died in a U.S. military jet crash Dec. 8 in Remscheid.
