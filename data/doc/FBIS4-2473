  [Text] Shantou, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Shantou city, one of 
China's special economic zones [SEZ] in Guangdong Province, has 
made efforts to develop its export of labor services. 
  Now the city has formed labor export relations with a dozen 
countries and regions, and every year the city sends about 1,000 
people to work abroad. 
  Most of the workers will be engaged in housing construction, 
machine operation, clothes-making, crop-raising and livestock 
farming. 
  In 1980 when the Shantou Overseas Labor Service Company 
started its labor export service, its business was limited to 
countries and regions in southeast and central Asia. 
  Now its business has expanded to some countries in Europe, 
America and Africa. 
  Experts noted that the people of Shantou have a tradition of 
working abroad. With the rise of Shantou's fame in labor 
exports, more and more people from Shantou will participate in 
the labor export service. 
  Last year a team of construction workers was hired by a 
Spanish company to undertake an express highway construction 
project in Libya. 
  Now they have completed the project and have been employed 
by 
the company to continue a supplementary project.
