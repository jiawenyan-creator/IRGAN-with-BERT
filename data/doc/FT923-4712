FT  04 SEP 92 / GM strikers hopeful of deal
A SPOKESMAN for United Auto Workers (UAW) yesterday said progress was being
made in the trade union's talks with General Motors (GM) over the Ohio
strike that has affected more than 30,000 GM workers.
Mr Reg McGhee, the UAW official, said a settlement was not yet in sight, but
the union was cautiously optimistic the talks were moving forward after a
separate agreement was reached yesterday between GM and the UAW over health
and safety issues at a Lordstown car assembly plant.
Talks have been under way since August 28, when some 2,300 workers went on
strike over job security and related issues at a crucial metal-stamping
plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Although the latest accord will not affect the
strike at the metal-stamping plant - the source of the broader shutdown -
the UAW official called it 'a positive step'.
The strike at the metal-stamping plant resulted in GM's decision to shut
down production at a series of car assembly plants around the US. A total of
32,500 additional workers - out of GM's total US hourly workforce of 300,000
 -have been affected so far.
