  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis stressed that a 
pannational conference is necessary for long-term planning to 
handle such an important national issue as the Cyprus problem. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Thessaloniki at noon today, 
Kliridhis added that in the course of the Cyprus issue we should 
have set short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, as the 
Turkish side has done, regardless of the government. He added: 
Turkey is following this policy, and is now working toward 
recognition of the pseudostate. It later will aim at 
partitioning and possibly occupying all of Cyprus. 
  The president said he will meet Greek Defense Minister 
Yerasimos Arsenis tomorrow to discuss the common defense area. 
He stressed: It will be easy for the Turks to advance in 
Cyprus if there is no joint strategic defense plan. 
  Answering a question on the new tour of Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus who is 
expected in Cyprus tomorrow, Kliridhis said Clark's goal is to 
determine whether the Turkish side accepts the UN secretary 
general's proposal on Varosha and Nicosia Airport. He added: 
The Turkish side has not accepted the UN secretary general's 
proposals. If the statements that appeared in the press are 
true, then my evaluation of their position is unchanged. 
  Answering another question, Kliridhis replied that he will 
accept nothing less than the return of Famagusta's fenced-off 
area and that he will attempt to change Butrus-Ghali's map 
during the talks. 
  The president said those who can change Turkish policy on 
the 
Cyprus issue are: the United States, the UN Security Council, 
and Europe. He stressed that, according to the latest 
indications and for some serious reasons that he knows but does 
not want to publicize now, for the first time these forces are 
pressuring Turkey that the status quo cannot continue and that a 
Cyprus solution must be found.
