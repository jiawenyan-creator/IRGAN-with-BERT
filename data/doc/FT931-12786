FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Compaq's stock surges on back of
profits rise
SHARES in Compaq Computer hit a 52-week high yesterday morning after the
company reported a 34 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income on sales
which surged 63 per cent.
The results helped shares in Compaq climb Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 58 before
the close of trading in New York.
Net income for the three months to December 31 was Dollars 89.5m, or Dollars
1.10 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.42bn, against net earnings of Dollars
66.6m, or 77 cents, on sales of Dollars 873.4m a year earlier.
Analysts had expected Compaq to earn between 80 cents and Dollars 1.01 share
in the quarter.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive, said: 'We've seen record-setting
demand for our entire product line since June when we began implementing our
new strategy of offering price-leading products that feature Compaq quality
and the best service and support in the industry.'
Compaq said the number of PCs shipped in the fourth quarter more than
doubled from the previous year, but its backlog was continuing into the 1993
first quarter.
'To accelerate our product output, we've added production lines, parts
inventory and employee shifts in our Houston, Singapore and Scotland
factories during the third and fourth quarters,' Mr Pfeiffer said.
For the whole of 1992, Compaq's net income climbed 63 per cent to Dollars
213.2m, or Dollars 2.52, from Dollars 130.9m, or Dollars 1.49, in 1991.
Sales were Dollars 4.1bn, against Dollars 3.27bn.
