  [Text] Jericho, West Bank, June 22 (AFP) -- PLO chief Yasir 
'Arafat, who was expected here by the end of June, will not be 
coming before the middle of next month, a senior Palestinian 
official said Wednesday [22 June]. 
  Colonel Jibril Rujub, head of preventive security in the new 
Palestinian self-rule enclave of Jericho, said: "The main reason 
for his delay is that the international donors are late in 
sending us the aid to start building our infrastructure." 
  But he also said political factors such as the Palestinian 
prisoners and Israeli security arrangements at checkpoints were 
also behind the delay. 
  'Arafat had been expected in Gaza and Jericho by the end of 
June. 
  Rujub refused to reveal the exact date of the PLO chief's 
arrival but said: "He is not expected before mid-July." 
  He said questions such as the release of thousands of 
Palestinians from Israeli jails "must be settled before he 
comes." 
  Israeli measures at checkpoints around Jericho must be 
addressed before 'Arafat's visit, he added. 
  Israeli soldiers on Monday stopped chief Palestinian 
negotiator Nabil Sha'th at checkpoints twice during a visit to 
Jericho. It took several hours for him to get through one and 
only then after the intervention of Israeli deputy chief of 
staff Amnon Shahaq. 
  Palestinian officials complain that Israelis are violating 
the autonomy agreement by holding them up at checkpoints.
