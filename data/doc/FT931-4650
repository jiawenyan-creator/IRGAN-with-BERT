FT  10 MAR 93 / Observer: Honey-tongued
So John Birt claims that he saved only Pounds 810 in tax by being paid his
BBC salary through a private company. The great man has clearly never heard
the story of the Victorian parlour-maid. When tackled over the arrival of an
illegitimate child, she replied: 'It's only a little one, ma'am'.
Birt, unlike the parlour maid, had the benefit of a report from accountants
Ernst &amp; Young to quantify the mischief. But despite this impressive
imprimatur, we suspect that Birt's mission to explain has been about as
successful as the early day attempt to shrink the kid.
