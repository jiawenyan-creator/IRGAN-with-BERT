  [Text] The chief of training and operations at the Defense 
Headquarters, Major General Rufus Kupolati, has appealed to 
journalists to exercise caution in reporting military activities 
to avoid misinforming the people about the Armed Forces. 
  He made the appeal to journalists during a recent media 
publication about the Forces in the southeastern part of the 
country. He also said that reports that link troops movement 
and other related matters could jeopardize the security of the 
nation.
