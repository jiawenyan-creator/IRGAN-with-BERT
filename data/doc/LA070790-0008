METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONFERENCE TO INCLUDE SURFERS, DEVELOPERS 
Surfers, environmentalists and others who want to save the waves and beaches 
will meet July 21 at Pepperdine University in Malibu for the GeoSurf Symposium 
1990. 
According to organizers Glenn R. Hening and John Van Hamersveld, the conference 
will be the first to bring together all groups that have a vested interest in 
the health of the coastline, from wave riders and makers of wet suits to 
ecologists and developers. 
Hening, who founded the Surfrider Foundation, a surfer activist organization, 
and Van Hamersveld, a graphic designer whose work includes the classic poster 
for the surfing film "The Endless Summer," said they hoped the symposium would 
function as a leadership seminar for all those concerned about the future of 
waves and beaches.
