FT  10 FEB 94 / German engineering workers protest wage freeze call
More than 20,000 German engineering workers demonstrated in the town of
Mannheim yesterday to protest against employer calls for a wage freeze and
benefit cuts, Reuter reports from Mannheim.
The protest was part of a campaign of token stoppages across Germany over
the past 10 days.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, head of Germany's IG Metall union, warned employers about
the consequences of a strike in the engineering sector and said the union
was prepared to make a compromise. But it was not prepared to make all the
sacrifices and carry all the burdens of companies' cost-cutting plans.
Union and employer officials are meeting on Friday for talks to try to solve
the dispute.
