  [Text] Moscow March 4 ITAR-TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
has called for the adoption of a memorandum on civil peace in 
Russia to offset the destabilising effect of the week-old 
political amnesty. 
  He was speaking at the extended meeting of the Russian 
Government which opened in the Kremlin on Friday morning. 
  President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin are meeting with ministers, leaders of state 
committees and other federal executive bodies, as well as 
parliament chamber speakers, faction leaders and heads of local 
governments, as well as the leaders of interregional 
associations and public organisations. 
  Ironically, the other item on the agenda of today's meeting, 
eagerly awaited in and outside Russia is road safety.
