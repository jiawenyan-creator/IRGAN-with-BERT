FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Scitex ahead 22% on strong sales
growth
SCITEX, the Israeli maker of colour electronic pre-press systems, yesterday
reported a net profit of Dollars 122.3m in 1992, a 22 per cent increase over
the previous year, as strong growth in both the US and Europe took sales to
Dollars 550m.
Although profit growth was less than in the three previous years in
percentage terms, the results further entrenched Scitex, which is traded on
the New York over-the-counter market, as the star of Israel's successful
high-tech industry.
Mr Giora Bitan, finance director, said demand for Scitex's range of
computerised products for the publishing, printing and graphic design
industries had grown despite a second year of low or negative overall growth
in the company's main markets in north America and western Europe.
He said half of 1992 sales were to new customers. The trend of ungrading
technology in these sectors was not exhausted.
Scitex said fourth-quarter sales of Dollars 153m were 31 per cent ahead of
the same 1991 period and almost one-third were accounted for by products
introduced in 1992.
Over the year, sales to the 'mid-range' market of small print houses, a key
growth target, reached Dollars 69m, compared with Dollars 25m in 1991.
International Paper of the US bought an 11 per cent stake in Scitex during
the year for more than Dollars 200m. This helped leave Scitex with a
year-end cash balance of Dollars 325m. Mr Bitan said he was actively looking
for further acquisitions.
He said Leaf, the US maker of photo-scanning and transmission systems,
bought for Dollars 35m last year, had made a second-half loss which knocked
4 cents per share off Scitex's fourth-quarter earnings.
