AMEDEO DE FILIPPI; COMPOSER, ARRANGER, ORCHESTRATOR 
Amedeo de Filippi, who created orchestral, choral and chamber music for 
ballets, radio and philharmonic groups, has died in Burbank. He was 90. 
As a composer, arranger and orchestrator, Mr. de Filippi was on the staff of 
the Columbia Broadcasting System and also worked for Pathe Films, Judson Radio 
Program Co., Victor Phonograph Co. and several theaters and publishers. 
He died June 15 of complications from a recent stroke, said his wife, Della 
Posner de Filippi. 
Born Feb. 20, 1900, in Ariano Irpino, Italy, he came to New York with his 
family in 1905. At 9, he was playing the piano with bands in Atlantic City and 
New York during the summer. He later studied violin and composition and was 
awarded a four-year fellowship in both piano and composition at the Juilliard 
Graduate School of Music in 1926. 
His "Concerto for Orchestra" won the Philharmonic-Symphony Society of New York 
American Composers Awards of 1936-37, but the award was withdrawn because he 
was not born in the United States. In 1936, his "Sonata for Violin and Piano" 
was performed at the Festival of Contemporary American Music. He also 
orchestrated ballets for the Ballet Russe and Ballet Theatre. 
A longtime member of ASCAP, Mr. de Filippi also wrote music for films, radio 
and television. He moved to Studio City in 1961 and continued to write music 
until his death. 
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Richard de Filippi of 
Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Adrienne Lannom of Eugene, Ore.; sisters, Mae 
Schweitzer, Adele Caffrey and Anna Pietroburgo, all of New York; and five 
grandchildren. 
A private service and burial were held this week. Arrangements werehandled by 
Pierce Brothers Valhalla Memorial Park and Mortuary in North Hollywood. 
Donations can be made in de Filippi's name to the Juilliard Graduate School 
Alumni Scholarship Fund in New York.
