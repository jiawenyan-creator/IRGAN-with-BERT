FT  17 FEB 93 / GPA hit by chief executive resignation
MR Nigel Wilson has resigned from GPA Group just over a year after he was
brought in as chief executive-corporate to improve the aircraft leasing
company's relations with shareholders, banks and aircraft manufacturers.
Several of the group's shareholders yesterday described Mr Wilson's
resignation as a blow to the company, which is in the middle of debt
restructuring negotiations. One institutional shareholder said: 'Mr Wilson
had a feel for institutional sentiment which the company sadly lacked. His
departure will be a great loss.'
A spokesman for GPA last night confirmed that Mr Wilson is to leave next
week. He said the decision had been agreed amicably and would not affect the
restructuring proposals.
Mr Wilson's responsibilities will be taken over by other departments. GPA is
expected to announce a management reshuffle within the next 48 hours.
Mr Wilson, the 36-year-old former managing director of Stanhope Properties,
was recruited just before the group aborted its planned flotation. When the
company failed to go public, Mr Wilson become involved in the refinancing
proposals. One banker involved in the negotiations said: 'It is a pity the
company could not persuade Mr Wilson to stay on.'
