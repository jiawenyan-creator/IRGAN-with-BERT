FT  28 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Cost of funding high
RATES IN the sterling money market moved slightly higher in a quiet day of
tight trading.
Once again the Bank of England forecast a big shortage that proved difficult
to take out, thereby keeping the cost of funding high. Eventually the
shortage was removed but only after late assistance from the Bank brought
overnight rates down.
The Bank's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 1.5bn. It set out
to be as accommodating as possible, purchasing Pounds 25m of band-3 bills at
9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 28m of band-4 bills at 9 19/32 per cent in the
early round.
In further morning operations it bought Pounds 125m of band-1 bills, Pounds
136m of band-2 bills, both at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 172m of band-3 bills at
9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 35m of band-4 bills at 9 19/32 per cent. It also
purchased Pounds 69m for resale to the market in equal amounts on June 16,
17 and 18 at a 9 15/16 per cent rate.
However, with the market reluctant to part with paper, the rate for
overnight money, which had started the day firm at 10 3/4 per cent, rose to
11 3/4 per cent.
In the afternoon the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.6bn and the Bank
operated again, buying Pounds 478m of bands 1,2,3 and 4 bills at the same
rates.
Only after the authorities had provided late assistance of Pounds 540m,
taking total official intervention operations for the day to Pounds 1.6bn,
did the cost of money cheapen significantly. Late borrowers were able to
pick up balances at 8 1/2 per cent, much lower than Tuesday's closing
overnight rate of 25 per cent.
Rates for one-month, three-month and six-month money crept upwards. The key
three-month interbank rate ended at 10 1/8 per cent after Tuesday's close of
10 1/16 per cent.
One trader said: 'The rate changes did not really reflect Bank of England
policy, it just reflected the fact that people were long on bills and not
particularly willing to sell them.'
There was little activity on the sterling futures market. The September
short sterling contract closed at 90.32, up four basis points on the day in
thin trading.
Overall, sentiment appeared to be suffering from Tuesday's disappointing
trade figures - the current account deficit widened to more than Pounds 1bn
 -and the growing awareness that chances of a further rate cut before the
early autumn are scarce.
