Background 



The regulations at 7 CFR part 1468 currently set forth the provisions which are used to administer the wool and mohair
programs. These programs are authorized by the National Wool Act of 1954, as amended (Wool Act). 

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 amended the Wool Act by: 

(1) Requiring the Secretary of Agriculture not to deduct marketing charges for commissions, coring, and grading
in determining net sales proceeds and national payment rates for shorn wool or mohair; and 

(2) Revising the payment limitation for wool and mohair producers for the 1995 marketing year from $125,000 to $100,000.


Also, the Wool Act authorizes the Secretary to deduct a 1 percent assessment from Wool Act payments made to producers
during the 1991 and 1992 marketing years. Such authority has not been renewed. Removing the 1 percent assessment will
increase producer's Wool Act payments by the 1 percent that was withheld from the 1991 and 1992 marketing year payments.


Not deducting marketing charges for commissions, coring, and grading in determining net sales proceeds and national
payment rates for shorn wool and mohair will reduce total Wool Act payments by a small amount. Producers who have marketing
charges for commissions, coring, and grading will have their payments increased slightly; but the national payment
rate will be reduced slightly. This action should encourage more producers to core and grade their wool and mohair
to obtain a higher price for their wool or mohair. 

The decrease in the payment limitation for the 1995 marketing year from $125,000 to $100,000 will reduce payments
slightly. The persons affected by this change would be larger producers who earn over $100,000 for a marketing year.


The statutory requirement not to deduct marketing charges for commissions, grading, and coring in determining net
sales proceeds requires a change in definitions. All references to ``net sales proceeds'' have been changed to ``net
proceeds for payment purposes''. A definition for ``net proceeds for payment purposes'' has been added in 1468.3.


Section 1468.3 is amended by adding the definitions for (1) commission; (2) coring; (3) deductible marketing charges;
(4) grading; (5) gross proceeds; (6) net proceeds; (7) net proceeds for payment purposes; (8) nondeductible marketing
charges; and (9) nonmarketing charges. 

Section 1468.4 is amended to reduce the payment limitation for the 1995 marketing year. 

Section 1468.5 is amended to change the reference to net sales proceeds. 

Section 1468.6 is amended to exclude non-deductible marketing charges in determining net proceeds for payment purposes.
Section 1468.6 is also amended to change the reference to net sales proceeds. 

Section 1468.8 is amended to exclude non-deductible marketing charges in determining net proceeds for payment purposes.
Section 1468.8 is also amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds, and to remove the 1 percent assessment.


Section 1468.10 is amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds. 

Section 1468.13 is amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds. 

Section 1468.15 is removed to withdraw the provision for assessments. 

It is necessary that this regulation be placed in effect as soon as possible. Since the Omnibus Reconciliation Act
amendments went into effect during the 1993 marketing year and assistance in process is being affected by the statutory
changes, these changes need to be implemented immediately so as to impact the 1993 and 1994 marketing years. Accordingly,
good cause is shown for making this rule effective without prior public notice and comment. Comments will be reviewed
after the interim rule is effective.
