FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: It's a dog's life as every cat has its day
Every one knows that cats have nine lives, but evidence has also emerged
that they are recession proof - unlike dogs.
In the two years to September 1992, the UK cat population rose from about
6.7m to more than 7m. Dog numbers, on the other hand, declined by 1 per cent
last year, although they did keep their noses slightly in front of their
feline rivals.
These fascinating statistics formed part of Dalgety's results presentation
to the City yesterday. It seems that because cats cost less to keep than
dogs, there may have been some trading down by hard-pressed animal lovers.
This has proved good news for Arthur's (ne Kattomeat) and Purrfect, but not
so good for Prime and GoodLife - although Dalgety claimed an increasing
market share.
Demand for canned dogfood had fallen by 5 per cent last year and demand for
dog biscuits was affected by the growing popularity of complete dogfoods.
Spillers bit back in September with the launch of Choice Complete.
