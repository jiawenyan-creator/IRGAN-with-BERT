FT  25 OCT 94 / Aristide nominates new prime minister for Haiti
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide yesterday nominated Mr Smarck Michel, a
wealthy Haitian businessman, to be his prime minister, according to an aide
to Mr Michel, reports Our Foreign Staff.
This follows speculation over who would assume the delicate task of forming
a cabinet of national reconciliation, now that Mr Aristide has returned to
power after three years in exile.
Mr Michel helped finance Mr Aristide's successful presidential campaign in
1990 and was commerce minister in 1991 before the military coup. He remained
in Haiti rather than follow Mr Aristide into exile.
