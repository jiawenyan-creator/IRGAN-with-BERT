FT  04 JUN 94 / Japan current account surplus rises by 22.6%
Japan's current account surplus in April was up a larger-than-expected 22.6
per cent on the same month a year ago, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. The
surplus widened to Dollars 13.98bn (Pounds 9.24bn) in April, breaking a
declining trend shown in the previous two quarters.
This comes in the wake of the relaunch of US and Japanese efforts to break
their deadlock on ways to open Japan's market more to imports. Officials say
talks on insurance, one of the three areas at stake, started constructively.
A sharp rise in exports of semiconductors and oil tankers and a decline in
the value of oil imports were behind the growth in the surplus, said a
finance ministry official.
