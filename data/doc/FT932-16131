FT  07 APR 93 / Increase in Tesco profits slows to 6.5%
PROFITS growth at Tesco, the UK's second-largest grocery chain, dropped
below 10 per cent last year for the first time in nine years, as the company
warned that food retailing was still in the grip of recession.
Pre-tax profits for the year to February 27 rose 6.5 per cent to Pounds
580.9m - the smallest increase since the 19.6 per cent rise reported for
1983.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said sales had been disappointing in the first
half but improved over Christmas and the new year, helping annual turnover,
including VAT, to rise 7 per cent to Pounds 8.1bn.
The stronger performance had continued into the current year, with
year-on-year sales growth running at about 9 per cent. Sir Ian warned that
food retailing was likely to continue to suffer from the recession until
later in the year: 'I know that the country is supposedly coming out of
recession, but we were the last into it, and it will be some time yet before
we see any benefits.'
Sir Ian was pleased with Tesco's 14.7 per cent increase in operating profits
to Pounds 577.2m, given the difficult economic climate, and a half-point
rise in the operating margin to 7.6 per cent.
The advance in profits would, he said, benefit the company's 48,000 staff to
the extent of Pounds 25.5m through Tesco's profit-sharing scheme.
The improvement showed that Tesco's investment in scanning equipment and
sales-based ordering systems, as well as a reorganisation of its retail
management structure, was bearing fruit. Tesco increased its market share
from 9.4 per cent to 9.7 per cent.
Analysts were disappointed that the increase in operating profits was not
matched by the rise in pre-tax profits - which were depressed by a large
drop in net interest receivable from Pounds 65.5m to Pounds 31.5m,
reflecting the continuing investment in new stores. There was also a net
loss on sale of properties of Pounds 2.3m.
A final dividend of 4.85p gave a total of 7.1p - an increase of 12.7 per
cent - although earnings rose only 5.1 per cent to 20.97p. The shares gained
1p to 232p.
Some 25 new stores were opened last year and were performing 'above
expectations'. Tesco plans to open another 25 stores this year, including
both superstores and its new city-centre Metro format, but capital
expenditure will be only Pounds 750m compared with about Pounds 950m a year
in the late 1980s.
