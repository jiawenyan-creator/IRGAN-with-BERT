  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and Cuban President Fidel 
Castro did not discuss political reforms in Cuba during their 
meeting today, before the inauguration of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. 
  Spanish official sources revealed that the meeting, which 
lasted 40 minutes, focused on the process of economic reforms 
begun by Castro and the current crisis at the German and Belgian 
Embassies in Havana. 
  Gonzalez reiterated to Castro that Spain is willing to 
remain 
a financial consultant on the condition that, in the opinion of 
Gonzalez, reforms should lead to "a change of political 
circumstances." 
  As a result, Cuba should join the "democratizing trend of 
the 
Ibero-American group." 
  During the meeting -- referred to merely as "cordial" by the 
sources -- the two leaders reviewed the economic situation in 
the their respective countries, and Castro did not conceal the 
hardships his country is facing. 
  According to Felipe Gonzalez, there are only two paths to be 
taken in facing this crisis: to implement more in-depth reforms 
or to abstain from doing so, which would further exacerbate the 
situation. 
  Regarding the situation triggered by the occupation of the 
embassies of Belgium, where 18 people remain since 18 May, and 
Germany, where 20 people forcefully entered yesterday, Castro 
explained his position. Castro's position consists of "not 
allowing the escalation of conflicts of this type."
