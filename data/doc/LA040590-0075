MORNING REPORT: ART 
Chagall Record Set: An unidentified Japanese telephone bidder paid an auction 
record price of $6.09 million for a work by artist Marc Chagall. 
The 1949 painting, "The Bride Under the Canopy," was the highest-priced work in 
Tuesday night's sale of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's. The painting 
shows a bride and bridegroom under an awning, with a large vase of leaves and 
flowers and a violinist. Another Chagall, "The Farmers' Bouquet," went for 
$5.02 million, also to a Japanese telephone bidder. SHAUNA SNOW
