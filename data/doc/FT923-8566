FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pinault sells timber subsidiary
to Glunz
PINAULT, the French retailing and timber group, is continuing its debt
reduction programme by selling Isoroy, one of its timber subsidiaries, to
Glunz, the leading German timber products group.
The disposal, for an undisclosed sum, forms part of Pinault's strategy of
selling its original timber businesses to refocus on its retailing
interests. In addition it is raising capital to reduce the debts incurred
after last year's controversial bid for Au Printemps, the French department
store and mail order group.
Pinault, which made net profits of FFr503m (Dollars 102m) last year, hopes
to raise between FFr4bn and FFr5bn from disposals. Its net debt stood at
FFr15.5bn by the end of last year.
So far Pinault, which owns the Conforama furniture chain and La Redoute mail
order catalogue, has sold several timber-related businesses, including Lafa
in furniture and Sofiseb in kitchen units.
Isoroy specialises in wood-derivative panels and has 2,720 employees and 14
production plants in France. It made net profits of FFr60m on sales of
FFr2.2bn last year.
The acquisition forms part of Glunz's efforts to consolidate its hold over
the European wood panelling market where it is a leading player in chipboard
and plywood. The German group, based at Hamm, has been restructuring its
interests since the acquisition two years ago of Conti Products in the UK.
Glunz saw its pre-tax profits fall from DM40m in 1990 to DM16m (Dollars 11m)
in 1991.
