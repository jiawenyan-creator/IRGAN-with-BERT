FT  03 DEC 93 / EU aid to areas hit by cuts in defence
Projects in the UK to benefit from a Pounds 15.5m European Union aid package
for regions suffering from cuts in defence spending were named yesterday.
The grants, which will be matched by equal amounts from local authorities or
the private sector, will go to 150 projects selected from 250 applications
from private companies, local authorities and enterprise agencies.
The grants can be used for economic regeneration, training, new product
development and environmental schemes.
For the first time areas in the south-east and south-west of England will
benefit from EU structural funds.
Successful applicants include a new small business centre in Fife and a plan
to revive the Woolwich Arsenal in London. Grants range from Pounds 2,500 for
an information development project in Leeds to more than Pounds 1.3m for a
plan to diversify the local economy of a defence-dependent area of the
south-west. Every region of England, with Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales
and Gibraltar, will benefit.
