<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish, other than demersal shelf rockfish (DSR) in the Southeast Outside
district, by vessels using hook-and-line gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding
the second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut apportioned to hook-and-line gear in the GOA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the FMP prepared by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is 
governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 
and 672. 


In accordance with 672.20(f)(2), the 1994 Pacific halibut prohibited species catch limit for hook-and-line
gear for groundfish fisheries, other than DSR in the Southeast Outside district, in the GOA was established by the
final 1994 groundfish specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 740 metric tons (mt). NMFS apportioned 500
mt to the second season, the period May 18 through August 31, 1994. 
Due to the short duration of the hook-and-line sablefish fishery, observer data will not be available in time to monitor
bycatch during the second season of the 1994 Pacific halibut prohibited species catch limit for hook-and-line gear
for groundfish fisheries. Therefore, based on the 1993 bycatch rates, the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has
determined, in accordance with 672.20(f)(1)(ii)(A), that operators of vessels engaged in directed fishing
for groundfish, other than DSR in the Southeast Outside district, with hook-and-line gear in the GOA will reach the
second seasonal bycatch allowance of Pacific halibut by May 28, 1994. NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish,
other than DSR in the Southeast Outside district, by vessels using hook-and-line gear in the GOA from 12 noon, A.l.t.,
May 28, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., August 31, 1994. 
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at 672.20(g).
