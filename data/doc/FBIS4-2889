  [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank 
approved today a loan of 570 million U.S. dollars to support an 
irrigation and power generation project along northern China's 
Yellow River. 
  The "Xiaolangdi multipurpose project" finances construction 
of a 154-meter-high rock fill dam, with a reservoir, 15 large 
tunnels and a spillway to divert the river, handle floods, 
generate power and control sediment. 
  The dam will protect about 103 million people and billions 
of 
dollars in housing, roads, factories and power plants from 
possible catastrophic floods, and reduce sediment flow. 
  The project, in the fertile and heavily populated Xiaolangdi 
region along the Yellow River, will prevent floods that could 
cause billions of dollars in damage and the loss of thousands of 
lives. 
  Flooding problems along the Yellow River date back thousands 
of years, as do China's efforts to regulate the river. China 
has considered the project for about 40 years, which was 
formally identified by the World Bank in 1989. 
  The loan approved today, extending from 20 to 35 years, 
included a loan of 460 million dollars from the World Bank and a 
credit of 110 million from its affiliate, the International 
Development Association.
