NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
111 YEARS A 'LIFELONG RESIDENT' 
The words "lifelong resident of Vicksburg" mean a lot to Bessie W. Putman -- 
she reckons 111 years. 
Putman celebrated her birthday Wednesday at the Vicksburg Convalescent Home. An 
inscription in her family Bible shows that she was born in 1879 in a small 
house on the edge of Vicksburg. 
The daughter of slaves, Putman said her mother and father died while she was a 
baby, and an aunt raised her and her brother. Born Bessie Wilson, she married 
Sam Putman in 1900 and had 12 children, most of whom have died.
