FT  31 AUG 94 / Court upholds ban on music company
A music company was yesterday denied its attempt in the High Court to
release its records from an alleged monopoly of distribution outside the US.
American Recordings, the US recording label formerly known as Def American,
had sought an injunction to overturn a ban imposed by the Mechanical
Copyright Protection Society on sales of its albums in the UK.
The ban was enacted on behalf of Phonogram, the UK unit of PolyGram, the
music and film group in which Philips of the Netherlands has a majority
stake.
Phonogram claimed American had violated a joint-venture agreement in which
it was named as sole distributor for American's artists outside the US.
Earlier this month Phonogram dropped a case against American in the UK and
instead launched a claim for punitive damages in the California courts. The
US action also seeks to restrain American from entering into a distribution
agreement with any other company until the dispute is resolved.
The Phonogram action is a countersuit to a Dollars 14m (Pounds 9m) case
brought by American. It has said that Phonogram did not abide by the
agreement and that the company did not promote its artists as agreed, file
tax returns, pay royalties, or set up office space.
American filed the application against the ban in the UK because it believes
it is no longer bound by the agreement and should be allowed to distribute
outside the US.
Mr Justice Evans-Lombe ruled that without proceedings against American in
the UK there were no grounds for lifting the ban until the dispute was
settled.
American was awarded costs for its defence against Phonogram's abandoned
High Court action.
