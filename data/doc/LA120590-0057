DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW JET CURB SOUGHT AT VAN NUYS AIRPORT 
The Van Nuys Airport Advisory Council voted Tuesday to urge Los Angeles city 
officials to bar any new jets from being based at the airport. . 
Members of the advisory group said they want the Board of Airport Commissioners 
to enact the recommended moratorium to halt a decade-long trend at the airfield 
of corporate jets displacing piston-engine craft favored by recreational 
fliers. 
The council members blamed jets for increasing airport noise and for squeezing 
out many of the weekend fliers who formerly used the airport. 
Airport officials say that since 1979, the number of jets based at the airport 
rose from 18 to 93 and the number of piston-engine planes dropped from 1,333 to 
771. 
Business operators at the airport say they expect the proportion of jets to 
continue to grow because renting and servicing jets is more profitable than 
catering to owners of piston-engine craft.
