FT  14 JAN 92 / Tokyo rewards South African efforts to dismantle apartheid
JAPAN has formally restored diplomatic links with South Africa, which Tokyo
feels deserves recognition for moving to dismantle apartheid and establish
democratic institutions, writes Robert Thomson.
The two countries exchanged notes yesterday allowing ties to be upgraded
from consular to ambassadorial level. Tokyo expects links to be enhanced
when South Africa's President F W de Klerk visits Japan later this year.
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the decision followed talks in
South Africa last month on the drafting of a new constitution. They
suggested Tokyo would work to develop 'stable relations with a new South
Africa'.
Japanese companies welcomed the resumption of ties, which follows the
lifting last October of economic sanctions, including a ban on direct
investment and imports of gold coins and steel.
Tokyo had asked the corporate sector to exercise 'self-restraint' after
bilateral trade swelled to Dollars 4.1bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in 1987. The figure
fell to Dollars 3.32bn in 1990, although the African National Congress
condemned some Japanese companies for trading through third countries.
Diplomatic relations were severed after the outbreak of the Second World
War, but consular links were re-established in 1952. Japanese officials
expect Mr de Klerk to visit Tokyo in the second half of this year.
