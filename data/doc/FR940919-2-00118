 

Assumptions, Task Times and Lapse Times 



Listed below are key assumptions, task times and lapse times 
that the Team used to model the redesigned process. The task 
times are shown in minutes and represent the estimated time it 
will take an employee to complete the described task. For each 
task time entry, three task time numbers are shown. The middle 
number represents the most common task time, while the first and 
last number represent the low and high extremes for that task. 
The lapse times are shown in work days, rather than calendar 
days, and represent the number of days between actions or tasks.
