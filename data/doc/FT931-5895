FT  04 MAR 93 / Taiwan and UK to establish air links
TAIWAN and Britain will establish direct air links on March 29 in a move
expected to benefit trade and tourism, airline officials said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
Aircraft flying the route will not carry flags or national insignia because
of political sensitivities.
Britain does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taipei and instead
recognises China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan.
British Asia Airways, a subsidiary of British Airways, will make two round
trips a week between Taipei and London, with a stopover in Hong Kong, Mr
Winston Hsieh, the airline's Taipei manager, said.
Eva Airways, Taiwan's second international airline and part of the Evergreen
shipping group, said it would make three trips a week with stopovers in
Bangkok and Vienna.
Taiwan has struggled to set up direct air links with other countries because
of its rivalry with China. The island's growing economic power has helped it
establish services with several nations in the past two years.
Taiwanese made about 50,000 trips to Britain last year, up from 35,000 the
previous year, Britain's representative office in Taiwan said.
