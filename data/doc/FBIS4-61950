  [Text] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy has the highest popularity 
rating with State Duma deputies among politicians who could head 
the Russian Federation Government in the future. That is borne 
out by the results of a poll of 211 members of the Federal 
Assembly's lower chamber (82 percent of the members) conducted 
by sociologists of the independent "Mneniye" service.
