  [Text] Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has 
asserted that Iraq has complied with Security Council Resolution 
687 on weapons of mass destruction and no longer has any of 
these weapons or the capacity to manufacture them. 
  In a statement to Qatari state television last night, he 
said 
that although Iraq implemented the provisions of that 
resolution, it is repeatedly accused of failure to abide by 
international resolutions for political reasons and to maintain 
the blockade imposed on it. 
  He added that U.S.-led foreign parties in the Security 
Council have political purposes unrelated to the Gulf crisis. 
  This is the second time the Qatari television has held an 
interview with Iraqi officials. A week ago, it aired a report 
on the unjust blockade, including an interview with Trade 
Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih.
