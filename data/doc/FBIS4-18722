  [Text] Brussels, April 8 (AFP) -- Belgium was sending a 
Boeing 737 to the Burundi capital of Bujumbura to prepare for a 
possible evacuation of civilians from Rwanda, Communications 
Minister Elio Di Rupo said here Friday [8 April]. 
  He said plans had been made for the 150-seat aircraft to fly 
civilians from the Rwandan capital of Kigali to Bujumbura, 
provided that a safety zone could be established 20 kilometres 
(12.5 miles) around Kigali airport. 
  The Belgian cabinet was due to meet here around 1300 GMT to 
decide whether to evacuate Belgian civilians from Rwanda, what 
troops to provide for the operation and how to coordinate the 
operation with the United Nations. 
  Di Rupo said a flight crew of the Belgian airline Sabena was 
already in Kigali, and that the captain and first officer had 
been slightly injured when the Sabena-owned hotel there came 
under machine-gun fire. 
  He added that a Sabena DC-10 aircraft was being sent to the 
Ugandan capital of Entebbe to increase the evacuation capability.
