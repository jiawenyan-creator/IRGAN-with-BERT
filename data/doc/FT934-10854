FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tokyo broadcast unit alters view
TOKYO Broadcasting System, a leading Japanese commercial broadcasting
company, issued revised unconsolidated earnings forecasts showing
expectations for increased profits but falling revenue for both the six
months to September 30 and the full year to March, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
The company said a review of costs and programming conducted last summer had
resulted in a greater impact than expected on earnings.
