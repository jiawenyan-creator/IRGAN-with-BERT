FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia's soya imports to
soar
INDONESIA'S IMPORTS of soyabean meal are likely to rise 150 per cent to
250,000 metric tonnes in the marketing year beginning October 1 following
the removal of a 35 per cent import surcharge last June, according to a
report by the US embassy in Jakarta.
The report said Indonesian companies supplying feed to the poultry and
livestock industry have indicated 'tremendous interest in importing
(soyabean) meal' now that it is price competitive with alternatives such as
fish, cottonseed and rapeseed meal.
The greatest beneficiary of the relaxed regime was likely to be India, which
at present accounted for 44 per cent of Indonesia's soyabean imports. The
embassy expected the US to increase its exports from 20,000 tonnes in the
current marketing year to 60,000 tonnes next year.
Industry officials noted, however, that the government still protected the
domestic crushing industry by demanding that feed companies continue to
purchase 40 per cent of soyabean meal from Sarpindo, a privately owned
company, which has a domestic crushing monopoly.
The report painted a mixed picture of Indonesia's other oilseed industries,
oil palm and coconut.
Palm oil exports were forecast to rise 32.6 per cent to 1.6m tonnes in the
year to September 30, and then to 1.85m tonnes next year, while total
production would rise from 3.25m tonnes to 3.6m tonnes.
'Sustained growth will help boost (palm oil) production near the
government's goal of 6m tonnes by the end of the century,' said the report.
Coconut copra production, however, was forecast to fall 13 per cent this
calendar year to 1.15m tonnes, before making a partial recovery to 1.2m
tonnes in 1994.
Coconut oil exports were expected to decline 15 per cent this year to
690,000 tonnes, rising next year to 750,000 tonnes.
