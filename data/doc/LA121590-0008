ETHICS HEARINGS AND CRANSTON 
So Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) played a more active and independent role than 
any of the other senators ("Cranston Was Most Active of Keating 5," front page, 
Dec. 10). So what's new? He always has on all issues, thank heavens. 
And so what? The testimony during the current Senate ethics hearings has more 
than proven that Cranston had every justification to inquire and question, at 
any time, the activities of the newly active regulators (where were they for 
six years?) when a constituent showed evidence of possible harassment and delay 
and damage to his business, no matter the contributions by that constituent. 
The deregulation and "profit at any cost and the public be damned" policies of 
the Reagan years, the greedy investors who chose not to look at the fine print 
to make a fast buck and the truly unethical conduct of the Neil Bushes caused 
the S&amp;L mess, not Sen. Cranston. 
Cranston should be lauded for his years of "active and independent" 
representation of the people of California and the nation, and for his 
dedication to voting rights and registration. We say, get the partisan 
hypocrites (are you listening, Sen. Warren Rudman?) off of his back and place 
the blame where it belongs. Leave our honorable senator alone!
