FT  07 DEC 93 / Airtours increases 25% to Pounds 45.5m: Holiday group to
broaden price ranges as bookings for summer 1994 rise 53%
Airtours, the holiday group, yesterday announced full-year pre-tax profits
up 24.6 per cent to Pounds 45.5m and said it had clearly established itself
as the UK's second largest tour operator after Thomson.
Airtours said its market share last summer was 21 per cent, against 13.9 per
cent the previous year. It said this year's figure was more than double the
market share achieved by Owners Abroad, the rival tour operator which it
failed to take over earlier this year.
Mr David Crossland, chairman, said the group would in future sell Airtours
packages as middle-market rather than budget holidays. Aspro, the tour
operator which Airtours bought last June, will become the group's budget
holiday brand. Mr Crossland said Airtours aimed to develop or buy an
additional upmarket holiday brand.
Mr Crossland admitted that there was a morale problem at Hogg Robinson, the
travel agency chain Airtours bought earlier in the year, but said this
affected only 12 of its 210 branches.
He said his attention had been focused on integrating the head offices of
Hogg Robinson and Pickfords Travel, which Airtours bought last year. The
group would now concentrate on introducing profit sharing and branch
budgetary control to the Hogg Robinson outlets. The two chains have 545
branches altogether, making Airtours the second largest UK travel retailer.
Mr Crossland wanted the number of retail outlets to increase to between 700
and 750 over the next two years.
The pre-tax profits figure for the year to September 30, 1993, included a
Pounds 9m charge for the failed Owners Abroad bid. Operating profit before
bid costs rose 49.2 per cent to Pounds 54.5m. Turnover rose 51.8 per cent to
Pounds 615.6m. A final dividend of 8p brings the total pay-out to 9p - 24.1
per cent up on last year's 7.25p. Earnings per share were 29.22p, up from
27.47p.
Airtours said its bookings for this winter were 38 per cent up on last year.
The group's winter market share is 19 per cent, compared with 17 per cent
last year. Early bookings for summer 1994 are 53 per cent ahead. Airtours'
summer market share is up three percentage points at 24 per cent.
The large increase in bookings for next summer has been partly caused by
early discounts offered by travel agents' chains. Airtours estimated market
growth next summer at between 5 and 10 per cent.
