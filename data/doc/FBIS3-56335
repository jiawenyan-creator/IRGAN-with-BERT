  [Excerpt] "The Russians are interested in selling Israel 
nuclear reactors for electricity production." This was reported 
by Energy Minister Moshe Shahal, currently visiting the CIS 
republics. 
  According to Shahal, the implementation of the deal depends 
on Israel's ability to purchase the Russian reactors in view of 
the technical, political, and economic constraints. 
  The minister explained that the Russians are willing to sell 
five [as published] energy products to Israel, in addition to 
nuclear energy: crude oil, natural gas, petroleum distillates 
(such as benzine), and know-how for the production of 
alternative energy. [passage omitted]
