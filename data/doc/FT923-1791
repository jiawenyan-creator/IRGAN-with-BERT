FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: E Europe steps up EC
pressure
POLAND, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Federation have stepped up pressure
to become full members of the European Community through the submission of a
'convergence' plan outlining how their economies could fit into the EC in
the near future.
In a joint memorandum to the EC, the three former communist countries also
warn that their reform efforts are at a crucial stage. The risks of
inflation and unemployment are imposing 'heavy costs' on their societies,
according to the memo which urges more EC investment to spur reform.
At the UK's prompting, the EC has agreed to hold talks at foreign minister
level with the so-called Visegrad countries in Luxembourg on October 5.
