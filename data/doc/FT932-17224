FT  01 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Options-related sales weaken
blue chips
Wall Street
IN SPITE OF an early rally in drug stocks, prompted by reports that the
Clinton administration is not considering placing controls on pharmaceutical
prices, US equities ended mixed yesterday but with blue chips hit hard by
late options-related selling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.16 down at 3,435.11, its low for
the day. Other indices fared better. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased only
0.30 to 451.67, while the American SE composite finished 3.75 firmer at
423.43 and the Nasdaq composite 3.88 higher at 690.13. New York SE volume
was 279m shares.
The day's economic news had little impact on the markets. Among the data
released was a 0.5 per cent rise in leading economic indicators for February
and a 1.4 per cent increase in February factory orders, both of which were
in line with analysts' forecasts. News of a stronger than expected Chicago
purchasing managers' report also had no effect on sentiment.
Investors have ignored most of the recent data because their attention is
firmly fixed on tomorrow's all-important employment report for March, which
will give the latest indication of how the labour market is responding to
the growth in business activity.
Prices traded slightly firmer throughout the day, except for Dow stocks,
which dropped more than 20 points in the final hour of trading, with dealers
saying this was related to the expiration of new stock index options
products.
Drug shares were the feature of the day as they continued the rally sparked
late on Tuesday by comments from Mr Ira Magaziner, a senior adviser to
President Clinton, who doubted that the administration would pursue price
controls as part of its healthcare industry reform package.
Since the middle of last year, when Mr Clinton became firm favourite to win
the election, drug issues have been hounded by speculation that limits would
be placed on drug prices in an attempt by the government to keep medical
costs down.
After some delays because of order imbalances, most of the big drug stocks
posted gains of more than Dollars 1 in early trading, which was described by
traders as primarily a follow-through from the heavy buying on European
markets. By the close, however, the rally had lost most of its steam, with
the bigger stocks hit by the options-related selling.
Merck finished down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 35 3/8 after volume of 5.6m
shares, Pfizer off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 62 1/4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Dollars  1/2 easier at Dollars 59. Among those that managed to hold on to
most of their gains were Johnson &amp; Johnson, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 42
1/2 , Foundation Health, Dollars 1 5/8 ahead at Dollars 30, and US Surgical,
Dollars 1 firmer at Dollars 57 1/2 , all after busy trading.
Wal-Mart, hit hard by a broker's downgrade on Tuesday, bounced back, rising
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 31 3/4 in volume of 6.8m shares.
On the Nasdaq market, medical stocks also gained ground. Amgen rose Dollars
 3/4 to Dollars 37 3/4 and US Healthcare put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 46
1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO closed higher after active trading, boosted by strong gains in
pipelines and gold shares.
The TSE 300 index improved 16.3 to 3,602.4 and advances outpaced declines by
428 to 280 after volume of 57.4m shares valued at CDollars 565.7m.
