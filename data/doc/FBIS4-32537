  [Text] Skopje, 25 Jun (TANJUG) -- Stevo Crvenkovski, 
foreign minister of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM], today sent a letter to the United Nations in which he 
says that "the Yugoslav Army has been continuously threatening 
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FYROM for three 
months now." 
  "We have tried using all peaceful means to reduce tension on 
the border with the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. 
However, the latest incident on the strategically important 
point 1703, Straza, where Yugoslav soldiers have taken position 
-- which indicates that they intend to stay on our territory for 
some time -- calls for the use of all available means to force 
the Yugoslav Army to withdraw to its own territory," the FYROM 
foreign minister says in his letter to Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  Crvenkovski also says that the FYROM, "if these incidents 
continue, will demand that the United Nations take the most 
energetic measures to protect our territorial integrity."
