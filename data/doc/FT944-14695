FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Chesterfield Props 37% lower at Pounds 4.9m
Chesterfield Properties reported a 37 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax
profits to Pounds 4.91m, compared with Pounds 7.81m which was boosted by
Pounds 3.38m in property disposals. Profits from continuing operations were
ahead 11 per cent.
Mr David Kiernan, finance director, said that the group had benefited from
the firm retail market which had underpinned a recovery in rental values.
However, office rents remained under pressure. About two thirds of revenue
comes from retail operations and Mr Kiernan added: 'We are looking to
increase our retail portfolio to take advantage of the upturn.'
Developments under way would show their benefit to the bottom line 'within
the next two years,' according to Mr Kiernan. However, the immediate outlook
was 'fairly quiet', he added. Refurbishments were progressing on shopping
centres in Hull and Rugby. An office block in Victoria was also due to
receive similar treatment.
Rental income showed a 13 per cent rise to Pounds 5.21m (Pounds 4.62m).
However, income from the group's theatres - including seven in London's West
End - and cinemas declined sharply, increasing losses from Pounds 184,000 to
Pounds 361,000. Mr Kiernan blamed a combination of factors for the
deterioration, including the rail strike, new parking restrictions and a
lack of consumer confidence.
Group turnover also showed a fall, slipping 5 per cent to Pounds 16.5m
(Pounds 17.3m). Earnings per share fell from 20.3p to 11.9p. The interim
dividend is raised to 4.4p (4p).
