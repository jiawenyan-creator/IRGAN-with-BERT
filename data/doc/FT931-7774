FT  23 FEB 93 / City 'loses Pounds 5m' on owners' vandalism
THE Corporation of London will lose Pounds 5m of revenue this financial year
as a result of 'constructive vandalism', the damage inflicted on buildings
by their owners to avoid paying rates, according to property advisers DTZ
Debenham Thorpe.
The practice of stripping out buildings is a response to the poor letting
prospects in the City. Rates on empty properties are levied at half the
charge of occupied property but no rates are payable on unusable property.
In the City of London, where 17 per cent of offices are empty, the rates
bill for empty property is expected to be Pounds 60m this financial year.
Across the UK, about Pounds 600m is paid in rates on empty buildings.
The property industry has been lobbying the government to reduce the burden
of empty rates, which it claims encourages forced sales of property and
reduces tenants' willingness to move premises.
