FT  19 OCT 93 / Clinton resists curb over troops
FOR the second time in a week the Clinton administration was yesterday
gearing itself to beat back congressional attempts to dictate where and when
it may use US troops overseas.
On Sunday, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said he would submit a
bill preventing the administration from using force in Haiti unless the
president certified that vital US national security interests were involved.
Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, warned that passage of
the proposed Dole amendment, which would be tagged on to the current defence
appropriations bill, would be 'a very serious setback for the US'.
'Any provision which preconditions the ability of the president to use the
armed forces is offensive to the constitution,' he said.
Mr Dole had helped the administration last week defeat an amendment limiting
US military operations in Somalia. On Sunday morning, prior to the TV
interview in which he disclosed his proposal, he called President Bill
Clinton for a lengthy discussion, which prompted the senator to revise an
existing legislative draft.
The senator, in his TV interview, seemed particularly exercised at the
prospect of US lives being lost to reinstate Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the
ousted Haitian president. 'I think he has a lot of shortcomings,' Mr Dole
said.
Some members of the administration were inclined to suggest Mr Dole was
acting with his own political future in mind. Last week several
proto-candidates for the 1996 Republican nomination burst forth with
indictments of the administration's foreign policy at precisely the moment
Mr Dole was actively engaged in sustaining it on Somalia.
Mr Clinton meanwhile stepped up pressure on Haiti's army leaders yesterday
by signing an order freezing their assets. He also said he had ordered US
warships blockading Haiti to move closer to shore 'so they will be in plain
sight'. The ships are to enforce an oil and arms embargo.
