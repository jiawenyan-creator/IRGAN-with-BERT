  [Text] Haikou, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
is to introduce a monopoly system on salt production and 
wholesale distribution. 
  Starting from this year, all salt producers and wholesale 
dealers are required to apply for licences, a State Council 
decision has said. 
  This is aimed at checking shoddy and non-iodised salt on the 
market. 
  An administrative department for the salt industry will be 
set up in the China Council of Light Industry to take charge of 
the work. 
  In recent years, low-quality and non-iodised salt have 
emerged on the market, leading to a rise of Iodine Deficiency 
Diseases (IDD) in some areas of the country. 
  The introduction of the system is expected to help the 
country realize its goal of eliminating IDD nationwide by the 
year 2000. 
  China is one of the countries in the world with severe IDD 
prevalence.
