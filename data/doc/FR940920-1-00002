<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations pertaining to technical specifications
for nuclear power reactors. The proposed rule would codify criteria for determining the content of technical specifications.
These criteria were developed in recognition of the overly broad use of technical specifications to impose requirements,
diverting both NRC and licensee attention from the more important requirements in these documents to the extent that
it has resulted in an adverse but unquantifiable impact on safety. Each licensee covered by these regulations may
voluntarily use the criteria as a basis to propose the relocation of existing technical specifications that do not
meet any of the criteria from the facility license to licensee-controlled documents. The voluntary conversion of
current technical specifications in this manner is expected to produce an improvement in the safety of nuclear power
plants through a reduction in unnecessary plant transients and more efficient use of NRC and industry resources.

 Comment period expires December 5, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to
do so, but the Commission is able to ensure consideration only for comments received on or before this date.

Background 



Section 182a. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (Act), as amended (42 U.S.C. 2232), mandates the inclusion of technical
specifications in licenses for the operation of production and utilization facilities. The Act requires that technical
specifications include information concerning the amount, kind, and source of special nuclear material, the place
of use, and the specific characteristics of the facility. That section also states that technical specifications
shall contain information the Commission requires through regulation to enable it to find that the utilization of
special nuclear material will be in accord with the common defense and security and will provide adequate protection
of public health and safety. Finally, that section requires technical specifications to be made a part of any license
issued. 

The Commission promulgated 50.36, ``Technical Specifications,'' which implements Section 182a. of the
Atomic Energy Act on December 17, 1968 (33 FR 18610). This rule delineates requirements for determining the contents
of technical specifications. Technical specifications set forth the specific characteristics of the facility
and the conditions for its operation that are required to provide adequate protection of the health and safety of the
public. Specifically, 50.36 requires the following:

 


Each license authorizing operation of a production or utilization facility of a type described in 50.21 or
50.22 will include technical specifications. The technical specifications will be derived from the analyses
and evaluation included in the safety analysis report, and amendments thereto, submitted pursuant to 50.34.
The Commission may include such additional technical specifications as the Commission finds appropriate.
