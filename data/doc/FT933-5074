FT  06 SEP 93 / Workers' fear of job loss lessens
FEAR OF unemployment and job loss among Britain's workers has declined in
the past nine months, according to a survey carried out for the TUC, Robert
Taylor writes. The findings suggest a recovery of optimism about economic
prospects in the workplace.
As many as 65 per cent said they did not think there would be job losses at
their workplace in the next 12 months, compared with 50 per cent who
believed this last December.
Only 11 per cent thought it was likely that they would lose their job in the
next 12 months, compared with 15 per cent back in December.
