FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder results hit by
property write-offs
GOODMAN Fielder Wattie, Australia's biggest food group, has maintained a
resurging operating performance with a 7 per cent rise in net profits,
before special items, from ADollars 100.8m (USDollars 72.5m) to ADollars
108.1m in the June year.
But bottom line earnings were hit by a ADollars 58.6m special loss, against
a ADollars 9.4m profit previously, reflecting property write-downs and
rationalisation costs.
The result came on a small rise in sales to ADollars 4.21bn from ADollars
4.13bn and the dividend is being held at 11 cents a share.
Mr Michael Nugent, chief executive, said the result was achieved in spite of
intense competition in Australasian markets which make up 66 per cent of the
company's total business. 'The programme that began two years ago to focus
on core businesses, to sell non-performing and non-strategic assets, cut
debt and reduce overheads is showing through in the improved quality of
pre-tax and pre-abnormal earnings and the strengthened balance sheet.
'In the past two years we have increased earnings before interest and tax by
more than 25 per cent, sold more than ADollars 440m worth of assets, cut
interest costs, increased operating profit before tax by about 50 per cent,
reduced net debt by ADollars 272m and improved gross cash flow per share by
7.4 per cent. Directors are aiming to achieve a minimum growth in net profit
after tax, before abnormal items of 15 per cent in the current year and
believe this would represent a significant improvement given the prevailing
economic conditions.'
The company's biggest earning division remained baking and milling, although
its net contribution fell 13.6 per cent to ADollars 85.1m. Among the best
improvers, the food ingredients division lifted its contribution by 64.7 per
cent to ADollars 41m.
