FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cowie in Pounds 18.9m vehicle leasing
purchase
T Cowie, the acquisitive motor group, is expanding its vehicle leasing
activity by buying Commercial Union's business for Pounds 18.85m.
The deal will add 5,000 vehicles to Cowie Interleasing's fleet, making a
total of 65,000. Cowie was already market leader.
Cowie is paying cash and not taking any debt with the business. The deal
will increase its gearing by about 12 percentage points.
The Commercial Union business broke even after tax in 1993.
The acquisition follows Cowie's purchase last August of Commercial Union's
corporate fleet management activity, for an undisclosed sum, and the 1991
purchase of Royal Bank of Scotland's lossmaking contract hire business for
Pounds 38m. That covered 5,700 vehicles.
The price being paid relates to the value of the vehicles, and will be
finalised on completion today.
Cowie said it could assimilate the 5,000 vehicles without taking on many
extra staff. The vehicles are mainly under contract to local authorities.
