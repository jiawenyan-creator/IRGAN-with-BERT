FT  28 JAN 93 / Krajina's Serbs demand withdrawal by Croat forces
Serb gunners take a rest during a lull in fighting 25 miles west of Knin,
capital of the disputed enclave of Krajina, which has been subjected to a
six-day Croatian offensive. The Serbians yesterday launched a counterattack
and issued an ultimatum demanding Croat withdrawal within 24 hours from all
territory seized since the recent resumption of fighting. Serb forces later
claimed to have seized strategic villages around the Maslenica bridge, which
is the link between central Croatia and its southern Adriatic coast and
which was the initial objective of the Croatian forces. Late yesterday the
United Nations Security Council demanded an immediate halt to the Croat
offensive into areas protected by the UN and also warned of further
unspecified action.
