SPORTS KIDS' GOAL: CHARACTER THROUGH FITNESS 
The goal of the nonprofit Sports Kids, its founders say, is to build character 
in children through sports and physical fitness. 
The four principals in the 18-month-old organization are Paul Stem, a former 
Delta Air Lines executive; Bob Mathias, a former Olympic decathlon champion who 
is the group's president; Chuck Foster, the executive director, and Larry 
Sayler. Each is paid $85,000 a year, Foster said. 
The group has an unpaid board of governors that includes celebrities such as 
Mike Love of the Beach Boys and Jermaine Jackson of the Jackson family. 
In 1987, Mathias placed the organization's headquarters in Irvine rather than 
Indianapolis, in part at the urging of then-Irvine City Councilman C. David 
Baker. Officials say that Baker opened doors and introduced Sports Kids leaders 
to influential people in Orange County. 
The group, with offices in a suite on the 17th floor of the Irvine Marriott 
Hotel, says its goal is to build programs for children ages 5 and up, and to 
annually produce an international competition for boys and girls 10 to 13. The 
group's motto is: "Participation Is Victory." 
The group had its first major fund-raiser in April featuring singer Donny 
Osmond. The event at the Marriott drew nearly 800 people who paid $250 a plate. 
Foster said the organization cleared $30,000 after expenses. 
Last summer, its first international Earth Games were held on the campus of UC 
Irvine and drew 140 participants, including 14 from the Soviet Union and 16 
from Mexico. 
The second Earth Games, a 13-day event, will begin Aug. 13 at the Caliente Race 
Track in Tijuana, Mexico. About 500 children from 159 countries are expected to 
take part in games such as soccer, baseball and basketball. GEORGE FRANK and
