FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals surge as nickel touches
two-year high
Prices on the London Metal Exchange rose sharply yesterday, helped by
renewed interest from investment funds and a weakening dollar which made
metals look cheaper in other currencies.
Aluminium prices touched a fresh four-year high and nickel joined the party
to go briefly to its highest level for two years before substantial
profit-taking stopped the upward momentum. At the close, aluminium was up
another USDollars 9.25 a tonne at Dollars 1,741.50, copper had advanced by
Dollars 51 to Dollars 2,539.50 and nickel was up Dollars 205 at Dollars
6,895 a tonne.
Nickel, used mainly for production of stainless steel, reached Dollars 6,950
at one stage, a 42 per cent rise from the Dollars 4,000 low point it touched
last year, in spite of LME stocks standing at a record 150,000 tonnes or an
estimated 11 weeks of consumption.
Analysts suggested that investment funds were anticipating strong demand for
metals next year and helping to push up prices before increased consumption
reduced stocks.
Mr Heinz Pariser of Heinz H Pariser Alloy Metals &amp; Steel Market Research,
said at an LME seminar last week that nickel consumption this year was
likely to grow by 7.7 per cent and reach a record 740,000 tonnes.
A 'moderate' further increase of 2.7 per cent was forecast for 1995 followed
by a rise of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent in 1996 and 1997.
This would create a 33,000-tonnes supply shortage in 1994 and 40,000 tonnes
next year. Mr Pariser said nickel prices were likely to average Dollars
6,390 a tonne this year.
