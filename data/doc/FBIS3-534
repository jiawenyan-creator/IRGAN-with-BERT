  [Text] Business confidence is down, and political 
uncertainty is to blame. The South African Chamber of Business 
[SACOB] today released the latest confidence index, which 
reflects the mood of businessmen around the country. Jennifer 
Wilson reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Wilson] It's headlines such as these that 
are reflected in the February drop in business confidence. 
SACOB's business confidence index is over 1 point down, quite a 
significant drop, following on from last month's five-year high. 
  [SACOB Director General Raymond Parsons] The drop in the 
business confidence index was not entirely unexpected, if you 
take into account the political uncertainty in the past few 
weeks having had a negative impact on the business mood. But 
the more we can make the politcal process inclusive, the more we 
hold out the promise of political stability, so the chances that 
the South African economy could grow at 2.5 to even 3 percent 
this year improve, with the prospect of an even higher growth 
rate next year, if we get the politics right. 
  [Wilson] Another important economic indicator: the new car 
sales figures were released today. Car sales figures for 
February were 2 percent down on last year at the same time. It 
seems that the whole of the South African economy is adopting a 
wait-and-see attitude. But motor industry sources said today 
that they did continue to expect a modest increase in new car 
sales figures for the rest of the year. [end recording]
