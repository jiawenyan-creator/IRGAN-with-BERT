FT  08 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar estimate cut, but by less
than expected
WORLD SUGAR output in the 1991-92 crop year is forecast to reach 113.1m
tonnes, raw value, according to FO Licht, the influential German statistics
agency, in its second production estimate, reports Reuter.
This compares with a previous forecast for 1991 - 92 of 114.06m tonnes made
last October and a revised 1990-91 output estimate of 113.76m tonnes.
All the figures are based on national crop years.
The announcement pushed world sugar futures prices down in New York because
the production forecast was higher than traders had expected.
'The estimate was down by almost 1m tonnes but we were looking for a
downward revision of up to 2m tonnes,' one analyst said. 'The drop in the
Cuban output numbers (that) we expected apparently didn't come through.'
At the London Futures and Options Exchange, the May raw sugar position was
down Dollars 2 at Dollars 186 a tonne in late afternoon trading.
