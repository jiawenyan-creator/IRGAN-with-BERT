FT  18 AUG 93 / Hambros Bank to advise Tube
LONDON Underground has appointed Hambros Bank as an adviser on raising
private-sector funding.
The move is a response to the private-finance initiative announced by Mr
Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, in the Autumn Statement last year.
Hambros is to 'consider the feasibility of the private-sector funding
opportunities that the Underground and London Transport have already
identified', and 'suggest possible further opportunities for private-sector
involvement'.
Projects being examined for joint-venture possibilities include CrossRail,
the Pounds 2bn project to build a pair of rail tunnels between London's
Paddington and Liverpool Street stations, and the overdue modernisation of
the Northern Line.
London Underground denied that full-scale privatisation was an option, while
Hambros said that it was not part of its remit.
London Underground said: 'This is not a prelude to privatisation, but we
have major problems over funding our long-term investment plans, given that
the 1992 Autumn Statement reversed the promises made in the 1991 Autumn
Statement. This clearly placed upon us the need to explore every feasible
avenue.'
Mr Tony Sheppeck, a member of the London Underground board, said that the
aim was to create 'a decently modern metro within 10 years, reversing
decades of neglect'. He said this had gained 'tremendous support from
business and the community in London'.
The main priority of the new initiative is to raise funds for new trains and
signals, rather than opening new lines.
Mr James Stewart, of Hambros' asset finance division, said equipment supply
would provide one of the main routes for private-sector involvement in
London Underground.
Hambros already advises the Department of Transport on British Rail's West
Coast mainline, and works on several other projects involving health and
transport. It is one of several City institutions to devote heavy resources
to advising on public-sector projects.
