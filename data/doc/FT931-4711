FT  10 MAR 93 / Accountants attack audit plans
THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has launched a
strong attack on the proposals on the future development of auditing issued
by the Auditing Practices Board late last year.
In response to the board's consultative document it expresses disappointment
that the board failed to provide more detailed evidence or to draw firm
conclusions.
It says the primary focus of auditors must always be on the historical
accounts, not on prospects.
