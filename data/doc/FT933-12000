FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Large supply of
short-term plans - In a Nutshell
Only 54 per cent of small business owners draw up a formal business plan
when they start up, according to a survey by Barclays Bank's Business
Planning Bulletin.*
The most common reason for preparing a plan was to obtain bank finance,
mentioned by 36 per cent; to formalise ideas (34 per cent) and assess the
viability of their venture (24 per cent). Only 19 per cent used it to
monitor their progress.
Businesses which did plan ahead still took a short-term view. Twenty-three
per cent planned one year ahead and 5 per cent planned two years ahead. But
61 per cent planned only one month ahead, or even less.
