MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Oscar is coming back downtown to the Music Center for next year's Academy 
Awards, after two years down the freeway at the Shrine Auditorium. Richard 
Kahn, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, says that 
"the Shrine Auditorium allowed the academy to do some new and special things 
with the 60th and 61st Academy Awards telecasts. At the same time, we've always 
had a good relationship with the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and we've done 19 
very handsome shows from that venue. The board's feeling at the moment is that 
we now have two very nice homes for the show, each with its own special 
virtues." Oscar night will be March 26.ALEENE MacMINN
