ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of
the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). Amendment 2 would prohibit the taking of wild live rock in the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states (South Atlantic) from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary
to the Dade/Broward County line in Florida and in the EEZ of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), except off Florida north of Monroe
County; phase out wild live rock harvests in the South Atlantic EEZ south of the Dade/Broward County line by 1996; phase
out wild live rock harvests in the Gulf EEZ off Florida north of Monroe County by 1997; establish restrictions on live
rock harvesting and possession and require permits and reporting during the phase-out periods; and allow and facilitate
live rock aquaculture. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to the regulations to correct and conform them to current
standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) and the South Atlantic Fishery
Management Council (South Atlantic Council) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 



Live rock consists of living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate, including
dead coral or rock (excluding individual mollusk shells). Live rock is collected by scuba divers and sold to the marine
aquarium industry, which markets it as the basis for minireef aquaria. Live rock is a nonrenewable resource providing
essential fishery habitat in the South Atlantic and Gulf. 

In the recent public review process during the development of Amendment 2, the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils received
testimony concerning serious damage to reefs, ledges, and other hard bottom habitats from live rock harvesting activities.
At the request of the Gulf Council, NMFS published an emergency interim rule on May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25344), effective
May 16 through August 14, 1994, and extended the rule, with modifications, through November 12, 1994 (59 FR 42533,
August 18, 1994). At the request of the South Atlantic Council, NMFS published an emergency interim rule on June 27,
1994 (59 FR 32938), effective through September 26, 1994, and extended the rule through December 25, 1994 (59 FR 47563,
September 16, 1994). These rules were intended to slow the rate of harvest, prevent serious damage to habitat, and
prevent geographical extension of harvest until permanent measures could be implemented through Amendment 2.
