FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Treasury plans for model of economy
Sir, Peter Marsh ('Treasury Economic Model may be run by US Group', April 6
and subsequent articles) has repeated the story that discussions took place
in January between the Treasury and the US consultancy DRI about the
possibility of the Treasury contracting out the supervision of its
computerised model of the UK economy.
This story is wholly misleading. The facts are as follows. We announced last
September that economic model building and development are among the
Treasury activities to be market tested. This process is still at an early
stage internally. No decision has yet been taken on whether model building
will be contracted out. No negotiations have taken place with other
organisations about contracting out model building.
Treasury officials frequently hold informal meetings with other forecasting
groups, which happened to include DRI in January, a part of our continuing
interest in techniques of forecasting. But these have not been concerned
with contracting out model building.
I hope this clears up the confusion which has arisen over this issue.
