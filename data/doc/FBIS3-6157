  [Text] Four officials working for a Royally-sponsored 
project in Ta Phraya District were abducted by Cambodian bandits 
yesterday. The 13 bandits, armed with rocket-propelled grenade 
launchers and assault rifles, slipped across the Thai-Cambodian 
border into Site Two. The former camp in Ban Thap Thai, Tambon 
Thap Sadet has been transformed into a land development project 
for border inhabitants under the Thapthim Siam 03 project 
sponsored by HRH [Her Royal Highness] Princess Chulaphon. 
  The bandits forced Mr Cha-on Thongtonhak and Mr Phadung 
Wongsapan, two officials of the land development unit of the 
Land Department, and two temporary employees, Mr Charat Phutson 
and Mr Nak Khathong, into Cambodia's Ampil village, in Banteay 
Meanchey Province. About two hours after the abduction, the 
bandits freed Mr Nak and told him to fetch 120,000 baht ransom 
in exchange for the release of his three colleagues today at 3 
p.m. at a rendezvous point to be determined later. The bandits 
would notify him later about the location for the rendezvous, 
Nak told police.
