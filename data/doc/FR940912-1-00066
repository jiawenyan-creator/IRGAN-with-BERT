Foreign Fishing; Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the
Gulf of Mexico (FMP). This rule would increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp harvested from the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico and would eliminate the total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF)
for royal red shrimp from that area. In addition, NMFS proposes changes to the existing regulations implementing
the FMP that would clarify and conform them to current standards and enhance enforcement.

DATES: 

Written comments must be received by October 24, 1994.

Comments on the proposed rule must be sent to Michael E. Justen, Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center
Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702.



Requests for copies of Amendment 7, which includes a regulatory impact review and an environmental assessment, should
be sent to the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, Lincoln Center, Suite 331, 5401 West Kennedy Boulevard,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) and is implemented by regulations
at 50 CFR parts 611 and 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).



Currently, the FMP specifies a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and optimum yield (OY) for royal red shrimp of 392,000
lb (177.8 mt) and estimates the domestic annual harvest (DAH) at 246,036 lb (111.6 mt). All weights are tail weights.
As specified in section 201(d) of the Magnuson Act, the difference between OY and DAH, 145,964 lb (66.2 mt), must be
set aside as TALFF. As a result, the domestic quota for royal red shrimp is 246,036 lb (111.6 mt) and the domestic fishery
must be closed when it reaches that level. 

Amendment 7 would increase the domestic quota of royal red shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico EEZ to 431,200 lb (195.6 mt),
which is 110 percent of the current MSY. The Council considers this level of harvest to be conservative based on the
present estimate of MSY. Amendment 7 explains that the data for determining MSY are sparse (limited recent catch and
effort data), but that the current MSY is based upon the best available scientific information. The FMP indicates
that MSY falls within a range of values between 352,000 lb and 650,000 lb, and provides a single point estimate at the
lower end of this range of 392,000 lb (177.8 mt). Considering the MSY estimate, the Council believes that establishing
the domestic quota at the level of MSY plus 10 percent represents a biologically conservative harvest level. Amendment
7 explains that the Council intends to monitor catch and effort data and adjust MSY and OY as appropriate.

Final Amendment 7, as received from the Council, did not contain an explicit statement of the Council's intent to increase
OY to 110 percent of MSY, as is necessary to allow catch (domestic quota) at that level. To clarify the intent in this
regard, the Council sent NMFS a letter verifying that its intent in Amendment 7 is to increase OY to the level that equals
110 percent of MSY. Based on the Council's clarifying letter, this rule proposes an increase in the domestic quota
from the current 246,036 lb (111.6 mt) to 431,200 lb (195.6 mt) consistent with the increase in OY.
