THOSE TICKET PRICES 
When I placed a telephone order May 15 for four $50 tickets for "Aida," the 
order taker at a major ticket agency knew enough at that date to state that if 
the show were cancelled, handling charges of $23.50 would be retained. 
Less than 12 hours later, the cancellation of the operatic spectacular at the 
Los Angeles Coliseum was announced. 
Let's say 5,000 tickets sold, each with an additional fee of about $6. Six 
times 5,000 equals $30,000: a good deal for someone?
