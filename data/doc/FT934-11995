FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Leading US brewer turns in
shortfall of Dollars 75m
ANHEUSER-Busch, the largest brewing group in the US, yesterday reported a
net loss for the third quarter of Dollars 75m after a one-time pre-tax
charge of Dollars 565m to cover a restructuring aimed at cutting costs and
reviving sales of its Budweiser and other beer brands.
News of the losses had little impact upon the company's share price because
it had warned investors and analysts about the charge a month ago.
Excluding the restructuring charge and an additional Dollars 33m deferred
tax revaluation charge, Anheuser-Busch's net income for the quarter would
have been Dollars 311.1m, down slightly from the Dollars 318m reported a
year earlier.
The company said beer sales rose 3.3 per cent in the quarter, and its share
of the brewing industry sales in the US climbed from 44.5 per cent to 45.1
per cent.
It also reported record earnings from its entertainment and theme parks
business.
