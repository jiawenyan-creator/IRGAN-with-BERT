14. Reasons for Changes in Burden 


This is a new information collection effort; therefore, this section is not applicable.



15. Publication for Statistical Use 



HUD will analyze the information obtained through the surveys to determine common issues and problems encountered
by community and economic development practitioners in undertaking microenterprise activities with CDBG funds.
Data will be analyzed by grantee type, regional identity and size of grant in determining if common issues and problems
exist. HUD will rely on the evaluation of the survey data in preparing its required report to Congress.

Assuming approval from OMB is received no later than March 15, 1994, the surveys would be mailed no later than March
18, 1994. The follow-up telephone survey is expected to begin March 24 and be completed no later than April 6, 1994.
Analysis of the data and preparation of the report, pursuant to Section 807(c)(4) of the 1992 Act, would be completed
by April 29, 1994 and forwarded to Congress thereafter. 



Part B. Collections of Information Employing Statistical Methods 



1. Potential Respondent Universe 



Two target populations are of interest to this survey: CDBG grantees and microenterprise intermediary organizations.
The data collection approach employs two, statistical methods: A universe of 897 CDBG grantees (states and entitlements)
and a purposive sample of 20 microenterprise intermediary organizations. Telephone interviews for this group of
917 will be attempted and it is expected that 807 grantee and 18 intermediary organization interviews will be completed
for a 90% response rate.

2. Procedures for Collection of Information 



a. 

Universe/Sample Stratification and Selection. 

HUD intends to survey all CDBG grantees because of the need to have information on grantees that fund microenterprise
organizations and those that do not; there is no sampling frame that provides this information prior to conducting
the survey. For instance, if a sample of CDBG grantees was drawn and the survey indicated that few of these grantees
funded microenterprises, it would provide little information to permit an analysis of the effectiveness of the use
of CDBG funds in promoting the development of microenterprises. 

A purposive sample of 20 intermediary organizations will be selected from those listed in the 1992 Association for
Enterprise Opportunity Membership Directory. The sample will be selected on the basis of type of intermediary organization
(cooperatives/non-profit enterprises, enterprise development organizations, financial intermediaries, and
technical assistance providers/consultants) and geographic region to help ensure that the selected sample offers
representation and variability on these characteristics.

b. 

Estimation Procedure. 

Not applicable.

c. 

Degree of Accuracy. 

Assuming a 90% response rate from grantees and that nonresponse is random, the grantee survey will yield very good
estimates even if the proportion of grantees who fund microenterprises is small. The sample of intermediary organizations
is not a statistical sample.
