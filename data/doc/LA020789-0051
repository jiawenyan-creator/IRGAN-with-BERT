Weightlifter Guy Greavette of Canada denied any role in a scam to foil an 
anti-doping test before the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. 
Testifying before a federal inquiry, Greavette contradicted earlier testimony 
by former teammate Jacques Demers that he was one of four athletes who 
attempted to beat the test last September in Vancouver by having "clean" urine 
injected into their bladders. 
Greavette said Demers and two other weightlifters, David Bolduc of Montreal and 
Paramjit Gill, like Greavette of British Columbia, were mistaken when they 
testified last week that Greavette was at a meeting where the plan to inject 
urine into the athletes' bladders was discussed. 
Demers, Bolduc and Gill all failed the test despite the urine injection scheme.
