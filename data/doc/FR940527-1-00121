 

C. DRG Relative Weights



As discussed in section II of the preamble, we have developed a classification system for all hospital discharges,
assigning them into DRGs, and have developed relative weights for each DRG that are intended to reflect the resource
utilization of cases in each DRG relative to Medicare cases in other DRGs. The intermediary makes an adjustment to
the prospective payment rate by multiplying the standardized amount by the relative weight for the DRG to which the
discharge is assigned.

Table 5 of section V of this addendum contains the relative weights that we propose to use for discharges occurring
in FY 1995. These factors have been recalibrated as explained in section II of the preamble.



D. Calculation of Prospective Payment Rates for FY 1995



General Formula for Calculation of Prospective Payment Rates for FY 1995



Prospective payment rate for all hospitals located outside Puerto Rico except sole community hospitals=Federal
rate.

Prospective payment rate for sole community hospitals=Whichever of the following rates yields the greatest aggregate
payment: 100 percent of the Federal rate, 100 percent of the FY 1982 hospital-specific rate, or 100 percent of the FY
1987 hospital-specific rate.



Prospective payment rate for Puerto Rico=75 percent of the Puerto Rico rate+25 percent of a discharge-weighted average
of the large urban, other urban, and rural national rates.



1. Federal Rate



For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994 and before October 1, 1995, except for sole community hospitals
and hospitals in Puerto Rico, the hospital's rate is comprised exclusively of the Federal national rate.

The Federal rates are determined as follows:

Step 1_Select the appropriate national adjusted standardized amount considering the type of hospital and designation
of the hospital as large urban or other (see Tables 1a and 1b, section V of this addendum).

Step 2_Multiply the labor-related portion of the standardized amount by the applicable wage index for the geographic
area in which the hospital is located (see Tables 4a, 4b, and 4c, section V of this addendum).

Step 3_For hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii, multiply the nonlabor-related portion of the standardized amount by the
appropriate cost-of-living adjustment factor.

Step 4_Add the amount from Step 2 and the nonlabor-related portion of the standardized amount (adjusted if appropriate
under Step 3).

Step 5_Multiply the final amount from Step 4 by the relative weight corresponding to the appropriate DRG (see Table
5, section V of this addendum).



2. Hospital-Specific Rate (Applicable Only to Sole Community Hospitals)



Sections 1886(d)(5)(D)(i) and (b)(3)(C) of the Act provide that sole community hospitals are paid based on whichever
of the following rates yields the greatest aggregate payment: the Federal rate, the updated hospital-specific rate
based on FY 1982 cost per discharge, or the updated hospital-specific rate based on FY 1987 cost per discharge.

Hospital-specific rates have been determined for each of these hospitals based on both the FY 1982 cost per discharge
and the FY 1987 cost per discharge. For a more detailed discussion of the calculation of the FY 1982 hospital-specific
rate and the FY 1987 hospital-specific rate, we refer the reader to the September 1, 1983 interim final rule (48 FR 39772);
the April 20, 1990 final rule with comment (55 FR 15150); and the September 4, 1990 final rule (55 FR 35994).
