FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional swells Wiggins Grp losses
Wiggins Group, the property developer and housebuilder, reported increased
losses in the six months to September 30, though the increase was steepened
by a Pounds 752,000 exceptional loss relating to provisions against the
group's development sites.
Pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 1.76m, against Pounds 889,000 in the
corresponding period and Pounds 2.54m in the year to March 31.
Turnover declined to Pounds 5.22m (Pounds 6.92m) and, despite lower
administrative expenses of Pounds 326,000 (Pounds 531,000), operating losses
were Pounds 239,000 (profits Pounds 102,000). After the exceptional,
operating losses on discontinued activities came to Pounds 1.04m, while
continuing businesses were in the black with Pounds 51,000.
Mr Stephen Hayklan, chairman, blamed high debt servicing and closure costs
for the losses. He said that there were signs of improvement in the demand
for new houses in the east Midlands, though the south-west operations had
been discontinued. Demand for industrial buildings had not improved.
An extraordinary general meeting has been called for February 26, to address
the fact that, with the continued losses, the group's net assets had been
reduced to less than half of its capital.
Losses per share emerged at 11.1p (5.6p).
