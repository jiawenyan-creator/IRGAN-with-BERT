and Valparaiso, in Kosciusko, Marshall, Starke, La Porte and 
Porter Counties, IN 



The Commission has found that the public convenience and necessity permit Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail),
to abandon its 61-mile rail line known as the Fort Wayne Line, from milepost 363.0 near Warsaw to milepost 424.0 near
Valparaiso, in Kosciusko, Marshall, Starke, La Porte and Porter Counties, IN. 
A certificate will be issued authorizing abandonment unless within 15 days after publication of this notice the Commission
finds that: (1) A financially responsible person has offered financial assistance (through subsidy or purchase)
to enable rail service to continue; and (2) it is likely that such assistance would fully compensate Conrail. 
Requests for public use conditions must be filed with the Commission and Conrail within 10 days after publication.

Any offers of financial assistance must be filed with the Commission and Conrail no later than 10 days from the date
of publication of this Notice. The following notation must be typed in bold face on the lower left-hand corner of the
envelope containing the offer: ``Section of Legal Counsel, AB-OFA''. Any offer previously made must be remade within
this 10-day period. 

Information and procedures regarding financial assistance for continued rail service are contained in 49 U.S.C.
10905 and 49 CFR 1152.27. Requests for public use conditions must conform with 49 CFR 1152.28(a)(2).
