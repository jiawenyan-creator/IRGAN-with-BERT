SHORT TAKES; 
HARTMAN RETURNS TO DAYTIME TV 
Former "Good Morning America" host David Hartman will return to daily 
television next year as host of the syndicated series "Realities With David 
Hartman," the show's producers said. 
Hartman, the first host of ABC's morning show, left the program in 1987 after 
11 years. 
His new series is a one-hour weekday magazine show that "probes the issues and 
experiences that affect people in their daily lives," the producers, Viacom 
Enterprises and Greystone Communications, said Monday. 
Hartman will introduce each segment in each day's show and conduct interviews. 
The program is intended for afternoon broadcast. 
Hartman has been an occasional host on various TV specials since leaving the 
ABC series. He will play host to a five-part PBS series, "Seasons of Life," 
which will premiere Sunday.
