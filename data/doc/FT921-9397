FT  12 FEB 92 / Bids sought for Athens motorway
The Greek government is seeking international bids for a Dr200bn (Pounds
606m) motorway project in Athens, to be constructed on a
build-operate-transfer basis, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The two sections of motorway, totalling 58.2km in length, will cut through
northern and eastern districts of the city. They are part of a larger ring
road project aimed at reducing traffic congestion and atmospheric pollution
in central Athens.
The northern section of the 'Attica Highway' will also include part of a new
suburban railway line to serve dormitory towns near the capital. The Public
Works Ministry says the Greek state will contribute Dr70bn to pay for land
expropriations, mainly from taxes on petrol sales in the capital.
