FT  10 JUN 93 / People: Hollidge to head venture capitalists
The appointment yesterday of Ron Hollidge, managing- director of the venture
capital arm of Lloyds Bank, as chairman of the British Venture Capital
Association, represents a break with tradition.
Hollidge, 49, is the first head of a bank-owned venture capital company, to
lead the association. The previous 10 chairmen, going back to the founding
of the organisation in 1983, were all in charge of 'independent' funds,
owned by their managers.
Hollidge spent 20 years in retail banking at Lloyds before becoming head in
1984 of Lloyds Development Capital (LDC).
LDC has recently been reported to have pulled back from active investment
but Hollidge says this was an impression created by a decision to back out
of one particular investment and he is currently investing about Pounds 15m
a year in a dozen or so deals.
Hollidge's deputy and automatic future chairman is Brian Larcombe, 39,
finance and planning director at 3i, Britain's largest venture capital
group. Larcombe's appointment is intriguing because 3i, grandfather of the
UK venture capital industry, has traditionally had an uneasy relationship
with the rest of the industry. Rivals detected a sensitivity at 3i to the
challenge they presented to its previous dominance.
A year or so ago the appointment of the Hollidge and Larcombe might have
been seen as a symbol of the waning power of the independents. Many expected
their dependence on raising outside funds to finance investments would make
them particularly vulnerable to swings in investor moods.
