FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round deadlines expire without
accord
TRADE negotiators in Geneva have failed to meet today's deadline for an
accord on tariffs and services in the Uruguay Round of trade talks, on steel
and on the transatlantic dispute over European subsidies to Airbus
Industrie.
The chances of meeting the Easter deadline for completion of the Uruguay
Round now look remote, and officials are increasingly talking of extending
the talks into the summer, even into next year.
The detailed country-by-country negotiations on reducing tariffs by a target
one-third, and on specific measures to open services markets to foreign
competition, are key ingredients of the Uruguay Round package designed to
put flesh on the bones of the draft 'Final Act' presented last December.
Officials say neither set of talks is likely to make progress until there is
some sign of a breakthrough in the crucial US/EC talks on farm subsidy cuts
in the Uruguay Round.
Talks on a new multilateral code for steel trade continued in Geneva
yesterday and are due to resume today, The Bush administration has indicated
it will not renew US voluntary export restraint agreements (VRAs) on steel
which expire today, but the US steel industry has threatened a barrage of
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits if there is no multilateral code to
replace the VRAs. The proposed code would phase out tariffs and direct state
subsidies to steel over 10 years.
The EC yesterday pledged it would not reintroduce import curbs on steel,
even if talks in Geneva failed to produce an Multilateral Steel Agreement
(MSA) curbing subsidies and other trade distorting measures. Spain, however,
remains the only EC country pressing for protection against imports.
Brazil
EC officials said yesterday that no talks on the US/EC Airbus dispute were
taking place, after inconclusive discussions last week in Washington. The US
is now expected to take its case against Airbus subsidies to Gatt's
subsidies committee.
