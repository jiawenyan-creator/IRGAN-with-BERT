Leading scorer Terry Cummings could return for the Milwaukee Bucks today in 
Game 3 of their National Basketball Assn. Eastern Conference playoff series 
against the Detroit Pistons at Milwaukee. 
Cummings, who has missed the last three playoff games, had a cast removed from 
a sprained right ankle Friday. 
The Bucks, who trail the series, two games to none, also are without Paul 
Pressey, who has a separated shoulder, and Paul Mokeski, who has two broken 
ribs.
