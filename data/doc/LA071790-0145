DUKES HOLD OFF SAN ANTONIO RACQUETS TO RECORD FIRST VICTORY ON THE ROAD 
Playing their first road match in franchise history, the Newport Beach Dukes 
defeated the San Antonio Racquets, 25-22, Monday at the Thousand Oaks Racquet 
Club in San Antonio. 
Dukes Coach Greg Patton said he expected San Antonio (2-1) to be one of the 
strongest teams in Team Tennis' West Division, but the men's doubles and mixed 
doubles matches proved the difference in helping Newport Beach improve to 2-1. 
Marty Davis joined Roger Smith to defeat Sammy Giammalva and Dacio Campos in 
men's doubles and give the Dukes a 6-2 lead. Later, Davis and Sophie Amiach 
defeated Campos and Mary Lou Daniels, 6-1, in mixed doubles, extending the lead 
to 14-9. 
Amy Frazier of the Dukes won her third consecutive women's singles match, 
defeating Elna Reinach in a tiebreaker, 6-5 (5-4), after trailing in the 
tiebreaker, 4-3. 
San Antonio made a run at the Dukes in women's doubles, the last match of the 
evening. Reinach and Daniels trailed Frazier and Amiach, 4-2, but won four 
consecutive games to force an overtime. 
With the Dukes leading, 24-20, Reinach and Daniels needed to win four 
consecutive games to force a super-tiebreaker. They took the first two games of 
overtime before the Dukes broke Daniels' serve. 
Monday's match was originally scheduled for Sunday, but rain forced a delay. 
The Dukes' trip continues tonight with a match against Wellington, Fla., a team 
in the East Division.
