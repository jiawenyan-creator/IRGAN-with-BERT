FT  23 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Gaza Strip killings
Israeli soldiers shot dead four Palestinians, two of them children, in the
occupied Gaza Strip after an Arab stabbed and wounded six Israelis in a
Jerusalem schoolyard. Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labour party defeated a
right-wing no-confidence motion prompted by the bloodshed.
