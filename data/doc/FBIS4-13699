  [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker Hasan 
Rowhani last night blasted big powers' malicious propaganda on 
the use of atomic energy in Iran. 
  Rowhani made the remark in a meeting with the Director 
General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans 
Blix who arrived here Monday on a 4-day visit. 
  Rowhani deplored that countries such as Iran which have 
"excellent and positive cooperation" with the agency and its 
inspectors have repeatedly verified the peaceful use of atomic 
energy, continue to suffer from the propaganda pressures of big 
powers. 
  While, he added, those countries which are neither a member 
of the IAEA nor cooperate with, it have remained immune from the 
pressures. 
  Rowhani said Iran has made investments to use atomic energy 
for peaceful purpose and to develop its technology. 
  Due to the existing political pressures, he said, certain 
countries that own the technology refrain from active 
cooperation with Iran and completion of their projects here. 
  Blix for his part referred to Iran's cooperation with the 
agency and said nuclear disarmament in the Middle East and the 
world was among the goals of the agency. 
  He said the regional countries are expected to have serious 
cooperation in this connection. 
  Blix praised the coopertion of Iranian officials with the 
agency as a sign of their feeling responsibility towards 
peaceful use of nuclear technology.
