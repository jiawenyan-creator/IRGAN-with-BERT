  [Text] The price of the dollar on the parallel market 
dropped 1 percent in the past three months, and the current 
shortage of cash (cordobas) in circulation has led to a dollar 
surplus. For that reason, exchange houses are selling the 
dollar at 6.65 cordobas. Managers of the 14 exchange houses 
that operate in the country and the people who sell dollars on 
the streets are concerned, for they have been unable to make 
major operations due to a shortage of cordobas. 
  Exchange houses have even bought the dollar at a price 
higher 
than the official rate, which yesterday was set at 6.53 
cordobas, whereas in other cases the dollar was sold for 6.52 
cordobas. "The price has not settled since last year, when we 
closed with a selling price of 6.65 cordobas to the dollar," 
Multicambios General Manager Jose Dolores Gomez has said. 
  In addition, the U.S. State Department released a report 
criticizing the Nicaraguan Government for its lack of initiative 
in controlling "money laundering" and drug trafficking. The 
State Department report stated "money laundering" is especially 
serious in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. "There is no doubt 
Nicaragua's tremendous financial and political problems make it 
the perfect target for drug traffickers," the document has 
stated. 
  Nicaraguan Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada denied 
"money laundering" is done in Nicaragua through the national 
financial system. "The Superintendency of Banks and Other 
Financial Institutions and the BCN [Central Bank of Nicaragua] 
follow up every day all the transactions conducted through the 
financial system and exchange houses, and there are no 
large-scale operations indicating to us that money laundering is 
taking place," he said. 
  Taboada said that based on the stability observed in bank 
transactions, there is no possibility that "money laundering" is 
done that way. "For example, there is no evidence huge amounts 
of money have been withdrawn from the financial system 
overnight," he said. 
  Concerning the dollar surplus, the official said the 
dollarization of the economy still persists in the country, 
mainly in sectors that in some way sense instability. "Certain 
people cannot forget about the inflation and devaluation period, 
although we insist the situation has changed. We hope they will 
feel more secure with the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced 
Structural Adjustment Facility], so we can reverse this 
sentiment," Taboada said. 
  At the start of Holy Week, the price of the dollar had 
dropped to 6.60 cordobas. The exchange house Multicambios did 
not miss the opportunity of selling it at up to 6.55 cordobas 
yesterday. "We need cordobas, and that is why we often have to 
sell at that price, barely a point above the official price, 
which today (yesterday) was 6.53.77 cordobas," Gomez has said. 
  Exchange dealer Miguel Angel Mendieta said that before Holy 
Week, the market experienced a dollar surplus and a cordobas 
shortage. "We believe this is caused by the economic crisis. 
People who have dollars are selling them to survive, but only a 
few are buying to save them as they did before," Mendieta has 
said. Gomez said the surplus and shortage in demand will lead 
to a dollarization of the economy. "The balance has been broken; 
more people are selling dollars, and there are few cordobas to 
purchase them," he has said. In certain cases the profit margin 
of certain exchange houses was four cents, but that has dropped 
to one cent for the above mentioned reasons. Most of the 
exchange houses have cut back their levels of operations. 
  Alejandro Solorzano, Exchange Houses Association [Asociacion 
de Casas de Cambio, Asocambio] president, attributed the 
situation to the shortage of liquidity. "The trend is now toward 
more people with dollars and fewer with cordobas. We are almost 
working at the official price," he added. According to 
Solorzano, the chief problem is that the exchange houses lack 
the capacity to give incentives to buyers as they did before. 
"The slow circulation of dollars is hurting the market," he 
said.
