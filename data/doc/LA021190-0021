ONE MAN'S EXPERIENCE STRIKES FAMILIAR CHORD 
Bruce Bean's article was well done and raises our sympathy. We all must agree 
that the Stuart case in Boston was in great error, but when the seeming victim 
of a violent double crime describes his assailant, the authorities cannot be 
blamed for searching for the person so described. 
For most of my adult life I have been giving to Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Urban League, 
Southern Poverty Law Center. The last time I had an unusual kindness done me by 
an Afro-American male was 25 years ago. Since then I have had two cars stolen 
and recovered in black areas after having been stripped and vandalized. I have 
been mugged and robbed by blacks. I have been robbed at gunpoint once by an 
Afro-American who said, "You and your kind have been taking from me my whole 
life. Now I'm taking from you." Another time I escaped two robbers. 
I give everyone "common courtesy and respect" but am tired of being a victim.
