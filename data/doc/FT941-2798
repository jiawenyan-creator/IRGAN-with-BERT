FT  18 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Close vote expected on
Nymex/Comex merger
Members of the New York Mercantile Exchange and the big New York metals
market, Comex, will vote April 25 on a proposal to merge the two futures
exchanges, pending final approval of the merger prospectus by both exchange
boards of directors next Monday.
The merger, which has been under discussion for a year, would make the Comex
a subsidiary of the Nymex and give members of each exchange some overlapping
trading rights.
Nymex has offered Dollars 50m for the smaller exchange, and has projected
about Dollars 8m of cost savings each year as a result of combining the two
administrations. The two exchanges already share trading space in New York's
World Trade Centre. Both are seeking to expand elsewhere in New York.
The plan to merge the two exchanges has been controversial from the start,
and a Nymex official this week gave it only a 60-40 chance of gaining
membership approval. Mr Daniel Rappaport, Nymex chairman, noted that for the
initiative to pass at the Comex, it must earn the approval of two-thirds of
the membership, adding: 'We all know that getting a two-thirds affirmative
vote on anything at the exchanges is nearly unheard of.'
At the Nymex the proposal needs 50 per cent of the vote to pass.
A law suit filed last month by a group of options traders at the Comex will
complicate the transaction, Mr Rappaport said. The options traders, who have
minority membership rights at the metals exchange, are suing to share in the
Dollars 50m distribution should the merger be approved.
'The suit introduces a level of uncertainty about how much each Comex member
would receive in the event of a merger,' he said. 'This potentially could
tip the scale', against the plan. He said that while the Nymex is named in
the suit, it is the Comex that must resolve the options traders' complaint.
