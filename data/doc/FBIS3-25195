  [Text] Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer says 
recent demands made by King Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulus are 
tantamount to a call for independence. Mr. Meyer told the SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] that the king's 
delegation had made specific demands about the future of the 
kwaZulu kingdom during talks with President F.W. de Klerk. He 
would not divulge the details but said it was a cause for 
concern as the matter could redirect the future of the 
negotiations.
