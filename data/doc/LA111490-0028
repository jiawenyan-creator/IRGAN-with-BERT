METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OUTCRY PROMPTS LYNWOOD TO SCALE BACK 
UTILITY TAX 
The Lynwood City Council has decided to scale back a new utility tax after 
being deluged with complaints from angry residents. 
The council voted 4 to 1 Monday to enact a 3% tax on gas, telephone and 
electric bills, effective Jan. 1. 
The council initially had approved a 10% tax, but opted for the lower rate 
after angry residents packed the council chambers last week to protest the tax. 
The 3% tax is expected to increase residents' total utility bills an average of 
$35 a year. 
The new tax is expected to generate more than $1 million next year to help pay 
for such services as street and sewer repairs, officials said. 
The council approved the 10% tax on Oct. 30 to avoid restrictions of 
Proposition 136, which would have required cities to obtain voter approval 
before raising taxes. The proposition, however, was defeated last week.
