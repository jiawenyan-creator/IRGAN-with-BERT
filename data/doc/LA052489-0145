JETLINER LANDING GEAR COLLAPSES 
A Delta Airlines jet was evacuated at Stapleton Airport today after part of its 
landing gear collapsed just minutes before the plane was to take off, officials 
said. 
Delta Flight 402 bound for Atlanta was preparing to push back from the gate 
when the left main landing gear collapsed, Stapleton spokesman Norm Avery said. 
The left side of the Boeing 727 dropped to the ground, damaging the tip of the 
wing.
