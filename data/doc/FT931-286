FT  31 MAR 93 / UN Security Council approves extension of forces mandate in
Yugoslavia
THE UN Security Council yesterday approved unanimously a three-month
extension of the mandate of the international force in former Yugoslavia,
writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC mediators, will again try to
resolve problems in Croatia, where the bulk of the 22,000-strong force is
deployed, which stem from a Croatian offensive in late January against Serb
districts.
