FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: So little time - Rolling settlement
There is only one complete stock exchange account period left until rolling
settlement begins on July 18.
The exchange divides the year into account periods, named by letters of the
alphabet. We are now at the end of account period M, in which the last day
for dealings was July 1. All trades conducted any time in the period, which
began on June 20, are totalled and a single bill for the net amount is sent
out. It has to be settled on July 11.
This allows some investors (particularly, those who have dealt early in the
account) up to 15 working days to settle their accounts.
The system allowing them to settle the net amount is useful for all
investors, and especially speculators who aim to buy and sell at a profit
within the same account. If successful, they can make money without ever
having to put up a penny of their own money.
Account periods will disappear from July 18, although investors who dealt in
the last period - account N - can still settle in the usual way on July 25.
From July 18, the settlement day will be 10 working days after dealing day -
or T+10.
