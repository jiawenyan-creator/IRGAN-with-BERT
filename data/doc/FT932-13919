FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Abbey National warns of further heavy
provisions
ABBEY NATIONAL, the mortgage lender, disclosed yesterday that it expected to
make further heavy provisions this year against possible bad debts on
operations in Europe after a Pounds 47m provision in France and Spain for
1992.
Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, told the annual meeting of the former
building society that market conditions in Europe 'continue to de-teriorate'
and it expected to make provisions 'that could be at least at last year's
level'.
He said the core rationale which had prompted it to enter business in Europe
'remains sound' although it was a long-term investment. But he said the
board continued to keep all diversifications under close review.
Abbey last year had to make capital injections of Pounds 37m in France and
Pounds 28m in Spain after suffering losses on commercial property lending.
It stopped commercial lending in France in March 1992, and has changed
management in Spain.
Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS, said he expected Abbey would make
provisions of about Pounds 100m on continental lending for 1993.
Sir Christopher said Abbey's mortgage lending had 'got off to a good start
in the first quarter. Mortgage approvals were 60 per cent up on the first
quarter of 1992, following the offer of competitively-price fixed rate
mortgages.
He said loans one to two months in arrears fell from 70,000 in December to
56,500 at the end of March. The number of properties in repossession fell
from 9,300 to 9,000.
