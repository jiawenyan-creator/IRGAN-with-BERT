FT  13 AUG 93 / French consumer prices see small July increase
French consumer prices increased slightly in July, rising by between 0.1 per
cent and 0.2 per cent above the level in June, according to figures released
yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office, writes John Ridding.
The figures, which give an annual rate of inflation of between 2.1 per cent
and 2.2 per cent, were welcomed by the economics ministry, which said they
confirmed the 'strong state of French competitiveness.' A spokesman for the
ministry said they would support the French franc in the medium term.
Economists in Paris said that the figures were at the lower end of forecasts
and that the rise reflected the impact of indirect taxes and a relatively
strong rise in the cost of services.
Petrol taxes were increased at the beginning of July, although the full
effect of the price increase is not expected to be felt until August or
September.
