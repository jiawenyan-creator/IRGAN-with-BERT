FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Seagram chief to defend Time
Warner holding
Mr Edgar Bronfman Snr, chairman of Seagram, the world's fourth-biggest
drinks group, will today face shareholders' questions about his company's
longer-term relationship with Time Warner, the entertainment group.
Seagram has acquired 14.9 per cent of Time Warner for Dollars 2.1bn.
Uncertainty over its future plans has been over-shadowing Seagram's market
performance this year.
Analysts expect Mr Bronfman to say at today's annual meeting that Seagram's
holding represents a strategic investment in a global growth industry and
will benefit all shareholders as Time Warner reduces its debt and
strengthens cash flow and profits. Its cable TV interests are already a
source of rising cash flow.
He may also play down reports of disagreements with Mr Gerald Levin,
chairman of Time Warner, who has ruled out any standstill agreement that
might allow Seagram to increase its stake to 25 per cent. Analysts also
believe Seagram will ultimately seek one or two board seats to influence
Time Warner's strategy, although at the moment Seagram has denied this.
Seagram has strongly denied it plans to sell its 24.3 per cent interest in
Du Pont, the chemicals and energy giant, which is now worth nearly Dollars
10bn, and bid for all Time Warner stock.
Analysts say this would be prohibitively expensive, and selling the Du Pont
interest could involve heavy capital gains taxes.
After the meeting Mr Bronfman, soon to be 65, will hand over the chief
executive's chair to his son, Mr Edgar Jnr, 39, who became president and
chief operating officer in 1989.
Mr Bronfman Snr will remain chairman with his brother, Charles, co-chairman.
The Bronfmans own 37 per cent of Seagram.
