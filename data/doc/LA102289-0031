MORE ON MICK 
Concerning the Sept. 24 Pop Eye column's mention of Mott the Hoople and 
guitarist Mick Ronson and, later, the letter of correction from Michael 
Beltramo: Ronson didn't play on any Mott the Hoople albums but he did in fact 
join the group in time to play on and produce the last single, "Saturday Gigs." 
He also played guitar on the last Mott tour. I hope this will put both Mott 
informants in the right!
