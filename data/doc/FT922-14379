FT  07 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris start week
on firmer note
SENIOR BOURSES started the week on a strong note, though Italy fell after
hours as initial projections pointed to a defeat for the coalition
government, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was unmoved by the swing to the far right in Sunday's two state
elections. Instead, the market took heart from some encouraging economic
news and stronger bond futures. The DAX index closed at its highest level in
two weeks, rising 14.99 to 1,734.62, while the FAZ index, calculated at
midsession, gained 3.78 to 706.02. Turnover rose to DM7.1bn from DM4.5bn.
Analysts said that a forecast by the Bundesbank's chief economist, Mr Otmar
Issing, that inflation would be under 4 per cent by the end of the year
lifted sentiment, since it appeared to rule out a further rise in interest
rates. The wage settlement for bank employees of under 6 per cent was also
well received, although analysts said that there was now pressure on other
sectors to settle at that level.
Dresdner Bank, which reported better-than-expected 1991 results and forecast
moderate expansion this year, rose DM1 to DM351.50. Commerzbank advanced
DM3.70 to DM258.70 ahead of its results. After the close, the bank said that
1991 consolidated group operating profits would be up by one-third.
Among car makers BMW rose DM5.20 to DM586.20, Volkswagen added DM6.40 to
DM375.80, and Daimler-Benz was DM7.70 stronger at DM769.00. But Porsche went
against the trend closing down DM2 at DM550.
PARIS was surprisingly firm, which brokers attributed to reasonable domestic
demand and a complete absence of sellers. There was also talk that UK market
makers in French equities had been caught short. The CAC 40 index rose 32.04
or 1.7 per cent to 1,974.77 in modest turnover of FFr2.2bn.
Alcatel was the most active stock, rising FFr19 to FFr619, after its joint
venture, GEC Alsthom, said it expects more deals in China after a consortium
it led won a Pounds 550m order to build a power station in Guangdong
Province.
Other gainers included Michelin up FFr6.20 or 3.8 per cent to FFr169.80
ahead of its 1991 results. On the way down was the drinks company Remy
Cointreau which fell FFr8.50 or 4.5 per cent to FFr179.50 on rumours of a
disappointing response to its share placing.
Perrier was one of the day's least active stocks, as it remained at FFr1,700
with 33,050 shares traded. Nestle and Indosuez said that they now held 57.6
per cent of Perrier's shares and 66.8 per cent of the voting rights.
MILAN rose in quiet trading in the official session but share prices were
later marked down on London's Seaq as an exit poll showed that the ruling
four-party coalition had suffered a serious setback in the national
elections. The Comit index added 2.69 to 511.59 in turnover estimated at
less than Friday's L90bn.
In official trading, Fiat rose L8 to L4,823 while Generali eased L60 to
L29,340. But after the poll, they fell back in London to L4,770-L4,815 and
L29,000-L29,200 respectively. A market-maker in Italian equities said that
prices were being marked down in the absence of any selling pressure.
San Paolo, the newly-listed bank, continued to drop, closing L14 lower at
L12,201.
AMSTERDAM gained ground on strong interest in Royal Dutch which rose Fl 2.30
to Fl 145.10 as tension in the Gulf boosted the price of crude oil. The CBS
Tendency Index ended up 1.0 at 125.7 in turnover of Fl 534.6m.
Reports that KLM and British Airways had resumed merger talks, later denied
by the Dutch carrier, lifted its shares by Fl 1.30 to Fl 36.10.
Heineken advanced Fl 3.30 to Fl 194.50 after saying that might buy an east
European brewer.
ZURICH saw insurers coming to the forefront on speculation that they might
swap their participation certificates for shares later in the year. The SMI
index rose 13.9 to 1,843.0.
Swiss Re bearers gained SFr120 to SFr2,630 and Zurich Insurance bearers
advanced SFr50 to SFr4,220 while its registered sharers weakened SFr10 to
SFr4,040.
Roche certificates rose SFr40 to SFr3,160 following Friday's strong results.
BRUSSELS closed above the day's lows as dealers squared positions on the
last day of the forward market account. The Bel-20 index fell 3.90 to
1,184.65 in turnover of BFr700m. Delhaize closed down BFr130 or 1.4 per cent
to BFr9,200.
MADRID eased ahead of next week's inflation data and the general index fell
1.68 to 248.87 in turnover of some Pta9bn.
STOCKHOLM rebounded from its recent weakness in spite of a rise in the
marginal lending rate to 13 per cent from 11 per cent, following a large
SKr22bn outflow of foreign currency from Sweden on Friday. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 7.7 to 988.2, in turnover of SKr533m after SKr409m.
Volvo rose on rumours that it would sell its car operations to Renault. The
B free share jumped SKr16 to SKr427.
LISBON rose following the escudo's entry into the ERM. The BTA index added
26.2 or 1.3 per cent to 2,052.5. Mr John Ferreira at Carnegie International
said foreign investors were likely to increase weightings as Portugal's
positive interest rate scenario becomes more widely appreciated.
VIENNA saw the oil group OMV fall Sch42 or 4.4 per cent to Sch923 on
concerns that the crisis over Libya could cut off a major source of crude.
The ATX 18-share index fell 17.99 or 1.8 per cent to 980.88, its lowest
close since January 27.
HELSINKI edged higher in very thin trade with attention fixed on the foreign
exchange and money markets. The HEX index rose 5.5 to 806.9 in turnover of
FM7.3m.
