  [Text] Paris, 23 February (MTI) -- French President 
Francois Mitterrand received Hungarian Prime Minister Peter 
Boross in the Elysee Palace on Wednesday [23 February] afternoon. 
  In the course of the meeting, which ran 20 minutes longer 
than planned, the French president said Hungary naturally 
belongs to the European organizations, and France will be its 
supporter and partner in the integration process. 
  At a press conference for Hungarian journalists after the 
cordial political discussions, Boross said that, similar to his 
other French negotiation partners, President Mitterrand 
indicated that the senior French political groups hold a 
favorable view of Hungary. 
  Discussions were also held on Hungary's intention to become 
a 
member of the European Union. 
  President Mitterrand called attention to the fact that the 
member countries of the Union "do not particularly like" the 
special demands posed by individual countries. 
  Boross said Hungary has at least five or six such special 
requests. 
  He mentioned the agriculture debate as one of the delicate 
issues of membership. 
  Boross held out the prospect that the government would 
announce a new agricultural program at the end of March.
