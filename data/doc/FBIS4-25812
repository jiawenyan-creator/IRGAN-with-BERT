  [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
appealed here today to all the parties concerned to be 
cool-headed, make every effort for an earlier resumption of 
dialogue and avoid further deterioration of the situation 
regarding the DPRK nuclear issue. 
  On June 10, the Council of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), encouraged by some countries, adopted a 
resolution suspending the technical assistance to the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). On June 13, the DPRK 
announced its withdrawal from the IAEA. 
  "We hereby deplore the adverse turn of events," said a 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said [as received] here this 
afternoon. 
  "The Chinese Government once again appeals to all the 
parties 
concerned to be cool-headed, exercise restraint and make every 
effort for an earlier resumption of the dialogues, consultations 
and negotiations, and to continue to work for a satisfactory 
settlement of the issue in point so as to avoid the further 
deterioration of the situation," the spokesman said.
