FT  04 JUN 93 / Coal subsidiary improves figures
BRITISH COAL'S smokeless fuels and coking subsidiary, an early candidate for
privatisation, yesterday reported its best operating profit since the 1970s.
Coal Products made Pounds 8m before exceptional items in the year ending
March 31, up from Pounds 2m the year before. Yet the bottom line will show a
large loss because of closures and restructuring costs. These have yet to be
finally calculated, but the company said yesterday the result would be 'much
less' than the Pounds 31m loss of the previous year. Turnover reached Pounds
132m.
