FT  07 SEP 92 / Union to open stall at bosses' conference
THE AEEU electrical and engineering union is set to be the first union to
open a stall at the CBI employers' conference in November and three
companies will foot the bill.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, said the aim was to promote the
union 'at source'. He added: 'We want to demonstrate the progressive face of
trade unions.'
The move is in line with the union movement's efforts to open dialogue with
employers such as the TUC's unprecedented invitation to Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the CBI, who will address delegates in Blackpool this
week.
The AEEU is understood to have won about Pounds 20,000 in sponsorship from
Centurion, the printing company which specialises in union journals; Fraser
Williams, the computer software company, and Brian Beekes, suppliers of
company cars.
Mr Laird added: 'We will take money from anyone except Gadaffi.'
