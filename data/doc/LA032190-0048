TENNIS INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
FLEURIAN, SEEDED 32ND, UPSETS BECKER IN THIRD ROUND 
Jean Fleurian went into his match against Boris Becker with reservations. 
He had to cancel them. 
Fleurian upset the second-ranked Becker, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1, Tuesday in the third 
round of the International Players Championships. 
Fleurian, seeded 32nd in the tournament and ranked 46th in the world, had 
trailed 3-1 in the first set when play was suspended Monday because of rain. 
"I was supposed to take my plane flight home Monday night, and I was really mad 
because I didn't make it," the Frenchman said. 
"So I made it for tonight. Unfortunately, I won, and now I have to cancel it 
again." 
Fleurian said he was being realistic, not pessimistic, in booking a flight 
before the match. 
"When you play Boris, you'd better get ready to go back home," he said. 
Fleurian also had to borrow a pair of shorts that were too big for him. He had 
to use a safety pin to get them to fit. 
Another upset winner was 30th-seeded Javier Sanchez of Spain, who beat No. 4 
Brad Gilbert, 6-3, 6-7 (14-12), 7-6 (7-4). Gilbert delayed his defeat by 
surviving five match points, including four in the second set. 
Top-ranked Ivan Lendl advanced to the fourth round over Uruguay's Marcelo 
Filippini, 6-0, 6-2, in another match suspended Monday because of rain. 
Fifth-seeded Andre Agassi defeated Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden, 6-1, 6-3. 
In a women's quarterfinal match, No. 1-seeded Gabriela Sabatini, who has yet to 
lose a set in nine matches this month, beat Susan Sloane, 6-2, 6-2. 
Also, No. 3 Monica Seles beat No. 13 Rosalyn Fairbank, 6-3, 6-4, and No. 4 
Manuela Maleeva eliminated No. 10 Raffaella Reggi, 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.
