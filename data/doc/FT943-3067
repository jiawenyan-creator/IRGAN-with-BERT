FT  15 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Seoul
posts intraday record
Speculative sales, corporate profit-taking and index-led selling by
arbitrageurs pushed the Nikkei 225 average lower, agencies report from
Toyko.
However, many investors remained absent ahead of today's national holiday.
The Nikkei 225 was down 126.38 at 19,919.38 after a day's high of 20,040.71
and low of 19,906.08.
With public funds quiet, the market was weighed down by domestic
corporations engaged in last-minute profit-taking on short-term tokkin
funds, index-led selling by arbitrageurs, and investors taking short
positions on speculative shares. Foreign investors were mostly inactive.
Volume on the first section was estimated at 270m shares, down from
Tuesday's 339.2m. Retreating stocks outnumbered rises by 743 to 227, with
207 issues unchanged. The Nikkei 300 slipped 1.52 to 289.24 and the Topix
index shed 8.55 to 1,583.96. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.70
at 1,294.37.
Turnover on the second section was estimated at 7m shares, little changed
from the previous day's 6.6m.
Tsumura, a Chinese medicine manufacturer, became the target of speculative
selling, falling Y120 to Y1,050 on the day's third biggest volume of 6.2m
shares. Newspapers reported that the company faced business and management
difficulties.
Magara Construction dropped Y65 to Y905 on turnover of 2.4m shares, while
Sanrio declined Y180 to Y1,430.
After the market closed, Hanwa, a steel trading company, announced that it
expected a large net loss for the first fiscal half - likely to total
Y175bn.
The share price of Hino Motor jumped Y21 to Y959 following its announcement
that it expected to see pre-tax profits rise by 2.2 times in the current
fiscal year. Nissan Motor, following Tuesday's advance, receded Y8 to Y785
on turnover of 2.7m shares.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone moved forward Y6,000 to Y894,000 and DDI
improved Y2,000 to Y886,000, but the newly listed Japan Telecom finished
Y50,000 weaker at Y4.15m, unable to sustain a morning rally.
Roundup
Some regional markets moved sharply higher.
SEOUL continued its advance, in spite of Won25bn of sales by the stock
market stabilisation fund, which stepped in shortly after the composite

TAIPEI was propelled 1 per cent higher by a late surge in financial stocks,
which took the weighted index above 7,000.
Demand for the Big Three commercial banks, fuelled by the lifting of a
three-day routine ban on margin trading a month before shareholder meetings
by Chang Hwa and Hua Nan, pushed the market up 70.16 to 7,025. Turnover was
an active TDollars 69.79bn.

ban to run, TDollars 12 to TDollars 194.
MANILA rose on renewed buying of blue chips and some second liners. The

the counter fell back from intraday highs. The Straits Times Industrial
index eased 1.35 to 2,298.31.
KUALA LUMPUR ended well off the day's high after profit-taking took its toll
of a market still driven by rotational play of speculative stocks. The
composite index closed 4.73 up at 1,173.84 after touching 1,182.29.
KARACHI was supported by hopes that foreign interest in an offering of
Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation vouchers abroad would boost
confidence in the domestic market. The KSE 100-share index climbed 23.56, or
1.1 per cent, to 2,212.33. Brokers said yesterday the PTC issue could be
heavily oversubscribed.
