  [Text] 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Islamic 
Majles, held a news conference this morning attended by domestic 
and foreign correspondents. During this news conference the 
Majles speaker referred to particular features of the coming 
year's [beginning 21 March] budget bill, saying: By allocating 
a greater subsidy to essential goods, the vulnerable strata will 
be protected better. Our foreign currency commitments will be 
reduced, greater attention will be paid to deprived areas, 
villages, the scientific, cultural and defense sectors. Income 
and expenditure will become more realistic. 
  In reply to a question asked by a correspondent on the 
comments made by a U.S. official about holding talks with Iran, 
Nateq-Nuri stressed: America's performance has always been 
contradictory and so far this performance has not shown any 
indication of that country's good intentions that can be trusted. 
  On the main obstacles on the path of improving ties with 
Egypt, he termed the Egyptian Government as the biggest obstacle 
in this field. He added: The Egyptian Government cannot see the 
people's Islam-seeking morale.
