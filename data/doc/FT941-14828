FT  18 JAN 94 / IG Metall warns of possible strike action
Germany's largest union, IG Metall, yesterday warned it might strike this
year and the leader of the largest public services union, the OeTV, said pay
talks would be very difficult, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The two unions, which will negotiate wage deals for almost 7m workers, are
under fire from employers who say wage freezes are essential to counter
problems caused by Germany's worst postwar recession.
Mr Walter Riester, deputy president of the IG Metall engineering union,
said: 'It is possible that we will not be able to manage without a strike.'
IG Metall has claimed a 5.5 per cent pay rise for 1994, while public
servants want 4 per cent.
