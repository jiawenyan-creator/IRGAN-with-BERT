  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (CNS)--According to a national 
work conference on coal production, the Ministry of Coal 
Industry is, with the approval by the State Council, to 
implement a permit system for coal production. 
  The implementation of such a system is necessary in that 
there are many disorders and malpractices in the country's coal 
industry especially in the township enterprises engaging in this 
sector including the disorder in their production, the bad 
condition in their safety and the waste in coal resources. 
[paragraph as published] 
  According to the permit system, coal mines will be asked to 
submit to an examination by departments concerned in order to 
receive a permit before starting up production and those already 
in production will also be required to apply for such a permit 
and those found not qualified will be ordered to improve their 
work, stop their production or be closed.
