FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Daf Trucks in the black in first
four months
DAF TRUCKS made a profit of Fl 1.8m (Dollars 950,000) in its first four
months after being resurrected in slimmed-down form following the Dutch
truck maker's financial collapse at the start of this year.
The figure was achieved after tax, interest and an allocation for
development costs. The profit at operating level was Fl 6.2m, achieved on
turnover of Fl 367m.
The results are roughly as forecast by the company after it was formed with
the aid of Fl 451.7m in equity and loans from the Dutch and Flemish regional
governments, banks and institutional investors.
They cover the period from March 2 to June 21, putting Daf Trucks in
position to make a conventional second-half report for a financial year
ending December 31.
The company yesterday said that it expected a 'significantly higher positive
result' for the whole year, with a projected turnover of Fl 1.4bn.
The results coincided with an announcement by Leyland Daf Trucks, the Dutch
company's wholly-owned UK sales arm, that it had won its largest
post-receivership order in the UK, for 152 trucks worth Pounds 7.5m.
