FT  20 SEP 93 / People: Natwest's Frost chairs LCH
The London Clearing House is rapidly becoming a repository for NatWest's
retired top brass.
Tom Frost, 60, who retired as deputy chairman of National Westminster Bank
last week, is taking over as London Clearing House chairman from Denis
Child.
Child first took over as chairman of the LCH in 1990.
Child, 66, retired as NatWest's deputy group chief executive in 1986 but
remains a non-executive director of the bank.
The big four clearing banks each have 20 per cent in LCH; the Royal Bank of
Scotland and Standard Chartered each hold 10 per cent.
