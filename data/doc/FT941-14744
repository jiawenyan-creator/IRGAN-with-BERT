FT  19 JAN 94 / Mirror special offers rapped
The Advertising Standards Authority yesterday criticised Mirror Group
Newspapers for misleading readers over special offers designed to increase
newspaper sales.
The authority's monthly report, published yesterday, details three
complaints upheld against the Daily Mirror, bringing the total of similar
complaints upheld against the group to eight during the past 12 months.
Mirror Group's 'continuing failure to conform to the requirements' of the
British Codes of Advertising and Sales Promotion Practice was 'deprecated'
by the authority. It said it was important for newspapers and magazines to
stick to the codes because publishers were part of the system of advertising
control.
The first of the latest complaints concerned a front-page item that stated:
'Big Mac free for every reader'. The promotion did not make it clear to
readers before they bought the newspaper that they would have to collect
tokens over several days, the authority said.
The second complaint concerned an offer of four free bottles of Sol beer. It
had not been made clear that tokens had to be collected, the authority said,
or that they had to be redeemed at Asda stores.
The third complaint was over an offer of 100,000 free tickets to see the
film Jurassic Park. The authority said the offer had failed to explain how
the tickets would be allocated.
Mirror Group argued that readers would understand that the first two offers
would be subject to further conditions, and that promotional material in the
third made clear that not all those applying would receive free tickets.
A claim by the Health Education Authority that rainforest trees are burnt in
the growth and production of tobacco was 'inadequately substantiated', the
Advertising Standards Authority ruled.
The claim, which appeared in advertisements in the HEA's youth magazine, was
objected to by the Tobacco Advisory Council and the International Tobacco
Growers' Association.
