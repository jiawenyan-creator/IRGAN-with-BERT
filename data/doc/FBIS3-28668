  [Text] Mr. Yakovlev, head of the Russian Federal 
Television and Broadcasting Service who once served as chief 
adviser to former President Gorbachev, granted an interview to 
NHK. With regard to ultranationalist leader Zhirnovskiy, who 
has been making radical remarks and calling for territorial 
expansion, Yakovlev said that his influence on the Russian 
people is small, and his remarks should not be overestimated. 
  Moreover, he said that the term territory has become a 
painful word to the Russians who lost territories as a result of 
the collapse of the Soviet Union and that if Japan presses 
Russia to solve the territorial issue by using such a word, 
nothing will be solved.
