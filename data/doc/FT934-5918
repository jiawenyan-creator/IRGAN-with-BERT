FT  27 NOV 93 / Major attacked over party dinners
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, yesterday attacked the
prime minister's use of 10 Downing Street, his official residence, as a
venue for fundraising dinners for the Conservative party.
Mr Cook said yesterday that Downing Street was a government building and not
a private home which Mr Major could use as he pleased.
'If the prime minister is using it as an exclusive club to wine and dine
Tory party paymasters, it demonstrates the arrogance of a party that has
been in power for too long,' he said.
Earlier this week the Financial Times revealed that a crisis in the
Conservative party's finances had forced the prime minister to drop a
self-imposed ban on entertaining elite groups of past and potential donors
in the building.
It is understood that the prime minister reversed that decision in
September, after a warning from two of the party treasurers - Mr Charles
Hambro and Sir Philip Harris - that such events were vital to the party's
drive to raise money to finance next year's European and local election
campaigns.
Earlier this week Mr Major hosted the third Downing Street fundraising
dinner in recent months.
The occasions have been kept a close secret because of acute sensitivity
about Conservative party finances in the wake of the controversy about
donations from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
In a letter to the prime minister, Mr Cook requested Mr Major to provide him
with a list of guests who have attended recent functions, and assurances
that none of them has been appointed to any public body.
He also asked for a list of the forthcoming dates on which Downing Street
was to be used for such events.
