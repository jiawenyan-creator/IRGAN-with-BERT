FT  23 JUN 93 / Art sale total exceeds Pounds 20m
SOTHEBY'S secured its highest total for an Impressionist and modern art sale
in London for three years last night when it secured Pounds 20.35m from 84
lots. The top price was Pounds 3m paid for a 1937 abstract painting by
Kandinsky.
A work by Daumier, depicting a washerwoman, sold for Pounds 1.65m - below
forecasts but a record for the 19th-century artist. A portrait by Modigliani
of his sister more than doubled its estimate at Pounds 1.48m.
The 22 pictures from the collection of the late Madame d'Alayer, the
grand-daughter of the Parisian dealer of the first impressionists Paul
Durand-Ruel, all sold. They reached a total of Pounds 4.7m. A sketch by
Monet of a woman with an umbrella sold for Pounds 353,000, a record for a
Monet drawing, to a Japanese dealer. The Japanese were back in the saleroom
after a two-year absence.
The sale of Impressionist and modern art at Christie's on Monday night
produced the lowest unsold total by value - 16.4 per cent - for more than
three years. The 58 lots brought Pounds 17.9m, with the most desirable and
expensive paintings attracting keen interest.
A Renoir portrait of a young girl with a basket of flowers sold for Pounds
5.72m.
Meanwhile, Christie's is to sell the art collection of the dancer Rudolf
Nureyev, who died in January. The Pounds 4m expected to be raised from
auctions in London in December and in New York in January next year will
benefit two foundations established by Nureyev to help dancers and classical
dance.
Among the highlights of the sales are a painting by Fuseli inspired by
Milton's 'Paradise Lost', which carries an estimate of up to Dollars 700,000
(Pounds 466,667); a Roman marble torso of 'The Fillet Binder', based on the
Greek original (estimate up to Dollars 500,000); and a Reynolds portrait
(Dollars 600,000).
