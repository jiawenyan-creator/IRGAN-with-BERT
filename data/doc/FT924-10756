FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels plans VAT ban on bank
gold
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday proposed that 'financial' gold, held by or
in central banks, should be exempt from value added tax throughout the
European Community, reports Reuter from Brussels.
Industrial gold, used in jewellery, electronics and industrial processes,
should bear VAT, which would be collected from the purchaser rather than
from the seller, it said.
'This is a practical proposition that adapts (VAT) in a concrete manner to
the complex reality of the gold market,' Ms Christianne Scrivener, the EC
tax commissioner, said.
'We want to reduce the risks of fraud and the parallel markets which
currently exist in the community due to the diversity of national tax
systems,' she explained.
The Commission held back from proposing any specific VAT rate on industrial
gold, preferring to leave it up to individual countries to set their own
levels of tax.
Mr Dick Gazmararian, chairman of the London Bullion Market Association, said
last night that the association had been in close touch with the Commission
about the proposals so the outcome was of no surprise.
'The impact on the London bullion market will be minimal,' he said.
'Basically we are happy with the Commission's proposals.'
