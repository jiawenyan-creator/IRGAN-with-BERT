 

In addition, the first interim final rule changed the minimum size requirements for several varieties of peaches
packed in loose-filled and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for peaches specified in paragraphs
(a)(3)(iii), (a)(4)(iii), and (a)(5)(iii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes made in column
2 of both Table I for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and Table 2 for late-season peach varieties cited
in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of 917.442. 
The PCC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these peach varieties, and the consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. The first
interim final rule was designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh peaches consistent with expected
crop and market conditions. 
This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revised handling requirements
for California nectarines and peaches, as specified. The Department's determination is that this rule will have
a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and peaches. 
This rule finalizes the revised handling requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches consistent with
expected crop and market conditions, and will help ensure that all shipments of these fruits made each season will
continue to meet acceptable handling requirements established under each of these orders. This rule will also help
the California nectarine and peach industries continue to provide fruit desired by consumers. This rule is designed
to maintain orderly marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers.

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
After consideration of all relevant matters presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,
and other information, it is found that the finalization, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act.
