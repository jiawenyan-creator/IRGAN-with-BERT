FT  12 OCT 94 / HK hard line on securities
Hong Kong's government is to tighten securities legislation by empowering
the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the regulatory body, to provide
reciprocal investigative assistance to overseas counterparts and company
inspectors, Louise Lucas writes from Hong Kong. The measures, detailed in a
bill which will be introduced into the Legislative Council this month, will
enable the SFC to give information to overseas authorities even where the
case concerned does not involve a breach of relevant Hong Kong laws. Mr
Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said the changes had
been prompted by the local market's internationalisation and growing need
for cross-border regulatory co-operation.
