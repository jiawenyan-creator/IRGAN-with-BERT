A passenger who tries to take a gun through an airport screening point, even 
unwittingly, could be fined at least $1,000 under a newly toughened Federal 
Aviation Administration policy, a spokesman said. If the weapon is loaded or 
there is an attempt to conceal it, fines could range up to $10,000, said 
spokesman Fred Farrar. Previously, FAA regional authorities could pursue 
smaller fines against first-time offenders or issue warnings. Under the new 
order, a penalty of $1,000 would be sought in civil court if the firearm was 
unloaded and ammunition was not accessible to the passenger.
