  [Excerpt] A responsible source in the command of the Armed 
Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has expressed 
astonishment and deep regret over what was reported by the 
media, quoting 'Abd-al-Qadir Ba Jammal, who shamelessely stated 
that the Sanaa regime's forces had drawn close to the Lahijj 
Governorate's supply of drinking water and was about to capture 
it. What concerns us here is to refute the report, which 
conflicts with the facts of battles being fought far away, 
toward the Tawr al-Bahah, al-Khattabiyyah, and al-Turbah areas, 
where our heroic forces have delivered crushing blows against 
the invading forces. [passage omitted]
