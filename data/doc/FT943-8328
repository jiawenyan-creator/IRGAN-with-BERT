FT  18 AUG 94 / UK, France in fish accord
Britain and France have reached an agreement over the disputed fisheries
around Guernsey, the foreign office said yesterday. Waters around the
Channel Island were the scene earlier this year of clashes involving French
and Guernsey fishing boats and Royal Navy vessels. Under terms of the
agreement, which will run initially for a year, fishermen of both sides will
be allowed to resume fishing in the disputed areas and confiscated lobster
pots will be returned while negotiations on a long-term settlement continue.
