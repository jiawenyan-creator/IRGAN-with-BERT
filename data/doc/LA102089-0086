SAUGUS AWARDED VICTORY IN GAME SUSPENDED WHEN OFFICIAL ATTACKED 
Golden League administrators Thursday awarded Saugus High a 2-0 forfeit victory 
in its football game last Friday night that was suspended after a Palmdale 
player attacked an official. 
Principals and athletic directors met for six hours Thursday at Quartz Hill 
High before reaching a decision. 
"We were looking for a fair and equitable decision," Saugus principal Mike von 
Buelow said. "We didn't come across any real precedent that was close to this. 
It was just a matter of what would be the best thing to make sure this would 
never happen again." 
Von Buelow said the league will release a statement today listing sanctions 
against individuals involved. 
Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen could not be reached for comment. Von Buelow, 
however, said that Palmdale officials were "extremely cooperative and helpful 
in making the decision." 
Palmdale Coach Kent Bothwell said he was not happy with the decision but 
declined further comment. 
The teams were locked in a scoreless tie when the game was suspended in the 
fourth quarter after Palmdale's Darius Wilson attacked official Brad Woolley. 
Wilson was arrested and could face misdemeanor battery charges. He has been 
suspended from school. VINCE KOWALICK
