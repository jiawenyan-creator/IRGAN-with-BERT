FT  18 AUG 94 / Brazil grants pay rises to quell row
Brazil has moved to resolve a row over public sector pay with a compromise
which the government hopes will head off complaints by the civil service and
the military, but not damage administration attempts to control spending,
reports Angus Foster in Sao Paulo.
The government has awarded pay rises of up to 16 per cent for some
lower-paid civil service grades, while the average military rise was 11 per
cent. The total monthly cost of the increases, which are to take effect from
next month, is the equivalent of about Dollars 129m (Pounds 84m).
The pay rises, partly designed to bring wages for the executive arm of
government into line with those of higher-paid members of the legislative
and judiciary, were less than public sector unions and military leaders had
demanded.
But the government has stressed its need to keep a lid on spending so as to
balance its budget, seen as crucial for the credibility of the country's new
currency, the Real.
The government said a further review of salaries for these and other groups
was possible in November. Brazil's presidential elections - whose first
round is due on October 3 - will be over by then, allowing the present
government greater freedom of action.
