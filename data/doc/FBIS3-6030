  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- The chief of the Fair 
Trade Commission (FTC) on Friday [11 March] denied allegations 
that the commission's 1992 judgment in a bid-rigging case had 
been influenced by external factors. The fair trade watchdog 
exercised its duty in an appropriate manner when it decided not 
to file a criminal accusation against contractors over alleged 
bid-rigging in public works projects in Saitama Prefecture, FTC 
Chairman Masami Kogayu told a news conference. 
  The denial followed the arrest by prosecutors earlier in the 
day of former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura over 
bribery charges involving top contractor Kajima Corp. 
  Nakamura allegedly accepted 10 million yen from Kajima as a 
reward for using his influence to fend off an FTC criminal 
complaint in the bid-rigging case. The FTC, after investigating 
the case, dropped the charge. 
  The FTC was not able to find evidence to support charges of 
a 
criminal act under the Antimonopoly Law, Kogayu said. The FTC, 
as an independent administrative organ, strictly enforced the 
law, he said.
