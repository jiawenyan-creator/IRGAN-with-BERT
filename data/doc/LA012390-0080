METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE KNEW BUS DRIVER HAD DRUNK-DRIVING 
RECORD 
State officials knew more than a month ago that a school bus driver charged 
last week with drunk driving while trying to pick up a load of students in 
Encino had applied for his driver's license using an alias and had an extensive 
criminal record. 
But state Department of Justice policies -- designed to protect the rights of 
those accused of crimes -- kept that agency's officials from passing the 
information on to the California Highway Patrol or the Department of Motor 
Vehicles, which had issued Harold Keith Lone a temporary school bus driver's 
certificate, Assemblyman Richard Katz said. 
As a result, Lone, who had been convicted of drunk driving five times, was 
allowed to continue driving a bus.
