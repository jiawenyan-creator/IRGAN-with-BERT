FT  10 MAY 93 / Challenge to Craxi immunity
ITALIAN magistrates inves-tigating alleged political corruption are to fight
the Rome parliament's decision not to lift the immunity of two of the most
senior politicians implicated in the widening scandal.
The move to challenge parliament over the immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, the
former Socialist leader, and Mr Severino Citaristi, former administrative
secretary for the Christian Democrat party, brings to a head a simmering
conflict between the judiciary and the legislature.
It came as Mr Mario Segni, leader of the country's referendum movement,
threw the discredited party political framework into further disarray by
announcing the creation of a new party to contest general elections expected
later this year.
At the same time Mr Giuliano Amato, until last month the Socialist prime
minister, suggested the creation of a new centre-left group which could
embrace former Socialists and members of other centre parties.
Last month the chamber of deputies, the lower house of parliament,
authorised the lifting of Mr Craxi's immunity on only two of the six
requests made by Milan magistrates. A month earlier the senate, the upper
house of parliament, voted similarly in relation to Mr Citaristi, whose
immunity was lifted only on the least serious of magistrates' requests.
Magistrates will appeal against both decisions, taking the corruption
investigation into largely uncharted constitutional territory.
The magistrates, who believe Mr Craxi could be indicted within two months on
the allegations on which investigations have been authorised, argue that
parliament exceeded its rights in rejecting the other requests.
The corruption investigations, meanwhile, produced leaked testimony from Mr
Antonio Mosconi, a senior Fiat group executive detained earlier this year,
according to which Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's chief executive, was allegedly
aware of payments to politicians through foreign bank accounts well before
the date previously indicated.
