WORLD; 
BEDLAM BREAKS OUT AT SEOUL TRIAL 
Hundreds of police and security guards held back vengeful relatives today as a 
confessed North Korean agent went on trial for the bombing of a South Korean 
airliner that killed 115 people. 
"I'm here to kill you!" shouted one person. "Bring back my husband!" another 
screamed at Kim Hyon Hui as security agents led her into the courtroom. She 
buried her face in her hands and sobbed as relatives of victims reduced the 
courtroom to bedlam, shouting insults and trying to get through a police cordon 
to attack her. 
In January, 1988, she admitted on South Korean television that she planted a 
bomb disguised as a radio and liquor on the Boeing 707 in November, 1987, to 
disrupt last summer's Olympic Games in Seoul. She also told the court today she 
had been a North Korean agent.
