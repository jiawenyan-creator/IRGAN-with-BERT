FT  19 AUG 92 / Jensen Car calls in liquidators
JENSEN CAR Company, the manufacturer of high-performance sports cars for the
rich and sometimes famous, is giving up the struggle against market
indifference and calling in the liquidators.
Officials from Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, yesterday made their
first visit to the Jensen works in West Bromwich, West Midlands, to look
over the books and property. Creditors are owed Pounds 638,000. The
liquidators hope to sell the company as a going concern.
Grant Thornton said: 'It is a very difficult business to value, because of
the nature of the thing  - and who knows really what something with this
reputation is worth on a goodwill basis?'
Jensen cars are hand built. Some parts are made in West Bromwich, others are
bought in from component manufacturers. They have a list price of about
Pounds 100,000 and are sold direct from the factory.
But the small scale of production has not made Jensen a serious contender on
the sports car market in recent years, although early this year the company
introduced a re-engineered model, the first significant change to the Jensen
Interceptor since 1983.
Only one Jensen car has been sold this year, however  - to Germany  - and
there are no outstanding orders.
Jensen, which went into receivership in 1976, has been supported financially
for the past 18 months by Unicon Holdings of Stockport. With no sign of
fresh orders, Unicon has decided to cut its losses. Grant Thornton said:
'The company is a victim not only of recession in the UK, but also recession
worldwide.'
About 20 people work at the factory which once produced cars for the likes
of Clark Gable, Henry Cooper and Cliff Richard. The assets of the company  -
apart from a property and lingering goodwill  - are a mass of jigs, tool and
dies, one M-registered Jensen, another in the process of being rebuilt, a
large parts department and a servicing operation.
