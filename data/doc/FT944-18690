FT  03 OCT 94 / US Marines pulling out of Haiti
US Marines will begin withdrawing from Haiti today, to be replaced by extra
US military police who are to help disarm forces loyal to Haiti's military
rulers, Defence Department officials said last night, report Canute James,
in Kingston, and agencies.
US troops are being ordered to stop violence between Haitians when they
safely can, but a senior US official said yesterday that this did not
indicate a broadening of US policy.
Also today, about 300 soldiers from seven Caribbean countries will be
deployed in Haiti - the first non-US troops to arrive since the military
intervention began a fortnight ago.
The new Caribbean troops, part of a multinational force which is to assist
imposing order in Haiti, have been training in Puerto Rico for three weeks.
They will be assigned to the docks in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital,
relieving US personnel.
The port area has been the scene of bloody clashes between factions
supporting the Haitian military and those backing the exiled President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
