FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Loan of BFr3bn for Gechem
GECHEM, the Belgian polyurethane foam manufacturer, is to receive a BFr3bn
(Dollars 92m) subordinated loan from Societe Generale de Belgique, the
conglomerate owning 58.5 per cent of the company. The loan will be
reimbursed by an increase in capital before June 30 next year, writes Paul
Abrahams.
Gechem is also to be renamed Recticel, following an extraordinary general
meeting yesterday. The renaming reflects the group's desire to concentrate
on the activities of its subsidiary Recticel which makes polyurethane foam.
The company has been troubled by debt and made a BFr1.9bn loss last year,
following an ill-fated expansion in the US. Last year, it abandoned majority
control of Foamex LP, its US subsidiary. Foamex's sales were below
expectations and Gechem was unable to service the debt taken on to buy its
stake. Gechem made losses of about BFr500m on its US foray.
