  [Text] On 21 December 1993, Electric Power Development Co., 
Ltd. (EPD; president: Mr. Kazuo Sugiyama), announced that a 
contract had been signed with Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA) for technological cooperation concerning the 
power- development-plan survey for Vietnam. According to the 
contract, EPD, jointly with Japan Energy Economics Research 
Institute (board chairperson: Mr. Toyoaki Ikuta), will cooperate 
in drafting the power development plan in Vietnam. This is the 
first cooperative effort with Vietnam in power-source 
development. In the five years leading up to 1992, Vietnam's 
power demand showed an average annual increase of 7.3 percent, 
and the trend is expected to continue into the near future. 
Therefore, the Vietnamese government had assigned priority to 
the power-development project and had asked Japan for technical 
assistance in the project. 
  EPD is to offer its assistance from December 1993 through 
August 1995, during which time Vietnam's power-demand forecast 
will be surveyed, a power-development plan for 1996 through 2010 
will be drafted, and basic policies for executing the plan will 
be examined. Vietnam's total power-generation-facility capacity 
is estimated to be 3,057 megawatts, of which 54 percent is 
generated by hydroelectric power. With the new contract, EPD 
will be involved in cooperative efforts with 41 nations.
