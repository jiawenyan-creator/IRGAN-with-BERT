FOR YOUNG TRUCK DRIVERS 
Kids and trucks seem to have an ongoing attraction for each other . . . and 
here's a popular toy vehicle that any youngster will enjoy for years. This 
pint-size version of a dump truck is made from plywood, runs by pedal power and 
has a working steering mechanism. 
Other realistic features include a crankshaft on the forward set of rear tires 
(8-inch lawn-mower wheels) and the back set of rear tires "floats" on rough 
terrain. 
The dump lever operates by pivoting on a roller that moves under the dump box, 
causing it to rise . . . and allowing the driver to deliver his pay dirt from 
one end of the yard to the other. 
Full-size traceable parts, detailed drawings and step-by-step directions guide 
you in construction. To obtain Dump Truck, Pattern No. 682, please send $5.50.
