FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Framatome earnings fall to
FFr900m
FRAMATOME, the state-controlled French nuclear reactor group, yesterday
reported a fall in net profits to just over FFr900m (Dollars 164.6m) last
year from FFr980m in 1991 because of the continuing contraction of the
nuclear reactor market.
Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman, told Les Echos, the French financial
newspaper, that, in spite of the fall in profits, Framatome had performed
better than expected last year. The group experienced a sharp fall in sales
to FFr12.5bn in 1992 from FFr14.2bn in 1991.
Framatome received a substantial nuclear order, its first for some time, at
the start of this year and late last month won a Dollars 120m steam
generator replacement contract from Asco of Spain for its Framatome-Siemens
consortium.
However, Mr Leny warned that 1993 would be more difficult than 1992 because
of the continuing economic pressures.
He said he did not envisage a recovery until 1994.
Mr Leny was concerned that Framatome's position in China, one of the few
buoyant markets for nuclear reactors, could be imperiled by the row between
France and China over the sale late last year of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter
jets to Taiwan by Dassault, the French state-controlled aircraft maker.
The Framatome chairman told Les Echos that French companies 'have not yet
stopped paying' for the damage to Sino-French relations. However, there were
signs this week of an improvement when Alcatel, the telecommunications
equipment division of Alcatel-Alsthom, the state-controlled industrial group
that owns 44 per cent of Framatome, won Dollars 400m of contracts in China.
Alcatal Alsthom saw net sales rise to FFr161.65bn in 1992 from FFr160.08bn
in 1991. The group said it had suffered from the strengthening of the franc
after the autumn currency crisis.
The level of orders was virtually stable at FFr166bn last year, against
FFr165.3bn in 1991.
