FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia rises to SKr1.3bn
Pharmacia, the Swedish drugs group being privatised next month, yesterday
announced a big jump in first-quarter profits, after benefiting from higher
sales and cost-cutting.
Profits after financial items amounted to SKr1.33bn (Dollars 172m), compared
with SKr486m in the same 1993 period.
The result was better than expected, and the A shares rose SKr3 to SKr130.
Analysts said the figures should assist the privatisation process, with the
government planning to sell a 47.4 per cent voting stake in the group. The
disposal is expected to raise around SKr10bn in Sweden's biggest
privatisation.
Group turnover rose 3 per cent, to SKr6.78bn. However, on an underlying
basis the increase was 6 per cent. Operating costs fell 2 per cent to
SKr5.12bn from SKr5.22bn.
The group benefited from one-off gains of SKr183m, compared with costs of
SKr308m a year ago. This helped lift operating profit to SKr1.38bn from
SKr577m. Excluding one-off items, operating profits were 35 per cent higher
at SKr1.19bn.
Financial costs, linked mainly to the financing of the group's acquisition
of the Italian drugs group Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Fice), dragged the overall
figures down. Net financial expense amounted to SKr49m, compared with
financial income of SKr170m in the first quarter of 1993.
The results contained some disappointments. Sales of the growth hormone
Genotropin fell 4 per cent to SKr654m from SKr684m, as good sales in the UK,
German and Italian markets were offset by weakness in Spain and Australia.
Healon, a substance used in eye surgery, saw sales drop 6 per cent to
SKr369m from SKr393m. There were lower sales in the US, Spanish and Nordic
markets. By contrast, anti-cancer drugs Farmorubicin and Adriamycin lifted
sales by 18 per cent.
