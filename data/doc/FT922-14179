FT  08 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Italy
There are two possible reactions to Italy's fragmented election result. One
is excitement that the old order has been broken, that the humbling of the
Christian Democrats will actually hasten electoral reform, reduce the size
of the public sector and increase the hitherto snail-like pace of
privatisation. The other is apprehension that the drawn-out process of inter
party negotiations - followed perhaps by fresh elections - will further
delay attempts to tackle the deficit and bring the country into line with
the monetary union disciplines prescribed by the Maastricht summit.
Judging by yesterday's 2 per cent fall in the Comit index - which itself
followed a weak performance in the month leading up to the poll - the market
seems inclined to the gloomier view. A longish period of reflection looks
inevitable, while the dwindling chances of a new government being led by Mr
Craxi - the Socialist leader with a reputation for getting things done who
was prime minister when local equities spectacularly outperformed in the mid
1980s - will hardly help short term sentiment.
Given the relatively small size of the domestic mutual fund industry - and
local investors' continued preference for bonds - Italy badly needs to
rekindle the enthusiasm of foreigners. Bourse reforms have failed to make
much outside impact, while the recent spate of poor company results is
hardly an inducement. The market remains attractive for individual stock
pickers, but bigger international fund weightings must await clearer
evidence of a political sea change.
