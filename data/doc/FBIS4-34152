  [Text] All parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies 
signed a political declaration aimed at rejecting the 
extraterritorial application of any country's law as well as to 
express their support for any initiative aimed at suppressing 
the trade blockade against Cuba. 
  Fernando Charleston, a Institutional Revolutionary Party 
deputy, proceeded to read the declaration endorsing the Chamber 
of Deputies' support for the Cuban people in their quest for 
sovereignty and self-determination.
