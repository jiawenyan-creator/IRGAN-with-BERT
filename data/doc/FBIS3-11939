  [Text] Cuban Consul General to Chile Humberto Hernandez has 
stressed the development of mutual economic and commercial ties 
between Cuba and Chile, notwithstanding the lack of full 
diplomatic relations. In an interview granted to the Chilean 
newspaper LA EPOCA, Hernandez said that since the restoration of 
consular ties two years ago, Chilean businessmen have expressed 
increasing interest in investing capital in the Caribbean island. 
  The Cuban consul to Chile explained that Chileans are 
already 
investing in citrus production and that there are good prospects 
for tourism and companies to supply various products to the 
Caribbean nation. Concerning the reestablishment of full 
diplomatic ties at ambassadorial level, Hernandez insisted that 
the Cuban Government maintains a stance of absolute patience, 
waiting for the Chileans to take the first step.
