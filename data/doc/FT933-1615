FT  23 SEP 93 / Union leaders pull back in public pay fight
UNION leaders representing 5.5m public-sector workers drew back yesterday
from any immediate conflict over the government's tight public-sector pay
policy.
Instead, after a two-hour meeting at the Trades Union Congress, they agreed
to launch a campaign against the policy. The campaign will involve a rally
early next year, lobbying of Conservative MPs in marginal constituencies and
efforts to persuade the public of the justice of their claim.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the 45 public sector unions had
lit a 'slow burning fuse'. Industrial disruption could not be ruled out next
spring and early next summer when the main public-sector pay deals are
normally negotiated.
Union leaders were keen yesterday to play down suggestions of conflict. They
said they did not intend to fall into a 'trap' set by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, by calling for disruption that would antagonise the public and
unite next month's Conservative party conference.
The TUC is to encourage public-sector unions to co-ordinate their pay
claims.
Mr Monks said: 'We are starting what will be a long campaign that could
leave the government badly bruised at the end of it.'
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public services union,
said four Civil Service unions would take strike action on November 5 in
protest at market testing in the Civil Service. On November 20, he added, a
demonstration was planned in defence of the National Health Service.
Yesterday's meeting brought none of the calls for action and predictions of
chaos in the public sector heard at the Trades Union Congress a fortnight
ago.
