As many as 7,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Port Arthur, Tex., 
after a leaking crude oil tank at a Chevron plant created a noxious cloud of 
gas with traces of hydrogen sulfide, officials said. More than 20 people were 
treated and released at hospitals for minor reactions, most for fume 
inhalation, officials said. Chevron officials said they were monitoring air 
quality in the area of the leak since it was discovered in the early afternoon, 
and described the gaseous release as a minimum health hazard. "Most crude oils 
in Texas have sulfur in them, and that means their gas containes hydrogen 
sulfide . . ." said Chevron spokesman Art Spencer. Hydrogen sulfide is a 
flammable, poisonous gas with an odor of rotten eggs. The odor got so strong 
that officials decided to evacuate people downwind of it, he said.
