<F P=106> ["UN and United States Urged To Take Measures for Peaceful </F>
Solution of Nuclear Issue" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The Committee of 
Korean Veterans in Moscow on April 7 sent letters to the United 
Nations Security Council and the U.S. President concerning the 
tensions on the Korean peninsula growing due to the anti-DPRK 
nuclear racket of the United States and its followers. 
  The letter to the UN Security Council said that the 
situation 
on the Korean peninsula has reached a brink of war owing to the 
moves of the reactionary forces of the United States, Japan and 
South Korea. This poses a threat to peace in northeast Asia and 
the rest of the world, it added. 
  It appealed to the UN Security Council to cooly and 
prudently 
assess the situation created around the Korean peninsula and 
exert its utmost efforts to solve the nuclear issue in this 
region in a peaceful way. 
  It demanded that the United Nations take the stand of 
impartiality and rectify its policy toward the DPRK. 
  The letter to the U.S. President said if the U.S. President 
really intends to call upon the governments of all countries to 
observe human rights and democracy, humanitarianism and moral 
freedom, he should immediately take practical and necessary 
measures and decisions to prevent the aggravation of the tense 
situation surrounding the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, give up 
the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, 
stop the maneuvers of U.S. aircraft carriers and warships and 
cancel the deployment of Patriot missiles.
