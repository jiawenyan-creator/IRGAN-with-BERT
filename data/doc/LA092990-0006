VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
TEACHER OF THE YEAR BRINGS PAST TO LIFE 
A Thousand Oaks social studies teacher who conducts mock trials in her 
classroom -- with real attorneys and judges presiding -- has been named Ventura 
County teacher of the year, school officials said Friday. 
Joan Gorner of Colina Intermediate School was selected by a committee from the 
county superintendent's office from a field of four nominees, Assistant Supt. 
Chuck Weis said. 
"I try to make learning fun," Gorner, 52, said. "I don't ever want to be bored, 
and I don't want to bore my students." 
One of Gorner's favorite projects is to have students build medieval weapons 
and castles, and then quiz them about their historical significance. 
A 30-year veteran of teaching, Gorner has been in Thousand Oaks schools for 25 
years. She has been at Colina Intermediate School for 17 years and now oversees 
classes of seventh- and eighth-grade students. 
She has taught English, Spanish, science, mathematics and home economics from 
elementary to high school grades. 
Colina Principal Michael Waters said students are excited by Gorner's spirited 
approach to history. 
"History is a story well-told, and she's the kind of person who can teach 
history as a story," Waters said. "Students just love her." 
Gorner has also participated in Conejo Valley Unified School District 
committees that offer tips to other teachers on how to improve instruction. 
"I haven't turned education upside down," Gorner said. "It's just innovations 
that I've made for my own classes, and people have picked them up." 
Gorner's name will be submitted to the state Department of Education as the 
county's nominee for Teacher of the Year, Weis said. The state announces the 
winner Oct. 31. PSYCHE PASCUAL
