  [Text] According to a SRNA report, the 40th session of the 
assembly of the republic of Srpska opened in Brcko somewhat 
after 1800 today. As has been learned, in the first part of the 
session, which is being held behind closed doors, deputies are 
discussing the current issues of interior and foreign policy of 
the republic of Srpska. Although it was planned for 1600, the 
session of the club of deputies has not been held. 
  [Begin Darko Milosevic recording] During the afternoon, 
assembly commissions held their sessions. Afterward, the 
Serbian Democratic Party club of deputies opened the session 
that is still under way. 
  The attention of the large number of domestic and foreign 
journalists is attracted by the announced debate on the current 
problems of war and peace in this region. The item on the 
agenda described as the assessment and analysis of the 
political-security situation is the only one dealing with this 
issue because, in an extremely long agenda consisting of 68 
items, most attention is devoted, conditionally speaking, to 
peacetime topics. It is also hinted here that the president of 
the republic may acquaint the deputies with the name of the new 
prime minister designate of the republic of Srpska. 
  It is completely calm in Brcko today and the life is going 
on 
in the usual, normal way. [end recording]
