  [Text] People wishing to visit the Netherlands for a period 
of more than three months are to apply for a residence permit at 
a Dutch Embassy or consulate. The measure will take effect on 1 
April. If such a permit cannot be produced at a Dutch port of 
entry, access to the Netherlands will be refused and no legal 
applications for admission to the country will be heard. 
  The Dutch Justice Ministry has introduced the measure in 
order to tighten its immigration policy further. At the moment, 
it's common practice among foreigners wishing to enter the 
Netherlands to apply for residence permits after arrival in the 
country. The measure does not apply to nationals of other West 
European countries and the United States, nor to refugees.
