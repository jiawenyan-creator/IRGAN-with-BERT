FT  18 MAR 92 / Wakeham move on power prices attacked
ATTEMPTS by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, to curb increases in
electricity bills for industrial users have been 'an abject failure,'
according to large power consumers including Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK
foods group, and Blue Circle, the cement and aggregates group.
The companies, which belong to the Major Energy Users' Council, a lobbying
group, yesterday wrote to Mr Wakeham saying his efforts to prevent increases
of 15 per cent or more in April electricity bills had not helped.
Earlier this month Mr Wakeham asked Nuclear Electric, the state-owned
operator of the nuclear stations in England and Wales, to sell cheaper power
to industry. Although Nuclear Electric dropped its price last week, the
council said it was still far too high.
'Nobody has taken up the offer as far as we are aware,' said Mr Neil
Tribick, vice-chairman of the council's electricity group.
Mr Tribick said Nuclear Electric's new price of 2.3p per unit plus an
inflation adjustment was still 15 per cent more than last year's average
price. The offer also came too late for many consumers, who had had to buy
more expensive power from National Power and PowerGen because they faced
deadlines to renew existing contracts, he said. 'We don't understand why
prices are increasing so much, and are asking the Department of Energy why.'
