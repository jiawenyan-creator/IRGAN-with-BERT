  [Text] One hundred and twenty members of the Fatah Hawks 
have been inducted into the Palestinian police forces. The 
autonomy police are today beginning a recruiting drive in the 
Gaza Strip. Advertisements in newspapers there are calling on 
Palestinians aged 18 to 25 to join. They will replace older 
members of the former Palestinian Liberation Army.
