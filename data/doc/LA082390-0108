ROBBERS HOLD 4 IN HOUSE FOR 8 HOURS 
Two men wielding guns held four people captive in a La Crescenta house for 
nearly eight hours during a robbery, injected themselves and their victims with 
drugs and raped one of the women, Glendale police said. 
The gunmen walked through the unlocked front door of Gregory Fallert's house in 
the 3700 block of Pontiac Street about 1:30 p.m. Monday, shortly after 
Fallert's mother, Betty Lane, and sister, Diane Racey, had arrived from 
Glendale for a visit, Sgt. Pete Michael said. 
The men bound all three while they ransacked the house, Michael said. 
Fallert's 25-year-old girlfriend arrived about 2 p.m., was taken to a bedroom 
and sexually assaulted by both men, Michael said. She later was tied and 
gagged. 
The victims told police that the men injected themselves with a hypodermic 
needle, then used it on Fallert and his girlfriend, who said they became 
drowsy, Michael said. Paramedics at the scene did not determine what was 
injected, but believe that it was a non-lethal dose of a narcotic, he said. 
The men left in Fallert's car about 8 p.m. after taking several guns, a 
videocassette recorder, clothing and other items, police said. Lane was able to 
free herself because the shoelaces used to tie her had loosened. 
The victims described the robbers as a 35- to 40-year-old white with blond hair 
and tattoos and a Latino in his 30s. Fallert, 41, told police that he 
recognized the former as the person who broke into his house in May and stole 
his gun collection. Fallert identified one of the guns used Monday, a revolver, 
as his own, Michael said.
