FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: France confirms Taiwan jets sale
TENSE trade relations between the US, France and China worsened yesterday
when Paris officially confirmed the sale of 60 Mirage jet fighters to
Taiwan, which has also bought US-made F-16 fighters.
The French deal, the latest step in the island's efforts to bolster its
defences against China's growing military power, has attracted Chinese anger
since it first emerged in Taiwanese press reports last November. Until
yesterday, the French government refused to acknowledge the sale.
'The French government's approval for the sale of these fighters to Taiwan
has caused serious deterioration to relations and gravely damaged their
foundations,' the Chinese Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
Mr Li Lanqing, Chinese trade minister, said Beijing did not rule out steps
against the US, which last year authorised the sale of 150 F-16 jet fighters
to the island, over which China claims sovereignty.
Until yesterday, China had given no indication that it might widen its
retaliation against French business interests to embrace the US. Over the
past month, China has ordered France to close its consulate in the southern
city of Guangzhou, the economic capital of one of the world's fastest
growing regions and banned French companies from a Dollars 1bn subway
project there.
The sale of Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) worth of Mirage fighters, plus
1,500 missiles bringing the total contract value to Dollars 3.8bn, is a
lifeline for the prime contractor, the Dassault aerospace group. Dassault
has not had a military export order for four years.
It brings to an end a long French government wrangle between the defence,
industry and trade ministries, keen to further the ailing interests of the
French aerospace industry, and a cautious foreign ministry, unwilling to
jeopardise relations with such a powerful ally as China.
