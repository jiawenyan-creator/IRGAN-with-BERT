FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rogers-Maclean Hunter deal
approval likely to be slow
Rogers Communications faces a long wait for Canadian regulatory approval of
its CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn) strategic merger with Maclean Hunter.
Both the federal Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)
and the Bureau of Competition must review the deal, as Rogers is Canada's
biggest cable-TV operator and Maclean Hunter the second largest.
Maclean Hunter also holds extensive print media interests.
Federal industry minister Mr John Manley said: 'It is by no means clear the
takeover creates unacceptable media concentration and some argue that Canada
needs the critical mass to compete with the giant US multimedia
conglomerates.'
Mr Phil Lind, vice-chairman of Rogers, said he did not expect the CRTC
decision until early 1995, and a trustee would technically run the merged
business until then. Rogers cannot complete the sale of any parts of Maclean
Hunter, such as the publishing and commercial printing units, until the CRTC
makes its decision.
In the past, the CRTC decisions have leaned towards preventing any single
company from dominating the domestic cable industry. The Competition
Bureau's position will depend heavily on the CRTC decision.
Rogers won the Maclean Hunter board's approval of its CDollars 17.50-a-share
cash offer for all the Maclean Hunter shares it does not already own. It
also got an option on 17.4m Maclean Hunter treasury shares at the same
price.
The expiry date was extended to March 31 from March 15 to allow time for the
US Federal Communications Commission to rule on Rogers' proposal to sell
Maclean Hunter's US cable licences for about CDollars 1.5bn. This was
designed to reduce Rogers' heavy debt load.
The enlarged Rogers would have 33 per cent of the total Canadian cable
subscriber base, up from 23.5 per cent before the deal.
The big US cable operator TeleCommunications has 10m subscribers.
