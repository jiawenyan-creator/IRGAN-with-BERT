FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Rights and the Revenue
Recently, I sold my allocated holding of Eurotunnel rights issue. As the
proceeds are not subject to capital gains, will they now form part of my
general income for taxation?
A sale of rights IS subject to capital gains tax, so your question is based
upon a misunderstanding. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13
(The indexation allowance for quoted shares) and CGT14 (Capital gains tax:
an introduction). Although both are out of date, they should help you to
grasp the basic principles.
Selling rights may produce an allowable loss (with transitional indexation
relief), or a chargeable gain (after indexation relief), or a zero result
(with a reduction in the CGT base cost of the original shares). It all
depends upon the background facts and figures and (in some cases) the
taxpayer's choice.

answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
