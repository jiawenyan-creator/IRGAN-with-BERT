DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTORCYCLIST DIES AFTER HITTING SEMI 
A 21-year-old Newhall man was killed Wednesday when his motorcycle plowed into 
the back of a parked semitrailer in Newhall, sheriff's deputies reported. 
The accident occurred at Circle J Ranch Road and San Fernando Road shortly 
after 4 p.m., Deputy Robert Norlemann said. 
The victim's name was not released because his relatives had not been notified.

vehicles on the right and weaving in and out of traffic." Accelerating around a 
pickup truck, he hit the rear of the semitrailer, Norlemann said.
