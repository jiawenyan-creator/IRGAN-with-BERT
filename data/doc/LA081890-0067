GOOD SURFING STORY 
Bravo, yahoo, excellent, great! 
The article about Mitch Thorson (Ventura County Life, Aug. 2) was the best 
surfing article to come out from any area newspaper ever! Perfect! The focus 
was on a transplanted local, local board-builder, (Malcolm's, the best we have 
in Ventura County), etc. 
Thanks very much for depicting surfers as intelligent human beings and not 
going for the stereotype "Jeff Spigoli"! 
You have endeared the Ventura County Edition of the Los Angeles Times to every 
surfer in Ventura County. Please more, more, more surfing of the Ventura County 
variety.
