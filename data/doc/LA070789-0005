Latinos and blacks continue to suffer housing discrimination in the north and 
central Fresno areas, according to a study by the Community Housing Leadership 
Board. The board said half the property managers contacted during test visits 
by a dozen university students posing as renters displayed some form of unfair 
discrimination. Latinos and blacks often were quoted higher rents than whites 
and sometimes were told no apartments were available on the same day whites 
were told apartments were available, the board said.
