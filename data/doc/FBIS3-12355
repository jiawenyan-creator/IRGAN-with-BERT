  [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah, followed 
by remarks in response to a question by an unidentified 
reporter, on 27 February; place not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] This is an al-Ibrahimi-mosque-style attack 
against Christians. The perpetrator is the same and the 
objective is identical. The perpetrator in both cases is 
Israel. There is a clear Israeli hand acting here through 
agents. The two crimes--the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the 
bombing in Sayyidat al-Najat church ... [pauses] The new crime 
aims to engage the attention of international media and opinion 
in an event that looks sectarian on the surface. A crime taking 
place at Sunday mass in a church can take some limelight away 
from the Israeli-planned atrocity in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
the occupied territories, in which 55 were killed and about 300 
wounded. 
  Those who planned and carried out the church bombing hope to 
create sectarian strife in Lebanon. Therefore, the best answer 
to the atrocity is to assert solidarity among the Lebanese. 
Fortified with the lessons of the civil war, the Lebanese 
should join forces with the Government to uncover the 
perpetrators and punish them. The Lebanese know how to deal with 
such tragedies, which can always be repeated. The enemy is the 
same one. We know from past experience that they never give up. 
Therefore, we should build up our immunity by remaining united 
and cooperating with the Government. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that the bombing is aimed at 
the 
visit of His Holiness the Pope to Lebanon [scheduled for May]? 
  [Samahah] It may be directed against the visit ... [pauses] 
Among other things, it may be directed against the visit by the 
Holy See to Lebanon. I certainly hope that those who have 
expressed opposition to the Pope's visit have nothing to do with 
this morning's incident in Sayyidat al-Najat Church. [passage 
omitted]
