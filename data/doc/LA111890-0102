PETE WILSON IN SACRAMENTO 
Pete Wilson has won the battle, but lost the war. The issue to me was a divided 
government. 
A Republican in as governor with a Democratic Legislature. Since that has 
happened, Wilson is going to find that many of his campaign promises are going 
to be derailed in the Legislature. 
For an example, cock an eye toward Washington. Checks and balances ain't what 
they used to be.
