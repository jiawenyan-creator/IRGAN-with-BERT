FT  17 MAR 94 / People: McCready squares the circle
Blue Circle Properties, a subsidiary of Blue Circle, has appointed John
McCready to be managing director of its proposed Pounds 300m Bluewater Park
retail and leisure scheme at Dartford.
Since November 1992, McCready has been working as a consultant on the
funding of the 1.625m sq ft project. The realisation of the project depends
on finding a development partner to fund it, though he says he is hopeful
that the scheme will go ahead later this year.
McCready, 37, began his career as an accountant. After taking an MBA at
Insead in France, he joined Goldman Sachs in London, where he specialised in
property and leisure. He then worked as a corporate financier for 2 1/2
years for the Arab Banking Corporation, which he left in the aftermath of
the Gulf War.
He replaces Peter Nuttall who resigned recently to join Embassy Property
Group.
