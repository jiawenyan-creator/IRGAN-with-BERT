SUMMARY:

 The Office of University and Science Education Programs of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in keeping with the
energy-related mission of DOE, announces its interest in receiving Financial Assistance applications from museums
that will support development of or replication of successful projects, exhibits, and programs in the media of informal
energy-related science education. The media of informal science education include but are not limited to: Interactive
exhibits, hands-on activities, and film/video productions. Examples of energy-related areas within the fundamental
energy sciences include high energy and nuclear physics, nuclear science and technologies, global warming, waste
management, energy efficiency, new materials development, fossil energy resources, renewable energy, health
effects research including the human genome, emerging energy technologies, risk assessment, energy/environment,
space exploration initiative, public science literacy, and other timely topics. The purpose of the program is to
fund the development, use, and/or replication of creative informal science education media which focus on energy-related
science and technology. Replication of informal science education funded under this program or other DOE supported
programs will be considered. 



For the purpose of this notice, ``museum'' means: An established nonprofit institution serving the public on a year-round
basis, providing interactive exhibits, demonstrations, and informal educational programs designed to further
public understanding of science and technology. The term also includes organizations referred to as science centers,
science-technology centers and youth museums. Thus, museums, as defined in this document, are eligible to submit
Financial Assistance applications.
