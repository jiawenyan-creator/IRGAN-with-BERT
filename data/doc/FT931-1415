FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Shake-up at Australian mutual
life association
NATIONAL Mutual Life Association of Australasia is to restructure its
Australasian insurance operations to cut costs and improve service, Reuter
reports from Melbourne.
National Mutual, Australia's second-largest life office, said it would
reduce duplication, provide a flatter management structure, and reduce the
size of the head office.
Mr Geoff Tomlinson, managing director, said the number of redundancies could
not be predicted. The unlisted company cut staff by 10 per cent to 6,600
people in the year to September 30 1992.
Mr Tomlinson said National Mutual aimed to make each of its profit centres
as autonomous as possible and commit each to meeting a reasonable profit
target.
He said Australasian insurance would be split into five profit centres and
four support units.
National Mutual lost ADollars 46.6m (USDollars 31.7m) in 1991-92, the first
year it published audited profit figures.
