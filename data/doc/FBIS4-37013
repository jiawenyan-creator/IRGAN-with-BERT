  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 16 (AFP)--Northern shelling killed 
at least 18 people early Thursday in a suburb of the southern 
stronghold of Aden, hospital officials said. 
  The shelling also set fire to several homes in the Shaykh 
'Uthman suburb, just to the north of the city, and sent 
residents fleeing to safer areas. 
  The wounded were still being taken to the Al-Jumhuriyah 
hospital three hours after the dawn attack, officials at the 
hospital added. 
  Shaykh 'Uthman is about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the 
front lines to the north where southern and northern forces have 
been fighting artillery duels almost daily. 
  The war in Yemen broke out on May 5.
