FT  27 JUN 94 / Observer: Taxing times in Zurich
When last year Switzerland finally introduced a value added tax, the Swiss
government naturally took it for granted that tiny Liechtenstein would join
in.
After all, the postage-stamp principality has contentedly co-existed in a
customs and currency union with Switzerland since 1923. It also allows the
Swiss finance ministry to collect the existing turnover tax on goods on its
behalf.
But the mouse has squeaked 'enough'. As a fully-fledged member of the United
Nations and the European Economic Area - Switzerland is neither  -
Liechtenstein feels it is time it collected its own taxes. Is this a canny
means of slipping in some VAT loopholes, tempting business away from Zurich?
Not at all. 'We have said our VAT will be the same so there will be no
competitive advantage. We think we are a sufficiently trustworthy partner
for Switzerland,' opines a Liechtenstein diplomat.
In other words: do not even think of putting your armoured bicycles on our
lawn.
