FT  12 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report
Base metal trading was largely routine on the London Metal Exchange, as many
participants were absent because of LME week. The three months COPPER price
pushed higher in the afternoon, as sellers lost interest. The market eroded
the band of resistance between Dollars 1,705 and Dollars 1,710 a tonne and
final business was at Dollars 1,709 a tonne, up Dollars 9, with Dollars
1,725 the next target. NICKEL prices lost ground following the rally fuelled
late last week by Inco's announcement of plans to cut production. Traders
attributed the retreat, which took the three months position to Dollars
4,455 a tonne, down Dollars 105, at the end of after-hours trading, to
disappointed liquidation as many believed that the Canadian company's move
would not be matched by other producers. LEAD prices edged up, as the move
above Dollars 385 a tonne for three months metal touched off some light
short-covering. Final business was at Dollars 390 a tonne, up Dollars 5.50
from Friday. TIN prices fell back in nervous trading as the market continued
to fluctuate in a wide band. The three months position ended at Dollars
4,590 a tonne, down Dollars 60.
