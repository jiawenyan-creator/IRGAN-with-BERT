  [Text] The Russian Federation president's representative 
in Tambov Oblast has said he has decided to resign because "a 
bureaucratic coup is being staged in the country, bureaucrats 
have seized power, and the president has been deprived of the 
ability to govern." He believes that the oblast is sliding into 
an economic abyss, because industry and the agricultural sector 
are headed by people who are "unable to work under market 
conditions."
