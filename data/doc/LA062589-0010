THE COCAINE WAR 
I wonder why our government doesn't force Colombia to get in the fight against 
drugs. Why not start with a boycott of Colombian coffee, probably their second 
most important and profitable export, other than cocaine? You can't kill an 
octopus by cutting off its tentacles -- you've got to go to its heart.
