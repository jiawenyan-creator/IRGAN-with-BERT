<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Excerpts] Despite his promises given earlier, [Serb 
military commander] General Milovanovic did not allow the 
helicopter of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] this morning 
to fly over the territory of the so-called Serb republic and 
bring to Gorazde the five-member delegation of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. So the meeting planned for today 
between the Serb aggressor side and the government delegation -- 
which was supposed to take place in Gorazde under the auspices 
of UNPROFOR and the International Red Cross -- has been 
canceled. [passage omitted] 
  Gorazde is still without electricity -- for two years and 
six days now -- without water -- as two years ago the chetniks 
cut off the water system Cajnice-Gorazde -- and without 
communications -- this city has been completely besieged for two 
years and a month and a half now. Talks about solving these 
problems for the Gorazde people were meant to take place today 
at the meeting that the chetniks canceled. The exchange of 
prisoners was also supposed to be on the agenda, as was the 
exchange of bodies, the NATO ultimatum, and the UN Security 
Council resolution (913), which the chetniks simply ignore.
