  [Text] Gosport May 23 TASS -- British and Russian military 
sailors rejoined for the first time after decades of cold war at 
a welcoming ceremony for a Russian submarine that arrived on a 
visit in Britain on Monday. 
  The craft belonging to the Russian Northern Fleet called at 
the Navy base Dolphin in the town of Gosport in the south of 
Britain, marking the first ever visit of a Russian submarine to 
this country. 
  The Russian sailors received a hearty welcome with a 
military 
band, gun salute and guard of honour which would have been 
unheard of only several years ago. 
  This is a historic event, base Chief of Staff Jeff Goodwin 
told ITAR-TASS. During the World War Two Russia and Britain 
were allies, but then the Cold War set in and the base was the 
main watchdog for Soviet subs in the Northern Atlantic, he 
continued. But now everything has changed and Russian sailors 
are welcome guests in Britain, Goodwin said. 
  "When the military make friends, there are fewer chances 
that 
a war will break out," Russian submarine Captain Sergey Rozanov 
said. "I cannot even imagine myself fighting against Jeff," he 
said. 
  During the visit, the submarine crew led by Rear Admiral 
Georgiy Titarenko, first deputy chief of staff of the Northern 
Fleet, will meet with British military officials, tour warships, 
navy bases in Gosport and Portsmouth, and the museum of 
submarines. The Russian sailors will also take a trip to London 
and hold receptions aboard the submarine for their British 
colleagues. 
  On May 25 the submarine will leave Britain and head for its 
base in Severomorsk.
