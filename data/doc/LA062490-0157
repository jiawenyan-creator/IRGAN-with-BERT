THE RIGHT THING 
YAF is an organization that routinely attacks and intimidates young Republicans 
who will not join their organization or support their positions or candidates 
in statewide elections. They attempt to harass Republicans who do not agree 
100% with YAF positions and will resort to criminal actions in their campaign 
to "purify" the California Republican Party. 
When a hawkish, capitalist, pro-life conservative like myself is labeled a 
"liberal" or a "Commie" by YAFfers because I will not support their strong-arm 
tactics, YAF has gone too far.
