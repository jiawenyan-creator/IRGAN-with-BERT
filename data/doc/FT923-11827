FT  22 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Program selling takes Dow
back from highs
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH US stock markets - buoyed by an overnight recovery in foreign
equities - opened firmer yesterday, a round of program selling saw share
prices retreat from their early gains and end virtually unchanged, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.41 at 3,308.41, but
well below the day's peak when the index was 20 points ahead. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished just 0.01 firmer at 413.76, while the American SE
composite gained a mere 0.30 at 384.82. The Nasdaq composite managed to end
4.35 higher at 568.63. Turnover on the New York SE was a modest 174m shares.
After two days of big losses, a rebound in Tokyo and leading European
markets yesterday paved the way for a positive opening in New York, although
the underlying factors behind Monday's sharp worldwide declines - the
weakness of the global economy and high German interest rates - remained a
drag on sentiment.
The market received little comfort from the testimony before Congress of Mr
Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman. He gave little away, although his
upbeat comments about the outlook for inflation may have provided investors
with some comfort.
That left second quarter corporate results as the main influence on stock
prices yesterday. Drugs shares were in the forefront, with Warner-Lambert up
Dollars 1 at Dollars 65 1/8 on news of record quarterly net income of
Dollars 178m, up 15 per cent from a year ago, and Pfizer Dollars  1/8 firmer
at Dollars 75 3/4 in active trading on a 14 per cent increase in second
quarter profits to Dollars 204m.
USAir climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 in heavy trading after British
Airways agreed to buy a 44 per cent stake in the US carrier for Dollars
750m. The news of the deal lifted BA's ADRs Dollars 1 to Dollars 50 5/8 .
Leading banks were also a feature, with Citicorp gaining Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 20 1/4 after revealing net income of Dollars 171m for the second
quarter, against just Dollars 11m a year ago. The comparison, however, was
distorted by after-tax restructuring charges and after-tax net gains on the
sale of non-strategic assets.
Chemical Bank went the other way, falling Dollars 1 to Dollars 36 in spite
of second quarter net income jumping to Dollars 240m. Investors may have
been disturbed by large loan/loss provisions in the quarter.
United Technologies moved ahead Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 53 1/2 on
announcing second quarter net income of Dollars 166m, up from the Dollars
44m earned a year ago in the wake of a one-off charge against earnings.
Motor issues continued to take a beating on concern about the outlook for
car sales. Ford fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 44 and General Motors Dollars
 1/2 to Dollars 39 3/4 . Canada
A BARRAGE of sell orders at the opening set the tone for heavy losses on the
Toronto stock exchange, but the overall market was mixed. Northern Telecom
opened late due to an imbalance of sell orders on reporting surprisingly
poor second quarter earnings.
Nortel ended CDollars 4 1/4 down at CDollars 41 1/8 . Its parent, BCE Inc,
further depressed later by a sharp loss at its Montreal Trustco unit,
tumbled CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 45 1/8 .
The TSE 300 index closed 27.3 down at 3,425.2, although falls and rises were
almost evenly matched at 265 to 264 after volume of 25.0m shares.
