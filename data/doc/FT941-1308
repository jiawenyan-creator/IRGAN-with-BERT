FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ruberoid beats flotation forecast with
Pounds 7.1m
Ruberoid, the roofing subsidiary spun off by Tarmac, yesterday marginally
beat the forecast made when it floated in November with pro forma pre-tax
profits of Pounds 7.1m for the year to December 31.
Mr Ian McPherson, chief executive, offered cautious encouragement to
Ruberoid's new shareholders by saying confidence appeared to be returning to
some sectors. The leisure and health markets, in particular, had begun to
show tentative signs of life.
Turnover was expected to rise this year, Mr McPherson said, although 'it
will be 1995 before there is a noticeable upturn in commercial and
industrial new build activity'.
Contracting orders were about 20 per cent ahead of last year, excluding the
effects of wet weather which hinders construction activity.
Mr McPherson said the group intended to focus this year on improving margins
through cost reductions and getting synergies from businesses previously run
as separate entities. So far, Ruberoid had made cost savings of about Pounds
10m year on year, and a further Pounds 1m was expected to be squeezed out
this year.
Ruberoid was created in November to hold businesses spun off by Tarmac. As a
result, the accounts cover only the trading period to December 31. These
showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 86,000 on sales of Pounds 42.85m.
On a pro forma basis, which assumes all the businesses had been trading
together for 12 months, profits were Pounds 100,000 ahead of expectations at
Pounds 7.1m, on sales of Pounds 232.6m.
Two of the three divisions showed operating profit increases. Cost
reductions helped the building materials business return operating profits
of Pounds 4.7m, against Pounds 2.5m last time. Sales were Pounds 400,000
ahead at Pounds 44.2m.
A rationalised building services reversed losses of Pounds 800,000 into
profits of Pounds 500,000. Sales fell from Pounds 117m to Pounds 84m.
The European division was hit by margin pressure in France and the
Netherlands. Profits fell from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2.9m. Sales were Pounds
1.6m higher at Pounds 104.4m.
The dividend was 1.8p per share. Pro forma earnings were 10.6p. The group's
shares, issued at 150p, closed in a declining market yesterday 2p down at
193p.
