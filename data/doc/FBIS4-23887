  [Excerpts] The French Government is once again ready to add 
to her acts of perfidy in the Rwandan tragedy. [passage omitted] 
  During the whole genocide process, which began on 7 April 
with the genocide perpetrated by the students of the French 
Army, the French Government kept silent. Here she is now 
shouting massacre, at a time when genocide has already been 
committed. 
  For those who know the harmful consequences which always 
come 
with the cruel intentions of so-called cooperation -- if not the 
complicity of France with the bloody Rwandan regime, there is no 
possible doubt that the French Government is once again 
attempting to give active military support to the Rwandan 
Government Army's acts of genocide. The French Government has 
certainly noted that defeat was shame for the Rwandan Government 
Army, so France wants to give a helping hand to this Army. 
  The RPF, with the backing of Rwandans tired by dictatorship, 
is determined to fight anyone who sheds and continues to shed 
Rwandan blood. Should the French Government cling stubbornly to 
its backing for the criminals, the Rwandan people and the RPF 
are determined to defend themselves until victory is reached. 
We really think that the French people will not stay idle for 
long in the face of the countless evils committed by their 
government against the Rwandan people.
