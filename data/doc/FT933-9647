FT  09 AUG 93 / British Army four-day parachute exercise
Men of the British Army's 5 Airborne Brigade check equipment at the weekend
ahead of a four-day parachute exercise involving 4,000 troops.
UK servicemen were joined by 600 members of the US Army's airborne infantry
who flew to the 'battle zone' on Salisbury Plain from Aviano in Italy. The
initial stages of the exercise, named Roaring Lion, were designed to
simulate the evacuation of British nationals from an overseas country on the
verge of war. The exercise was launched from Abingdon airfield, Oxfordshire.
