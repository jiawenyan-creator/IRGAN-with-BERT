FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Eli Lilly result ahead of market
expectations
ELI LILLY, the US pharmaceuticals group which went through a shake-up of top
management last month, has reported a 6 per cent advance in sales for the
second quarter of 1993, compared with the same period a year earlier,
confounding the more gloomy market predictions.
Net income rose to Dollars 346.8m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, from Dollars
340.2m, or Dollars 1.16. The result was ahead of market expectations, though
still below the Dollars 1.23 a share achieved in the first quarter of this
year.
Sales totalled Dollars 1.56bn, compared with Dollars 1.48bn in the second
quarter of 1992, led by growth in international markets. The rise came in
spite of moves by Germany to contain spending on drugs, the company said.
Pharmaceutical sales in the US were dampened by the effects of Medicaid
rebates, the growth of institutional buying of drugs through managed-care
programmes, and continued competition in anti-infective drugs.
Lilly has been hit by concern over its failure to produce new big-selling
drugs, which contributed to the resignation last month of Mr Vaughn Bryson,
chief executive.
Spending on research and development rose to Dollars 470m in the second
quarter, up 11 per cent on a year earlier. The company said this reflected
'the increased number of compounds that are entering the final phases of
clinical research'.
Before the effect of accounting changes, net income for the first half fell
by Dollars 102m, to just over Dollars 1bn, pushing earnings per share down
from Dollars 2.66 to Dollars 2.45.
However, after accounting changes, earnings rose from Dollars 2.26 to
Dollars 2.42 a share.
