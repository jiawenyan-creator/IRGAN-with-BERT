  [Text] St. Petersburg January 10 ITAR-TASS -- Specialists 
from Russia and the United States have pooled their efforts in 
coordinating international global research of the northern 
hemisphere. The first stage of the project provides for an 
exchange in geophysical technologies already tested by either 
side. 
  According to Yevgeniy Guryanov, vice president of the 
Leninets holding company based in St. Petersburg, leading 
research and producing firms of the two countries and aviation 
support groups will participate in fulfilment of the project. 
  Some contracts have already been completed, including the 
transfer of Russian magnetometers to an American company. Some 
earth surface research devices will soon be sold to the 
Americans. 
  The bulk of observations will be conducted from the air, 
using aircraft of the Canadian Air Force and coast guards. The 
parties involved have already identified the airfields and 
traffic control centres located in various Arctic regions in 
Russia, Canada and the United States.
