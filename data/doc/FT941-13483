FT  25 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Stock index futures finished on a firm note, having recovered from a sharp
retreat earlier in the session, as turnover in both the futures and traded
options returned to more modest levels, writes Joel Kibazo.
An uneventful opening at 3,493 saw the March contract on the FT-SE 100 come
under pressure as a leading independent (local) firm, said to have been
acting for a US client, executed a large sell order. The overnight plunge in
Tokyo, and the early weakness in other European markets, only served to
encourage further sporadic selling, sending March to a low for the day of
3,463.
However, the completion of the large order and a favourable outlook on the
economy included in the industrial trends survey from the CBI brought a
turnround in the fortunes of the contract, helping March follow the recovery
in the other European markets.
The early rise on Wall street led to further buying of the contract, which
ended at 3,498, up 8 from Friday's close and around 15 points above its fair
value premium to cash of about 7 points. Turnover was 15,238 at the official
close and dealers reported good activity in after-hours' trading.
Volume in the traded options fell back to 33,801 lots from Friday's 54,500
contracts. Some 11,439 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 6,702 in the
Euro FT-SE 100 option.
Activity in the stock options was light. Rolls-Royce, favoured by US
investors, was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,511 contracts
transacted. It was followed by Guinness at 968, Hanson at 816 and Commercial
Union close behind at 804 lots.
