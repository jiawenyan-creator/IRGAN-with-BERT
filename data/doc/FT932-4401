FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: M Clark rights to fund Freetraders purchase
MATTHEW CLARK, the British wines and mineral water group, yesterday
announced a Pounds 12.9m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Freetraders
Group, a leading drinks wholesaler.
Freetraders, which recorded a 45 per cent increase in sales last year,
mainly to independent pubs, restaurants and hotels in southern England, will
complement Clark's wholesaling operations in the take-home trade.
Clark, which also announced a 16 per cent increase to Pounds 5.3m in profits
for the year to April 30, will pay Pounds 12.8m for 74.9 per cent of
Freetraders, including Devenish's 30 per cent stake and Swiss Bank
Corporation's 20 per cent holding.
It will provide an additional Pounds 5.8m towards repayment of the company's
existing debts from a new Pounds 7m bank facility.
The 4-for-9 rights issue, fully underwritten by BZW, will be at 320p a
share, a 185p discount to yesterday's close of 405p.
The remaining 25.1 per cent of Freetraders, owned by its management, and a
49.9 per cent minority interest in its Francis of Guildford subsidiary, will
be acquired over the next two years. The price will depend on the company's
performance but will be subject to a maximum aggregate of Pounds 16m.
Freetraders, reported an operating profit of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of
Pounds 39.4m in the year to September 30 1992.
Mr Peter Aikens, Clark's chief executive, said the rights issue would enable
the group to continue to expand its business without weakening a strong
balance sheet. 'The group is well positioned for further development,' he
said.
In 'another year of difficult trading conditions,' earnings rose 8 per cent
to 36.2p. A final dividend of 10p lifts the total 6 per cent to 16.75p.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.41m to Pounds 5.36m on turnover, net of
duty, 5 per cent higher at Pounds 42m.
The group's share of the expanding British sherry market, in which it owns
the brand leader, Old England, continued to grow, and Stone's ginger wine
performed strongly.
Strathmore bottled water, acquired in May last year, expanded distribution
outside Scotland and contributed Pounds 460,000 to operating profits.
