FT  29 DEC 93 / US raps Japan over chip trade
The Clinton administration yesterday turned the heat up in a dispute with
Japan over semiconductor trade, suggesting Japan was reneging on an
international agreement, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Lawrence Summers, the Treasury's undersecretary for international
affairs, said during a Cable News Network interview that Japanese companies
were still discriminating against US suppliers and it was time they stopped.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, had earlier called for emergency
talks with Japan after a report of a new drop in Japan's purchase of foreign
semiconductors.
In the fourth quarter of 1992, Japan bought 20.2 per cent of its
semiconductors from foreign sources, but the share fell for the third
quarter of this year to 18.1 per cent.
'This latest share number raises serious concerns regarding Japan's
commitment to fully implement the semiconductor arrangement,' Mr Kantor
said. The accord calls for Japan to improve its market share of foreign
semiconductors to an average 20 per cent.
Mr Kantor said a meeting next month would consider a joint plan to 'improve
dramatically foreign share and access' to Japan's market.
However, Mr Hidehiko Yoshida, chairman of the Electronic Industries
Association of Japan's committee that monitors foreign semiconductors, said
yesterday that foreign chip suppliers' sales in Japan in the April-September
period of 1993 were up by 26 per cent, or Dollars 4.5bn, from a year
earlier. 'The market share figures do not fully reflect the efforts of
Japanese users,' he said.
