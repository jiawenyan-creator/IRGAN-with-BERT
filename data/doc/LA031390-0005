METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY LOSES ROUND ON PROPOSED AMENDMENT 
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley lost a round Monday in his struggle to keep off 
the June ballot a proposed City Charter amendment that would give the City 
Council new powers. 
The measure would give the council authority to override decisions by seven 
powerful and somewhat independent commissions appointed by the mayor, including 
panels that oversee the harbor and airports. 
Bradley has called the proposed amendment "a dangerous intrusion into the power 
of the city's citizen-controlled commissions" and he refused last week to sign 
the ordinance asking the county to place it on the ballot. 
The City Clerk's Office, however, had already sent the measure, plus four other 
ballot measures, to the county on March 7. 
After reviewing the mayor's position Monday, Claude Hilker, an assistant city 
attorney, said that the proposal could still be placed on the ballot unless 
Bradley actually attempts to veto it.
