FT  14 JUL 93 / World Trade News: UK interest in trans-Andean pipeline
FIVE British companies, among them British Gas, Rolls-Royce and British
Steel, are discussing possible participation in the trans-Andean gas
pipeline with a Chilean consortium.
The project, expected to cost Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 2bn, will carry gas from
southern Argentina to Chile's capital, Santiago, a distance of 1,200km.
UK company executives visited Chile recently as part of a delegation led by
Mr Michael Portillo, Britain's chief secretary to the Treasury. They
discussed participating in transmission and distribution work with Chilectra
and ENAP, which hold the gas supply contract.
The project has a target completion date of late 1996.
Mr Portillo said the broader aim of his trip was to raise Chile's profile
among UK businesses. Although Britain had historically been a big investor
in the country, it had been slow to exploit recent opportunities outside the
mining sector.
Chile's economy, though relatively small, is one of the fastest growing in
Latin America. Its exports are equally divided between Europe, Asia and the
Americas.
Mr Portillo, who said ministers had assured him of the country's commitment
to free trade, is keen to speed up two bilateral trade deals: a double
taxation accord and an investment promotion and protection agreement. After
talks with Chile's foreign minister, Mr Enrique Silva, he expressed
confidence that the taxation accord would be signed 'before the end of the
year'.
