FT  18 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises but mood subdued by
dollar woes
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks posted modest gains yesterday, but the wider market
languished as fresh weakness in the dollar ensured that overall investor
sentiment remained subdued, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.46 at 3,923.93. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.14 off at 468.96, while
the American SE composite was 0.26 firmer at 458.76 and the Nasdaq composite
down 1.30 at 765.78. Trading volume on the New York SE was a modest 238.5m
shares.
After posting gains totalling more than 100 points last week, the Dow
continued on its upward path yesterday but the advance was not entirely
convincing with secondary indices lagging well behind the blue chip index.
Analysts said there was nothing specific to explain the gains in the Dow
industrials. The mood of the market, however, has been generally positive in
the past week because recent economic and inflation statistics have helped
to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would put up interest rates again
before the month's end. Equity prices have also been buoyed by mostly strong
third-quarter corporate earnings.
The absence of a more broadly based advance was blamed on weakness of the
dollar - which fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday - and on an early
decline in bond prices. By late afternoon, however, the benchmark 30-year
bond had recouped its fall and was back to its opening yield of 7.825 per
cent.
Eastman Kodak retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 48 1/8 in volume of 3m
shares amid reports that the company was preparing to embark on another
round of cost cuts in expectation of weak second-half earnings.
General Electric was unchanged at Dollars 50 3/8 and PaineWebber firmed
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 15 on news that GE was selling its troubled Kidder,
Peabody investment banking unit to PaineWebber in a deal that will leave GE
with a 25 per cent stake in the securities firm.
Chemical Waste jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 9 1/2 on news that the
company had signed a definitive merger agreement with WMX Technologies in a
deal that put a higher value on Chemical Waste than had been originally
outlined in a July pact. The news left WMX shares up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars
29 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, California Micro Devices plunged Dollars 6 3/8 to
Dollars 7 1/2 after the company said it was investigating possible
accounting irregularities that could affect its financial results.
