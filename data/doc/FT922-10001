FT  05 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Building Channel Tunnel walkways
TARMAC STRUCTURAL CONCRETE (TSC), part of Tarmac's building materials
division, is already working on a Pounds 4.2m order to manufacture thousands
of reinforced precast concrete units forming walkways in the Channel Tunnel.
When completed it will provide four walkways - being fitted both sides of
the twin-bored rail tunnels - just over halfway to France.
The company has now won a Pounds 3.2m order to continue the four walkways
all the way to the French terminal.
In total TSC is manufacturing 84,000 units, 46,000 for the first contract
and 38,000 for the second - each about two-and-a-half metres long and
weighing about one tonne.
Half of them, for one side of each tunnel, incorporate service ducts and
include manufacturing 126,000 slabs to cover the ducting.
Work on the second contract has justed started, for completion at the
beginning of next year.
This will involve producing and delivering over 1,000 units a week and they
will be manufactured both at Henlade and its sister plant at Lound,
Nottinghamshire.
Tarmac Construction's newly-launched European division is celebrating the
start of its first building project on mainland Europe.
The division, which was launched at the beginning of the year, is
construction manager for a FFr30m (Pounds 3.02m) leisure complex in Picardy.
L'Espace Culturel et Sportif is a multi-use building being developed in the
centre of the town of Albert in the heart of the Somme.
The centre comprises a 600-seat theatre, gymnasium, offices/meeting rooms,
covered garden and support facilities.
