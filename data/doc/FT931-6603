FT  01 MAR 93 / UN begins Angola truce bid
The United Nations mounted a last-ditch attempt yesterday to convene peace
talks between the Angolan government and a team of Unita rebels which said
it was trapped in Angola by fighting, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa.
Delegates who had been waiting in Ethiopia since Friday for the talks to
start said the UN was in touch with Unita in the hope that the rebels would
accept elaborate plans to take them to Ethiopia.
