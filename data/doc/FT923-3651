FT  11 SEP 92 / Business faces rising tax burden
BUSINESS is facing a growing burden of advance corporation tax which it
cannot offset against its tax bill in the UK, according to a study released
yesterday.
It shows that ACT rose to 34 per cent of the total tax charge on quoted
companies in 1991, compared with 23 per cent in the previous year.
The analysis, by DM Collins &amp; Associates, a financial consultancy,
calculates that quoted companies collectively incurred liabilities of Pounds
6.6bn for the 1991 financial year.
ACT is the tax a company must pay on its dividends - currently at the rate
of a third of the gross dividend. It can be offset only against the tax on
profits earned in the UK, up to a maximum of 25 per cent.
Companies that derive much of their profits from overseas and those in which
ACT exceeds a quarter of the total tax bill are unable to offset the full
charge.
A study last year by the London Business School estimated the total for such
irrecoverable or 'surplus' ACT at more than Pounds 3bn and growing at Pounds
400m a year.
Yesterday's study called for clear disclosure in company accounts of ACT. It
says the largest ACT payers are the oil and gas and conglomerates sectors.
The largest single ACT payer last year was BP, the oil company, at Pounds
600m.
Business has complained that the growing ACT burden restricts its
competitive position by generating a large tax bill and restricting
dividends. Mr Norman Lamont, in his last Budget speech, acknowledged that
surplus ACT was a handicap to business.
The latest figures from the Inland Revenue show that in the 1989-90 tax year
the exchequer received Pounds 7.78bn in ACT payable for the year for all
public and private businesses.
