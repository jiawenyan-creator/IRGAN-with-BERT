  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] 
leaders Saturday [25 June] condemned "terrorism" in Algeria and 
urged the "rigorous pursuit of the national dialogue and the 
process of structural reform" there. 
  Closing a two-day summit of EU leaders here, the 12 EU 
nations said they were following the situation in Algeria 
closely and "condemn all acts of terrorism and violations of 
human rights, both against Algerians and foreign citizens." 
  Dozens of foreigners have been killed in Algeria in the past 
two years since fighting began between Islamic fundamentalists 
and a military backed regime. 
  The EU leaders said in a statement the pursuit of reform was 
"essential for the liberalization of the Algerian economy and 
its better integration into the world economy." 
  They also invited EU finance ministers to urgently examine a 
proposed European Commission ECU200 million (240 million dollar) 
loan to Algeria.
