Simmons Sues Lockheed: Fulfilling a threat he made Monday, Texas investor 
Harold C. Simmons filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles 
alleging that Lockheed's recent corporate election was illegal and unfair. 
Simmons, who lost his proxy fight for control of Lockheed, claims that shares 
from a Lockheed employee stock ownership plan were illegally and improperly 
used to ensure victory by the company's incumbent slate of directors over 
Simmons' rival slate. "This action seeks to restore integrity to the recent 
election of Lockheed's board of directors and to ensure integrity in future 
elections," Simmons said in his lawsuit. The suit was filed on behalf of 
Houston-based NL Industries, which Simmons controls.
