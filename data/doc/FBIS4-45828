  [Text] Xiamen, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Xiamen will never 
sacrifice the environment for economic benefits, Hong Rongshi, 
mayor of the special economic zone in east China's Fujian 
Province, said today. 
  A city whose population has doubled and whose economy has 
grown more than twelve-fold, Xiamen has maintained its 
environmental level as it was a decade ago, and has built a 
series of pollution control projects. 
  Known as a seaside resort, Xiamen has allocated its island, 
mainland and suburbs different industries for attracting 
overseas investment, so as to attain simultaneous development of 
economy and environment. 
  The city is now a major attraction for overseas investment 
and for Chinese and foreign tourists. Its air pollution is 
under control and its water quality is among the country's best.
