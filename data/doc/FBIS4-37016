  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has approved a 
15-million shekel aid package to Jordan Valley settlements. The 
aid will be given as a loan for five years. Our correspondent 
Gil Litman reports that 3-million shekels of this sum will be 
transferred to the settlers of Na'ama, who chained themselves to 
the border fence earlier this week to protest the fact that the 
government is not aiding them. The demands of the Jordan Valley 
settlers have now been fully met. The head of the Jordan Valley 
Regional Council thanked the prime minister, adding this aid 
proves that Rabin supports the strengthening the Jordan Valley 
settlements.
