FT  25 MAY 93 / Budget reform idea 'inadequate'
GOVERNMENT proposals for reforming the budget make no concessions to
'widespread' demands for better consultation on taxation issues, a cross
party report said yesterday.
The committee was looking into government plans for a unified budget
bringing together spending and revenue statements in November, rather than
the existing system where revenue-raising measures are announced in the
spring and spending plans in the Autumn.
The report said existing consultation with outside bodies was insufficient
and the white paper proposals were unlikely to alleviate the situation.
The report says: 'The government's new budgetary time table is a modest step
towards the modernisation of budgetary procedures. It goes only a small way
towards meeting the concerns of either parliamentary reformers or of
lawyers, accountancy bodies or business organisations with an interest in
improving the presentation, scrutiny and control of public expenditure,
taxation and borrowing.'
The Treasury and Civil Service select committee has long supported the idea
of a 'green budget', under which the government's taxation and spending
proposals are presented to parliament for public and parliamentary scrutiny
before final decisions are announced.
The report concludes that the proposals do not 'meet the needs for the House
to improve its procedures for responding to the government's proposals for
public spending, taxation and borrowing'.
