  [Text] In Rwanda, government forces have launched an 
offensive against the [Rwandan] Patriotic Front [RPF]. Their 
aim, according to a UN spokesman in Kigali, is to clear the road 
between the capital, Kigali, and Butare, south of it. 
  Violent fighting took place today. The government forces are 
concentrating their efforts north and south of Kigali. The 
evacuation of civilians in the town by the United Nations has 
been suspended because of a lack of gasoline. 
  In a separate development, the White Fathers have announced 
the killing of a Spanish missionary. He is believed to have 
been shot in the zone controlled by the RPF. Three other 
missionaries are still reported missing in the prefecture of 
Byumba, in the north of the country. That zone is controlled by 
the RPF.
