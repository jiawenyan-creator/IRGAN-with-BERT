Beijing made him confident about Macao's future.

cooperation between China and Portugal and a document providing 
the basis for Macao's future. 
  He said, "to speak in a frank way, the Chinese Government 
has 
strictly implemented the joint declaration in the past seven 
years, which gave us confidence in dealing with the macao issue." 
  When answering a question about China's economic 
development,

development in China, which in fact has also surprised other 
European countries.

of China's trading party status in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), saying international elements could 
make China's economy maintain a sustained rapid development.

Macao and left for Hong Kong for a 24-hour visit this afternoon.
