FT  26 MAR 92 / Observer: Bulky
One question it won't be is: What is the largest-known prime number? - which
has just been newly answered by scientists at the UK Atomic Energy
Authority's Harwell laboratory at the cost of 19 hours on a Cray 2
supercomputer.
The latest result of the ceaseless search for the biggest number that can't
be divided by anything except itself or one, is 2756839-1 (two multiplied by
itself 756,839 times, minus one). Written out con- ventionally it would have
227,832 digits, enough to fill seven pages of the FT.
