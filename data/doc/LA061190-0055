ISRAEL WILL OPEN LIAISON OFFICE IN CHINA 
Israel plans to open its first liaison office in Beijing this week as a 
diplomatic beachhead, ending decades of estrangement with China, which 
traditionally has supported Israel's enemies. 
The office, operated by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities at a 
foreign-managed hotel in downtown Beijing, will technically serve as a 
clearinghouse for academic exchange between the two countries and will not have 
official government status. 
Israel and China have no diplomatic relations and are unlikely to establish 
official ties in the foreseeable future. Beijing maintains strong political and 
military ties with Arab nations and has steadfastly supported the Palestinian 
cause. 
Yet the liaison office, staffed by two Israeli science academy experts, 
represents a watershed in a relationship that has been developing quietly in 
recent years. 
China's immediate interest is obtaining trade and technology from Israel.
