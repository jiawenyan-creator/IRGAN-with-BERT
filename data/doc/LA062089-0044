MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
The Casino Royale, the last theater in downtown Washington showing X-rated 
pornographic movies, has become the victim of urban development. Workmen moved 
in over the weekend to prepare to demolish the theater that is located two 
blocks from the White House. The marquee still listed the last double feature, 
"Bring on the Virgins" and "Passionfest." The theater and an adjoining adult 
bookstore are giving way to an office building. The Casino Royale was in the 
heart of the block which until recently also had a massage parlor and clubs 
featuring nude dancers and X-rated videos. Two other theaters in the Washington 
area still show full length adult films. One is in a northeast neighborhood and 
the other is in a shopping mall in the city's Virginia suburbs. ALEENE MacMINN
