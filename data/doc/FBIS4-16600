  [Text] STRASBOURG, Apr 15, BNS - It is unlikely that 
Latvia would become full member in the Council of Europe [CE] 
before October, since the country has yet to adopt its 
citizenship law, the president of the CE Parliamentary Assembly, 
Miguel Angel Martinez, said at a meeting with the Estonian 
delegation for the assembly session Thursday [14 April]. 
  Martinez said he saw no other factor that might have a 
negative effect on Latvia's acceptance into the European body. 
He underscored that the "common European family" was missing 
Latvia. 
  The president of the Parliamentary Assembly pointed out in 
positive aspect the work of Estonia's representatives in the 
assembly. He said quick rise of Estonian parliament Deputy 
Speaker Tunne Kelam to one of the leading figures in the 
assembly was another great contribution to the country's good 
standing. 
  Martinez is expected to visit Estonia in May or June for 
meetings with the country's leaders and representatives of 
different factions in the parliament. He is also to meet then 
Uno Lohmus, who was elected member to the European Human Rights 
Committee at the assembly session Thursday. 
  Tunne Kelam, the leader of the Estonian delegation, at the 
meeting delivered to Martinez Estonia's propositions concerning 
the agenda of the visit.
