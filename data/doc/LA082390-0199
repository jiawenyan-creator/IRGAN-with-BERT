ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
DAD'S DEPARTURE: Marines shipping out to the Middle East are leaving behind 
families and a coloring book, above, written by Camp Pendleton wives to help 
children cope. . . . Titled "Daddy's Days Away," the book encourages kids to 
express their feelings, to write to daddy, to help mom with the chores. 
"Whether dad is at home or away, we are a family," the book says. . . . And why 
is dad going? "To protect and defend our country." Originally written for 
Pendleton Marines, the book is now distributed nationwide. Tom Hamilton and 
Shannon Sands
