FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: If the price is right . . . - Philip
Coggan watches brokers hone their competitive edge
COMPETITION is a marvellous thing. Following Fidelity's relaunch of its
stockbroking service two weeks ago, Sharelink has moved in to undercut
Fidelity's commission rates.
On deals worth over Pounds 8,000, Sharelink will now charge a commission of
just Pounds 50. This compares with the Pounds 65 charged by Fidelity on
deals worth Pounds 7,500 to Pounds 10,000, rising to a maximum of Pounds 250
on deals worth Pounds 100,000 plus. Sharelink says its rates are lower than
Fidelity's for all deals over Pounds 5,500.
Fidelity responded by pointing to its frequent dealing discount of 10 per
cent, for those who pay more than Pounds 250 in commission in a calendar
month.
The US group also claimed that its trading muscle would save investors money
through its ability to get keener prices from market-makers.
Meanwhile, a Manchester-based stockbroker called Gall and Eke has set up an
telephone-based execution-only dealing service called Sharemarket.
The commission rate on deals of up to Pounds 1,000 is Pounds 10, on deals of
Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 1,667 is Pounds 15, and on deals of Pounds 1,668 to
Pounds 45,000 is 0.9 per cent, with a maximum of Pounds 45. Deals worth over
Pounds 45,000 will be charged at a rate of Pounds 22.50 plus 0.05 per cent,
so a Pounds 100,000 deal would cost Pounds 72.50.
Investors may find that they can match or beat these rates if they go
elsewhere. Some building societies offer cut price dealing services to their
depositors who wish to sell small holdings in privatisation issues.
Of course price is not the only way in which these services can compete.
Fidelity's service requires shares to be held in a designated nominee
account whereas Sharelink allows investors to hold shares directly.
Sharelink is offering vouchers to Fidelity customers to meet the cost of
transferring out of the nominee system. But Mark Collier of Fidelity says it
will not charge its customers if they want to sell their shares to take
advantage of the Sharelink offer. 'I am convinced we will not see a single
trade as a result,' he added.
Investors may find that the standard of service is as important as cost.
Efficiency in dealing with paperwork, opening hours, access to foreign
markets - all factors will have varying levels of appeal to different
investors.
Many investors will not want to rely on an execution-only service but will
need advice or portfolio management skills in handling their stocks.
But it has to be good news for private investors as a whole that brokers are
prepared to compete on price.
Telephone-based services make the business of share dealing much less
cumbersome and remove the 'intimidation factor' involved in approaching a
stockbroker.
Those who want further information should call Sharelink on 021-200-2242,
Sharemarket on 061-237-9443 or Fidelity on 0800- 414191.
