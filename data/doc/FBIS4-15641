  [Text] Ukraine's Popular Rukh [Ukrainian People's Movement 
for Perestroyka] will manage to form up its own faction in the 
Ukrainian parliament, said RUKH leader Vyacheslav Chornovil, 
after voting in a Kiev polling station. 
  He expressed fears, however, lest the national democrats 
might fail to secure the required one third of the votes and 
block the left-wing forces' attempts to ruin the Ukrainian state 
system. 
  Asked by Interfax-Ukraine if he was planning to run for 
presidency (Chornovil took part in the previous presidential 
elections - Interfax), he stated that it would be inexpedient 
to hold presidential elections on June 28, 1994, because the 
alignment of forces was not in favor of the Ukrainian state or 
the national-democratic forces. He also announced that RUKH 
would determine its position on the presidential elections 
during its congress on April 16. 
  In his opinion, the victory of Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma 
was not ruled out. He remarked, however, that Kuchma is an 
incompetent person, so it would be a crime to let him run the 
state. 
  He also denied the possibility of cooperation between the 
national-democrats and the extreme left-wing and right-wing 
factions, and described Stepan Khmara, the leader of the 
Ukrainian Conservative Party popular in Western Ukraine, as the 
Ukrainian Zhirinovskiy. 
  Commenting on the situation in Crimea, he said that 
following 
the signing of the tripartite statement, Russia would not 
complicate the situation in Crimea. He noted, however, that 
this statement did not quite suit Ukraine. 
  Until recently, Ukraine had neither a strategy nor tactics 
in 
relation to Crimea, he said. Instead of overly exaggerating the 
problem, one should pursue a firm state policy in relation to 
Simferopol which absolutely depends on Kiev economically, he 
added. This does not mean, though, that troops should be sent to 
Crimea, said Chornovil.
