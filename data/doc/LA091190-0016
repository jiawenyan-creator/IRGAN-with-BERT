ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS 
Certron Corp.: The Anaheim-based manufacturer of audio recording tapes and 
distributor of video cassettes and floppy disks posted a third-quarter loss of 
$544,000, contrasted with net earnings of $45,000 for the year earlier period. 
Sales for the quarter ended July 31 declined 49%, to $4 million from $7.9 
million. For the nine month period, the company lost $1.3 million, contrasted 
with net earnings of $233,000 a year ago. Sales fell 41%, to $13.8 million from 
$23.4 million. Certron said the general softening of the economy has caused a 
decrease in video cassette sales during the current year, and contract 
manufacturing sales were also off from third quarter of last year.
