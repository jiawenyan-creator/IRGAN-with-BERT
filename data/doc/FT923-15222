FT  03 JUL 92 / People: Crest Nicholson builds up its board
Bob Erith, who was the City's number one rated analyst of the building
industry for more than a dozen years, has joined the board of Crest
Nicholson, one of Britain's battered housebuilders, along with John
Matthews, the merchant banker who helped advise Beazer on some of its
biggest deals.
John Callcutt, who took over as Crest's chief executive a year ago, says
that 'both are not only well known financial men but are also well known for
the knowledge of our industry'. He said that Crest had consulted Proned, the
body which promotes non-executive directors, about the appointments.
Erith, 53, a former senior partner of Savory Milln, is probably best known
in the City for producing his annual building book - a tome filled with
facts and figures about the industry. Although he has not been involved in
analysing companies for some years - he is chairman of the equities group of
Swiss Bank Corporation - he maintains close ties with the industry.
Erith has known Geoffrey Fox, one of Crest Nicholson's founding directors
for over 30 years, and is deputy chairman of Erith, a family firm of
builders' merchants. He said yesterday that Crest had got itself into 'very
much better shape' following its problems last year. It had written down the
value of its landbank 'very hard', and reduced its gearing.
John Matthews, 47, has had a less traditional career than Erith. Having been
a senior director of County NatWest, he went on to become deputy chairman of
Beazer, the acquisitive building materials company which was taken over by
Hanson last year. He is currently chief executive of Financiere Indosuez.
