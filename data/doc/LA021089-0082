SALE COMES UP SHORT IN DRUG BOAT AUCTION 
Federal authorities had hoped for a hefty sum Thursday when they auctioned off 
a 65-foot fishing trawler seized in an international drug-smuggling case. 
They got $10. 
"As far as I know, it is lowest bid for a ship in Rhode Island since the state 
entered the Union in 1790," U.S. Marshal Donald Wyatt said.
