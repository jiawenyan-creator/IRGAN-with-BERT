FT  21 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down in fourth
consecutive session
A SHARP fall both in the yen and bond prices triggered profit-taking, and
share prices lost ground for the fourth consecutive day, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 80.21 to 20,607.26, down 0.7 per cent on the week,
after a high of 20,859.49 in the morning and a low of 20,586.56 in the late
afternoon. Brokers were seen clearing positions ahead of the weekend, while
some foreign investors supported share prices.
Volume remained below 300m shares for the third day, at 230m against 253m.
Declines led advances by 501 to 442, with 206 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks fell 5.57 to 1,659.19 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.58 to 1,267.89.
The yen's decline against the dollar caused mixed reactions. Local
newspapers reported that overnight intervention by the US on the currency
markets, buying dollars against the yen, was the result of an agreement
between the US and Japan regarding an imminent cut in Japan's official
discount rate. Mr Jiro Saito, vice-minister of finance, later denied such an
accord.
Most investors turned pessimistic over an imminent easing of monetary
policy, with interest rate-sensitive banks and large-capital issues losing
ground. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y50 to Y3,370 and Mitsubishi Bank lost
Y60 to Y2,870. Steels were also lower, with Nippon Steel down Y4 to Y376 and
Kawasaki Steel falling Y3 to Y365.
Ricoh, the office automation machinery maker, was once again the most active
issue of the day, rising Y16 to Y815.
High-technology issues were higher on the falling yen. Fujitsu rose Y14 to
Y780 and Sony gained Y110 to Y4,460.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 21.20 to 22,534.63 in volume of 90.2m shares.
