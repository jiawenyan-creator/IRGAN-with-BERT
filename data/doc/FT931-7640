FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact compromise proposed
THE FOURTH and final round of United Nations-sponsored talks on a new
international cocoa agreement kicked off yesterday with a compromise
proposal from the chairman, Mr Peter Lai of Malaysia, on the price range to
be defended and the pact's financing. The 45 or so producing and consuming
nations represented have until March 5 to agree on a successor to the 1986
accord, which expires at the end of September.
The compromise envisages a price range of SDR1,040-1,560 a tonne, with a
median price of SDR1,300 (Dollars 1,780). At the end of negotiations last
November, producers were demanding a price range of SDR1,180-1,770 while
consumers offered SDR840-1,260. Cocoa is at present trading near historic
lows in real terms of about SDR730 a tonne.
On the sensitive issue of financing, Mr Lai has suggested that producers and
consumers share the cost of the proposed withholding scheme for stabilising
cocoa prices, with contributions equivalent to Dollars 8 a tonne on imports
or exports. However, governments would be free to decide how to finance
their contribution.
Consumers have rejected producer calls for a trade levy, insisting instead
that the new pact be financed in the first place by payment of the Dollars
137m owed by producers to the International Cocoa Organisation. Mr Lai's
compromise would require producer countries in arrears to pay their own
costs of storage and rotation for withheld stocks, enabling them to part-pay
their debts in local currency and save on scarce foreign exchange.
A separate proposal came yesterday for a 350,000 tonne limit on the amount
of cocoa that could be withheld from the market to bolster prices. Last
November, producers were demanding 380,000 tonnes, consumers 330,000.
