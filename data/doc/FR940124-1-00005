SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background on the Indiana Program


On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the
disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found
in the July 26, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 32107). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at
30 CFR 914.10, 914,15, and 914.16.


II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendments


Since July 29, 1982, (the date of conditional approval of the Indiana program), a number of changes have been made to
the Federal regulations concerning surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Pursuant to the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 732.17, OSM informed Indiana on May 22, 1985 (Regulatory Reform I), on August 24, 1988 (Regulatory Reform
II), and on September 20, 1989 (Regulatory Reform III), that a number of Indiana regulations are less effective than
or inconsistent with the revised Federal requirements.
By letter date December 30, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IND1322), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package (number 937) consisting of revisions to 38 sections
of the Indiana rules. These revisions address changes to the Indiana program that were identified in the three letters
referred to above, and certain required program amendments. The State has also proposed additional changes which
Indiana believes will further improve the approved State program. The primary focus of the submittal is on soil capability
and restoration standards, individual civil penalties, significant/non-significant revisions, coal exploration,
and performance bonds.
The following rulemaking actions are being proposed by Indiana:
