FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: ENO season
The 1992-3 season at the English National Opera opens on August 27 with a
revival of Rigoletto in Jonathan Miller's Mafia-style staging. Ken Russell
makes his house debut in a new production of Princess Ida; among the other
new productions are The Force of Destiny by Nicholas Hytner (starring
Josephine Barstow), Janacek's The Excursions of Mr Broucek by David
Pountney, Handel's Ariodante by David Alden and the premiere of Jonathan
Harvey's Inquest of Love.
Revivals include Ariadne on Naxos, Wozzeck, Hansel and Gretel, The Turn of
the Screw (which also marks Valerie Masterson's first Britten appearance at
the Coliseum), Queen of Spades, the notorious 'green blood' Macbeth, and two
Mozarts - Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute.
Mark Elder, Richard Armstrong, Jane Glover and Charles Mackerras head the
list of conductors.
Alberto Remedios, the company's much-loved Wagner tenor of previous decades,
returns after an absence as Mr Broucek.
