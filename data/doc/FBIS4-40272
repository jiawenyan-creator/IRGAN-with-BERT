  [Text] Sukhumi June 15 TASS--Demining of the Abkhazian 
territory, where according to experts some 100,000 mines have 
been placed in two years of ethnic war, is the most complicated 
task of the first stage of deploying Russian peace-keepers in 
the region and its implementation will take a very long time. 
  "In two years of combat activities a huge amount of mines 
and 
explosives has been placed. There are no mining maps and 
sappers face a hard job which will last for several months", 
Deputy Defence Minister Georgiy Kondratyev, who is in charge of 
the peace-keeping operation, told TASS on Wednesday. 
  However, military experts believe the complete demining of 
Abkhazia will take years as the number of mines in the region 
exceeds that in another "hot spot", the Dniester region in 
Moldavia [Moldova], where demining has been going on for two 
years. According to experts, 40,000 mines have been placed along 
the Gumista River in Abkhazia. 
  Sappers will first begin working in places where command 
posts of the peace-keepers will be situated. The unified 
headquarters will be located in Sukhumi in the sanatorium of the 
Moscow Military District. The headquarters of the Western 
control group will be deployed in the city of Zugdidi. 
  After demining of the command post sites is completed, 
Russian paratroopers will begin deployment along the Inguri 
River which divides Georgia and Abkhazia. The warring units are 
to withdraw 12 kilometres from the river and concentrate their 
units and armoured vehicles in specified places.
