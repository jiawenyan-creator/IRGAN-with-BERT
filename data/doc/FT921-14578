FT  15 JAN 92 / German unions caught speeding in the slow lane: German
unions find their pay claims are now out of step with a slowing economy
GERMAN trade union negotiators have left themselves out on a limb with their
demands for double-digit percentage wage rises at a time of slowing economic
growth in the west, huge financial demands in east Germany, and rising
prices.
One consequence of their demands was the Bundesbank's decision last month to
raise interest rates more steeply than expected. This drew much criticism
but the central bank made it clear that it would not tolerate present
inflation of about 4 per cent or wage settlements as high as the 7 per cent
of last year.
Yet the unions will not find it easy to climb back from their exposed
position. This was shown by the decision yesterday by the powerful IG Metall
union to hold a strike ballot in the steel industry, though it said that
further talks were still possible. The banking and insurance union has also
threatened limited industrial action in banks this week in defence of its
claim. Both are asking for 10.5 per cent rises.
IG Metall's recommendation that regional claims do not exceed 9.5 per cent
for the much more important engineering industry pay round this spring
demonstrates its awareness that opinion is swinging against it. Mr Franz
Steinkuhler, head of the union, admitted that profitability in the sector
had 'certainly worsened'. But the recommended claim ceiling is still more
than twice the inflation rate.
'The unions have not chosen their tactics very well this time,' says Mr Gert
Schmidt, an economist with IKB Deutsche Industriebank. 'The public, the
politicians, the Bundesbank, and many employees are against them.'
When the unions made their double-digit demands, the west German economy
still seemed to be going strong. But gross national product figures for the
fourth quarter 1991, due out today, are expected to show no growth between
the third and fourth quarters and expansion of just more than 3 per cent on
a year-on-year basis.
'The unions' problem is how to retreat without losing face,' says Mr Adolf
Rosenstock, senior economist with Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt.
With demand from east Germany waning and export markets still not picking
up, industrial companies now seem more willing to brave strikes rather than
agree to pay awards at about the 7 per cent level of last year.
Because of higher pay deals, increased social security costs, and lower
productivity improvements at a time of slowing economic growth, German
industry's unit wage costs rose by about 5.5 per cent last year, the
strongest rise since the early 1980s. This year productivity will increase
by just more than 1 per cent. Thus, argues Westdeutsche Landesbank, industry
would be put under extreme competitive pressures if wage settlements again
approach 7 per cent.
After the Bundesbank's own warnings, political pressure has built up against
the unions. Not only have government politicians from Chancellor Helmut Kohl
downwards called for wage moderation, so have politicians in states governed
by both the Christian Democrats, the dominant party in the ruling federal
coalition, and Social Democrats, the federal opposition party.
At a time when public funds are needed to maintain the economic revival in
east Germany, the central and state administrations are adamant they cannot
afford to pay public sector workers and civil servants anything like the
double-digit increases they are asking for.
At the same time, many export-oriented companies are suffering from weak
markets. 'Industry fears a loss of competitiveness, especially to the
Japanese,' says Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank.
'Union leaders sit on companies' supervisory boards and know the figures and
their business situation,' Mr Hufner adds. 'They are aware how far they can
go and when the limit is reached. This makes me hopeful that despite all the
noise, there will be sensible settlements.'
Most economists reckon agreements of about 6 per cent would be acceptable.
Salomon Brothers, the US investment house, believe this would allow
inflation to ease to 3 per cent by the year-end after a peak of 4.7 per cent
in March.
The central bank's ambitious goal is an eventual return to inflation of 2
per cent compared with the latest figure of 4.2 per cent in December. Core
inflation is about 3.5 per cent, when the impact of last year's consumer tax
rises are excluded. The Bundesbank is worried that a planned rise in
value-added tax in 1993, currently stalled in parliamentary committee, would
add to medium-term inflationary pressures.
Not wanting to appear too provocative, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of
the Bundesbank, avoided strictures against the unions when announcing the
rate increases which took the Lombard rate to 9.75 per cent and the discount
rate to 8 per cent. He made most play of the rising money supply, spurred by
a sharp rise in bank lending, much of it to finance corporate investments in
east Germany.
But it was the unions which the Bundesbank wanted to take heed of its words
and deeds. Mr Hufner hopes the message got through. 'I believe the unions
are thinking about what the Bundesbank did.'
Only when the Bundesbank is confident that they have thought hard enough,
and signed moderate pay accords, can it be expected to consider reducing
rates again.
