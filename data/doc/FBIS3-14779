  [Text] Chisinau February 27 TASS -- President Mircea Snegur 
on Sunday voted "for political forces which strive for Moldova's 
independence". In an ITAR-TASS interview at a polling station 
here, Snegur voiced hope that "those forces should form a 
parliamentary majority capable of leading Moldova out of the 
crisis and resolving the Gagauz and Dniester problems". 
  "If this does not happen, agonising attempts will again be 
made to get agreement between parties in parliament, between the 
parliament and president", he added. 
  Two thousand polling stations are functioning in Moldova. 
Polling will end at 20:00. The first preliminary results are 
likely to become known late at night. 
  All the 2,900,000 voters of the country got an opportunity 
to 
take part in the polling: on Saturday the Moldovan leadership 
managed to persuade the Gagauz into giving up the earlier 
declared boycott and opening polling stations on their territory. 
  The Dniester authorities refused to open polling stations 
but 
promised not to prevent residents from the left bank of the 
Dniester to cast their votes at special polling stations which 
had opened on the right bank a week ago. 
  The polling is being monitored by 150 observers from Euro 
Council, CSCE, and NATO.
