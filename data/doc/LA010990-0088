BRIEFLY 
Home Affordability Index Steady: The percentage of California households able 
to afford the median priced home remained constant at 19% in November, 
according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
Although housing prices increased slightly during the month, mortgage rates 
declined, offsetting the increase. The state's median-priced home now sells for 
$195,400, up from $193,557 in October. Only 14% of the households can afford 
the median-priced home in Los Angeles, which sells for $224,625, or the 
median-priced home in Orange County, which goes for $242,765.
