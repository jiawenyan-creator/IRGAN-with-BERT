FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trilon losses cut to CDollars
38m
Trilon, a financial services subsidiary of Toronto's Hees-Edper group,
reduced its 1993 loss to CDollars 38m (USDollars 28m), or 74 cents a share,
from CDollars 331m, or CDollars 3.90, in 1992, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal. The results include special charges of CDollars 107m, against
CDollars 433m, for Trilon's share of losses by Gentra, the former Royal
Trust Co.
Before special charges, Trilon was profitable in the fourth quarter of 1993
and expects to remain in the black through 1994. The real estate brokerage
has been restructured, and merchant banking reduced.
