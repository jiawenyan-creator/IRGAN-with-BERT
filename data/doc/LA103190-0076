FOREMAN IS CHALLENGER FOR HOLYFIELD 
Evander Holyfield will defend his heavyweight title against George Foreman for 
$20 million, promoter Dan Duva said Tuesday. 
Foreman will get $12.5 million, Duva said. 
Duva said no decision had been made on a site or date, but he confirmed that 
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas had offered a site fee of $10 million to $12 
million. 
"I'm meeting with the (Donald) Trump people today," Duva said. 
Bob Arum of Top Rank, who is co-promoting the bout with Duva, told USA Today 
that the Holyfield-Foreman fight will be held in Las Vegas April 19. Duva 
denied that the date had been set, however. In London, promoter Frank Warren 
said that the 42-year-old Foreman would have a tuneup fight Dec. 5 in Britain. 
He said no opponent had been selected. 
Foreman knocked out American Terry Anderson in the first round in London last 
month.
