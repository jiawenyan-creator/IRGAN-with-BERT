FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: GM's European operations slip 8%
THE NET profit of the European operations of General Motors, the world's
largest vehicle maker, fell last year by 7.9 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from
a record Dollars 1.92bn in 1990.
Despite the modest decline, GM was probably still the most profitable of the
big six volume car-makers in Europe last year, with a 7 per cent net profit
margin.
The profits of GM's European operations are a stark contrast to the record
losses suffered by the group in the US last year, which totalled Dollars
7.087bn including a Dollars 1.777bn special restructuring provision.
The European profits provided a partial cushion for the US losses, but could
not prevent the group suffering an overall loss of Dollars 4.5bn, the
largest annual loss ever recorded by a US company.
It is understood the net profits of GM Europe's core Opel/Vauxhall car and
light commercial vehicle operations rose marginally last year to a record
Dollars 1.96bn, despite the launch costs for its new generation Astra small
family car, GM's best-selling car in Europe.
The overall GM Europe profit of Dollars 1.76bn contrasts sharply with the
net loss of Dollars 961m announced earlier this month by Ford, its domestic
rival, for its European operations.
While GM's European profits have totalled more than Dollars 1.75bn in each
of the last four years, Ford has suffered a steep decline from a net profit
of Dollars 1.56bn in 1988, to a net loss of Dollars 961m last year.
Ford's European automotive operations accumulated a net loss of Dollars
1.079bn last year, which was partially offset by a net profit of Dollars
118m achieved by its financial services in Europe.
While GM's core Opel/Vauxhall operations achieved a Dollars 1.96bn net
profit in Europe, the group's overall profit in Europe was reduced to
Dollars 1.76bn by several factors including:
Its share of losses at Saab Automobile, the Swedish car-maker where GM holds
a 50 per cent stake and management control.
Saab Automobile had a loss after financial items of SKr2.243bn (Dollars
375m), compared with a loss of SKr3.25bn a year earlier;
The continuing losses suffered by Group Lotus, the specialist UK sports
car-maker and automotive engineering consultant;
Its share of losses at Avis Europe, the car leasing and rental group;
Reduced profits at its GMAC financial services operations, and losses at the
GM Hughes Electronics subsidiary in Europe.
GM's European turnover rose 3.8 per cent to Dollars 25.36bn from Dollars
24.4bn a year earlier, while its workforce in Europe increased slightly to
128,000 from 127,000 in 1990.
Both GM and Ford claimed record sales volumes in western Europe last year.
GM said its Opel/Vauxhall car sales in western Europe (Opel in continental
Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) rose marginally to a record 1.56m from 1.55m
a year earlier. Ford said its western European car sales totalled 1.58m,
some 2 per cent higher than the previous peak set in 1989.
Most importantly, Opel captured a 17.2 per cent share of last year's booming
German market, with sales in Germany of 717,100.
In the UK, Vauxhall's sales fell 23 per cent to 248,704, while its UK market
share was reduced to 15.6 per cent from 16.1 per cent a year earlier.
Overall in western Europe, GM claimed a record car market share for its
Opel/Vauxhall marques of 11.6 per cent marginally higher than the 11.5 per
cent that was achieved a year earlier.
GM is forecasting sales of 700,000 for its new generation Astra range this
year, with combined sales and new orders of 400,000 since its launch in
mid-October last year.
