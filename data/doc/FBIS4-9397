  [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- The biggest 
measurable damage to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during 
the international sanctions is the drop in the national income 
from 3,000 dollars to 700-900 dollars per capita, Dr. Oskar 
Kovac told TANJUG on Monday. 
  The prominent economist is a member of a team of experts 
charged with estimating the damage to the Yugoslav economy since 
the imposition of the sanctions in May 30, 1992 which caused a 
drop in the production, a halt of export-import activities, 
rising unemployment and lower living standards. 
  "The idea on a conference on the economic revival of the 
former Yugoslavia, recently proposed by U.N. Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has only spurred the Yugoslav experts to 
step up their efforts to estimate the scope of the damage," 
Kovac said. 
  The former Yugoslav republics have intensified their efforts 
to estimate the war damage, either independently or with the aid 
of world experts, he said. 
  Yugoslavia has suffered damages both due to the sanctions 
and 
the disintegration of the former Yugoslav Federation which 
started in 1991 with the violent secession of Slovenia and 
Croatia. 
  The experts will determine in what measure the sanctions 
affected the reduction of the social product, which recorded a 
drop from 23,399 million dollars to 9,520 million dollars in the 
1990-93 period. 
  The marked decrease began in 1991 with a 11 percent drop 
compared to 1990, and 26 percent in 1992. In 1993, this figure 
was 30.3 percent. 
  In view of the fact that in the 1986-90 period the Yugoslav 
social product recorded an average annual drop of 1.2 percent, 
it is clear that the drastic fall is the result of the 
disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and the introduction of 
the E.C. and U.N. Security Council sanctions. 
  Much of the damage will be difficult to measure, while a 
part 
will become apparent only after the sanctions are lifted when 
potential losses of commercial banks surface.
