FT  10 FEB 94 / Evidence of aid disclosed
Further circumstantial evidence that the government may have breached its
own guidelines on aid provision was disclosed last night when a minister
said that Malaysia had been promised aid shortly after an earlier
arms-for-aid offer had been rescinded.
Two weeks ago, the Foreign Office revealed that Lord Younger, the then
defence secretary, had written to the Malaysian government in June 1988,
pointing out that the sale of Pounds 1bn of British arms could not be
formally linked to the Pounds 234m of UK aid to help build a dam on the
Pergau river, as such a link would have been a breach of guidelines.
The Foreign Office said that Lord Younger had sent the letter because he had
signed a protocol in March of that year which wrongly linked the arms sales
to the provision of aid.
However, in a parliamentary written answer yesterday to Mr Alan Williams,
Labour MP for Swansea West, Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, a Foreign Office minister,
confirmed that there was 'further correspondence reiterating promises of
civil aid' between the two governments following Lord Younger's letter.
Mr Lennox-Boyd did not elaborate on the nature of the correspondence.
Mr Williams, said he suspected that this correspondence contained further
evidence that the aid was linked to the Pounds 1bn arms deal.
