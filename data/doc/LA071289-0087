ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LA HABRA; 
YOUTH SHOT IN FACE; GANG MEMBERS BLAMED 
A 17-year-old youth was in stable condition Tuesday after being shot in the 
face when two carloads of gang members cornered him at La Habra Boulevard and 
Cypress Street, police said. The victim was not believed to be a member of a 
rival gang, police said. 
The confrontation started when the youth, who was not identified because of his 
age, stopped his car about 9 p.m. Monday, Police Lt. John Buchholz said. 
Two cars filled with gang members began following the victim, Buchholz said. 
One car wedged him into a corner and a gang member got out and used a 
small-caliber gun to shoot the youth in the face, Buchholz said. 
The teen-ager is expected to lose one of his eyes as a result of the attack, 
police said.
