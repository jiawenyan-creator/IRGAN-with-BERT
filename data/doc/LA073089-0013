FOR SOME, NENEH'S NO JONI . . . PERIOD; 
A RAP FLAP AMID ANTI-SEMITISM CHARGES 
A reaction to Steve Hochman's July 16 article about Public Enemy, the rap group 
that announced it was disbanding after a group member created a controversy by 
saying in an interview, "The Jews are wicked. We can prove that": 
We have almost completed a decade filled with hatred, violence and racial 
contempt, as witnessed by several alarming incidents. Among them are the Al 
Campanis blunder on national TV; the emergence of Louis Farrakhan; the 
resurgence of white supremacist movements; the escalation of gang warfare. 
Now there is anti-Semitic sentiment from Public Enemy and what appears to be a 
racially motivated movie by Spike Lee ("Do the Right Thing"), which I consider 
incendiary. 
What has become of the '60s movement that included a cause for civil rights? 
And what about the '70s, which saw a push for equality in many areas? 
Apparently we have not come far. Or maybe we have just come full circle, back 
around again to a time of prejudice as we head into the '90s. In any case, I am 
saddened by the attacks on people in regard to the color of their skin, the 
colors of their clothes or the way they pray to God.
