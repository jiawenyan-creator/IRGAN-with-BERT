METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DELIBERATIONS RESUME IN JEWELRY-DRUG CASE 
A federal court jury in Los Angeles, after confirming the convictions of four 
men accused of laundering $350 million in drug profits through jewelry 
companies, was ordered Thursday to resume deliberations on undecided counts. 
The jury on Wednesday found Nazareth Andonian, his brother, Vahe Andonian, and 
Juan Carlos Seresi guilty of conspiring to launder money. 
However, the panel was dismissed before it could confirm the verdicts and make 
them official. That confirmation took place Thursday. The Andonians and the 
alleged mastermind of the scheme, Raul Vivas, 39, were also found guilty on 25 
other counts of money laundering. 
On Thursday, the judge instructed the jury, over objections of several defense 
lawyers, to resume deliberations to try to break an impasse on five other 
counts of money laundering against Seresi and on all counts against defendant 
Ruben Saini.
