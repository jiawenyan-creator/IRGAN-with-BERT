FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Continental stays in the black
CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, has managed to stay in the black for
the first nine months of the year despite dire conditions for suppliers to
the automobile industry.
Reiterating its prediction that it would make a profit for the year, the
Hanover-based group reported that sales dropped by 6 per cent in the first
nine months to DM6.8bn (Dollars 4.1bn). Sales to to the European auto
industry dropped by 26 per cent in the period.
Continental cautioned that the operating results for its mainstream tyre
business, as well as its non-tyre technical products, would be considerably
under last year's level, reflecting the depth of the recession in Europe as
well as weaknesses in the US market for replacement tyres.
However, Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, chief executive, said he was confident
that the group would be able to achieve its plan of sales of 5m winter tyres
in the coming months.
