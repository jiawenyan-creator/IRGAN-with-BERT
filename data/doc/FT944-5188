FT  05 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: German exchanges
Last week's decision by BASF to de-list its shares from all of Germany's
stock exchanges apart from Frankfurt is a significant step for Finanzplatz
Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre. This is the first time a big
German company has made such a move but it is likely to be followed by
others concerned to reduce the costs of multiple listings.
BASF's decision reflects the reality of Frankfurt's dominant position. Its
share of turnover in German shares has risen from 43 per cent in 1980 to 74
per cent last year. So far this year, over 70 per cent of turnover in BASF
stock has been handled in Frankfurt. But though Frankfurt has gained in
importance, continued fragmentation still allows price variation between
exchanges and impedes liquidity. It is also unwieldy for companies to raise
capital and comply with disclosure requirements at seven different
exchanges. Increasing concentration on Frankfurt means greater transparency
and liquidity, which benefits both companies and investors.
Should more companies follow BASF's route, it will help Frankfurt compete
more effectively with London for German securities business. The trouble is
that regional ties will prevent some of Germany's largest companies from
cutting their links with their local bourses - however financially
beneficial such moves might be.
