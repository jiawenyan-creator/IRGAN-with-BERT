Jury selection began in federal court in Seattle in the case of a woman who 
says drinking during pregnancy caused birth defects in her son. Candace and 
Harold Thorp filed suit against the makers of Jim Beam bourbon for not putting 
warning labels on its bottles. The couple's 4-year-old son, Michael, was born 
mentally retarded, neurologically impaired, developmentally stunted, with 
facial and other body malformations, according to the lawsuit. The Thorps sued 
the James B. Beam Distillery Co. of Deerfield, Ill., claiming it should have 
provided labels warning that alcohol can cause birth defects. Twenty-nine 
potential jurors were called. Mrs. Thorp said in court documents she drank up 
to a half a fifth per day of Jim Beam bourbon while she was pregnant and did 
not know her drinking would damage her child.
