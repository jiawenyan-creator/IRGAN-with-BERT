FT  12 FEB 93 / Revenue unveils redesigned forms
MORE THAN 8m taxpayers, with the Queen possibly among them, will receive a
re-designed income tax form in time for the end of the tax year in April.
The form is being circulated by the Inland Revenue to professional tax
advisers and companies which prepare tax software.
The aim of the redesigned form is to make it much simpler to read and
complete, and to reduce the cost of dealing with incorrectly completed
returns.
Printed over 12 pages in blue and light orange on white paper, the new tax
return follows a structured format with instructions down the left-hand
margin and space for numerical totals down the right-hand side to lead the
taxpayer logically through the form.
There are eight variations on the basic personal income tax form, with
special versions for some taxpayers such as the clergy, underwriters at the
Lloyd's of London insurance market, members of the armed forces and British
residents overseas.
In all of the new forms the language has been simplified, the volume of
notes has been increased, and the questions follow a consistent sequence.
However, the new design has not been achieved without controversy. There
have been internal debates within the Revenue about the format, and some
accountants have complained that they were not given sufficient time to
comment.
And at least one software company has expressed concern at how easy it will
be for taxpayers to understand the instructions.
The new tax return document is part of a wider redesign of about 800 Revenue
documents and forms.
The Revenue hopes to introduce up to another 40 types of form by the start
of the new tax year.
The redesign project is being supervised by Wolff Olins, the design and
corporate identity consultancy.
