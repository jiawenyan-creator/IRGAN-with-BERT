SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



The Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 amended the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the Act). The Act now requires
that U.S. firms entering into contracts for the sale of weapons systems or defense-related items to foreign countries
or foreign firms that are subject to offset agreements exceeding $5,000,000 in value to 
furnish information regarding such sales to the Secretary of 
Commerce (the Secretary). The Act also now requires the Secretary to establish regulations to collect this information
and to protect it from public disclosure unless public disclosure is specifically authorized by the firm furnishing
the information. The Act further requires the Secretary to serve as the President's executive agent in preparing
an annual report to Congress on the impact of offsets on the United States. 

This report will include an aggregated summary of information provided to the Secretary by U.S. industry pursuant
to the regulation proposed here. It will address the impact of offsets on the defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness,
employment, and trade of the United States. 



Rulemaking Requirements 


1. This proposed rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
2. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 5 to 60 hours per response, with an
average of 10 hours, including time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the 
collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of
information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Brad Botwin, Director, Strategic Analysis Division,
Office of Industrial Resource Administration, Attention: Offset Regulation Comments, room 3878, U.S. Department
of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. 
3. This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation
of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
4. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. It is anticipated that the rule will primarily affect large defense contractors that engage in offset agreements
with foreign governments. Moreover, the rule is not expected to pose a burden because firms engaging in offset transactions
already 
must prepare periodic accounts of progress toward fulfillment of offset obligations for the foreign entity that
is party to the offset agreement. The information to be collected pursuant to 
these regulations is less than that required by these foreign parties. With regard to new offset agreements entered
into, the information requested is readily available and will take a minimum amount of time to assemble by the parties
involved. 
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 
5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the
effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation is specifically exempt pursuant to the Defense Production
Act of 1950, as amended. (50 U.S.C. app. 2159). Further, no other law requires a notice of proposed rulemaking to be
issued for this proposed rule. 
However, because of the importance of the issues raised by this regulation, this rule is being issued in proposed form.
Pursuant to the Act, comments will be considered in the development of final regulations. (50 U.S.C. app. 2159(b)(1)).
Accordingly, the Department encourages interested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time
to permit the fullest consideration of their views.
