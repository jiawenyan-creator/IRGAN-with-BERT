<F P=106> Report by Robert Schlesinger: "A Dual Asylum Recognition </F>
Policy"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- If one asks for the percentage of 
successful asylum applications in Austria, the information given 
on this differs. The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) 
speaks of 7.8 percent for 1993, while the Press Office of the 
Interior Ministry, on the other hand, speaks of a remarkable 
18.47 percent. 
  Both base their calculations on the same absolute figures. 
Last year more than 15,000 applications for asylum were 
processed (the majority of these had been left over from 
previous years); 1,193 were approved, which is 7.8 percent. 
According to the UNHCR's press spokeswoman, Melita Sunjic, this 
method of calculating is the international norm and was also 
used in our country until the new asylum law came into effect. 
  Last year, however, the ministry used a different 
calculation: Only 4,743 new applications were made -- 876 were 
approved, which is 18.47 percent. This figure, which is 
respectable when compared with other states, was achieved 
because, of the 876 asylum-seekers who were accepted, there were 
543 Bosnians, who had to be given asylum on the basis of an 
international agreement. Austria has committed itself to 
granting asylum to 600 Bosnians who have escaped from Serbian 
prison camps. 
  This year, however, even the method of calculating used by 
the ministry in 1993 would yield only 5.86 percent for the first 
quarter. Thus, it is close to the 4.2 percent of the UNHCR 
calculation. However, the method of calculating has been 
changed and the Press Office is proudly reporting 14.43 percent. 
<H5>  Smaller Overall Figure </H5>
  The overall figure was once again reduced: In the first 
three months of 1994 1,263 applications were made; 395 were 
legally decided on, 57 positively -- and 57 out of 395 is 14.43 
percent. 
  Just to check, the UNHCR uses the following method of 
calculation: 3,664 proceedings were concluded, 73 of them by 
withdrawing the application, which leaves 3,591; 152 were 
approved, which is 4.2 percent. 
  Internally, however, the Interior Ministry also insists on 
comparable results: According to one from among the group of 
recipients, Department III/13 of the ministry distributes 
monthly statistics for official use, which is not at all 
identical with the published ones but with that of the UNHCR. 
Among the addressees is the Office of the Chancellor. 
<H5>  Official Statistics </H5>
  Nevertheless, Vranitzky, too, prefers to use the official 
statistics: In his letter of 25 February 1994 to 18 Viennese 
historians who had protested the government's asylum policy, he 
speaks of a successful ratio of 19.29 percent for the period 
between 1 July 1992 and 31 December 1993.
