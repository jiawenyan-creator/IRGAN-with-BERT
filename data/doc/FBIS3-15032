  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 01, BNS -- A Russian diplomat in 
Lithuania denied as "not corresponding to reality" reports by 
the Russian PRAVDA newspaper that the Lithuanian prosecutor's 
office planned a provocation against the so called Association 
of Russian Citizens in Lithuania. 
  In its Jan. 18 issue, PRAVDA, the newspaper of the Russian 
communists, said the provocation failed thanks to "the firm 
position of a Russian Embassy representative." 
  PRAVDA said the provocation started with the interrogation 
of 
Valentin Meshcheriakov, leader of the association, which is "the 
last legal organization that openly defends the interests of our 
fellow-countrymen in that republic." 
  Meshcheriakov was interrogated in the presence of Nikolay 
Sokolov, counselor of the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. The 
Russian diplomat said he disagrees with the definition "firm 
position." Sokolov said he did not get the impression that this 
was a provocation against the association or its members. 
  The Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office confirmed that 
Meshcheriakov was interrogated Feb. 14, but only as a witness in 
relation to the failed 1991 Soviet coup attempt in Lithuania, 
and not as a person suspected of "sabotage." 
  In a communique presented to the Russian Embassy in 
Lithuania, the prosecutor's office said a Russian diplomat was 
allowed to be present during the interrogation, although the 
Lithuanian Procedural Code does not provide for such a 
possibility. This was done to avoid any biassed evaluations of 
the act, the communique said. 
  The prosecutor's office said Meshcheriakov confirmed that 
his 
association is not officially registered in Lithuania. The 
Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office also categorically denied 
allegations of sanctioning an arrest of 25 association members.
