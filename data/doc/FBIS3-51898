  [Text] Guatemala City, Jan 26 (AFP) -- About 1,500 Indian 
peasants from the southern coast of Guatemala protested today 
outside the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City. They are asking that 
their debt with International Development Agency [AID] be 
forgiven. 
  The peasants were received at the embassy by U.S. adviser 
Marilyn McAffe, who refused to speak with the press. The 
demonstration blocked part of La Reforma Avenue, one of the most 
important highways in the southern part of the city, causing an 
enormous traffic jam. 
  The leaders of the movement explained that AID granted an 
$11 
million loan to the Penny Foundation, which in turn purchased 
land to sell to the peasants under very flexible payment terms. 
The drop in coffee prices and other agricultural products, 
however, has forced the peasants to fall behind in payments. 
That is why they are asking AID to forgive the debt. The farmers 
said they would continue to picket until their demands are met.
