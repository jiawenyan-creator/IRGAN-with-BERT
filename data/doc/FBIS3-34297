  [Text] The Washington peace talks will resume 
approximately one week from now, on 15 February. Meanwhile, 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has postponed his 
departure for the Middle East in order to enable Israel and the 
PLO to conclude their complex negotiations before an effort is 
made to expedite the Israeli-Syrian talks. 
  On the table at which Muwaffaq al-'Allaf and Itamar 
Rabinovich will again sit down together will be an Israeli 
proposal that a phased withdrawal and the establishment of peace 
be carried out concurrently and over a lengthy period. 
  [Begin Rabinovich recording] We believe an agreement there 
is an element of a phased implementation and an element of 
reciprocity or interface [preceding word in English], as it was 
termed in a CNN interview -- namely, the link between the 
implementation of withdrawal and the measure of peace dispensed 
during that phase. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, it appears that not much will happen in the 13th 
round, and those who entertained the hope that the 
Israeli-Syrian talks will achieve a breakthrough in the spring 
now hope it will happen by the end of 1994 at the latest.
