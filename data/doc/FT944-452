FT  28 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies as Mexican ADRs
dive
Wall Street
US shares added to last week's gains yesterday in light post-holiday
trading, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
By 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 28.26 at 3,861.69. The more
broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.64 at 462.47, the American Stock
Exchange composite climbed 0.59 at 429.37 and the Nasdaq composite gained
4.01 at 746.20.
Trading volume on the NYSE was 211m shares.
The much-discussed year-end-rally seemed to have kicked in as investors
loaded their portfolios with blue-chip stocks to close out the year. The Dow
also benefited as traders pulled out of shares with exposure to Mexico and
bought industrials.
The Mexican bolsa was off sharply and peso was trading at a record low
against the dollar in the wake of the Mexican government's decision last
week to stop supporting its currency.
Also boosting US share prices were gains in the bond market on the heels of
weak data on the sales of single-family homes. Home sales fell 2.6 per cent
in November, according to the National Association of Realtors.
An early morning report that consumer confidence hit a high for the year in
December may also have helped the market. The consumer confidence index rose
102.2, up from 100.4 for November, according to the Conference Board.
ITT gained Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 88 1/8 as the US conglomerate sells off
various financial services to raise money to expand its entertainment
division. The company announced yesterday that it would sell two pieces of
ITT Financial to Norwest and Deutsche Bank for a total of about Dollars
3.7bn.
Shares in major retail companies were weak amid widespread, but mostly
anecdotal, reports of lower-than-expected sales for the holiday period.
Dayton Hudson dropped Dollars 4 at Dollars 68 3/4 , Kmart was off Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 12 7/8 , JC Penney fell Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 42 3/4 ,
Dillards Department Stores lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 26 3/8 and Federated
Department Stores shed Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 18 5/8 .
American depository shares of Mexican companies dropped as turmoil continued
in that country's financial markets. Telmex lost 6.8 per cent of its value
as shares fell Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 37 3/4 . Vitro lost Dollars 2 1/8 at
Dollars 11 3/8 , Coca-Cola Femsa fell Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 21, Grupo
Tribasa dropped Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 17 1/4 and Televisa shed Dollars 2
3/4 at Dollars 29 7/8 .

Equities edged away from the session's lowest levels in late trading, but
still closed sharply weaker on escalating fears about the country's currency
crisis and economic prospects.
The IPC stock index ended 65.89 points, or 2.81 per cent, lower at 2,276.90,
four points off its low point.
Analysts said investors were nervous about rising interest rates and what
the government's next step will be in trying to tackle the peso's relentless
slide against the dollar.
In Brazil the Bovespa index was down as investors sold heavily on concerns
over the Mexican currency. The Bovespa index closed at 41,137 compared with
42,782.
In Buenos Aires the Merval index was down 4 per cent to a year's low of
437.62 compared with 455.98. Losses of 17.2 per cent have been posted since
Mexico devalued the peso last week. Foreign investors sold heavily on
rumours that some banks in Argentina could be facing financial problems.
