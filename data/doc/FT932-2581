FT  18 JUN 93 / Chile in Gatt move on apples
THE European Community's licensing and surveillance system for imported
apples was challenged by Chile yesterday in the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
Chile told Gatt's governing council that countervailing duties imposed on
its apple exports to the Community were contrary to Gatt rules and could
cost its producers Dollars 14m in lost sales, spelling ruin for many. The
two sides are now in consultations over the dispute which may be brought
formally to Gatt if no agreed settlement is reached.
EC restrictions on imported apples have been a frequent source of trade
friction in recent years. Chile and the US both brought and won Gatt cases
against apple import quotas imposed in 1988.
Under the current EC system, import surcharges are automatically levied when
reference prices of apple imports fall below a certain level.
Despite surcharges, Chile's apple exports had not fallen last year, the EC
said, which suggested the duties were not harming trade. Chile was, however,
supported by other countries with similar grievances against the EC,
including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico.
