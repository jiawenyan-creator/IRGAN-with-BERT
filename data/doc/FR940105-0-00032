The proposal put forward by Working Groups 1 and 2 included fields identifying the date and time when release offers,
bids, withdrawals of bids or offers, and capacity awards are posted on pipelines' EBBs. No consensus was reached over
whether fields should be included to identify when pipelines actually received offers, bids, or withdrawals or made
the determination to award capacity. 
The NOPR proposed to require the inclusion of fields for bid receipt date and time, but not for the date and time offers
and withdrawals were received or capacity awarded. Since releasing shippers and pipelines may choose the first come,
first served method to break ties, the Commission found that routine posting of the bid receipt date and time would
permit shippers to verify the award of capacity without having to contact the pipeline. The Commission did not propose
to include the date and time fields for receipt of offers and withdrawals or capacity awards, concluding this information
was not as important to capacity release transactions as the bid information. The Commission stated, however, that
information about the date and time offers and withdrawals were received and capacity awards determined must be provided
by the pipelines upon request. 
Several commenters support the Commission's decision to include only the information about bid receipt in the standardized
data sets.

26

 Some request clarification as to whether pipelines must include both the date and time bids are received and posted
as mandatory fields.

27

 Process Gas Consumers Group contends the Commission should require inclusion of all the contested items. It contends
the date and time for receipt of capacity withdrawals is particularly important because releasing shippers have
only a limited right to withdraw offers; it maintains the date and time information is needed so bidders can determine
whether that right has been exercised validly. It contends pipelines easily can make all the contested information
available in electronic form. The National Registry requests that even if pipelines are not required to post information
concerning the receipt of offers and withdrawals and determination of capacity awards, they should be required to
provide this information in electronic form when requested.

The Commission adheres to its decision not to require pipelines routinely to post the receipt date and time for capacity
offers and withdrawals and the date and time capacity awards are made. The Working Groups could not reach agreement
on providing the additional information, and, as stated in the NOPR, the Commission does not find that this information
is as crucial to capacity release, or will be needed as frequently, as the bid information. The Commission will not
require pipelines to provide the additional information in electronic form, because such a requirement would not
be significantly different than requiring the routine, electronic posting of this information, which the Commission
has determined is not necessary. The ability of users to obtain the information for offers, withdrawals, and awards
upon request appears sufficient. The Commission clarifies that both the bid receipt and bid posting data fields are
mandatory. 
PEC Pipeline Group contends the date and time for bids should be the posting time, arguing if receipt date and time is
used, the information would be unreliable because the bids would not have been verified for accuracy. It maintains
only the date and time of verified bids should be used to break ties. 
The Commission agrees, in principle, that the appropriate information to include is the date and time used to break
ties. However, in most instances, that will be the date and time bids are received, not when they are verified. For example,
when bids are submitted near the end of bidding periods, the pipeline may not verify the bids until after the bid window
closes. Under a first come, first served tie breaking system, capacity would be awarded to the highest bid received
first in time even if the bid was not verified until later. 


3. Operationally Available Capacity 


The Commission proposed to adopt the Working Group's consensus agreement that pipelines provide information on
the amount of unscheduled capacity available at specific locations, such as receipt and delivery points, mainline,
or mainline segments. This field serves to identify the capacity that would be available as interruptible service
from the pipeline. Edison contends this definition would not allow shippers to determine whether firm or interruptible
capacity is available. It suggests operationally available capacity be defined as the capacity a firm shipper can
nominate at a point, asserting this definition would include interruptible capacity that can be displaced by a firm
shipper. Transco contends the amount of unscheduled capacity is proprietary information that would not be provided
in the free market. Williston Basin does not oppose this requirement, but states shippers may be able to use this information
only for trend analysis, not for making decisions on a daily basis. 
The Commission finds the requirement to provide information on operationally available or unscheduled capacity
is necessary to comply with the requirement that pipelines identify the interruptible capacity available on their
systems.

28

 The unscheduled capacity at a point reveals the capacity available as interruptible service. In response to Edison's
comment, the Commission finds that the consensus approach is adequate at this point to disclose both the firm and interruptible
capacity available to potential shippers. The operationally available capacity reveals interruptible service
and pipelines also are required to post the firm service they have available.

29

 The Working Groups still are considering issues relating to operationally available capacity, and the Commission
will be open to modification of this definition if needed.

For example, the Commission is not certain whether Edison and Transco principally are concerned with the definition
of operationally available (or unscheduled) capacity or with the different, albeit somewhat related, issue of whether
additional fields are required to divide scheduled (or nominated) capacity into firm and interruptible components.
The issue of identifying the firm and interruptible components of nominated capacity is still under deliberation
by the Working Groups, and Edison and Transco will have a further opportunity to address these issues in the Working
Group meetings. 
</FOOTNOTE>


ANR asserts that the data field for operationally available capacity should indicate that the data may be estimates.
It also suggests an additional data field to enable the pipeline to qualify the accuracy of any information. The Commission
agrees with ANR that the information in this field may be estimates and leaves to the Working Groups the decision on
whether another field is necessary to convey information about how the estimates are provided.
