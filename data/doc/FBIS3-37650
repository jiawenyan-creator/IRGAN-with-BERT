<F P=106> [Report by Madona Luckaite on news conference at the Seimas </F>
on 21 February] 
  [Excerpt] [Words indistinct] Professor Vytautas 
Landsbergis, leader of the Seimas, speaking at the news 
conference regretted that Lithuania, as a future NATO member, 
has not voiced her position concerning the NATO initiative in 
Bosnia to stop the terrorist shelling of Sarajevo. 
  Russia wants to fortify its positions in Bosnia, therefore, 
political and diplomatic aspects of the fact that Russia is 
coming to Bosnia with its armed forces will be of great 
importance. Also, it is not yet clear if this is taking place 
with the consent of the government and president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. So far there have been reports that Russia 
has declared its intentions to deploy its peacekeeping forces 
around Sarajevo. The statement made by the government of Bosnia 
is also known, Vytautas Landsbergis said, that they do not trust 
the Russians who are supporting the Serbs. 
  Because the military participation by (?Bosnia) in the UN 
forces has already begun it will be important to know whether 
the Russian troops coming to Sarajevo will be seen as Russian 
troops or as part of the United Nations military units. 
  This is also important to Lithuania because attempts to 
distort the history and the situation in the Baltic states are 
continuing. For example, there have been hints of this following 
the statements made by the Latvian politicians in the press 
about whether Latvia was occupied. It will not be beneficial if 
this issue has to be discussed, Vytautas Landsbergis said. In 
the meantime the danger caused by Russia has been directly noted 
by the Estonian leadership. 
  A clearer position toward the Baltic states was presented by 
the British foreign secretary in Riga. He separated the issue 
of the troops withdrawal from other issues, Vytautas Landsbergis 
said. [passage omitted]
