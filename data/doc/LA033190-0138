FULLERTON MAN PLEADS INNOCENT IN GIRL'S KILLING 
Michael Pacewitz, the self-described Satan worshiper who admitted in two 
jailhouse interviews that he had killed a 3-year-old girl, pleaded not guilty 
to murder charges on Friday. 
Municipal Judge Linda Lancet Miller set a May 11 preliminary hearing date for 
Pacewitz, 21, of Fullerton, who is represented by the public defender's office. 
Pacewitz is accused of murder in the March 3 death of Marcelline Onick, who was 
found stabbed to death at her father's apartment. Pacewitz is also charged with 
the attempted murder of his mother and her boyfriend in an incident the night 
before. 
The child's mother, Joanne Boydston, had left the girl and her 9-month-old son 
with Wes Robinson, identified as the baby's father, in Fullerton. The father 
then left the children in the care of Pacewitz's roommate, who then left them 
with Pacewitz. 
Pacewitz, who turned himself in to police, claims he killed the little girl "to 
please Satan."
