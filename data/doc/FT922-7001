FT  21 MAY 92 / Fraud charges shake Brazil's first family
BRAZILIANS, great lovers of soap operas, are glued to a real-life drama
involving the presidential family in a battle which could threaten
governmental stability.
The row erupted with the allegation by Mr Pedro Collor that his older
brother, President Fernando Collor, had been collaborating to help his
campaign treasurer and friend to accumulate wealth through fraudulent means.
Mr Pedro Collor says he has compiled a dossier on Mr Paulo Cesar Farias
(known as PC), elaborating alleged frauds which could incriminate the
president, and has put it on a video-tape now in a safe-deposit box in a New
York bank.
He accuses Mr Farias of having taken Dollars 15m from the Dollars 100m
Collor campaign chest for the 1989 presidential election, and of then using
his friendship with the president to cream off commissions for the award of
government contracts.
Mr Farias strongly denies the allegations, which a presidential aide claims
were provoked by the younger brother's envy of the elder. However, the row
caused the stock markets to fall 5 per cent on Monday, and forced Mrs Leda
Collor, the family matriarch, to intervene to prevent a threat to government
stability.
After intense family efforts to silence Pedro failed, Mrs Collor announced
on Tuesday night that she was sacking her youngest son Pedro from running
the family media empire in their home state of Alagoas, in the far
north-east, claiming that he was 'suffering a serious emotional crisis.'
Yesterday, Mr Pedro Collor was visiting a doctor for a certificate of
sanity. He insists he will not drop his campaign until 'PC is behind bars'.
