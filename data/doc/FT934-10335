FT  05 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Turkish bank raises Dollars
103m
TURKIYE Garanti Bankasi, Turkey's fourth biggest private sector bank, has
raised Dollars 103m through an issue of shares to foreign institutional
investors.
The deal, in the form of American depositary receipts, is only the second
time Turkish shares have been issued internationally - the first was a small
ADR issue by the privately owned Net Holding.
Advisers say the Garanti deal was three times subscribed. 'We've had a
presence in the international debt markets, now we want to establish
ourselves in the equity markets,' said Garanti's chief executive, Mr Akin
Ongor.
The shares were sold by Garanti's major shareholder Mr Ayhan Sahenk, head of
the Dogus Group of companies. The offering reduces his holding to around 51
per cent.
The bank made pre-tax profits of TL 1,230bn (Dollars 96m) in 1992. It has
assets of TL 20,539bn.
