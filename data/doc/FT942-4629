FT  09 JUN 94 / What we are voting for in the European Election
Across Europe, 269m voters are eligible to take part in the elections for
the European parliament today and on Sunday. The vote will decide the
composition of a 567-member assembly with significantly increased powers
under the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty, writes David Marsh,
European Editor. A pan-European opinion poll for the European Commission,
published this week, indicates that 55 per cent of the electorate will be
guided by national issues in their voting intentions, with 37 per cent
looking more to European questions.
Opinion polls show that most voters throughout the Union - with the notable
exceptions of the strongly Eurosceptical electorates in the UK and Denmark -
favour giving the European parliament more power.
At the same time, with governments in most countries suffering unpopularity
as a result of recession and unemployment, a large protest vote is likely in
many countries, led by the UK, Spain and Belgium. The election will deliver
important pointers to national contests in the next 12 months - especially
the general election in Germany in October and the presidential election in
France next May.
