THEY DON'T PULL PUNCHES OVER TROJAN-IRISH GAME 
Sour grapes? Stupidity? I guess it's a little of each. Jim Murray's column on 
Notre Dame really smacks of both. What is a Cadillac Catholic? Is he a BMW 
atheist? What's his message? Are all Catholic schools supposed to inform all 
their coaches now to lose, so they won't have a bad impression of their 
schools? Come on. 
Give Notre Dame credit, they came back in the second half and beat a good USC 
team. 
Obviously, Murray was rooting for USC. Better luck next time or maybe Notre 
Dame should drop USC, not much of a challenge there anymore.
