FT  04 FEB 94 / Property: Securum looks to the Ark to stay afloat - The UK
disposal strategy adopted by Sweden's Securum Property Holdings
Securum Property Holdings is one of the most important new overseas players
in the UK property market. But, unlike other newcomers, its job is to sell,
not buy, commercial property.
The company was set up last November to liquidate the UK property assets
secured on loans made by Nordbanken, a Swedish bank that was the single
biggest casualty of the crisis in Sweden's banking system in the late 1980s.
Securum Property Holdings is a subsidiary of Securum, which was created by
the Swedish government in October 1992 to take over Nordbanken's portfolio
of SKr67bn in bad and doubtful loans. Securum's goal was 'to recover . . .
non-performing loans and loss exposures . . . by taking possession of the
underlying assets, assuming an active ownership role and creating future
growth in value'.
Securum's UK holdings, which make up its largest overseas operation, include
Bricom, an airport servicing and parcel delivery company; a hotel group that
operates seven hotels; and a finance subsidiary.
Property is the largest single component of the British holdings. It
accounts for 60 per cent of the loans made by Nordbanken for UK
acquisitions. These loans were originally valued at between Pounds 650m and
Pounds 700m but were written down to Pounds 380m at the end of 1992; the
decline in UK property values was a contributory factor.
Overseeing the refurbishment and possible sale of the UK properties is the
responsibility of Mr Phil Alexander, whose previous experience includes
dismantling parts of the failed Mountleigh and Rosehaugh property
portfolios.
Securum presents a special set of problems arising from its unique origins.
Moreover, there were additional legal complications relating to the bad loan
book. The UK portfolio includes 180 properties, developed by more than 100
individuals and spread throughout the country. The portfolio, which is
mainly split between offices (60 per cent), retail (9 per cent) and
industrial (27 per cent), includes some in prime locations, such as Bond
Street in central London. But many of the properties are in secondary
locations, largely because Nordbanken loaned to developers active at the end
of the last UK property cycle whose deals were often concentrated in fringe
areas.
One example in Securum's portfolio is its biggest single property, the Ark,
a striking, award-winning development built by Ake Larson Byggare, a Swedish
contractor, in Hammersmith, west London.
Bringing some coherence to this ragged portfolio is a priority for Securum
Property Holdings. 'At the moment we have a mish-mash of buildings. We are
trying to get some reasoning into our portfolio,' says Mr Alexander. 'We are
trying to build up a well-balanced portfolio,' he adds.
Mr Alexander's strategy is to sell the buildings that do not need, or do not
justify, a further expenditure of effort. Last year, Securum Property
Holdings sold properties totalling Pounds 34m. The biggest sale was the
57,000 sq ft Adelaide House in Chiswick, west London, which was bought by
Postel for about Pounds 15m. A similar value of property is due to be sold
this year.
Mr Alexander believes the remaining core of the portfolio has the potential
to increase in value. His initial goal is to reduce the vacancy rate from a
current high level in excess of 35 per cent to 10 per cent in the next 12
months. Much depends on finding tenants for the Ark, which accounts for 10
per cent of the portfolio by square footage. 'The key to achieving our
objective is to ensure lettings at the Ark,' says Mr Alexander.
In addition, Securum Property Holdings believes it can add value to its
properties by investing in them. For instance, one of the most disastrous
property loans made by Nordbanken in the UK was for an office development at
Kingston, Surrey. Today the development's value is less than a tenth of the
original Pounds 11m loan, largely the result of the developers contravening
planning permission by building without the agreed number of parking spaces.
But Securum Property Holdings believes the development will recoup some of
its losses with a further investment of Pounds 2m, by buying adjacent land,
building a car park and finding a tenant.
Mr Alexander's goal is to build up the UK portfolio to a core property group
worth Pounds 200m by 1995. He is determined to sell Securum Property
Holdings in its entirety. 'Selling off properties one by one is not the way
we can best add value,' he says. His plan is to sell the core portfolio by
1996, possibly through a flotation or reverse takeover. 'We want to round
off the strategy of adding value for the Swedish taxpayer,' he says.
