FT  07 SEP 94 / BT hopes for video link are scorned
British Telecommunications was accused yesterday of being 'wildly
optimistic' over its plans for video-on-demand services, Raymond Snoddy
writes. CIT Research, the London-based communications analysts, said BT
might be greatly overestimating potential demand.
CIT based its judgment on an internal BT memo leaked at the end of last year
which suggested that the company, due to begin extensive trials of the new
services next year, hoped to have a base of 8m subscribers, each paying
about Pounds 250 a year at current prices.
Ms Liz Baker, CIT's project director, said that even if BT launched the
service at the beginning of 1996, which was highly optimistic, the
organisation would have to achieve a growth rate of 2m sales a year. 'That
would be four times faster than the take-up of the satellite TV dish, which
is the fastest-selling consumer electronics item ever launched in the UK,'
she said.
