BURBANK IN THE SMOG 
The picture with the article "Smog-Ridden Burbank to Study How to Cut Car Use" 
by Greg Braxton (Jan. 12) speaks for the smog-saturated downtown Burbank. Here 
we see, in one picture, four RTD smog-producing buses. The city of Burbank 
should now realize that light-rail vehicles are long overdue. 
It is virtually impossible to "cut the number of single-car trips," as the city 
fathers suggest. The only way to cut emissions feeding smog is to go with 
cleaner energy, and that includes reducing the bus fleet and replacing heavily 
traveled lines with light rail. 
All the money that has been used just in rail studies could have provided the 
whole Los Angeles mega-opolis with a super-transit system to the benefit of 
all.
