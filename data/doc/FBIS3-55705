  [Text] Baku, January 8 (TURAN) -- During the latest 
fightings at the southern sector of the front a Russian citizen, 
Lugovoy, Vladimir Vasilyevich, (1960) was taken prisoner. 
  A dweller of Krasnoyarsk region Vladimir Lugovoy was 
recruited on November 1993 by the leader of Armenian community 
of Pyatigorsk to fight in Karabakh. As Lugovoy said, special 
groups of Armenians actively recruit Russians in Moscow, 
Saint-Petersburg, Minvodi, Krasnodar and Vladikavkaz and send 
them to Armenia and Karabakh. Besides, Russian businessmen of 
Armenian origin transfer a certain per cent of their income to 
the special account for purchasing arms for Karabakh fighters. 
  As Lugovoy said, the recruiters prefer highly qualified 
retired servicemen. So, Lugovoy himself is a scout who served 
in Germany for a few years. 
  As Lugovoy also said, they promised to pay him 35 thousand 
rubles per day. Women sharp-shooters from Estonia and Latvia 
are being paid in hard currency for each killed Azeri. The 
mercenary also said that two Russian mercenaries from Voronezh 
were killed by Armenians for "being too insistent" in their 
demands to pay them fee earned for several months. 
  According to Lugovoy Russian battalion, recruited from the 
servicemen of the 7th Russian Army, a battalion consisting of 
Cossacks living along the Don River, a Special Battalion 
consisting of Russians and Cossacks are fighting on the Armenian 
side at Fizuli line of advance.
