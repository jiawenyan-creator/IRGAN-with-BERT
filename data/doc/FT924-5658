FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Karstadt lifts group sales to
DM14.5bn
KARSTADT, Germany's largest department store group, yesterday reported that
group sales climbed by DM1.1bn (Dollars 686m), around 8 per cent, to
DM14.5bn in the first nine months of the current year.
The group said that although the consumer climate had deteriorated in
Germany in the third quarter of the year, the retail sector had livened up
slightly in September and predicted that the trend would continue in the
run-up to Christmas.
It said that although sales for the year would exceed the 1991 level,
profits would not reach the same level of last year because of increased
costs: operating costs climbed by 11.5 per cent, reflecting staff numbers up
from 49,619 to 52,719.
Group profits last year were DM256.99m on gross sales of DM20.13bn.
