FT  02 FEB 94 / Polls show support for Japanese premier
Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's popularity has rebounded since
his victory on political reform, even though most people think it will
change nothing, writes William Dawkins. Polls by two newspapers yesterday
showed Mr Hosokawa had a 74 per cent support rating, a sharp recovery from
last month's level of about 60 per cent.
One poll confirmed dissatisfaction with the two main parties, the LDP and
Social Democratic party.
