  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee member and Guangdong 
Provincial CPC Committee secretary, delivered an important 
speech at a meeting at which provincial department-level cadres 
from Guangzhou and across the province reported their study of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  In his speech, Xie Fei first and foremost called for 
attaching great importance to theory study. He also called on 
leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in studying and 
applying the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics in the process of in-depth reform and rapid 
socialist market economic structure building, deeming it an 
important task at the moment. 
  Xie Fei maintained: In theory study we should concentrate on 
studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, as well as modern knowledge and 
socialist market economic theory. At present, we should focus 
on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and the book What Is the 
Socialist Market Economy, as well. 
  In the end, Xie Fei emphatically stated: In order to push 
forward the ongoing modernization drive and basically realize 
modernization in Guangdong within a period of 20 years, we 
should strive to improve the quality of leading cadres, heighten 
their leadership standard, and refine their leadership skills. 
To this end, leading cadres at all levels should spend more time 
and devote more energies to theory study, take theory study as 
an important task, and successfully accomplish such a task as 
arming the whole party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
