FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Major letter to UN
MANY more Kurds could die in mountain camps if the UN relief operation was
not speeded up, the prime minister warned in a letter to the United Nations
yesterday.
He told Mr Perez de Cuellar, the UN Secretary-General that Britain had
become increasingly impatient, disappointed and concerned about the 'tardy'
approach by the UN in helping with relief supplies and in organising a
police force to protect the Kurds from any Iraqi aggression.
There should be less talk from the UN and more action, Mr Major said.
