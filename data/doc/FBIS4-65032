  [Text] Istanbul, May 9 (A.A.) -- Energy Minister Veysel 
Atasoy, who returned to Turkey after concluding his visit to 
Egypt, on Monday [9 May] said that Turkey aims for an output 300 
billion kilowatt hours of electricity by the year 2010. 
  Speaking to reporters at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, he said 
that during the meetings in Cairo the inter-connection system 
between Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt was discussed and 
the project agreement signed in 1989 is in the construction 
stage. 
  He said the agreement has been put on hold because of the 
Gulf crisis, adding that the first part of the project, 
stretching between Turkey, Syria and Jordan, according to the 
agreement signed in Cairo last week, will be operational in 1997. 
  The second part, foreseeing the link between Syria and Iraq 
will be in service in 1998. 
  `With this system, all five countries' electrical systems 
will be linked to one another,' he said. 
  Atasoy also said that the total value of the project is 620 
million U.S. dollars, of which 396 million dollars will be 
provided from the Arab Fund, adding 167 miles (270 kms) of the 
system between Egypt and Jordan will be constructed by Turkey. 
  He said while energy is being produced, the environment 
should not be polluted and the ideal for this is hydroelectric 
and natural gas plants, adding Turkey plans to construct two 
electric plants.
