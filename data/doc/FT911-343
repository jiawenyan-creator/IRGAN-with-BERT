MOWLEM MANAGEMENT has been awarded a further contract by the Directorate of
Works, Home Office, at Strangeways Prison, Manchester.
Following on from the award of the new entry complex, it has been appointed

to the north of the main prison complex. The work is a further phase of the
overall refurbishment scheme for HM Prison, Manchester.
The works will include new kitchen facilities, a physical and recreational
centre and a new training and industries centre together with major
reconstruction works to external areas, including upgrading of perimeter
security and the construction of a road bridge across Sherbourne Street
connecting the Croft site to the main prison complex and the new entrance
facilities.
Pre-commencement work on the project has started with construction scheduled
to commence in July and completion in December 1992.
