  [Text] At a news conference held by leaders of the Slavic 
Union Belaya Rus, journalists have been informed of several 
resolutions adopted during the Union's recent congress, as well 
as of the participation of Union representatives in the meeting 
of Slavic patriotic organizations in Kiev. 
  Organizers of the news conference stressed that, with regard 
to the increased tendency to bring a categorical tone to 
international dialogue, participants in the Kiev meeting -- 
representatives of patriotic organizations from Ukraine, the 
Russian Federation, Belarus, and Poland -- protested against the 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine and Belarus. 
  To resist the establishment of a "new world order," the 
Slavic Union intends to convene the World Slavic Congress in 
summer 1994. For this purpose, the Union Belaya Rus has already 
established a Belarusian committee to make preparations for the 
Congress. 
  Union representatives also stated that the current Supreme 
Soviet is incapable of resolving any important issues, and 
therefore it should adopt a new electoral law and a resolution 
to hold early elections in the fall of 1994.
