  [Text] It was confirmed on 11 March that North Korea is 
developing two new types of long-distance surface-to-surface 
missiles with a longer range than Nodong-1 (whose range is 1,000 
km). 
  Regarding foreign papers' recent reports that North Korea is 
developing new types of missiles with a range of either 2,000 km 
or 3,500 km (tentatively named Taepodong 1 and 2), a government 
intelligence source said: The contents of the reports are 
generally true. U.S. intelligence authorities notified ROK 
authorities early this year about this development. 
Intelligence authorities of the two countries have thereby been 
keeping careful watch.
