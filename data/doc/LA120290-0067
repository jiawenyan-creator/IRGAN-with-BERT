CELEBRITY BATHROOMS 
After reading "Hot Property" over the last few months we have a question. 
Why is it these (so-called) celebrities always seem to buy homes that have more 
bathrooms than bedrooms? Is it possible these wealthy celebrities all have 
bladder problems? 
In these days when there are so many people sleeping in the streets, it seems 
obscene and disgusting for anyone to own such huge homes. These people could 
try to help others more and spend less on their ridiculously huge homes.
