BLAST IN NEW DELHI CLAIMS 8TH VICTIM 
A 3-year-old Pakistani girl died Tuesday, the eighth person killed by a 
powerful time bomb packed with nuts and bolts that blasted New Delhi's railroad 
station. 
Police blamed Sikh extremists for Monday's blast, which left 41 people 
seriously injured. 
No one immediately claimed responsibility, but New Delhi Deputy Police Chief V. 
N. Singh said extremists fighting for an independent Sikh homeland in north 
India's Punjab state are the main suspects.
