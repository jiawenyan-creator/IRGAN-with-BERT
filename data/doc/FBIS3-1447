  [Text] There is no end in sight at the moment to the 
infighting at the top of Liberia's ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction. Earlier tonight the 
Mandingo leader, Alhaji Koromah, denied claims by his Krahn 
rival Roosevelt Johnson that Koromah's supporters have been 
driven out of their stronghold at Tubmanburg. 
  The allegations made on this program yesterday followed hard 
on the heels of claims that Johnson had joined forces with 
Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] 
faction, which have also been denied. And the ULIMO split has 
become the latest headache for Liberia's newly installed 
Transitional Council and for the ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African States Monitoring Group] peacekeeping force. Our 
Monrovia correspondent Ni Nartey Alison has just been to 
Tubmanburg to check the claims for himself. He telexed us this 
report [read by announcer]: 
  In Tubmanburg, ULIMO fighters loyal to Alhaji Koromah walked 
the streets brandishing assault rifles, and the odor of dead 
bloated bodies fills the air. Mohamed Dumbuya, Koromah's 
military chief told me: We are in complete control of this town 
and if Johnson claims he controls Tubmanburg let him come to 
visit his men. The town is virtually deserted with the few 
remaining residents holed up indoors as fighters strut along the 
streets. The city is also full of mass graves and the stench of 
decomposed bodies is virtually everywhere. 
  According to Dumbuya, each mass grave contains five bodies 
of dissidents and some civilians caught in crossfire during 
fighting in Tubmanburg last Friday [25 March]. Dumbuya claimed 
that over 200 Krahn forces were trapped and killed during the 
battle. He said Johnson will pay the price of those who have 
died since March 6 when the fighting started. He claimed that 
200 Mandingos were killed last week in Kakata and Bong Mine, a 
mining city 30 miles east of Tubmanburg, by Krahn forces. One 
Mandingo commander who identified himself only as Kolut told me: 
I sense that the Krahns will break away. This is why in the 
area I control, I reduce the number of Krahn men to 15. In 
fact, by now they are slaves. They are on my farm. 
  Meanwhile, more than 60 women, children, and young boys who 
fled the fighting last Friday have been rescued from hideouts in 
the surrounding forest.
