SCHNEIDER WINS 6TH WORLD CUP SKIING RACE 
Vreni Schneider of Switzerland won her sixth World Cup race of the season today 
and became a clear favorite to dominate the World Alpine Skiing Championships 
at Vail, Colo., in 25 days. 
While Schneider won a women's slalom, her third of the season, and appears in 
top form for Jan. 29-Feb. 12 in Vail, American Tamara McKinney was third and 
also could be heard from at the world championships. 
But Schneider, the 24-year-old double Olympic gold medalist who looks to be 
well on her way toward capturing the 1988-89 World Cup, was cautious not to 
accept premature laurels. 
"I'm still not thinking of ultimate victory because there are still a lot of 
races left until the end of the season. I still remember last year's injury," 
she said. 
Last year, when she captured the Olympic slalom and giant slalom titles, she 
led the World Cup standings until she had a bad spill in a race at Aspen, 
Colo., and tore ligaments in her left knee. 
Second in today's race, held in dense fog, was Austrian Monika Maierhofer, in 
1:23.81.
