FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: The causes of an increased tax burden
Sir, For Labour's success in drawing attention to the increased tax burden
under the Tories to be condemned by your leader ('Campaigning in earnest',
January 11) as 'remarkably dishonest electioneering', it must have touched a
raw nerve, indeed]
The truth may hurt especially when it collides with conventional wisdom and
the outpourings of the government propaganda machine, but that is no reason
for it to be withheld from public debate.
The causes of the increased tax burden lie in a combination of increased
VAT, national insurance contributions and rates/poll tax, even as marginal
rates of income tax have come down; at the same time rising personal incomes
and the resultant fiscal drag have pushed the average tax burden up, since
marginal income tax rates, though diminished, still exceed the average. But
this simply confirms Labour's contention that economic growth, given our
still elastic tax system, inevitably yields a useful fiscal dividend.
Labour's research, based on official answers to parliamentary questions,
also shows that the rising tax burden hit those on average earnings and
below, while only those on well above average earnings enjoyed a reduction.
Hence, the case in social justice for Labour's proposed national insurance
and tax changes affecting top earners - and the linked increases in pensions
and child benefit.
Incidentally, what is true of household taxation under the Tories also holds
for the corporate sector. While the statutory rate of corporation tax has
fallen from 52 per cent to 33 per cent, the phasing out of initial capital
allowances and other factors have resulted in a near doubling in the
effective rate of tax on non-North Sea industrial and commercial companies:
from 16.6 per cent in 1978 to 28.6 per cent in 1990.
