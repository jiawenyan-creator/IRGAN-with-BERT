FT  13 JUL 94 / People: Fourth generation of Bowthorpes at OCS
Gerald Bowthorpe 55, has been appointed managing director of OCS Group,
succeeding David Cracknell, 63, who has become group chairman, following the
retirement of Derek Goodliffe at 62. Goodliffe and Cracknell assumed control
of the company in 1975, since when it has become one of the UK's largest
privately-owned property support services companies, with annual turnover of
Pounds 230m for 1993-94.
Bowthorpe's connections with the company go back a long way; his father,
Harry Bowthorpe, played a key role in expanding the one-man window-cleaning
operation started by Frederick Goodliffe in 1900.
The group is now on to its fourth generation of Bowthorpes, with 23 members
of the family employed.
Gerald Bowthorpe joined OCS in 1957 and, apart from assisting Her Majesty's
armed forces (during national service), has been with the group ever since.
One of the many roles he has played within the group was as managing
director of a subsidiary, the New Century Cleaning company. Before this
latest appointment, he was chairman of Office Cleaning Services Ltd, the
largest OCS subsidiary.
Through acquisitions and diversifications - within the UK and overseas  -
OCS has extended far beyond its origins of providing office cleaning
services, which now account for less than 50 per cent of group income.
