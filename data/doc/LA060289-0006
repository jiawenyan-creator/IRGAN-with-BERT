'CLARIFYING A CONTROVERSY' 
As you suggested ("Clarifying a Controversy," editorial, May 22) surtaxes on 
higher incomes of retired persons might be justified as partial financing for 
increased Medicare benefits. However, this overlooks a very important reason 
for complaint. A more steeply graded use of progressive taxation should in all 
fairness be applied to all taxpayers, and not only to the elderly. 
Medicare expenditures are made primarily to the elderly. Funds for basic 
education are largely expended for the young -- but school children are not 
asked to pay additional taxes for this benefit. Government action to stimulate 
full employment most directly affects those between childhood and retirement. 
Guaranteeing such basic human rights is a responsibility of all of us. The 
principle of taxation on the basis of ability to pay should be applied equally 
to all taxpayers.
