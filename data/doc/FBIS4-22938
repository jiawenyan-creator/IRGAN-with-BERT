  [Abstract] Specimens of surface-layer sorbents (fractions 
of 0.16 to 0.22 mm) were prepared based on chromosorb G-AW, 
inerton AW, and Celite-545 with molecular sieves of the type 
NaX, NaY, and Na-mordenite and a crystal size of 1 to 10 m. 
The content of active adsorbent on the surface of each 
surface-layer sorbent ranged from 20 to 50 percent of the solid 
carrier's weight. An LKhM-8MD gas chromatograph with a heat 
conduction detector was used for the studies; helium or hydrogen 
served as the carrier gas. A stainless steel column was filled 
by means of a vacuum pump and conditioned at 300C for 3 
hours. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate, column 
capacity coefficient, and criterion for the separation of 
various vapors (K[.sub]p[/]) were determined to estimate the 
surface-layer sorbents' quality and properties. The 
surface-layer sorbents' chromatographic properties were found to 
depend on the active sorbent used, the amount of active sorbent, 
and the type of solid carrier. The analytical packed columns 
containing the study surface-layer sorbent specimens had CO 
capacity coefficients ranging from 0.5 to 1.4. Inerton AW with 
33 percent NaX, Celite-545 with 20 percent NaX, and chromosorb 
G-AW with 30 percent NaY had the highest capacity and separative 
power. The surface-layer sorbent proved more efficient than did 
the bulk sorbent used for purposes of comparison: Unlike the 
conventional sorbent, at high carrier gas velocities (100 to 300 
ml/min), when the wash-out of the moving band of sorbate is 
dictated by the kinetics of mass transfer only in the 
near-surface layer, the surface-layer sorbent manifested only a 
slight drop in efficiency. Use of the surface-layer sorbent thus 
made it possible to reduce the height equivalent to a 
theoretical plate and to simultaneously reduce the generally 
observed dependence of the increase in height on an increase in 
carrier gas velocity, which is especially important when 
performing fast analyses. When high-efficiency columns filled 
with surface-layer sorbent were used, fast analysis of a mixture 
of fixed gases was completed in only 10 to 13 seconds (versus 
the 6 minutes required in the case of a column filled with bulk 
adsorbent). In columns of a surface-layer sorbent containing 
NaX, K[.sub]p[/] equaled 1.67 for nitrogen/nitrogen oxide 
vapor and 1.52 for nitrogen/carbon oxide vapor. Figures 5;
