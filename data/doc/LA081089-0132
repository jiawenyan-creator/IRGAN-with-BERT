MEXICO SEIZES COCAINE SHIP 
A Mexican navy cutter seized a Panamanian freighter off Cabo San Lucas, on the 
tip of Baja California, arrested about a dozen crew members and seized one 
metric ton of cocaine, the attorney general's office said. A spokesman 
Wednesday said he believes the crew is Colombian and that the drug was being 
smuggled to the United States.
