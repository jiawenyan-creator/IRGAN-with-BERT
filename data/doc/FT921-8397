FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Aristuein's Pounds 5m buy creates Bank of
Edinburgh Group
ARISTUEIN, a company set up in 1990 with the aim of acquiring small to
medium-sized building societies, has acquired the Goode Durrant Bank.
The bank will now change its name to Bank of Edinburgh and Aristuein will
change its own name to Bank of Edinburgh Group.
Goode Durrant Bank was a subsidiary of Goode Durrant, the vehicle hire,
motor distribution and building group.
Aristuein paid Pounds 5m for the bank and as part of the deal sold Goode
Durrant Bank's loan portfolio at its written down book value of Pounds 1.4m
to another subsidiary of the Goode Durrant group.
The portfolio consisted of loans to property developers in the south of
England.
The bank, which inherits a 'stable depositor base,' according to Aristuein,
will now concentrate on taking personal savings and providing residential
mortgages.
It will market itself through the press and independent financial
intermediaries.
Mr Ken Murray, managing director of Aristuein, said it had always been the
intention of the company to secure Bank of England permission to convert
itself into a bank called Bank of Edinburgh, either before or as part of a
merger with a building society.
Aristuein was set up in December 1990 with Pounds 26m of capital from UK and
European institutions with the aim of taking over building societies and
merging them into a federation which would be strong enough to compete with
larger institutions.
Mr Murray said yesterday that it was in talks with several building
societies about possible mergers but the discussions were covered by
confidentiality agreements. 'We are very ambitious,' he said.
