NATION; 
GRANDCHILD ABUSE CHARGES DROPPED 
Charges that a Harvard University professor and his wife molested their 
grandchildren have been dismissed, officials said today. 
The charges against William Moran, 64, and Suzanne Moran, 61, were dropped at 
the request of the district attorney's office, officials said. Last December, 
the couple pleaded innocent to charges, brought by their daughter, that they 
sexually assaulted their grandchildren while they were in their care between 
June, 1985, and June, 1987. The children are now 7 and 4 years old. William 
Moran is a professor of Assyriology and his wife is administrator of the First 
Congregational Church.
