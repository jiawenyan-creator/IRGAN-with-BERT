  [Text] Kiev 12 April, TASS -- The Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry laments over the fact the Bosnian developments entailed 
the use of force, a briefing at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry 
was told here today. 
  Political settlement brought no results, the U.N. 
peace-makers, including the Ukrainian battalion, were 
jeopardized. The Ukrainian side understands the situation but 
is dissatisfied with the fact no one consulted Ukraine before 
the air-strikes. Ukraine hopes for a peaceful political 
settlement of the Balkan conflict, said speakers at the briefing. 
  Commenting on the recent Ukrainian elections, the speakers 
said they were held in the atmosphere of democracy and 
lawfulness. Inconsiderable violations registered at some polling 
stations did not influence the general atmosphere, they noted 
referring to estimations of international observers.
