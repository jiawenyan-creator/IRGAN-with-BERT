FT  10 SEP 93 / French farm protest called
France's largest farm union, the FNSEA, called for a nationwide day of
protest on September 20 to press the European Community to renegotiate the
Blair House farm trade agreement with the US, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Luc Guyau, the union's leader, said the protest would be on the day EC
foreign and farm ministers were due to discuss the pact in Brussels.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt secretary-general, has warned that reopening the
Blair House draft agreement would endanger a December 15 deadline for
concluding the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation talks. He said
yesterday the talks would be in crisis unless quick solutions were found to
outstanding issues.
