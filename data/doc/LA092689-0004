An accused drug trafficker arrested in Colombia is wanted on U.S. charges of 
running an operation that shipped tons of the illegal drug methaqualone to the 
United States, the Justice Department said. The suspect, Carlos Humberto Gomez 
Zapata, is accused of directing a ring that shipped tons of the drug, also 
known as Quaaludes, from West Germany and Austria through Panama to Colombia, 
from where it was smuggled into the United States. Gomez was jailed over the 
weekend, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Washington is 
expected to seek his extradition to the United States for trial.
