FT  29 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US company to develop Argentine
lithium project
FMC Corporation of the US is to proceed with the development of major
lithium deposits in north-western Argentina.
It has signed a 40-year contract with the government in 1991 to explore and
develop a lithium production facility at the Salar del Hombre Muerto dry
lake bed in the province of Catamarca, 800 miles from Buenos Aires.
FMC says production will begin in less than three years and require
investment of over Dollars 45m. It has not disclosed the deposit's reserves,
but says they are sufficient for 70 years' production.
FMC's decision follows last month's announcement by IMZ of Canada and MIM of
Australia to go ahead with a Dollars 600m gold and copper project, also in
Catamarca. More large mining projects are in the pipeline, following last
year's enactment of pro-business mining legislation.
Government officials claim that once the project is fully operational,
Argentina will rank among the world's principal producers of lithium, with
annual exports worth some Dollars 20m.
The agreement ends 30 months of wrangling over the future of the Salar del
Hombre Muerto deposit, held up by negotiations with the Catamarca provincial
government over royalties and political intrigue. By law, royalties are set
by local governments.
