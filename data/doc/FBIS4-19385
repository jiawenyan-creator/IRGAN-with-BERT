  [Text] Turkey has announced that the escalating violence 
in Israel and in the occupied territories cause concern. In a 
statement, the Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the mutual 
attacks being perpetrated by extremists and causing the death of 
innocent Israelis and Palestinians. The statement says: It must 
be understood by all that terrorism will not help achieve any 
legitimate aims. We call on the sides to jointly fight 
terrorism and to cooperate in order not to halt the negotiating 
process at this critical stage of the peace negotiations. We 
hope that the terrorist activities which intensified in recent 
days are not repeated.
