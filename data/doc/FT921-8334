FT  18 FEB 92 / Further university places to be funded
AN EXTRA 18,000 university places will be funded next year, the University
Funding Council said yesterday. This is double the increase previously
announced.
Universities fear that the increase will lead to a sharp deterioration in
teaching quality unless extra resources are provided.
The council, a quango which distributes state grants to universities,
announced the extra places as part of an 8.5 per cent increase in funding
for university teaching in 1992-93. Funds for research will rise by 11 per
cent, to be distributed on a more selective basis than previously.
The extra places represent a 6 per cent increase on the current quota,
taking the number of funded places to 322,000. The extra students have been
allocated to universities with the lowest unit costs.
Professor Graeme Davies, funding council chief executive, said: 'We have
rewarded those institutions that are doing most to provide extra places at
lowest cost.'
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said, however, that
universities faced a 1.5 per cent cut in teaching funds, allowing for
inflation and the extra students.
The funding council says this is a reasonable efficiency gain, but Dr David
Harrison, committee chairman, said: 'More than 1,500 extra teaching staff
will be needed to teach the 18,000 new students if class sizes are not to
rise even further and staff are still to have time for research.'
Research funding will be concentrated on institutions and departments with
high scores in the UFC's assessment of research quality.
