  [Abstract] When one uses the path of a signal to determine 
the distance between a source and receiver, the classic 
requirement of object visibility is eliminated. The prime source 
of information becomes the radiation scattered by the medium 
between the source and receiver. This article examines one 
possible method of determining the distance to a pulse source 
using the time dependence of the degree of polarization of 
recorded scattered radiation. If the distance is known, this 
method may be used to obtain information on the microphysical 
properties of the scattering medium. It is found that the time 
required to reach the maximum degree of polarization is directly 
proportional to the distance between the source and receiver. If 
one knows the scattering angle and the sighting angle one can 
determine the distance by measuring the maximum polarization 
time. The factor of pulse length is considered. An alternate 
method is presented which involves measurements taken at two 
unequal sighting angles. Figures 3; references 3 (Russian).
