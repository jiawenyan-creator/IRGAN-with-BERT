FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Lower profitability at South
Korean banks
South Korean commercial banks reported lower profitability in 1993, hit by
two cuts in interest rates and the increased burden of corporate taxes and
internal reserve requirements, according to the Office of Bank Supervision,
AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
In a report on the management of domestic banks, the banking regulatory body
said that their after-tax net profits amounted to Won889.1bn (Dollars 1.1bn)
in 1993, a 4.5 per cent decline on the previous year's Won931.4bn.
Combined operating income totalled Won2,900bn in 1993, up 11.6 per cent from
Won2,600bn.
Combined assets expanded by 18.6 per cent to Won198,490bn, slower than the
previous year's 19.9 per cent rise.
Bad debts, defined as debts on which payments on principal or interest are
more than six months overdue, totalled Won2,930bn at the end of 1993, up
20.9 per cent.
The annualised rise of such debts was the first since 1988. The bank blamed
some large bankruptcies, including Hanyang, a leading construction company.
