MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD PLOT WITH EX-TUSTIN BANKER 
A man with alleged ties to organized crime pleaded guilty in U.S. District 
Court here Monday to one count of wire fraud in connection with a scheme with a 
former Tustin banker and another man to fraudulently obtain credit lines at 
five Las Vegas casinos. 
Morton Goodman, 53, faces five years in prison and a $1-million fine after 
negotiating a plea agreement in which two other wire-fraud charges and a 
conspiracy charge will be dropped. Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 13. 
The former president of Far Western Bank in Tustin, Roger McGinnis, pleaded 
guilty last month to one count of conspiracy in connection with the case, and 
will be sentenced Jan. 18. A third man, John DeMattia, has also pleaded guilty. 
Prosecutors said that in 1984 McGinnis provided casinos with false financial 
information indicating that Goodman and DeMattia had large bank balances, thus 
enabling the two men to obtain substantial credit lines. 
The casinos allegedly defrauded in the scheme were Binion's Horseshoe, the Las 
Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand and the Desert Inn and Country Club.
