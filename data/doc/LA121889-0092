P. M. BRIEFING; 
SEC SETS UP FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARM 
The Securities and Exchange Commission today said it is creating a post to 
coordinate enforcement cooperation with foreign stock regulators. 
SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden announced the new post during a news conference 
to report on his recent meetings with securities regulators in France and the 
Netherlands. 
The new Office of International Affairs will be headed by Michael D. Mann, now 
an associate director for international affairs in the SEC's Enforcement 
Division. 
Breeden said the new office, which will be responsible for negotiating formal 
cooperation agreements, known as memoranda of understanding, underlines "the 
very high priority" the SEC places on international coordination.
