PROFITS at Hambro Insurance Services, the insurance services company which
obtained a stock market listing in March, have been dented by a fall in the
number of claims handled by the group's loss adjusting subsidiary.
For the six months to September 30 pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 3.25m
(Pounds 4.02m). Earnings per share fell to 3.05p (4.25p) and the interim
dividend is 1.85p.
Turnover in loss adjusting increased marginally to Pounds 18.91m (Pounds
18.89m), but profits fell from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 372,000. The group's
UK loss adjusting subsidiary, Cunningham UK, has handled an average of 4,600
claims a month, compared with 5,200 this time last year.
As a result, 46 of the loss adjusting staff have been made redundant, saving
the group some Pounds 700,000.

and other telephone helplines, increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 6.12m
(Pounds 5.22m), with profits up to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 1.62m).

to Pounds 567,000 (Pounds 521,000). Profits at Berkeley Insurance, a
specialist broking consultancy, were also ahead of last year, rising to

Interest receivable by holding company net of overheads amounted to Pounds
146,000.
