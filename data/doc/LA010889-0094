Sikh militants, who pledged to avenge the execution of two Sikhs in the 
assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, killed 14 Hindus 
in two attacks in the northern state of Punjab. Gunmen shot dead 10 farmhands 
in one attack and killed four workers at a brick kiln in the second attack. A 
note left at one of the sites said it was the first revenge for the deaths of 
Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, who were hanged Friday for their roles in the 
1984 killing of Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.
