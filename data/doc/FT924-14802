FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Patten vows to end NUS
'closed shop'
AUTOMATIC membership of the National Union of Students will end soon, Mr
John Patten, education secretary, promised in a speech to the conference
yesterday.
He said only a few students became involved in supporting 'dubious causes'
through the NUS. 'In a free country, that is their privilege,' he said. 'But
why should the taxpayer have to pay for it?' NUS subscriptions are paid
automatically for most students by local authorities.
'We have abolished the closed shop everywhere else. There is no reason why
it should linger on in our universities and colleges,' he said. 'The NUS
closed shop must go. It must go soon, and go it will.'
The announcement was met with roars of approval from the hall.
The NUS, which has an annual income of about Pounds 2m from affiliation
fees, rejected Mr Patten's 'closed shop' claim. 'We are more like the
Confederation of British industry than a traditional trade union,' it said.
'We represent students' interests at national level and provide a range of
services such as welfare officers counselling people with financial and
accommodation problems.'
Mr Patten's speech concentrated on the familiar themes of choice, diversity
and standards, praising the achievements of grant-maintained schools in
England and Wales.
'I want to see all schools going grant-maintained,' he said. 'That's local
accountability and devolution of power to the people at its best.'
Several speakers complained that schools thinking of opting out often met
discouragement and disinformation from Labour-controlled local authorities.
It would be a government priority to 'sweep away the barriers erected
against schools who want to opt out', Mr Patten said.
'Shamefully, some local education authorities continue to squander your
money on trying to discourage parents from balloting. This abuse of public
funds has got to stop.'
