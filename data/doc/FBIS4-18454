Rights in Turkey"; as released by Brussels EUROPE] 
  [Text] Brussels, 31 Mar 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- Pursuant to 
the common foreign and security policy, the Council of the 
European Union published the following statement: "The European 
Union [EU] expresses its concern at the aggravation of the human 
rights situation in Turkey, including the lifting of the 
immunity of six deputies of the Turkish Democracy Party. It has 
repeatedly condemned terrorist acts in Turkey, but it believes 
that the fight against terrorism should be conducted within the 
law and with full respect for human rights. It further wishes to 
reiterate its appeal for a political solution of the problems in 
South Eastern Turkey. The EU wishes to underline that the right 
to express freely one's ideas and opinions is a fundamental 
freedom for all, and a fortiori for members of Parliament. It is 
enshrined in many international instruments, to which Turkey has 
subscribed. This right also forms the basis of the Parliamentary 
immunity of elected representatives in democratic States. The EU 
calls on the Turkish government to fulfil its earlier 
undertaking on constitutional reforms in the area of human 
rights."
