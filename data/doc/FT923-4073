FT  09 SEP 92 / Toyota opens engine plant
TOYOTA of Japan yesterday started production at its Pounds 140m engine plant
at Deeside, north Wales - the first of a wave of Japanese automotive plants
due to be commissioned in Europe by the end of the year.
Toyota is building up to a production rate of 200,000 engines a year at
Deeside - its first wholly-owned production plant in Europe - by the second
half of the 1990s. Output in the first phase is set to reach 100,000 a year
by 1995.
The engines will be supplied to the company's Pounds 700m car assembly plant
at Burnaston, near Derby, which starts production in December.
Toyota said the 1,500 engines to be produced at Deeside by the end of this
year would be shipped to Japan for cars being exported to Europe.
Output of 25,000 1.6 litre petrol engines is planned at Deeside next year
for supply to the Burnaston car plant. A 2-litre petrol engine is expected
to be added in the second phase.
