<F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report: "Duma Should Consider How To Keep </F>
Promises Made by Deputies During Election Campaign"] 
  [Text] I am making a small request of readers -- work out 
how much deputies have promised their voters. I got cracking 
and figured it out -- 333 trillion rubles [R]! 
  To put that figure in context, the state budget for the 
fourth quarter is just R17 trillion. You have to be a real 
fantasist to promise the unimaginable! 
  So what is imaginable? 
  I have already written about the state budget in the fourth 
quarter of last year. I can now quote the revised figures. 
  In order to limit the Russian Federation republic budget 
deficit in 1993 to no more than 10 percent of GNP, republic 
budget expenditure in the fourth quarter of 1993 has been set at 
R22,246.8 billion. 
  The ceiling for the Russian Federation budget deficit in the 
fourth quarter of 1993 has been set at R5,510 billion after 
being partly reduced by revenue of R1,500.1 billion from foreign 
loans granted to the Russian Federation. 
  Where has this money gone? 
  The revised spending on financing the economy in the fourth 
quarter comes to R2,958.8 billion, including R1,368.3 billion in 
state subsidies. 
  R3,628.5 billion has been allocated to fund state programs 
and investments, specifically: 
  the agro-industrial complex -- R526.4 billion; 
  financial support for northern regions -- R558.3 billion; 
  the program to support peasant farms -- R21.3 billion; 
  the enterprise support fund -- R12.8 billion; 
  funding for defense sector enterprises undergoing conversion 
-- R159.1 billion. 
  Defense spending comes to R4,476.4 billion, and spending on 
foreign economic activity to R1,303.1 billion. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin has instructed the 
government 
to adopt for execution the revised spending figures for the 
republic budget in the fourth quarter of 1993. And he has 
submitted this edict for examination by the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly which, as is well known, will meet in January! 
  Our Duma will have the difficult job of thinking about how 
to 
sanction this lost money with dignity.
