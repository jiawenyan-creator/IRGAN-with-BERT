BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE 
On the Other Hand . . . : That's not to say that everyone does wonderful work, 
however. 
No less an authority that Richard L. Hall, president of La Linda Homes of 
Orange and president of the California Building Industry Assn., was heard 
complaining about the lack of quality in some developments. 
Hall wouldn't name names, but he said during a session at the San Francisco 
conference that he is sometimes shocked by the work he sees at some of his 
competitors' projects. 
Still, he said, at the prices even "cheap" homes fetch in Orange County, 
developers are learning that customers will no longer put up with inferior 
workmanship.
