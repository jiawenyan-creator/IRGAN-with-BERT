Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society has underscored its commitment to
becoming a significant force in the UK retail banking market by appointing
Fred Crawley, a former deputy chief executive of Lloyds Bank, as chairman of
its Girobank subsidiary.
Crawley readily admits that Girobank is an institution which has never lived
up to its potential, but says that this was partly because there was never
enough money to promote its products properly. It was bought from the Post
Office 18 months ago, and its new owner is intent on remedying this
deficiency.
Crawley says that Girobank is 20 years ahead of the competition and has 2m
customers, or 10 times as many as Midland's Firstdirect. He is particularly
interested in building on its potential for telephone selling, as well as
its traditional money transmission business.
Crawley, 65, is replacing Scott Durward, the society's chief executive who
resigned last month. Crawley has been chairman of Alliance &amp; Leicester since
August 1990.
