FT  15 JUN 94 / Observer: Political affairs
Denmark's most celebrated unmarried couple have at last tied the knot. Prime
Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Social Democratic party leader, and Lone
Dybkjaer, a leading light in the Radical Liberal party, have been living in
unmarried bliss for the past two years. That raises not an eyebrow in
tolerant Denmark, where more than a third of cohabiting couples are
unmarried.
Rasmussen and Dybkjaer married in secret in May, in the midst of
tough-fought European parliamentary elections. Dybkjaer triumphed in the
vote; she achieved the second-highest personal score, with 159,552 votes,
and won her party's first Strasbourg seat. Rasmussen fared less well. His
party's vote fell to a miserable 15.8 per cent, from 23.3 per cent in 1989
and 37.4 per cent in the last election to the Danish parliament itself.
A former environment minister, Dybkjaer's connection with Rasmussen kept her
out of the current Radical party/Social Democrat coalition government. On
present form, she might be keeping Rasmussen out in future.
