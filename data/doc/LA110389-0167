WORLD; 
CANADA UNVEILS ABORTION BILL 
The Canadian government unveiled an abortion law today that allows a woman to 
end her pregnancy at any time if a doctor believes her life or health is 
threatened. 
The long-awaited legislation will fill the void created when Canada's Supreme 
Court struck down a more restrictive law last year but will end what has become 
a practice of abortion on demand that resulted from the lack of an abortion 
law. 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government had promised new legislation since 
the previous law was declared unconstitutional in January, 1988. 
"The bill introduced today establishes that the question of abortion is a 
medical decision to be made between a woman and her doctor, based on health 
grounds," Justice Minister Doug Lewis told reporters.
