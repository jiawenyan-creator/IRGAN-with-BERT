and the deficiency payments received under the annual acreage reduction programs will not exceed $50,000 per person;
and

Disaster benefits on enrolled bushels. 


(a) Disaster and deficiency payments cannot be earned on the same quantity of bushels, and the quantity of bushels
enrolled in the Options Program cannot exceed the eligible deficiency quantity. If such deficiency quantity is reduced
by the disaster quantity, the number of bushels eligible for enrollment in the Options Program may be reduced according
to paragraph (b) of this section. 
(b) If an enrolled producer elects to apply for disaster benefits and the enrolled options program quantity exceeds
the eligible deficiency quantity after such quantity is adjusted for disaster, such producer shall refund, before
receiving disaster benefits, any premium and incentive payments on the quantity of bushels that exceeds the remaining
deficiency quantity. 
(c) The total of disaster, deficiency, and Options Program bushels shall not exceed the result of multiplying the
permitted acreage for the crop times the yield. Options Program bushels that remain eligible for premium and incentive
payments shall be calculated as the smaller of: 
(1) The result of multiplying the permitted acreage of the commodity, times the program payment yield established
for such commodity, minus the disaster bushels; or 
(2) The bushels of the commodity that are enrolled in the options program.
