  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The trade ministry is 
studying whether or not to back down from a planned nuclear fuel 
recycling project using plutonium, a senior ministry official 
said Friday [4 March]. 
  He said it does not mean, however, that the ministry will 
surely move toward cutting the project. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has 
yet to reach any conclusion on its plutonium policy as reported 
recently, said the official, who declined to be named. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that the ministry 
has decided to postpone full-scale use of plutonium for nuclear 
recycling until its economic feasibility is confirmed. 
  The economic daily also cited global fear for nuclear 
proliferation in Japan and a diminishing need for an immediate 
establishment of nuclear recycling amid falling uranium prices 
as other reasons behind Japan's review of its plutonium policy. 
  The trade ministry's advisory body will probably issue a 
proposal on the matter in its interim report in June, the 
official said. 
  Meanwhile, the MITI official confirmed a newspaper report 
that the ministry will assist a shift of idle petrochemical 
production facilities in Japan to China. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI said Friday the nation's petrochemical 
companies will transfer unused facilities to China at an 
ethylene equivalent of 1 million tons. 
  The official said MITI will shortly send a mission to China 
to work out details on the scheme.
