FT  23 JUL 92 / Shephard firm on EC laws
EUROPEAN Community legislation on social and employment matters is to be
reviewed to ensure that it conforms to the principles of 'subsidiarity', Mrs
Gillian Shepherd, employment secretary, said yesterday. 'Subsidiarity' means
legislating at whichever level, national or EC-wide, is appropriate to the
law in question.
'I shall be conducting a thorough review of EC legislation in this area,'
Mrs Shephard, who chairs the EC's council of labour ministers, told Unice,
the EC employers' body.
'Too often there have been proposals for Community legislation on matters
which are more appropriately determined by individual member states,' she
explained.
Meanwhile the Trades Union Congress has also, in effect, admitted that the
high water mark of EC social legislation has passed for the present.
The TUC, in a paper urging that the Maastricht Treaty be ratified, said:
'The resolve of the 11 member states (minus the UK) to develop a strong
social policy has temporarily weakened in the face of economic
difficulties.'
The TUC general council decided that a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty
would not be appropriate.
In a separate paper on European collective bargaining, Mr David Lea, TUC
assistant general secretary, said that 'to contemplate European pay
bargaining would be to forfeit credibility'.
But that should not rule out an attempt to negotiate 'European models for
overtime rates', he added.
