PACIFICA PLAYERS AT AUTRY MUSEUM 
After an uneventful first half, which mostly failed to involve the listener, a 
woodwind quintet from Pacifica Chamber Players came to life, in an Open 
Festival concert at the Gene Autry Museum in Griffith Park. 
This apparently ad-hoc ensemble, whose members are Heather Lockwood (flute), 
Cheryl Foster (oboe), Frank Silva (clarinet), Edward Treuenfels (horn) and 
Charles Fernandez (bassoon), thereafter held its audience deftly, with strong 
-- if sometimes overstrident and usually overloud -- performances. 
Clearly, the quality of the works -- by Ingolf Dahl, Phyllis Addison, Dean 
Wheelock and quintet members Fernandez and Silva -- on this second half had a 
lot to do with the players' attentiveness, and with their audience's pleasure. 
But a high energy level was the catalyst for that pleasure. Engaging music 
sounds engaging only when performers take the trouble to project. 
What was most cherishable on this eclectic, mostly 20th-Century program Sunday 
night turned out to be Ingolf Dahl's brilliant "Allegro and Arioso" from 1942, 
a piece still fresh-sounding, witty and poignant. Coming immediately after 
intermission, it signaled the fact that the five performers had finally warmed 
up. 
Addison's skillful and colorful "The Room," a series of emotionally resonant 
character-pieces, and Wheelock's jaunty "Rondo," also held our interest 
effortlessly. Fernandez's three "Songs From a Child's Point of View," 
handsomely sung by soprano Vanessa Vandergriff, proved charming but innocuous. 
Silva's brief, jazzy "Solar Blew" closed the program in a burst of energy. 
The low-key first half had been devoted to quintets by Franz Danzi and Irving 
Fine (an optimistic work from 1948) and shorter, more recent items by Jonathan 
Sacks and William Goldstein, worthy pieces all, but offered in passive, rather 
than vigorous, readings.
