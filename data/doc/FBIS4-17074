Today, and Tomorrow" rubric: "Murmansk Is Russian Gas El 
Dorado"] 
  [Text] The world's largest city within the Arctic circle, 
Murmansk, is destined to also become the world's largest base 
for the extraction of natural gas. Not far from it on a shelf 
in the Barents Sea, gigantic deposits of this fuel have been 
discovered. But while preparatory work prior to the marine 
deposits' exploitation is in progress, the city will feed from 
the West Siberian gas pipelines.
