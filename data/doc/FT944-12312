FT  02 NOV 94 / Management: For aspiring board directors
Psst] Fancy a seat on the board of a company chaired by ICI's Sir Denys
Henderson, and where Andrew Teare of English China Clays is chief executive?
Just such an opportunity was made available this week by headhunters Spencer
Stuart, the Wharton Business School of Pennsylvania and the international
accounting and consulting firm KPMG.
Before would-be directors rush to sign up, though, they should bear in mind
that the company in question - MegaMicro - is fictitious, the board posts
are on offer for just the two days of a training programme next March, and
they come with a price tag of Pounds 4,000 plus VAT.
Known as the Director's Institute in the US where it was launched last year
this so-called Directors' Forum has been devised by the three joint venture
partners to fill what they perceive to be a gap in the UK market for
directors' training. The programme - aimed at execs and non-execs alike - is
essentially a board simulation exercise based on the imaginary but
true-to-life MegaMicro during which participants address issues facing the
company in the course of audit and remuneration committee meetings and a
full board meeting.
Strategy, succession, remuneration, product liability, and new financial
instruments are among corporate governance subjects that will be raised.
An important feature is the panel of advisers - an impressive list of the
great and the good who have indicated their willingness to offer advice,
lead the discussion, or even play a role in MegaMicro (hence the close
involvement of Henderson and Teare in the first programme). Panel
participation is one way the Forum hopes to distinguish itself from rival
programmes such as that run by the Institute of Directors.
