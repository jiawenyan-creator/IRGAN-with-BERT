SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), is preparing an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) for the proposed US23 freeway from M13 to M55 in Arenac and Iosco Counties, Michigan.
The purpose of the new freeway is to assist northeast Michigan in its economic development program which has been intensified
subsequent to the closure of Wurtsmith Air Force Base. The freeway will provide a high speed non-stop facility which
will make the region's markets, resources, and employment base accessible to more clients and customers. An accelerated
schedule for the completion of this 48 kilometer (30 mile) project is important to other economic development efforts.
Alternatives under consideration include: (1) No Action, (2) low Capitol Improvements, and (3) Freeway on New Location..





The Low Capitol Alternate proposes the possibility of passing relief lanes, intersection and interchange improvements,
and other minor traffic safety modifications. 

Other alternates eliminated from further study through public and agency comments include a southern Bypass of Standish
and Omer to M65 and improvements along the existing alignment (roadways).


The freeway alternate is a four lane divided, controlled access freeway with a median on a new location. The route under
study would begin at the existing US23/M13 interchange south of Standish and bypass Standish 1.6 kilometers
(1 mile) east of US23 to interchange with the existing US23 northeast of Standish near Senske Road. From
this point, the roadway proceeds northeast to cross the Rifle River about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) northwest of Omer.
The route then heads to parallel the railroad (along its west side) to Whittemore Road and then north to interchange
with M55 west of Tawas (between Imperial Drive and Rempert Road).



Early coordination with a number of Federal, State, and local agencies has identified the more significant issues
to be addressed in the EIS. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are requested
to be cooperating agencies in the development of the proposed action. A scoping document will be prepared identifying
the alternates being considered and the social, economic, and environmental issues involved.


The scoping document anticipated in August of 1994 and will be available to all interested agencies, organizations,
and individuals on request. A pre-study meeting will be held in 1994 to provide the public an opportunity to discuss
the proposed action. Comments on the scoping document and issues identified are invited from all interested parties.
Requests for a copy of the scoping document or any comments submitted should be addressed to the above contact persons.

The Draft EIS is scheduled for completion in fall 1995 and will be available for public and agency review.
