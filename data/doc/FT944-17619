FT  07 OCT 94 / Banks 'misusing' rules on capital
Banks are wrongly using the rules governing the capital they must allocate
to transactions with companies to determine charges, a Bank supervisor said
yesterday.
Mr David Holt, the Bank's senior manager of supervision and surveillance,
said it 'never loses the opportunity' to tell banks that capital rules were
not designed to deliver an accurate measure of risk in a single transaction.
'The banks nevertheless continue to use them for this purpose,' he said.
Rules on allocating capital to cover the risks of loans were introduced in
the 1988 Basle Accord.
