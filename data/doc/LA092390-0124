PLASTIC SURGEON SHOULD FACE TRUE JUSTICE 
Jeffrey L. Gunther, the presiding judge in Dr. Michael Elam's case, the 
controversial cosmetic surgeon, apparently needs more than mere cosmetic 
surgery. If his recent decision ("Doctor Who was Stripped of His License Gets 
Reprieve," Sept. 6) is any indication, he needs a full-fledged brain transplant 
as his thought processes and sense of logic seem to be severely impaired. 
Instead of concluding that Elam's medical license should be revoked, as the 
Medical Board of California had recommended due to numerous violations, 
including forged insurance billings, a botched "tummy tuck" and unwanted 
operations, Gunther gave him a mere slap on the wrist, which included requiring 
Elam to take an ethics class and to have his practice monitored until his case 
is resolved in court. 
Apparently, the deciding factor in the judge's ruling was around 75 letters 
submitted by doctors in support of Elam. Hmmm, just another example of the 
"good ol' boys" network, of doctors protecting their own. 
A more fitting punishment would have been to allow some of Elam's disgruntled 
clients to perform cosmetic surgery on him. As they say, an eye for an eye, a 
face for a face, a tummy for a tummy.
