  [Text] Hong Kong, June 20 (AFP) -- In Hong Kong, Governor 
Chris Patten said the territory has informed China that it 
stands ready to provide whatever assistance it can to help 
Guangdong confront its flood waters. "The devastating floods in 
China have shocked everybody in Hong Kong," Patten said. He 
also extended "sympathy at the large loss of life which those 
floods have already caused." The majority of Hong Kong's six 
million people trace their family roots to the Pearl River delta.
