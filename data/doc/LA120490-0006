U.N. APPROVES MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
After reading your article, I became ill. When Kenneth Turner said, "My 
religious beliefs are no longer compatible . . . with the Marine Corps . . .," 
I became furious. 
It's funny how Turner's beliefs were compatible when the corps was taking care 
of his medical bills, his housing, his opportunities to further his education, 
etc. It appears to me that when the corps benefited Turner, everything was 
compatible, but now that he is asked to do his duty, his beliefs get in the 
way. 
Having spent five years on active duty in the corps, I am deeply hurt by seeing 
Turner called a Marine. If Turner gets his honorable discharge, it will be a 
slap in the face to all veterans of any service who have done their duty. 
P.S. I am still with the Marine Corps Reserve and if called, will do my duty.
