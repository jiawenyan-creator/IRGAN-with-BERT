FT  05 AUG 94 / People: Sieff retires from FIBI
Lord Sieff, 81, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer and one of the
grand old names of British retailing, has retired after nearly 11 years as
chairman of FIBI Bank (UK), the London arm of the First International Bank
of Israel, one of Israel's top five banks.
However, the family link between Marks and Spencer and one of Israel's most
profitable banks, is continuing. David Sieff, 55, Lord Sieff's son and an
executive director of M &amp; S, has joined the board of the small City-based
bank and has taken over as chairman. Last year FIBI Bank (UK) made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.0m on shareholders funds of Pounds 19.6m. Its total
assets grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 75.6m.
The Israeli parent of FIBI Bank (UK) is unusual in that it is privately
owned. In November 1990 it was bought by two Brazil-based bankers, Yosef and
Moise Safra, brothers of Edmond Safra who controls one of the world's
biggest private banking empires.
