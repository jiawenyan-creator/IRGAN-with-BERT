FT  07 MAY 91 / US and Uruguay sign anti-laundering pact
THE US and Uruguay yesterday signed a mutual legal assistance treaty after
almost a year's negotiation.
US officials say the treaty, modelled on similar arrangements Washington has
with many other countries, is designed to 'make it easier to gather evidence
for criminal trials'.
Concern has grown both in the US and Uruguay that Montevideo, South
America's only offshore banking centre, has become a focus of money
laundering operations by the continent's cocaine cartels.
Two weeks ago, the Uruguayan central bank introduced guidelines
'recommending' that its 240 banks, banking houses and exchange houses
establish the true identity of their clients' and the origin of their money.
Argentina's retail price index grew by 5.5 per cent in April, down from 11
per cent in March, the government announced yesterday. Annual inflation fell
to 348 per cent. April's rate was widely expected and confirms the success
of stringent anti-inflation policies implemented on April 1.
