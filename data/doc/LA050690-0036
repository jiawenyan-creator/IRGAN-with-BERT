UPGRADING PIER AREA 
Your article (April 30) on Huntington Beach's Pierside Village project leaves 
the impression that those of us who oppose the project want the area left in 
its present state. 
That is not true; it is obviously a blighted area and needs to be upgraded. 
The disagreement is over what should be built on the site. The Downtown 
Specific Plan passed by the Planning Commission and City Council specified that 
commercial uses in this area are to be beach-related. Businesses that can be 
accessed by beach-goers in bathing suits and sandy feet, and that would not 
diminish views along Pacific Coast Highway would surely be supported by a 
majority of area residents.
