FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Prague Breweries seeks partner
PRAGUE Breweries, the second-largest brewing group in the Czech republic,
yesterday announced that it was seeking an international industrial partner.
Mr Stanislav Prochazka, chief executive, said: 'We believe our company has
an excellent platform for future growth, both domestically and through
exports.'
Prague Breweries, which has a dominant market position in the Czech capital,
was included in the first wave of the country's privatisation programme and
will have 72 per cent of its equity owned, as a result, by domestic
shareholders mostly regrouped in the largest seven private investment funds.
Creditanstalt Securities, the Prague-based investment bank, which has been
retained as adviser to the brewery, has a 12 per cent stake in Prague
Breweries.
Other large shareholders include investment funds controlled by leading
commercial banks. A remaining 28 per cent equity stake is held by workers,
management and the state property agency, the Czech government body
monitoring the privatisation programme.
Any international partner would become a shareholder of the company which
employs 1,300 and last year produced 2m hectolitres of beer, 5 per cent of
which was exported.
