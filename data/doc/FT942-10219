FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil advances 9 per cent in moderate
volume
Equities in Sao Paulo were up nearly 9 per cent in moderate trade, more than
recovering Monday's losses as investors took a second look at the
government's announcement that it was to introduce a new currency unit in
July.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares ended 1,262 points up at
15,480. Turnover was Cr209bn (Dollars 143.2m).
In spite of the rally, analysts commented that it was difficult to define a
trend: 'prices are see-sawing sharply and volume remains very thin,' one
said.
Among active issues, Telebras, the telecommunications group, had put on 10
per cent.
