FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Ansbacher bid terms announced
HENRY ANSBACHER, the UK merchant bank, yesterday confirmed that it had
agreed terms of a takeover by the First National Bank of South Africa.
Majority shareholders, accounting for 73.1 per cent of the shares, have
accepted 27 1/2 p a share.
However, Mr Richard Fenhalls, chairman and chief executive, could not
recommend that price to minority shareholders, who are to be offered 32p a
share.
Mr Fenhalls said: 'It is the job of management to get the best possible deal
for shareholders. We dug our heels in to get a better result for the
minorities.'
The majority shareholders' price assumes that First National will set aside
money in escrow arrangements in case any outstanding claims against
Ansbacher materialise.
Shareholders representing 89.3 per cent have given irrevocable undertakings
to accept.
