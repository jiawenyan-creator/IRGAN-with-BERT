FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind sharp gain to Pounds
3.5m at Lilleshall
Lilleshall, the engineering and building products group, yesterday reported
a 93 per cent increase in first half profits following a strong performance
by new subsidiaries.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 3.52m after contributions
from Trutite Fasteners, St Helens Glass and Jay Fasteners  - all acquired in
the past 12 months - helped lift turnover to Pounds 48.7m (Pounds 31.3m).
The figures were distorted by a Pounds 781,000 gain on property disposals
and a Pounds 300,000 loss on a consultancy agreement, but underlying profits
rose by 66 per cent to Pounds 3.04m.
The improvement was fuelled mainly by profits of Pounds 1.65m (Pounds 1.01m)
in the building products division, including St Helens, and a Pounds 797,000
(Pounds 355,000) gain in the industrial consumables business, dominated by
the fastener companies.
Together, they contributed Pounds 2.44m to operating profits of Pounds 3.25m
(Pounds 2.09m).
Mr John Leek, chairman, said: 'Demand has increased and our businesses
generally saw reasonable growth, but no-one would call it buoyant.'
In a cautious statement, he forecast a satisfactory outcome for the full
year 'provided the prospect of higher interest rates does not dampen demand
and assuming that pressure on margins does not worsen'.
Among the group's 13 companies, St Helens endured a slowdown in orders in
the second quarter, while profits at Ideal Williams - the PVC doors and
windows business - were affected by a price war among its competitors.
Profits in the plastics and engineering division, meanwhile, rose by a
modest 3.3 per cent as the components and housewares businesses struggled
against margin pressure and mixed trading conditions.
Nevertheless, the division enjoyed healthy export orders in the US and a
small first-time contribution from Laets, the Belgian houseware company
acquired for Pounds 1.33m in May.
Earnings per share rose to 7.67p (5.06p), and an increased interim dividend
of 1.85p (1.7p) is declared.
The shares closed up 5p at 155p.
