FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in NIE
IN KEEPING with other privatisation issues, Northern Ireland Electricity
(NIE) got off to a better than expected start, the shares opening at 125p,
five to six points higher than had generally been expected, according to
senior marketmakers, and maintaining their early momentum. NIE is the last
of the electricity companies to be privatised.
The stock price quickly moved up to touch 130p, before settling at 126 1/2
p. Turnover in NIE, easily the highest in the market yesterday, reached 51m
shares.
Dealers said the strong performance by the shares reflected the recent good
showing of the utilities sectors in the stock market, particularly the power
generators, which have recently been hitting all-time highs after announcing
results above expectations and raising hopes of bumper dividend payouts.
The regional electricity companies have recently begun to announce
preliminary results, the three companies reporting so far unveiling dividend
increases of 14 to 15 per cent.
There was evidence that some institutions, unable to acquire sufficiently
high weightings in NIE, decided to take the hefty premium offered and sell
their allocations. Others, however, were said to have been aggressive buyers
of NIE, and determined to reach target weightings.
The first day premium on NIE is similar to those achieved by the water
stocks, the 'recs' and the power generators. The Scottish generators enjoyed
much smaller initial premiums.
