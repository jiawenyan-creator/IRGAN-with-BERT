HOME COMPUTER: AROUND HOME; 
WRITE YOUR CONGRESSMAN 
THIS PROGRAM IS for those concerned citizens who, after reading in the morning 
newspaper about what absurdities elected officials have committed, immediately 
want to register a strong dissent with their representatives. 
It's a gap that GOVERN-U.S. was made to fill. GOVERN is a standard mail-merge 
program with a twist. Instead of the usual data base filled the names and 
address of customers and subscribers, GOVERN contains the names and addresses 
of all members of Congress, each of the nine justices on the Supreme Court and 
all major officials of the executive branch (from the President to the head of 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.) 
An expanded version also includes House Committees, Senate Committees, Joint 
Congressional Committees, Committee Assignments and foreign embassies. Finally, 
in case you need to remind your representatives of the basic law of the land, 
GOVERN also contains copies of the Constitution of the United States and 
Declaration of Independence. 
The way GOVERN works is simple. All you do is call up GOVERN's standard letter 
form, enter the text of the letter, and GOVERN prints out a properly addressed 
copy to each public official you designate. (You designate a public official by 
placing his name in a custom mailing-list file. Thereafter, every time you 
write a letter, GOVERN sends out individually addressed copies to everyone on 
your mailing list.) If you wish, GOVERN will also address the envelopes as 
well. 
 GOVERN-U.S. is a shareware program ($3 for the basic version) available from 
California Freeware (805) 273-0300. If you plan to use GOVERN regularly, the 
publisher (Foundation for Infinite Survival Inc., of Berkeley) asks that you 
register your copy for $28, which also entitles you to free updates and the 
expanded public official data base.
