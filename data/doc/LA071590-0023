ERMA BOMBECK: INFINITELY MORE ZEROS 
Is anyone else suffering from zero overload? Every time I open the newspaper or 
turn on the television, it's a billion dollars here or a trillion there. I 
never understood all those zeros when Carl Sagan talked about them, but it 
didn't seem important then. Now that I have to pay a share of $500 billion to 
bail out the savings and loans, it's important. I've never owed on anything 
that had 11 zeros before. 
I can't get a handle on that much money. If $500 billion was broken down into 
$5 bills, would they reach around the world? If you stacked them and sat on 
them, would you get a nosebleed from the altitude? How many sheets could Imelda 
Marcos buy with them? If they were nose tissues, how long would they last 50 
people with colds? 
The practice of zero dropping has gotten out of hand. No one even blinks 
anymore when talking about a national debt of $10.4 trillion, Adnan Khashoggi's 
apartment a steal at $33 million, or the California lottery being upped to 
$15.6 million to get people interested in it again. It's as if people have been 
numbed with Novocain. All those zeros mean nothing. 
The other night a television reader reported that Ivan Boesky took a tax 
writeoff on half of his $100-million settlement on insider trading. She gave it 
all the excitement of a kid swiping a tip at Denny's. 
Maybe our apathy started when plastic replaced money. We don't see money 
anymore; therefore, we place no value on it. We have forgotten what it looks 
like, how long it takes to get it, and how hard we have to work for it. 
On the news the other night there was talk about changing some of the 
denominations of money when someone observed, "Why don't we do away with the 
dollar bill? It's useless, and besides, it doesn't buy anything anymore." 
I hate to think I will eventually fall into the state of numbness where I will 
no longer question what all those zeros mean. If we are to be assaulted with 
numbers, why can't they be related to something? 
When a person is convicted of ripping off the government in nine zeros, tell me 
how many organ or bone marrow transplants that will buy. If a scam is involved, 
tell me how much money that would mean to cancer and AIDS research. 
If they're going to throw all those zeros at us, tell us how many hungry 
children it would feed or how many homeless it would house. Maybe we could get 
a little rage going here.
