FT  30 JUN 94 / World Trade News: South African wine sales up in Canada
South African wines have made an unexpectedly strong comeback in Canada
since trade sanctions against Pretoria were lifted six months ago. Canada
had vied with the UK as South Africa's biggest wine and spirits market
before the imposition of sanctions in 1986.
Government liquor boards, which control wine and spirits marketing in most
Canadian provinces, have yet to issue detailed sales figures for the past
few months. But an official at the Ontario board, the world's biggest liquor
retailer, confirmed that it has struggled to keep up with demand. 'There was
a fair bit of anticipation among wine enthusiasts for South African
products,' he said. Many retail outlets have run out of stocks.
Mr Michael Sainsbury, local agent for the South African Co-operative
Winegrowers' Association, 'conservatively' forecasts sales of South African
red wines in Ontario would reach 9,300 cases this year, only 13 per cent
short of volumes in 1985, the last full year before sanctions. He estimates
white wine sales this year at 8,000 cases, about two-thirds of 1985 volume.
Demand for brandy and other fortified wines has risen more slowly.
The strong performance of the South African products is ascribed partly to
competitive pricing and wine drinkers' past loyalties. But their
reappearance has also coincided with rising demand for wines from other
southern hemisphere countries, notably Australia and Chile.
A vigorous marketing campaign, including the formation of a wine society,
has accompanied the South African return.
