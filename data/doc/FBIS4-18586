  [Text] TURK-IS [Turkish Confederation of Labor] adopted a 
series of decisions to protest the economic package. The 
TURK-IS' council of presidents, which set up a permanent action 
committee, concluded that there is no way the package could be 
implemented within democratic rules and the state might consider 
introducing disciplinary laws. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] TURK-IS' 
council 
of presidents, which met in an extraordinary session soon after 
the unveiling of the economic package, decided to hold a massive 
rally in Ankara as soon as possible. 
  In a statement after the meeting, TURK-IS leader Bayram 
Meral 
said that actions such as slowing down or stopping work in 
workshops will be immediately put into action. Hoping that the 
government will reconsider its decisions, Bayram Meral recalled 
that the 12 September coup [in 1980] was made in order to 
implement [former president Ozal's] 24 January [1980 economic 
austerity] measures. Arguing that the there is no way to 
implement the economic package within democratic rules, Meral 
said that there might be the question of enacting certain 
disciplinary laws. Meral added that if the government takes 
such a measure, then all workers will go on a general strike.
