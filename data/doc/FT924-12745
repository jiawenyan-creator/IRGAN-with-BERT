FT  19 OCT 92 / Observer: Surprise packet
Hotels are forever seeking new ways to offer customers a little bit extra,
such as folding the tongue sticking out of the box of tissues. But a
colleague visiting Geneva was still surprised to find, among the peanuts and
chocolates in his room's minibar, a box of condoms.
The Swiss Movenpick group, which owns the hotel, said they were there not as
a marketing ploy, but as a response to increasing concern about Aids.
Indeed, whether to supply them is left to the conscience of each individual
hotel's management. So thrifty travellers who keep themselves in shampoo and
bath oil as a by-product of their globe-trotting, cannot count on a
Movenpick group booking to yield a further cost-saving collectable.
Nevertheless, in the future perhaps, hotel guides will have some appropriate
symbol to denote whether the additional feature is included.
