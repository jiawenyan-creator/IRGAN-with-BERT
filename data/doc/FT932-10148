FT  11 MAY 93 / Kyrgyzstan dumps the rouble
KYRGYZSTAN replaced the rouble with its own currency yesterday, but people
in the Central Asian nation viewed the brightly-coloured banknotes with
distrust, Reuter reports from Bishkek.
The launch of the 'som' is aimed at strengthening Kyrgyzstan's economic
independence from Russia and shielding it from the rampant inflation
afflicting virtually all former Soviet republics.
However, bank managers and employees in the capital Bishkek said that demand
for the new currency was poor.
'Only a stupid fool would buy som,' said one owner of a private retail
outlet in Bishkek.
'Who will have confidence in it? There is nothing to ensure its value.'
State-owned shops were ordered to accept the new money at the official offer
rate of Rbs200 to one som.
Kyrgyzstan's parliament voted last week to become the first Central Asian
nation to establish its own currency after the rouble's rapid devaluation
against the US dollar.
