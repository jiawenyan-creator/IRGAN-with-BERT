FT  26 SEP 92 / Contemplating a gamble
MR EDDIE JONES has a sheaf of papers on his living-room table. They are the
details of a suggestion from Rolls-Royce Motor Cars that he take voluntary
redundancy.
He is one the 950 people Rolls-Royce would like to see depart by the end of
the year. 'I think I will be tempted to go,' he said. 'It's a bit of
gamble.' A bit of a gamble financially, because there are not many jobs
available in Crewe, Cheshire, which has long been the Rolls-Royce company
town.
In a reversal of the usual pattern, he will be following in the footsteps of
his sons, now both in their 20s. They were both Rolls-Royce apprentices: one
took voluntary redundancy, the other was made compulsorily redundant.
Mr Jones continually referred to Rolls-Royce as 'we'. Old habits will die
hard for a man who has spent nearly 30 years in two spells with the company.
'I was just 20 when I went into Royce's for the first time,' he recalled.
'It was a hive of activity then. There was a lot more built in-house. I went
in prepared to take anything.'
The style of management has changed over the last few years. 'They're
treating us like mushrooms - keeping us in the dark and feeding us bullshit.
'The whole atmosphere in the factory when I first started there was totally
different. . . you could get hold of a manager and he knew something about
it (the way the car worked and how it was put together). They've got this
theory now that managers are there to manage men and not to manage the job.
It doesn't work. You get people coming in from outside - from all sorts of
managerial jobs - and they just don't know the product.'
Once, he said, people were proud to work for Rolls-Royce, but the recession
seems to have taken its toll on morale. 'The way we've been treated over the
last couple of years, the loyalty is just not there any more. It's just a
place to go and earn money.'
