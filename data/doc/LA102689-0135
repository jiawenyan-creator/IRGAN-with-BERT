An assistant coach and a football player at St. Genevieve High School in 
Panorama City have been suspended for two games and one game, respectively, for 
their involvement in a fight during last Friday's 45-6 loss to Chaminade. 
Another player and coach have been reprimanded by St. Genevieve Coach Mark 
Lovett in connection with the fight, which started when a St. Genevieve player 
blindsided a Chaminade punt returner after the latter had called for a fair 
catch and the whistle had blown. The names weren't released.
