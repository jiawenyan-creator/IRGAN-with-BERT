FT  09 SEP 92 / Ford re-launches Escort
FORD IS today unveiling heavily-revised versions of its Escort/Orion car
range (the Ghia version is shown above) just two years after the previous
generation was launched at a cost of Pounds 1bn. The exercise, which Ford
acknowledged yesterday involved further 'substantial' investment, follows
sharp criticism - mainly in the UK - of the styling and other aspects of the
cars at their original launch in October 1990.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said: 'We listened to what
was being said about the last versions of the cars, married these comments
with our own on-going (development) programme and introduced changes.'
Ford insisted that the most extensive - and expensive - changes involved
re-engineering to improve crash protection and other beneath-the-skin
specifications.
Adverse comment has had relatively little affect on sales. About 1.1m of the
controversial models have been sold in Europe. The Escort/Orion range was
Europe's second best-selling car behind Volkswagen's Golf last year.
