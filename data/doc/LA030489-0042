ENROLLMENT DRIVE KEEPS SCHOOL FROM DROPPING OUT 
The principal of Burbank's Providence High School said Friday that efforts in 
past months to increase enrollment will keep the school from closing in June. 
Parents, teachers and graduates have been raising scholarship money and 
recruiting students since September to raise enrollment at the coeducational, 
parochial school from 200 to 300 students. 
The Sisters of Providence, a Seattle-based order that operates the school, had 
threatened to close it unless 100 more students were enrolled. 
"We were joined in prayer efforts by people all over the world," said Sister 
Lucille Dean, the school's principal. 
The decision to keep the school open was made after 112 eighth-grade students 
took the entrance exam Feb. 4, Dean said. That is a 165% increase over the 
number taking the test last year, she said. 
Goal Met Easily 
Along with an expected 25 high school students who are expected to transfer to 
Providence over the summer, the school easily met its enrollment goal, Dean 
said. 
Parents and teachers from Providence recruited students and their parents from 
parochial elementary schools throughout the San Fernando Valley and other parts 
of Los Angeles, Dean said. The school, which charges annual tuition of $3,175, 
also took out advertisements in local newspapers, she said. 
The group raised more than $25,000 from rummage sales and other events to pay 
for scholarships to entice top students, Dean said. The Sisters of Providence 
has promised to match the amount of money raised by the group for scholarships, 
she said. 
"We were ready to close and we were challenged to turn it around," said Carmen 
Ferrante, a parent and school volunteer. "We are very proud of what we've 
done." 
School officials announced last month new courses in health science and media 
communications as part of the recruitment effort. 
"We will have to continue to actively market ourselves," Dean said.
