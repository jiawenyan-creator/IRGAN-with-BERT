BARDOT SLAMS RITUAL SLAUGHTERS 
mer film goddess turned animal rights champion Brigitte Bardot has assailed the 
Islamic world's ritual slaughter of animals as revolting and cruel. 
"We are no longer in the Middle Ages and now have every means to curtail the 
pains and terrifying anguish of animals about to be slaughtered," she said in 
an interview published Tuesday in the extreme right weekly magazine Present. 
"It is revolting . . . and unacceptable that in the name of religion, man 
should submit animals to such cruel and barbarous sufferings," she said. 
Bardot, 55, who has devoted herself to defending animal rights since her last 
film in 1973, made her statement after seeing a film of the mass slaughter last 
month of 3,000 sheep by North African immigrants in the Mediterranean port of 
Marseille. 
She was said by friends to be especially revolted since she has long campaigned 
for laws to be passed forcing ritual slaughterers to stun beasts before killing 
them. 
The slaughter of animals during religious feasts is an ages-old tradition in 
some religions. The animals' throats are slit quickly with a single stroke 
under special rules to minimize pain. 
Bardot's office said she felt equally strongly about Jewish ritual slaughter 
and Catholic churchmen who blessed foxhunts in France and bullfights in Spain.
