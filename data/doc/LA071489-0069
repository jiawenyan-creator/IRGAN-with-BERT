ITALIAN HOSTS GIVE HARVARD WATER POLO LESSON 
Members of the Harvard Water Polo Foundation returned Wednesday morning from a 
two-week tour of Italy with more than suitcases full of dirty laundry to show 
for it. 
The defending Southern Section 2-A Division champions came back toting the 
experience of international water polo at the European club level. Although 
Harvard won just two of its 18 matches and tied another, Harvard Coach Rich 
Corso was pleased. 
"We didn't take a team to conquer Europe," Corso said. "We went to learn water 
polo. Now they know what good water polo is. 
"It's good to see great water polo in Europe instead of the kids hearing me 
talk about it or showing it to them in videos." 
Brian Border, a sophomore on the Saracens' championship team last season, was 
among the 15 players who toured Italy. 
"We learned a lot from the Italians," Border said. "Just learning their style 
of play. Things we can bring back to the United States and put into our game." 
Harvard, after going to the 2-A Division final the past two years, has joined 
the Del Rey League, a member of the 3-A Division. With the upgrade in divisions 
comes a new challenge for Corso, who will begin his fourth season at Harvard in 
the fall. 
The Italian tour, he said, will aid in that transition. 
"I told the kids that we were the students when we went over there," Corso 
said. "We were going to learn the game. The club teams in Italy were very 
complimentary on how young we were and how we came back to the pool with new 
energy every day. So far, it's been an excellent summer of training." 
A Bergamo, Italy, club, which served at Harvard's host, likely will tour the 
Valley next summer.
