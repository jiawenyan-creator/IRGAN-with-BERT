ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
WORD 'EDUCATION' JOINING CITY LOGO 
The city's logo, which appears on all city vehicles, welcoming signs and 
stationary, is being modified by addition of the words "Education 1st." 
City Manager David N. Ream said the change reflects the city's commitment to 
education and will play a role in the marketing of the Santa Ana 2000 Plan. 
That plan, approved last October at a joint meeting of the City Council and 
Rancho Santiago College Board of Trustees, includes after-school programs at 
all 29 city parks and offers scholarships to promising students. The plan is 
designed to tackle the problems of gangs, drugs, high dropout rates and 
inadequate child care. 
The original logo was designed in 1983 to promote business and investment 
opportunities offered in Santa Ana. Ream said the modification will now permit 
use of the logo to promote educational opportunities as well. 
Ream said it will cost the city about $10,000 to change all of the logos. The 
new version will be in place within six months. GREG HERNANDEZ
