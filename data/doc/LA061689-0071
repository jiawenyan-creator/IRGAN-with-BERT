SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Six people, including a pregnant woman who had to be rescued from a car, were 
injured Thursday morning in a three-vehicle collision in North Park, 
authorities said. 
San Diego police and firefighters responded to the accident at 10:32 a.m. at 
Texas Street and Lincoln Avenue. All three drivers and their passengers 
suffered minor injuries and were treated at local hospitals, a spokesman for 
the Fire Department said. 
The pregnant woman was trapped in a small sedan when its doors, damaged in the 
collision, would not open. It took 10 minutes and a hydraulic-powered prying 
device to free the woman from the car, authorities said.
