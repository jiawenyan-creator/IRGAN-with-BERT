VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE; 
TRENCH CAVE-IN KILLS RANCH HAND 
A Fillmore ranch hand died after being buried alive Thursday when a 
seven-foot-deep irrigation trench collapsed on him, authorities said. 
Santiago Casas, 58, was buried beneath three feet of dirt and mud for about 15 
minutes before rescuers reached him and took him to Ventura County Medical 
Center, Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said, adding that Casas died during surgery 
three hours after the 10:25 a.m. accident. 
The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health later sent inspectors 
to the citrus farm on California 126 to investigate, said Rick Rise, division 
spokesman in San Francisco. 
Rivcom Corp., which operates the ranch four miles west of Fillmore, could face 
severe fines if the trench walls were not braced as required by industrial 
safety laws, Rise said. 
At the time of the accident, Casas was repairing an irrigation pipe at the 
bottom of the wet trench, which was about 4 feet wide by 20 feet long, Fillmore 
Fire Chief Pat Askren said. 
Casas was crouched down welding an under-section of the pipe when the sandy 
walls of the trench gave way and covered him, Askren said. 
A co-worker began digging furiously to find Casas while a second co-worker 
drove to the nearest phone three miles away, Askren said. Rescue workers dug 
Casas out about 15 minutes later, but their efforts to revive him were 
complicated by the presence of mud in his air passages, Askren said.
