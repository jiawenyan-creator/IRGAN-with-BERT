FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV moves into business TV
SELECTV, the independent production company famous for comedy hits such as
Birds of a Feather and popular dramas such as Love Hurts, has decided to
move into business television.
The USM-quoted company has bought a 50 per cent stake in Tribeca Television,
a tiny independent production company run by Mr Jeffrey Ferry, a financial
journalist.
The company produced Saving the American Dream which was shown on Channel 4
last December and has a series in development looking at those who created
inter-national brands such as Swatch watches and IKEA furniture.
Mr Michael Pilsworth, managing director of SelecTV, said it was also
interested in joining any consortium considering running a business channel
on UK cable television.
'We want to apply the humour of Birds of a Feather to corporate videos in
the way John Cleese has.'
The deal involves a maximum payment of about Pounds 91,000.
