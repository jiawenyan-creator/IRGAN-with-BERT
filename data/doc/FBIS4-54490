  [Text] Vladimir Soljic, defense minister in the government 
of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, announced he will reduce 
the number of soldiers in the Croat Defense Council. Soljic 
explained there would be no demobilization in the usual meaning 
of the word because the war has not finished; rather, the 
superfluous soldiers will be deployed on working tasks.
