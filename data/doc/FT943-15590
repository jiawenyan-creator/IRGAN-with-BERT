FT  08 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television
With the completion of the Rhine-Danube canal it is finally possible for
sizeable boats to cross the continent from the North Sea to the Black Sea,
and Peter Day has made the trip, as he recounts in Barging Across Europe
(6.30 Radio 4). Christopher Chataway continued smoking throughout his career
as a world-class athlete, a situation inconceivable in today's sporting
world where medicine, science, technology, diet and training techniques
become more and more significant. BBC1's new series, The Contenders, looks
at every aspect of sports preparation from psychology to tactics (7.00).
That is followed by another new series: International Young Driver Of The
Year, in which 27 young people from different parts of Europe compete for
the title. In addition to driving cars they compete in go-karts and, today,
in road sweepers, attempting to pick up golf balls as a test of vehicle
control (7.30 BBC1). In advance of the 100th season of promenade concerts,
beginning next Friday, Radio 3 broadcasts The Man Who Made The Proms
(10.30), a tribute to Sir Henry Wood.
