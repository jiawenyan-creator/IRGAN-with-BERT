FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: William Cook blames US for fall to Pounds
3.85m
WILLIAM COOK, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, yesterday blamed a
slide in profits on trading losses of more than Pounds 1.5m at its US
subsidiary.
Pre-tax profits in the 12 months to March 27 fell from Pounds 4.76m to
Pounds 3.85m on sales down 10 per cent at Pounds 100.5m (Pounds 111.2m).
Mr Andrew Cook, chairman and chief executive, said poor sales at the
Unitcast plant in Toledo, Ohio, had undermined the performance. Losses on
disposal of the US business, sold to its management last December for the
nominal sum of Dollars 10, were Pounds 4.7m excluding goodwill. A further
Pounds 3.2m was written off to reserves in attributable goodwill.
Pre-tax profits benefited from lower exceptional charges of Pounds 1.72m
(Pounds 3.31m) and net interest costs of Pounds 2.31m (Pounds 2.89m).
Sales in the US fell 62 per cent to Pounds 4.57m (Pounds 12.1m), while
turnover in the UK declined by only 3 per cent to Pounds 95.9m (Pounds
99.1m) and produced a trading profit of Pounds 9.47m (Pounds 11.5m).
Earnings per share fell from 15.03p to 11.74p. The proposed final dividend
is cut from 5p to 3.5p making a halved total for the year of 5p.
'Manufacturing in the US was a disaster,' Mr Cook said. 'But it remains our
strongest export market and we are determined to go on trading there.'
Expressing optimism over the group's domestic performance, Mr Cook said
order books were being held at 'tolerable' levels and borrowings had fallen.
'Year-end gearing, even after adjusting net worth for the US write-off, was
under 60 per cent,' he added.
