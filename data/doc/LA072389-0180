GARDEN OF THE FUTURE 
The July 16 piece on xeriscape, "Beauty, Ease, Economy of Flower-Filled Dry 
Garden" by Robert Smaus, was an excellent description of what is possible in 
Southern California when one considers the oxymoron less is more. 
Garden Editor Smaus correctly predicts water shortages in the not-too-distant 
future. Those readers taking his advice now will have a mature, beautiful 
garden in place when water supplies become tighter. Few people realize that the 
average family in California uses about 163,000 gallons of water a year -- half 
of that outdoors where real savings can be achieved. Smaus has shown the way. 
As one of the sponsors of the xeriscape garden at the Los Angeles County 
Arboretum, Metropolitan Water District has long advocated a return to 
California native plants and imports from similar climates that use little 
water, yet burst with color or offer attractive ground cover. 
Your readers are invited to contact the Metropolitan Water District at P.O. Box 
54153, Los Angeles 90054, for free copies of colorful and informative brochures 
that will help them plan and maintain a drought-resistant garden. 
If just one-fourth of the families reading the Sunday Times takes Smaus' 
advice, the water savings would approach a staggering 14 
billion-gallons-per-year savings.
