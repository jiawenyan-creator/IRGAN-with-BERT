 

Another consequence of the fact that Oregon lacks an EPA-approved program designed specifically to implement section
112(g) is that the applicability criteria found in its approved preconstruction review programs may differ from
those in section 112(g). However, whether a particular source change qualifies as a modification, construction,
or reconstruction for section 112(g) purposes will be determined according to the statutory provisions of section
112(g), using the proposed rule as guidance. As noted in the June 28, 1994 guidance, EPA intends to defer wherever possible
to a State's judgement regarding applicability determinations. This deference must be subject to obvious limitations.
For instance, a physical or operational change resulting in a net increase in HAP emissions above 10 tons per year could
not be viewed as a 

de minimis 

increase under any interpretation of the Act. The EPA would expect Oregon to be able to issue a preconstruction permit
containing a case-by-case determination of MACT in such a case even if review under its own preconstruction review
programs would not be triggered. 



d. Limitations on Potential to Emit

. Two commenters objected to EPA's requirement that Oregon refrain from adopting proposed revisions to Oregon's
applicability provision (OAR 340282110) on the grounds that such a revision would inappropriately
exempt certain title V sources from the requirements of title V. In the September 14, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice, EPA stated that the applicability provision originally submitted by Oregon on November 15, 1993, was fully
approvable. EPA also stated, however, that it believed that Oregon's proposed revision to OAR 340282110,
which would exempt from title V sources subject to certain ``prohibitory rules'' Oregon had also proposed, would
require disapproval of Oregon's program. The commenters stated, without elaboration, that Oregon's proposed revisions
to OAR 340282110 are fully consistent with 40 CFR 70.3(b)(1), which allows States to exempt temporarily
from title V certain categories of sources that are not major sources. 

EPA maintains that the exemptions Oregon proposed in OAR 340282110(4) exceeded the scope of the exemption
allowed under part 70 because the revisions would exempt four categories of sources from the requirements of title
V as a matter of State law even if EPA does not approve the ``prohibitory rules'' into the SIP so as to make them Federally
enforceable. In other words, Oregon's proposed revision to OAR 340282110(4) would have impermissibly
exempted title V sources that were in fact major sources under Federal law if the ``prohibitory rule'' under which
the sources sought to operate were not approved by EPA. In addition, the proposed revision would have exempted sources
within the four categories from title V even if such sources were subject to standards promulgated pursuant to section
111 or 112 of the Act after July 21, 1992, and the sources had been specifically determined in such promulgation not
to be exempt from title V (see 40 CFR 70.3(b)(2)). More to the point, if EPA approves a ``prohibitory rule'' into the
Oregon SIP which has the effect of making sources subject to that rule ``minor sources,'' then those sources would
be exempted from title V by the current provision in OAR 340282110(4)(b). 

In any event, Oregon did not adopt the proposed revision to OAR 340282110(4). Therefore, the version
of the regulation which the commenters addressed in their comments is no longer before EPA for consideration. Rather,
it is the version of OAR 340282110(4) which Oregon originally submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993,
and which EPA proposed to approve on September 14, 1994, that is currently before EPA. Accordingly, OAR 340282110
does not present a bar to title V approval. 



e. Environmental Audit Privilege

. One commenter raised several objections to EPA's discussion in the September 14, 1994 

Federal Register

 notice of Oregon's environmental audit privilege (ORS 468.963). EPA there stated that it was currently developing
a national position regarding EPA approval of environmental programs in States which have environmental audit privileges
and that it was proposing to take no action on the Oregon audit provision in the context of this title V approval. EPA
further stated that it might consider such a provision grounds for withdrawing program approval under 40 CFR 70.10(c)
in the future if it later determined that the Oregon audit provision interfered with Oregon's enforcement responsibilities
under part 70. See 59 FR 47106. 

Although acknowledging that EPA is taking no current action on the Oregon audit provision, the commenter stated that
it is bad policy for EPA to threaten a State permit program by indicating that EPA's own policy is under review, and that
the Oregon law is fully consistent with the Clean Air Act and Federal law on criminal enforcement. The commenter further
stated that civil penalties, which the commenter believes are not precluded by the Oregon audit provision, are adequate
to deter noncompliance and that the Oregon provision does not impinge on EPA's enforcement authorities.
