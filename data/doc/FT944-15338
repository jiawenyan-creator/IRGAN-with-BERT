FT  19 OCT 94 / Employers support pension reforms
Fears that employers will cut back on workers' pensions as a result of new
regulations may be overblown, according to a study.
In the study, by Alexander Clay and Partners, actuarial consultants, 86 per
cent of employers surveyed welcomed the white paper on occupational pension
reform, issued in June.
The survey covered 266 pension schemes with total assets of Pounds 48bn,
about 10 per cent of all UK pension assets.
Eight out of 10 employers were not concerned that proposed minimum solvency
ratios for pension funds would require additional funding, although just
more than a third said trustees might have to revise their scheme's
investment policies as a result.
The rules could force schemes with high numbers of current or deferred
pensioners to shift a greater proportion of their assets from equities to
fixed-interest securities.
Also, 87 per cent of employers supported the transitional arrangements for
phasing in the new minimum solvency test. Employers' groups have called for
an extension of the proposed transitional period.
Some 96 per cent of employers supported the plan for a pensions regulator
although nearly two-thirds of those questioned felt that taxpayers rather
than pension schemes should bear the cost.
