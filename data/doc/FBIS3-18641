<F P=106> [Interview with Civil Service Minister Sabino Cassese by </F>
Massimo Giannini; place and date not given: "I, the Thomas Mann 
of Ministers"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Giannini] Minister, 
this business of the 400,000 new jobs has something incredible 
about it. Have you started engaging in the election campaign 
now? 
  [Cassese] It is strange. Overnight, I, who have always been 
accused of being too rigorous, too strict, or even an enemy of 
public employees, have become -- according to some newspapers, 
trade unionists, and politicians -- a dispenser of jobs for the 
boys or a reckless waster of public funds. And it is a very 
strange that these accusations are coming partly from those who 
until yesterday were arguing the need for the public 
administration to absorb -- by law and without controls -- 
personnel from crisis-ridden enterprises or bankrupt firms. 
  [Giannini] With whom do you take issue, Minister? 
  [Cassese] I could cite many instances, from Federconsorzi 
[Italian Federation of Landowners Consortia] to EFIM 
[Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial Company], and from 
the Cellulose Holding Company to Enichem [National Hydrocarbons 
Corporation Chemicals Division]. 
  [Giannini] Very well, but let us return to the subject: Is 
the aim to regain the respect of public employees a matter of 
days before the elections? 
  [Cassese] I did not promise anyone anything: In the document 
I never mentioned 300,000-400,000 new jobs just in 1994. 
Indeed, I clearly specified that the envisaged competitions 
will not be completed before the end of the year because of the 
large numbers of applicants and the slowness of the procedures. 
  [Giannini] So if it was not an electoral move, please tell 
us 
what it was. Because there are two possibilities: Either you 
miscalculated, or we were laboring under a misconception when we 
thought that the public administration needed to be streamlined 
considerably. 
  [Cassese] Both those suggestions are mistaken. The truth is 
much simpler. There is no doubt that the public administrations 
must contain their recruitment, both because of the need to cut 
public spending and in order to restore the efficiency of the 
administrative machinery. This is indeed the thrust of Law 537 
of 1993, by introducing such fundamental innovations as a 
ceiling on recruitment and cuts in staffing levels. Keep in 
mind, however, that the law refers to the number of jobs 
occupied as at 31 August 1993. 
  [Giannini] What does that mean? 
  [Cassese] It means that the law does not annul any 
competitions initiated or authorized by that date. The 22,000 
recruitments envisaged for the ministries, investigated by the 
public administration department, result from competitions 
initiated or authorized between 1988 and 31 August 1993. In 
other words, these jobs were planned long ago and were budgeted 
for in the draft budget for 1994, so there will be no additional 
burden on public funds and no gaps will be created in current 
expenditure. Apart from this, some of these recruitments are to 
replace staff that have retired in the interim. 
  [Giannini] This is another puzzle. Did the reform not in 
fact envisage attrition? 
  [Cassese] Yes, but in a flexible form, inasmuch as it 
applies 
to 10 percent of state employees and 50 percent of health staff, 
but does not apply to local government, education, and the 
Justice Ministry. So those who retire will be replaced, albeit 
at proportionately lower levels. 
  [Giannini] Very well, but you went further than that. You 
also made a rather rash prediction: Since the new jobs refer 
only to the ministries which, with their 270,000 jobs, represent 
one-fourteenth of the 3.7 million employees who constitute the 
total labor force of the public administration, if you multiply 
the 22,000 recruitments by 14, that means some 300,000 new jobs. 
You will agree, Minister, that this is rather rash at such 
times as these... 
  [Cassese] Statistics are not an opinion. The figure of 
300,000 new jobs resulted from a simple exercise in inductive 
inference. 
  [Giannini] Please, Minister, do not make us long for a 
return 
to political jargon. 
  [Cassese] Let me explain: The statistical simulation was 
carried out by projecting onto the entire body of public 
employees the ratio between the number of jobs offered or 
authorized before 31 August 1993 in the sector of civilian 
ministry employees and the relative number of staff currently 
employed. 
  [Giannini] But of the 22,000 jobs to which you refer only 
18,000 apply to the Interior, Finance, and Justice Ministries, 
that is, the only three ministries that objectively need to be 
strengthened. Why, instead of confining yourself to an 
estimate, did you not carry out a detailed examination of 
employment in other sectors of the public administration? 
  [Cassese] Such a study has been carried out: An examination 
of the offers of employment published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE 
revealed that some 60,000 jobs were offered in 1991, 45,000 in 
1992, and 61,000 in 1993. As you can see, the result has not 
changed much. 
  [Giannini] Pardon me, Minister, but if there are the 
excesses 
in staffing levels that you are constantly criticizing, on the 
basis of what principle are new staff to be taken on? 
  [Cassese] There are two fundamental reasons. First, there 
are some administrations in which staffing levels are too high 
and others in which they are too low, and since the new staff 
mobility procedures have not yet come into effect it is 
difficult to move personnel from one area to another. Second, 
the competitions already initiated or authorized, such as those 
referring to the 22,000 new jobs, cannot and must not be halted, 
as Article 3 of the measure attached to the Finance Bill also 
envisages, for that matter. In other words, our pledges to the 
public must be honored. 
  [Giannini] Precisely. Are you not afraid that your 
initiative may have damaged your image as a kind of Cato the 
Censor which you have acquired through your work and for which 
the Italian people have appreciated you over the months? 
  [Cassese] These are political assessments, photographic 
stills from an electoral show involving many old and new 
protagonists that does not interest me. I am more concerned 
about the community, the ordinary people in the audience. I 
remain convinced that the unemployment problem cannot be 
resolved by using the public sector to create jobs directly. 
But I do not consider it unseemly for the public administration 
to inform the public -- as the newspapers do through their job 
advertisements -- about departments that have initiated 
competitions and are offering places. 
  [Giannini] Yes, but at present, with [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi brandishing the chimera of a million new jobs, it was 
obvious that your offer would seem like an empty promise, too. 
  [Cassese] These political subtleties escape me. 
  [Giannini] Well, you are a teacher, after all... 
  [Cassese] Yes, indeed. Do you know what one of my favorite 
books is? "Confessions of an Impolitic." This government, this 
country, needed my contribution at a certain stage: I have made 
it by saying and doing the things that I believe in. That is 
all there is to it.
