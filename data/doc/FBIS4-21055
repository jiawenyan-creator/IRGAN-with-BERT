  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Apr (EFE) -- Congressional sources today 
told EFE that the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies is investigating 
reports on the exchange of young prostitutes for cocaine on the 
Brazilian border with Bolivia. 
  A delegation of three deputies today went to investigate the 
charges raised by residents of Brazilian townships located in 
border areas with Bolivia in Mato Grosso, Acre, and Rondonia. 
  The deputies investigating the report are socialist Deputy 
Chico Vigilante and conservative Deputies Maria Valadin and 
Zelia Mendes, who serve on the Chamber special committee that 
investigates child prostitution. 
  According to the reports received by the committee, the 
minors are in the 11-16 age bracket--although one was eight 
years old. They are exchanged for cocaine and taken to coca 
growing and producing areas in Bolivia as prostitutes for the 
men working there. 
  The delegation will hear testimonies of state and municipal 
officials and local residents. 
  Some witnesses told the congressmen that a presumably 
Brazilian couple is recruiting minors in the Amazon region, 
ostensibly to work as household servants in Sao Paulo, but these 
minors are taken to the border with Bolivia to be exchanged for 
cocaine. 
  The congressional committee, which started to work six 
months 
ago, will release its final report on 31 May. 
  Social democratic Deputy Moroni Torgan, who is a police 
officer and the rapporteur of this committee, was rather 
cautious about this case but did not rule out this type of crime.
