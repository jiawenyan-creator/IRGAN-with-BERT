FT  04 MAR 93 / Observer: Wedding smells
The phrase 'marriage of convenience' has been given distinctly earthy
overtones by a report from the North Brabant Christian Farmers' Union on the
reasons behind the weddings of 200 pig farmers over the past five years.
It seems they married not for money, but for manure.
With more pigs than people in the Netherlands, the authorities are worried
that the animals' excretions will outweigh the absorbent capacity of the
soil, endangering water supplies. So quota restrictions have been imposed on
the amount of dung the farms may produce.
The effect - since quota rights can be acquired by inheritance - is a
bullish marriage market for farmers' daughters as their hands are sought by
other farmers wanting to boost their manure allowance.
