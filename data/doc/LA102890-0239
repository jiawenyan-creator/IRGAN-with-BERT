MRS. BANGS' ROOMING HOUSE 
I am doing research on the building at 125 South Grand in Pasadena. 
Presently housing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, it began as Mrs. Bangs' 
Boarding House, was later the Vista Del Arroyo Hotel and used as an Army 
Hospital in World War II. 
I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has information they would like to 
share on any of these phases of the buildings life. I am particularly 
interested in more information about Mrs. Emma C. Bangs and the Bangs Family or 
her first husband Frank Childs.
