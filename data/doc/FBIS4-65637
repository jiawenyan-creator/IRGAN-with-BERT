  [Text] European Parliament President Egon Klepsch departed 
Cyprus this afternoon following the conclusion of his contacts 
with government and political party leaders. He said the 
European Parliament will support Cyprus' accession to the 
European Union [EU], and expressed the hope that in the future 
Cyprus will be united. The European Parliament, he added, has 
an obligation to do what it can to end the period of injustice 
and suffering which has prevailed in Cyprus for the last 20 
years. I know the pain, he underlined, because I am German and 
I know what it means for your city to be divided. 
  House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos, who 
accompanied Klepsch to Larnaca Airport, said Cyprus believes 
that even if the Turkish intransigence continues both on the 
substance of the Cyprus issue and on the confidence-building 
measures, the EU will give the green light to begin talks on our 
island joining the Union by the beginning of 1995. Galanos also 
expressed his gratitude and appreciation that the president of 
the European Parliament included Cyprus in his tour during an 
important period when there are many developments.
