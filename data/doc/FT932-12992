FT  26 APR 93 / Ministers accused of wrecking drugs bill
MINISTERS have been accused of colluding with the pharmaceutical industry
and reneging on commitments to open government by refusing to support a
Labour MP's bill that would allow for more published information on drugs.
The Medicines Information Bill proposed by Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for
Durham North, is expected to collapse under opposition from Tory MPs and the
government when it is debated by the Commons on Friday.
Mr Radice said: 'If at the end of the day the government opposes this bill,
it will have destroyed the credibility of the prime minister's
open-government policy.'
His bill seeks to relax provisions in the 1968 Medicines Act on the release
of information so that they restrict the publication only of genuine trade
secrets. He also wants to create rights to information on drug safety.
The government is sympathetic to the principle of the bill. But Mr Tom
Sackville, junior health minister, is expected during Friday's third reading
and report stage to argue that UK drug companies would be put at a
competitive disadvantage and jobs would be threatened.
Some backbench Tory MPs have also expressed concern. Mr James Couchman, MP
for Gillingham, tried to introduce amendments during the bill's committee
stage that could have wrecked the bill. Mr Couchman declared an interest as
an adviser to Pfizer, the pharmaceutical group.
Mr Radice has dropped some clauses from the bill following pressure from the
industry and has promised to make more amendments.
But his bill is unlikely to survive in anything other than a truncated form.
