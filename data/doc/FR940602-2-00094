Background 


The Commission instituted these investigations effective January 28, 1994, following a preliminary determination
by the Department of Commerce that imports of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel from Italy were being subsidized
within the meaning of section 703(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671b(b)) and that imports of grain-oriented silicon electrical
steel from Japan were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice
of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was
given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of February 23, 1994 (59 FR 8658). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on April 12, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 
The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on May 27, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2778 (May 1994), entitled ``Grain-oriented Silicon
Electrical Steel from Italy and Japan: Investigation No. 701TA355 and 731TA660 (Final).''
