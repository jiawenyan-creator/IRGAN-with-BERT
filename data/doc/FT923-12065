FT  21 JUL 92 / Woolwich wins its six-year tax battle
THE government received a rebuke from the Law Lords yesterday as Woolwich
Building Society won the final round in its six-year battle to reclaim
overpaid tax with interest.
Lord Goff of Chieveley described Woolwich's battle to get the Inland Revenue
to repay tax exacted without lawful authority as courageous. 'This case is
of importance not only to the Woolwich but also to the future of law,' he
said.
His words will encourage five other societies whose attempts to reclaim
millions of pounds of overpayments of composite-rate tax have been blocked
by retroactive legislation.
Woolwich's difficulties date back to 1986, when the government introduced
composite-rate tax for building society accounts. Societies with financial
year-ends in the middle of the tax year ended up paying some tax under the
old and some under the new system.
The Lords' ruling establishes that Woolwich was repaid Pounds 91m as of
right and not at the discretion of the Inland Revenue.
