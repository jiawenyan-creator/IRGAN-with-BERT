FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cambridge launches BES - At a Glance
Cambridge University launched a new Business Expansion Scheme yesterday. The
Cambridge University Residential BES comes with a 'buy-back' guarantee after
five years from the university, to pay Pounds 1.14 for every Pounds 1 share
bought now. Cambridge has invested in gilts and deposits to cover this, but
the payment is at risk should the university go out of business in the next
five years.
Non-recourse loans are available from Barclays for top-rate taxpayers who
invest at least Pounds 7,000 - these offer Pounds 740 for every Pounds 1,000
after six months, and Pounds 780 for every Pounds 1,000 after a year. The
effective post-tax investment is Pounds 600. The first Pounds 1.5m has been
reserved for supporters of Cambridge University. The offer is open to the
general public from January 1, but it is probably worth submitting
applications before then.
