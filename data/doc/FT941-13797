FT  24 JAN 94 / People: EIB top staffer
Thomas Oursin is the new secretary general of the European Investment Bank,
the highest staff position at the Luxembourg-based bank, writes Lionel
Barber. His appointment bears the fingerprints of Sir Brian Unwin, former
head of the UK Customs and Excise who took over as EIB president last year.
Sir Brian wants to improve communications with his political masters in
Brussels, and to make sure that the EIB can shape policy as it expands its
lending portfolios and takes a leading role in the European Commission's
strategy to promote economic growth and competitiveness inside the EU.
Oursin, a 63-year-old German who worked at the World Bank, joined the EIB in
1974 and has a reputation for being sociable and skilled at absorbing
briefs. His last job was head of the directorate dealing with operations
outside the EU, such as Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. He replaced
Dieter Hartwich in the post as from January 1.
