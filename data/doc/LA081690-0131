WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY; 
FORUM ON HOUSING CODES 
Culver City property owners can ask city officials about room additions, 
converted garages and city codes at an open house this week. 
The open house will be held today and Friday under the sponsorship of the Code 
Enforcement Office, which aims to combat bootleg units and other illegal 
structures. 
Questions and complaints will be kept confidential, city officials said. 
Under an amnesty program, property owners who report violations of the building 
and zoning codes by Nov. 13 will be spared fines and penalties. They will not 
be required to correct the violations until the property is sold and the title 
is transferred. 
Violations of the health and safety code are also exempt from penalties but 
must be corrected immediately. 
The open house will be held from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at the Building and 
Planning Desk, Trailer No. 3 of the temporary City Hall, 4095 Overland Ave. 
Residents with questions about possible violations can also call 280-5944.
