SWEETHEART, GET ME JERRY WEINTRAUB'S AGENT 
I am grateful to Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Terry Semel 
for helping to redefine the criterion by which one gets a good executive 
position in the entertainment industry, "Jerry Weintraub Quits His Firm, Joins 
Warner" (Sept. 25). 
I hope it's not too late for those of us who are crying all the way to the 
poorhouse to learn a lesson from Mr. Weintraub. (Weintraub Entertainment, about 
$175 million in debt, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.) 
If we could just arrange to lose $175 million of other people's money, we would 
become eminently employable. 
I wonder if this is the same system that worked so well in the deregulated 
banking industry. What was it again? Putting a fox in the henhouse? 
Thanks for a hilarious read.
