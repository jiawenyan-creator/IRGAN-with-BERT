FT  29 SEP 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Recession is dead and world
output is set to expand
The International Monetary Fund has at last dared to call an end to the
recession. Its latest World Economic Outlook says the broadening and
strengthening of recovery in the industrialised countries marks the end of
the 'long and unusually severe downturn' in recent years. It expects world
output to expand 3.1 per cent this year and 3.6 per cent in 1995, or at
twice the rate for 1990 to 1993.
The industrialised countries are forecast to grow by an average 2.7 per cent
this year and next, reflecting an increase of 0.4 percentage points in
forecast growth for 1994, against the IMF's last forecast in May and a
slight upwards revision of 0.1 points for 1995. The developing countries
should grow at more than twice this rate: by a forecast 5.6 per cent this
year and next.
The IMF draws comfort from stronger signs of a turnaround in continental
Europe and more tentative signs of recovery in Japan. It has raised its
forecasts for German growth to 2.3 per cent this year and 2.8 per cent in
1995, up 1.4 and 0.6 points respectively from the forecasts published five
months ago.
It expects France to grow 1.9 per cent this year and 3 per cent next. Its
projections of 3.3 per cent and 3 per cent growth for the UK in 1994 and
1995 respectively are more bullish than the British government's.
Canada and the US are seen as the fastest growing of the Group of Seven
industrial countries this year, with forecast growth of 4.1 per cent and 3.7
per cent respectively. While Canada's growth is expected to slow to 3.8 per
cent in 1995, the US's will decelerate to 2.5 per cent next year. This
deceleration, which the IMF expects because of monetary tightening, would
push US growth below the 2.7 per cent average projected for G7 nations and
the industrial world as a whole.
The IMF's growth forecasts for Japan have been raised 0.2 percentage points
for this year and next to 0.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively. A
'particularly positive' aspect of world economic developments remains the
rapid expansion of many Asian and some Latin American developing nations,
such as Argentina, Chile and Peru.
The IMF draws comfort from large margins of slack between actual and
potential output in many countries. Apart from the US, where little or no
slack is left in output and labour markets, 'output gaps' ranging from an
estimated 1.7 per cent in Germany to 5.6 per cent in Japan reduce inflation
dangers.
The report states all this gives no grounds for complacency. Areas exist
where output continues to fall, as in the former communist states of Russia,
Ukraine and Belarus. Despite signs of improvement, economic conditions
remain difficult in much of Africa. In the industrial countries, policy
makers are faced with difficult tasks if they are to secure a strong,
long-running expansion with low inflation and high investment that can help
cut unemployment.
They must avoid the policy failures of the 1980s and safeguard a high degree
of price stability. That means acting promptly to raise interest rates in
anticipation of inflationary pressures as recovery takes hold, and
strengthening efforts to cut fiscal deficits.
'A critical policy requirement is the need to deal with the large fiscal
imbalances that have lifted gross debt in the industrial countries as a
group to nearly 70 per cent of gross domestic product from 40 per cent in
1978.'
Fiscal imbalances have contributed to high real interest rates and weak
private investment over the past decade. Governments recognise the problem
and are acting, but consolidation plans 'in most cases. . . appear to be too
modest'.
The IMF draws a moral from the recent rise in worldwide bond yields, which
hit countries with large fiscal imbalances such as Italy, Sweden and Finland
hardest. Here, an urgent need exists to strengthen the fiscal outlook, to
establish greater credibility.
But macroeconomic measures alone will not solve the world's economic
problems. Reducing structural unemployment, which is Europe's big problem,
will need fundamental labour market reforms, 'including lowering and
restructuring unemployment benefits and related programmes, lowering minimum
wages in some countries, reducing non-wage labour costs, liberalising
employment and wage-setting practices, and strengthening training
programmes'.
The Uruguay Round needs to be implemented. More liberalisation of markets is
needed in many industrial countries. All countries must introduce reforms to
curb rising budgetary costs of health care and pensions. The IMF predicts
strong overall growth in the developing countries, but notes conditions
vary. The most successful have created a stable macroeconomic environment,
encouraged domestic savings and implemented structural reforms that increase
efficiency.
The Fund worries that the rise in private capital flows to developing
nations over the past five years could in some cases backfire. In 1989, net
outflow from developing countries totalled Dollars 14bn; last year it
exceeded Dollars 130bn.
Not all countries benefiting from capital inflows have done so because of
investment opportunities or strong fundamentals. Some may have been
beneficiaries of a 'general enthusiasm for emerging financial markets'. For
them, 'the risk of sudden changes in market sentiment is particularly
serious'.
Those former communist countries such as the Baltic states, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Albania and
Mongolia which implemented market reforms, 'are now growing, or appear to be
on the threshold of recovery, and prospects for continued growth are good.'
In others, including Russia and the Ukraine, output continues to contract
and more must be done to control inflation. Enormous difficulties must still
be faced over structural reform in Russia and some other 'transition'
countries.
Many banks and companies are insolvent. Large payments arrears have built
up. Progress on land reform and farm privatisation has been limited.
Subsidies and cheap credits distort market signals. The framework for a
market economy, including business laws, accounting standards, and a modern
banking system, is only gradually being put in place. 'Widespread corruption
and crime threaten to undermine support for market reforms.'
The World Economic Outlook: to be published next month.
