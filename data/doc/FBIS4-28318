  [Text] The Government has instructed all offices concerned 
to abide by the United Nations resolution on sanctions against 
Haiti's military government. 
  The Cabinet on Tuesday approved the proposal of the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs to implement tough measures against the 
military regime in Haiti. As military leaders in the Caribbean 
island country have not complied with the governors' island 
agreement to restore democracy to Haiti, the UN Security Council 
on 6 May 1994 has imposed additional measures to tighten 
sanctions against Haiti. [sentence as heard] 
  According to the UN Security Council's Resolution 917, only 
humanitarian flights will be allowed to enter or pass Thai air 
space or land in Thailand. All of those involved in the 1991 
military coup in Haiti will not be allowed to enter Thailand. 
The Thai Government is also ready to freeze assets of those coup 
makers in Haiti. Trade sanctions against Haiti is also focused 
upon in the resolution banning trade ties with Haiti except for 
humanitarian purposes. [sentence as heard]
