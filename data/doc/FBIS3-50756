<F P=106> [Interview with Peruvian Army Colonel Jose Bailetti, </F>
retired, president of the Institute for National Defense 
Research, Iniden, by Victor Andres Ponce; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Ponce] How do you interpret the latest actions of 
the Shining Path [SL]? 
  [Bailetti] If one considers the letters of [SL leader 
Abimael] Guzman, which almost admit surrender, and reviews the 
last letter, signed by Abimael and four [SL] Central Committee 
members, one can see that the terrorist group is obviously 
breaking into factions. Since this organization began its 
bloody war, the appearance of a dissident group represents an 
unprecedented move... 
  [Ponce] Who would be heading this dissident group? 
  [Bailetti] It could be that this group would be headed by 
Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand (Feliciano) ["Comrade Feliciano"]... 
  [Ponce] Are there any clues in this regard? 
  [Bailetti] Police work will confirm this possibility. 
  [Ponce] Do the actions by the SL in Lima follow the 
activities of the four zonal committees? 
  [Bailetti] This is true. Following the capture of the SL top 
leaders, the terrorist group established four zonal committees 
in each one of Lima's cones [conos]. The SL actions in Ancash 
Department are also significant. Its December actions confirm 
this. Another group continues to be active in Satipo Province in 
the Ene Valley zone... 
  [Ponce] Are there any differences between the latest SL 
actions and those commanded by Guzman? 
  [Bailetti] The main difference is that today's SL people 
have 
diminished economic resources because they are no longer 
financed by drug traffickers. The Huallaga committee has been 
acting on its own for a long time. The Huallaga committee and 
the traffickers are currently moving toward the south of our 
country on the Aguaytia-Ene Valley axis. 
  [Ponce] From the way you describe the situation, Guzman has 
not been heeded by the majority of the militants who are free? 
  [Bailetti] This is not necessarily true. Some 180 SL 
militants killed three SL leaders and then surrendered under the 
Repentance Law in the Sello de Oro zone in Ayacucho Department. 
  [Ponce] What is your prognosis for the future of the SL? 
  [Bailetti] I believe it will break into three factions: The 
Huallaga militants, who are moving to the south as drug 
traffickers also move in that direction; those who will continue 
with their armed actions; and, finally, those who will obey 
Guzman's call. 
  [Ponce] So, what is the balance of the negotiations between 
the government and Guzman? 
  [Bailetti] There is no room for any negotiation here. We are 
facing a decimated, cornered, and penniless force. There is 
nothing to compare the situation that once prevailed in Colombia 
or El Salvador where negotiations were a national necessity.
