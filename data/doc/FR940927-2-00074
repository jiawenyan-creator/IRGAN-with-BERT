shares in the United States. The components of the portfolio represent companies which are generally perceived to
have recently experienced declines in earnings as compared to historical levels and/or other adverse developments

II. Description of the Proposal


Under Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''), the NYSE may approve for listing securities
which can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures,
and warrants.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE is now proposing under Section 703.19 of the Manual to list for trading MITTS based on the Restructuring Companies
Portfolio (``Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS'').
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>

See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29229 (May 23, 1991), 56 FR 24852 (May 31, 1991); and 28217 (July 18, 1990),
55 FR 30056 (July 24, 1990) (``Hybrid Approval Orders'').

</FOOTNAME>
The Commission recently approved the listing and trading on the Exchange of MITTS based upon (1) A global portfolio
of securities representing telecommunications companies, and (2) a portfolio of European companies. See Securities
Exchange Act Release Nos. 32840 (September 2, 1993), 58 FR 47485 (September 9, 1993); and 33368 (December 22, 1993),
58 FR 68975 (December 29, 1993) (``MITTS Approval Orders'').

</FOOTNOTE>


As with the other MITTS products, the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will conform to the listing guidelines
under Section 703.19 of the Manual, which provide that: (1) Issues must have a minimum public distribution of one million
securities; (2) a minimum of 400 shareholders; (3) a minimum duration of one year; (4) a market value of at least $4 million;
and (5) otherwise comply with the NYSE's initial listing criteria.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange will monitor the Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS to verify compliance with the
Exchange's continued listing criteria.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 MITTS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Merrill Lynch that provide for a single payment at maturity,
and will bear no periodic payments of interest. Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will entitle the owner at
maturity to receive an amount based upon the percentage change between the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending
Average Portfolio Value,'' subject to a minimum repayment amount. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value
of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio on the date on which the issuer prices the Restructuring Companies Portfolio
MITTS issue for the initial offering to the public. The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value'' is the average of the values
of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio at the end of the five calendar quarters preceding the expiration of the
Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS on December 31, 1999.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>

</FOOTNAME>
The hybrid listing standards in Section 703.19 of the Manual are intended to accommodate listed companies in good
standing, their subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-listed equities which meet the Exchange's original listing
standards. Domestic issuers must also meet the earnings and net tangible assets criteria set forth in Sections 102.01
and 102.02 of the Manual. Specifically the minimum original listing criteria requires that issuers have: (1) 2,000
holders holding 100 shares or more or have 2,200 holders with an average monthly trading volume of 100,000 shares;
(2) a public float of $1.1 million shares; (3) an aggregate public market value of $18 million or total net tangible
assets of $18 million; and (4) earnings before taxes of $2.5 million in the latest fiscal year and earnings before taxes
of $2 million in each of the preceding two fiscal years, or earnings before taxes of $6.5 million in the aggregate for
the last three fiscal years with a $4.5 million minimum in the most recent fiscal year (all three years are required
to be profitable).

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
10

</FOOTNAME>
The continued listing criteria for capital or common stock requires that: (1) The number of holders of 100 shares or
more is equal to or greater than 1,200; (2) the number of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than 600,000; (3)
the aggregate market value of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than $5 million; (4) the aggregate market
value of shares outstanding (excluding treasury stock) is equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income
after taxes for the past three years is equal to or greater than $600,000; and (5) net tangible assets available to common
stock are equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income after taxes for the past three years is equal to or
greater than $600,000. In addition, the continued listing standards for bonds require that outstanding publicly-held
bonds have an aggregate market value or principal amount equal to or greater than $1 million.

Section 802 of the Manual.

Specifically, the Ending Average Portfolio Value will equal the average of the quarterly values of the Restructuring
Companies Portfolio beginning in the calendar quarter ending December 31, 1998. The quarterly value for each of the
first four of the final five calendar quarters shall be the Restructuring Companies Portfolio value on the last scheduled
Exchange trading day on which there is no market disruption event. The quarterly value for the final calendar quarter
shall be the Restructuring Companies Portfolio Value on the seventh scheduled Exchange trading day preceding maturity
of the Restructuring Companies MITTS unless there is a market disruption event in which case the sixth trading day
preceding maturity shall be used.

</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
The Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS will entitle a holder at maturity to receive for each $10 principal amount
of MITTS an amount equal to the Ending Average Portfolio Value of the Restructuring Companies Portfolio divided by
10, but in any event no less than $9 per each $10 principal amount of Restructuring Companies Portfolio MITTS.
