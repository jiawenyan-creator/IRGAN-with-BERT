FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Serious fraud investigations should
not take forever
Sir, You report that in response to a parliamentary question about the
Serious Fraud Office's investigation of matters involving the flotation of
this company, the attorney-general said that the investigation was being
'pursued rigorously' ('Call for early Butte inquiry verdict', March 1).
The attorney-general is no doubt practised at believing the improbable.
The truth of this matter is that the Serious Fraud Office investigation, for
the first 18 months, was understaffed and ill-directed.
It has been much improved in the last two months, however.
This is not a criticism of the individual police officers, who have behaved
excellently; it is a criticism of their direction, and of the inappropriate
nature of the resources allocated by the SFO to investigate a Pounds 100m
fraud.
It would be a pity if it were generally believed that serious fraud
investigations in Britain had to take forever and be done badly.
With proper briefing and direction, successful fraud investigation in cases
such as Butte should take months, not years.
