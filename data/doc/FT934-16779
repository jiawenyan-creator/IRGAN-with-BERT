FT  05 OCT 93 / British Land pays Pounds 32m for complex
BRITISH LAND, the commercial property company, is to buy one of the largest
retail and office complexes in the Midlands, the company said yesterday.
The acquisition, valued at up to Pounds 32m, is the latest in a series of
deals signed by the company following the launch in June of a property
partnership with Quantum Fund, the investment vehicle owned by Mr George
Soros, the international financier.
The investment in Temple Court, a 300,000 sq ft complex under development in
central Birmingham, will bring the total value of acquisitions by the joint
venture to Pounds 120m.
Temple Court is the first partially built office complex to be acquired by
the partnership, which boosted property shares at its launch by announcing
plans to invest up to Pounds 1bn over the next four years.
Richardson Barberry, the developers, said the final purchase price would
depend on its success in letting retail units on the site.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, has already agreed to lease 100,000 sq
ft, while a further 125,000 sq ft will house eight county courts and offices
for the Lord Chancellor's Department.
Mr John Weston Smith, finance director of British Land, said the deal would
be put forward to Mr Soros' officials shortly for final approval.
Once the transaction and development work is completed next year, British
Land expects the complex to generate income of Pounds 2.75m a year.
