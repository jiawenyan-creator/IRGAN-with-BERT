FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (8): You may be wise to
fish in the pool - Collective funds / It's less exciting, admits Philip
Coggan, but even the better-off should not ignore unit and investment trusts
THE WEALTHY tend to overlook unit and investment trusts. Perhaps this is
because collective funds are seen as suitable only for the 'small investor'
and that, once one has more than Pounds 100,000 or so, direct equities
represent the 'real thing'. Perhaps it is simply more exciting to follow
one's investment in Tesco or Hanson than it is to track the growth of the
M&amp;G Dividend fund.
But unit and investment trusts have a number of advantages that the
better-off investor would be unwise to overlook. For a start, both are
exempt from capital gains tax (CGT) when portfolios are re-arranged. This
means that, while a private investor may hesitate about switching from, say,
Glaxo to British Gas, because of a potential CGT bill, a trust manager can
easily make the change.
Of course, if the investor wanted to sell his holding in a unit or
investment trust, he could still face a potential CGT liability. But a
collective fund makes long-term investing that much easier. Running a
portfolio of direct equities involves the investor in a series of difficult
choices - in which the desire to take profits and the fear of a tax bill
continually come into conflict.
In contrast, if the investor has a stake in a holding in a large investment
trust, he can rely on the manager to make the switches for him. The holding
need only be sold if the manager performs badly, or if cash is needed to
meet an important commitment.
Secondly, unit and investment trusts have published track records which the
investor can monitor. (Figures for the leading trusts appear every three
months in the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, and the statistical
records of all trusts appear every month in the FT's sister publication
Money Management.)
Most private-client stockbrokers say (not unreasonably) that each investor's
temperament and needs are different, so they cannot publish an 'average'
portfolio to show how they have performed. This makes it a lot more
difficult for a potential client to judge whether the firm is worth using.
Another advantage can be cost. In the unit trust sector, wealthier investors
may get a better deal than the less well-off. In July, a reporter from the
FT's sister publication, Financial Adviser, called the dealing desks of 15
unit trust groups, posing as a private investor with Pounds 55,000. He was
offered a discount off the initial charge at 12 of them. The discount varied
between 1 and 3 per cent, a maximum saving of Pounds 1,650.
And among investment trusts, wealthy investors may well find that the
management fees represent good value compared with the charge that would be
levied by a private-client stockbroker for looking after the same amount of
money.
Unit and investment trusts may well offer a wider range of investments than
the private-client stockbroker. One would have to be a very wealthy
individual indeed to be able to buy a spread of equities in, say, the
Brazilian market. A stockbroker seeking to give his clients exposure to such
markets would probably use a unit or investment trust in any case.
Finally, some unit trust groups offer a complete range of funds, including
cash and bond trusts, and allow investors to switch between them at reduced
cost. It is relatively easy to select a trust that will provide the required
level of income, or pure capital growth. They can thus represent a 'one-stop
shop' for an investor's portfolio needs.
Having said all that, there are some areas where unit and investment trusts
may not be able to offer the same services as a stockbroker.
The first is personal service. Some investors like to chat about their
investments with the person in charge of them; that may be impossible if you
are trying to deal with seven or eight very busy investment trust managers.
Furthermore, a private-client stockbroker may be able to offer to
consolidate all the dividend payments (to simplify tax returns) and will
certainly offer regular valuations. The investor using unit and investment
trusts would have to do that for himself.
A stockbroker will also be able to advise a client on the right time to
switch out of equities and into cash, to avoid an event like the crash of
1987 (provided - and this is a pretty large proviso - the broker can see the
crash coming). Most unit and investment trusts are simply unable to switch
from shares into cash on any significant scale.
The investor is also faced with the responsibility of choosing the unit or
investment trusts himself. With some 200 investment trusts and 1,500 unit
trusts in existence, that could be quite an arduous task.
One answer to these problems is to opt for a unit or investment trust
portfolio management service. These tend to be offered by stockbrokers and
independent financial advisers. Most managers offer a range of products
designed to produce growth, income or a balance of the two.
Although this service may be administratively easier, the investor can
easily find himself paying two sets of management fees (one to the broker
and one to the managers of the underlying trusts). In addition, as with the
direct equity service offered by brokers, it may be difficult to obtain past
performance figures for such portfolios.
