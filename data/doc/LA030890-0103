1 DEAD, 134 MISSING IN AMAZON COLLISION 
One person was killed and at least 134 people were missing after a boat 
carrying 209 people collided with a freighter and sank in the Amazon River near 
Iquitos, 715 miles northeast of Lima, police said. 
Many of the passengers were children returning from holiday. The vessel's 
helmsman told police that its engine failed and it began drifting, hitting 
several small boats anchored near shore and then careening into a large 
freighter. The river boat rolled over and sank within minutes, police said.
