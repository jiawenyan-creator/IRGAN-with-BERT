<F P=106> [News conference by President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares </F>
with unidentified reporters upon his arrival at the Presidential 
Palace; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] ...do you think there should be a second 
round of elections in the next electoral process? 
  [Perez Balladares] This has not been the custom in the past. 
Traditionally, victory has always been acknowledged with less 
than 50 percent of the vote. However, this topic could be 
discussed. I believe Panamanians have the last word on this 
issue. 
  [Reporter] What do you expect of the meeting you will have 
with President Endara? 
  [Perez Balladares] President Endara announced a long time 
ago 
that he would invite the elected candidate, immediately after 
his victory, to start talking about government transition 
issues. He has kept his word by inviting us this afternoon, and 
we accepted his invitation with pleasure. 
  [Reporter] How does Dr. Perez Balladares assess this 
invitation? 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe it is part of the democratic 
process, of the change of government that has to take place on 1 
September. President Endara, in keeping with his promise, is 
trying to make the transition as smooth as possible to benefit 
the entire country. 
  [Reporter] Does the meeting have an agenda? 
  [Perez Balladares] No, there is no special agenda. We are 
going to talk about general topics, I suppose. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Perez Balladares] No, not yet. 
  [Reporter] Drug trafficking is becoming a problem in Latin 
America. Panama is becoming an essential bridge for drug 
trafficking activities. What are you going to do to stop drug 
trafficking activities during your administration? 
  [Perez Balladares] We will do all we can to stop drug 
trafficking activities and the use of drugs in our country. 
  [Reporter] Including the laundering of drug money? 
  [Perez Balladares] Yes of course. 
  [Reporter] What measures will you implement? 
  [Perez Balladares] Well, we will implement many measures, 
but 
this is not the right time to discuss this issue. 
  [Reporter] The voting results show you still do not have a 
majority in the Legislative Assembly. How do you think this 
will influence your government? 
  [Perez Balladares] I believe we have the obligation to 
accept 
the mandate of the Panamanians, and they have not given us a 
majority in the Assembly. This will force us to find ways to 
talk and communicate with other political forces so our 
government program can [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] At a news conference this morning, Ruben Dario 
Carles said he would make a better president than you. [words 
indistinct] 
  [Perez Balladares] That is not what the Panamanian people 
think. Thanks boys. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] opposition to President 
Endara's government? 
  [Perez Balladares] What did you say? 
  [Reporter] You have always been against President Endara's 
government. How do you think [words indistinct]? 
  [Perez Balladares] I think it will go well. I believe the 
Panamanian political sector has shown extraordinary maturity 
during this electoral process, and this shows -- it is an effort 
we have all made, including President Endara -- a commitment to 
continuing on this path, and it shows that we have a commitment 
to fully democratize the country. Without doubt, the phase of 
confrontation and distrust has ended, and the country is opening 
the door to the 21st century with greater political maturity. 
Excuse me, boys, I have to go. The president is waiting for me.
