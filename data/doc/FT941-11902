FT  02 FEB 94 / Barclays offers 2% pay rise
Barclays Bank has offered its clerical staff a 2 per cent pay rise. The
offer is the first in this year's bank pay awards and is likely to set the
trend for the sector.
Officials from the Bifu banking union walked out of their first bargaining
meeting with Barclays' management yesterday, claiming the company was
imposing the award and circumventing negotiations.
The pay offer, covering about 60,000 clerical-grade staff, has been linked
to the introduction of flexible working which is already happening
informally in some branches, but which management wants to formalise across
the the bank.
Barclays said: 'We are very conscious of the need to improve customer
service by providing extra opening hours in areas where there is a demand
for it.' The bank said it had no plans to introduce longer opening hours
across the board.
The bank said it thought a 2 per cent pay rise was 'realistic in the present
market conditions'. It added: 'We are very happy to discuss it with the
unions.'
