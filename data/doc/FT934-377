FT  29 DEC 93 / Gelli bank holdings seized
The financial activities of Mr Licio Gelli, controversial head of the secret
Italian Masonic lodge, P2, have come under the spotlight following the
seizure of more than L16bn (Pounds 6.5m) worth of bank assets held in his
name.
The assets were seized on Monday under a law permitting magistrates to do so
if they suspect the origin of a person's wealth stems from illicit
operations.
Mr Gelli is the subject of at least three separate criminal investigations.
Last year he was sent for trial for alleged links with the Mafia.
He has also been linked to some of the murkier episodes in post-war Italian
history including the 1982 collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano and the death of
the banker Roberto Calvi. However, he has been able to carry on extensive
financial activities over the past decade.
The move against Mr Gelli promises to begin to lift the veil on the little
investigated activities of the Freemason movement in Italy and its suspected
connections with organised crime and with the far right and secret services.
Mr Lucio Violante, head of the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, said
yesterday that Mr Gelli until now had clearly benefited from protection from
within the establishment. He also called for a thorough investigation into
those banks which had agreed to do business with him.
Rome magistrates claim Mr Gelli bought treasury bills and commercial paper
from various banks between 1989 and 1992 to the value of L16.4bn. In this
period his total declared tax income was L138m. Mr Gelli has denied any
wrong-doing.
