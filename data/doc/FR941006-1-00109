 

Treatment for an iron overdose frequently includes 
parenteral administration of deferoxamine (also referred to as 
desferrioxamine), a drug which chelates (i.e., binds) iron in the 
intracellular fluid and causes its excretion in urine (Ref. 6). 
Given that 1 g deferoxamine can bind 93 mg of iron, and that, to 
avoid hypotension, infusion is generally recommended at 15 
mg/kg/hr, there is a limit to the amount of iron deferoxamine can 
bind. For example, safe administration of deferoxamine to a 10 
kg child over a 24 hr period is capable of binding only 324 mg of 
iron (Refs. 11 and 12). 
 Therefore, if very high levels of iron are absorbed, even 
prompt treatment with deferoxamine or another agent may not 
prevent a fatal outcome if chelation at the maximum safe rate 
cannot reduce the iron burden to levels below those that cause 
death. 
 Speed of diagnosis and therapy are important. With earlier 
and more effective treatment, the mortality rate from iron 
poisoning has been reduced from as high as 45 percent to about 1 
percent (Ref. 9). 
 

C. Summary of Information on Pediatric Deaths and Injuries 


1. Citizen Petitions 
 

Data have been submitted to or obtained by FDA on reports of 
deaths attributable to accidental pediatric iron poisoning that 
were made between 1983 and 1993 to the American Association of 
Poison Control Centers and between 1986 and 1993 to CPSC (Table 
1). Although these two sets of data are not identical, they do 
have extensive overlap (cases included in both databases). They 
both point to an increase in reported fatalities from accidental 
iron poisonings of children in the early 1990's. 
 The number or rate of fatalities does not represent the 
totality of the health hazard, however. Data obtained by FDA 
from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) 
show that from 1986 through 1992 there were nearly 63,000 reports 
to poison control centers involving ingestion of adult iron- 
containing products, with over 47,000 of these reports involving 
children under 6 years of age (Refs. 14 through 20). Many of 
these victims required hospitalization, and many others required 
some medical treatment. For example, Table 2 shows that over 
1,500 of these cases were classified as having ``moderate 
outcomes,'' i.e., the patient had symptoms that, while not life 
threatening, usually required some form of treatment. One 
hundred fifty-nine cases were classified as ``major outcomes,'' 
i.e., they were life threatening or resulted in permanent injury. 
Except for 1992, AAPCC data do not indicate how many of the 
moderate and major outcomes involved children under 6 years of 
age. However, for 1992, 55 percent (17/31) of the major 
outcomes, and 51 percent (141/278) of the moderate outcomes, 
involved children under 6 years of age.
