FT  24 JUN 93 / Mandela, Buthelezi at odds: Leaders fail to agree on
election date
SOUTH AFRICA'S two most important black leaders, Mr Nelson Mandela and Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, met yesterday for a long-awaited summit, but failed to
agree on the crucial issue of setting a date for the country's first
multi-racial elections.
After 10 hours of talks, Mr Mandela, leader of the African National
Congress, emerged grim-faced to say that the two men had not been able to
agree on an election date. The setting of a date, and the installation of a
transitional executive to oversee government before elections, are
preconditions for the lifting of international economic sanctions against
South Africa.
Mr Mandela had hoped to announce an election date when he visits the US next
week with Mr F W de Klerk, the president. He said he believed a breakthrough
on this issue could still be achieved in the 26-party constitutional talks,
but this seemed unlikely without the agreement of Chief Buthelezi.
Mr Mandela said the two men had made 'a great deal of progress' towards
ending political violence between supporters of the ANC and of Chief
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. They said they would address joint peace
rallies to persuade their supporters to cease fighting which has left over
15,000 people dead since 1984. In Natal province alone, 45 people died in
the three days before the talks. Both also committed themselves to banning
dangerous weapons at political rallies, a leading demand of the ANC.
The trial of three right-wing whites accused of murdering South African
Communist party leader Chris Hani was delayed yesterday to October 4, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg. Mr Hani was shot outside his suburban
Johannesburg home in April.
