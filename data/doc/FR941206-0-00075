 

(i) For facilities with acid-water scrubbers, the owner or operator shall establish as a site-specific operating
parameter during the test methods and procedures in 63.365(b)(1) either: 

(A) The maximum ethylene glycol concentration using the procedures described in 63.365(e)(1); or 

(B) The maximum liquor tank level using the procedures described in 63.365(e)(2). 

(ii) For facilities with catalytic oxidizers or thermal oxidizers, the owner or operator shall establish as a site-specific
operating parameter the baseline temperature during the performance test in 63.365(b)(2) using the procedures
described in 63.365(f)(1). 

(2) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, the owner or operator shall comply with
one of the following provisions: 

(i) For facilities with acid-water scrubbers, operation of the facility with an ethylene glycol concentration in
the scrubber liquor in excess of the maximum ethylene glycol concentration or the liquor tank level in excess of the
maximum liquor tank level shall constitute a violation of the sterilization chamber vent standard. 

(ii) For facilities with catalytic oxidizers or thermal oxidizers, operation of the facility with the oxidation
temperature, averaged over three cycles, more than 5.6
&cir;C (10
&cir;F) below the baseline temperature shall constitute a violation of the sterilization chamber vent standard.


(c) The following procedures shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limits under 63.362(d),
the aeration room vent standard: 

(1) During the performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine either:


(i) The concentration of ethylene oxide emitted from the aeration room into the atmosphere (after any control device
used to comply with 63.362(d)) using the methods in 63.365(c)(1); or 

(ii) The efficiency of the control device used to comply with 63.362(d) using the test methods and procedures
in 63.365(d)(1). 

(2) For facilities seeking to comply with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section with catalytic oxidizers or thermal
oxidizers, the owner or operator must also establish as a site-specific operating parameter the baseline temperature
using the procedures described in 63.365(f)(2). 

(3) Following the date on which the initial performance test is completed, the owner or operator of a facility shall
comply with one of the following provisions: 

(i) For facilities continuously measuring the ethylene oxide concentration emitted from the aeration room (after
any control device), operation of the facility with a 3-hour average ethylene oxide concentration in excess of the
1 ppmv ethylene oxide concentration limit shall constitute a violation of the aeration room vent standard. 

(ii) For facilities with catalytic oxidizers or thermal oxidizers, operation of the facility with the oxidation
temperature, averaged over three hours, more than 5.6
&cir;C (10
&cir;F) below the baseline temperature shall constitute a violation of the aeration room vent standard. 

(d) The following procedures shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limits under 63.362(e)(1),
the chamber exhaust vent standard for sources using 10 tons: 

(1) For facilities manifolding emissions from the chamber exhaust vent to a control device controlling emissions
from the sterilization chamber vent and/or the aeration room vent, the owner or operator shall comply with the appropriate
compliance provisions for that vent type and control device (see paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section). 

(2) For facilities not manifolding emissions from the chamber exhaust vent (to a control device used to comply with
63.362(c) or (d)), the owner or operator shall comply with the following: 

(i) During the performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, the owner or operator shall determine the
efficiency of control devices used to comply with 63.362(e)(1) using the test methods and procedures in 63.365(d)(2)
as well as the following:
