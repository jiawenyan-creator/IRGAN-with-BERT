FT  18 AUG 93 / Paris sets out plan for jobs increase
THE French government has finalised a five-year plan to fight unemployment
by reducing the costs of hiring workers while maintaining social benefits,
the Labour Ministry said yesterday.
Government officials said that the scheme would be the centrepiece of its
strategy to reduce unemployment, forecast to rise to 12.5 per cent by the
end of the year. But they declined to give details before the plan is
formally announced on Thursday.
The plan is expected to include a fixed timetable for the government's
commitment gradually to take over from employers the burden of social
security charges for employees' families. The French government has already
cut employers' payments for the lowest paid workers and is committed to
doing away with them entirely.
The plan may also include modifications to the SMIC, the inflation-indexed
minimum wage. The SMIC is blamed by many employers and political
commentators as one of the principal factors in France's high unemployment
rate, particularly among the young. The unemployment rate for 18-25 year
olds is about 20 per cent, one of the highest rates in Europe.
But Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, said last week in a television
interview that he did not want 'to use the pretext of an economic crisis to
reduce the protection of the least advantaged in the country'.
Officials at the Labour Ministry said that the main emphasis of the plan,
which contains about 50 measures, would be the simplification of procedures
and the reduction of costs relating to access to the labour market, training
and state administration.
Mr Balladur will discuss the plan with trade unions and employers on
September 6. It will go to the full cabinet on September 15 and be presented
to parliament from October 4.
