 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Labor is issuing these regulations pursuant to the requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular No. A110 (Revised), which provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. This rule also applies to the Department of Labor's grants to commercial organizations,
foreign governments, organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments and international organizations.



OMB issued Circular A110 in 1976 and, except for a minor revision in February 1987, the Circular remained unchanged
until revised in 1993. To update the Circular, OMB established an interagency task force to review the Circular. The
task force solicited suggestions for changes to the Circular from university groups, non-profit organizations
and other interested parties and compared for consistency the provisions of similar provisions applied to State
and local governments. The revised Circular and these regulations reflect the results of these efforts.
