  [Text] Engineer Franck Pierre, secretary general of the 
Capois Lamort Organization of Haiti [OCLH], has called for a 
state of siege. Pierre wrote Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras, 
commander in chief of the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH], demanding 
the state of siege and calling for the president of the Republic 
and Parliament to declare a state of siege to prepare for any 
possible provocation in Haiti. The current political sphere of 
influence continues to tear Haiti's social fabric and has led 
the country to a fatal deadlock, clearly threatening our 
national sovereignty with the military intervention of foreign 
powers known as Friends of Haiti. 
  The OCLH can in no way remain indifferent and idle during 
crucial points in the nation's life and has decided to save and 
defend our national independence. The OCLH earnestly and firmly 
asks the FADH high command: 
  1) To order a state of alert at all military bases in the 
nine geographic departments and to put the Army on alert; 
  2) To call up all officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
retired soldiers or those who were declared unfit for service in 
the FADH; to restore to the ranks of the FADH all former 
officers, noncommissioned officers, soldiers, tacticians, 
technicians, and others who were dismissed from the various 
corps, including the navy, infantry, artillery, training camp, 
aviation, and especially the elite corps that had been 
dissolved; that is, the Dessalines Barracks and the Corps of 
Leopards; to set up the FADH military high council immediately, 
composed of retired generals and colonels, to train and 
supervise the current High Command. 
  Engineer Franck Pierre is very firm about this. He demands a 
state of siege. The country will thus know it had been defended, 
explains Franck Pierre of OCLH. Forward! he cries to all 
Haitians and foreign nationals living on Haitian soil. Defend 
our lives and our interests in the face of the Haitian genocide, 
planned by foreign powers, that is coming. Up with a free, 
independent, sovereign Haiti, he exclaims. 
  It should be pointed out that the (Mais Gate) International 
Airport was reportedly under strict military control during the 
night of 30 to 31 May. We are awaiting further information from 
our colleagues on that issue.
