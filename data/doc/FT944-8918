FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Expense managers in expansion
move
The Richbell Group, an international strategic investment company, has
created what it claims to be the world's biggest integrated provider of
employee cost management services, writes Tim Dickson in London.
The deal involved Richbell's subsidiary Harpur Group, an operator of
corporate fuel charge-cards and fleet management services, buying Gelco
Payment Systems for Dollars 65m. The transaction values the combined group,
whose shareholders include the quoted investment trust RIT Capital Partners,
at Dollars 223m.
Harpur operates corporate fuel cards under the Overdrive and Dialcard names,
while Gelco's services include the outsourcing of accounting and employee
expense claims in the US and Canada. The companies initially plan to expand
in North America, the UK and Australia.
