FT  29 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Rapid reading in the French
Post Office
At a rate of 35,000 letters an hour, a French optical system can recognise
96 per cent of properly typed addresses. CGA, part of Cegelec (a member of
the Alcatel Alsthom group) has spent nine years developing this character
recognition system.
The system, of which the French Post Office has 40 and has ordered 40 more,
uses transputers developed by UK-based Inmos (part of France's SGS-Thomson)
and neural networks or pattern recognition computer systems.
CGA: France, 331 69885870.
