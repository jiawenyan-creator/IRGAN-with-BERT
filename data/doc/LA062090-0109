ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; 
RESIDENTS CELEBRATE DOWN-ZONING STAND 
Residents who have fought for four years to limit development in the Cypress 
Street neighborhood are celebrating this week after the Planning Commission 
decided that the area should be rezoned for lower density. 
The recommendation to the City Council, which residents say closely reflects a 
petition drafted by the community, suggests that the six-block area, where 
multiple dwellings are now allowed, be down-zoned to allow duplexes at most. 
Residents hope the change will help them control overcrowding, crime and gang 
activity. 
"It's a good beginning," said Bea Vega, a 39-year resident of the Old Towne 
community. "It will be a nicer place to live." Vega said she is optimistic that 
the City Council will accept the commission's recommendation. 
Commissioner Don Greek opposed the change, saying it was not an effective way 
to upgrade the neighborhood. 
The commission also voted unanimously to recommend a general plan amendment to 
rezone the Santa Fe Railroad Depot area from light industry to a limited 
business and residential district, if the City Council also can guarantee an 
emergency fund that businesses may use to help them relocate in case of 
disaster. 
Despite the promise of financial help, longtime owners of industrial property 
said they were unhappy with the recommendation because rezoning would diminish 
the value of their land. 
Robert Baier, whose family has owned property in the 33-acre industrial area 
for 70 years, said that if the area is rezoned as residential, his two lots 
would sell for one-third the current appraised value of $300,000. 
The Planning Commission recommendation follows a study two years ago that 
showed that the depot area was under-utilized and suggested that it be 
developed as a commercial and retail center to attract pedestrian traffic from 
Orange Plaza.MARY HELEN BERG
