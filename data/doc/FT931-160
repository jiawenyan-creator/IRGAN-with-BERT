FT  31 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Euro-glasnost
ONE MIGHT suppose that Denmark's EC partners would sympathise with its
desire to allow greater public access to the proceedings of the Council of
Ministers, in the hope of allaying the darker suspicions of Danish voters
before they decide the fate of the Maastricht treaty on May 18. But
apparently not. Danish proposals to broadcast three councils this month were
vetoed by other member states, and a decision is still pending on two more
scheduled for next week.
It is argued that opening up council debates will make them either purely
ceremonial or an occasion for political posturing, driving the real business
into other, more private, meetings. Why, it is asked, do not national
cabinets meet in public?
The analogy is false. The Council, though composed of national ministers, is
not a government but a legislature. Legislatures do not normally meet in
private. Indeed the publicity of parliamentary proceedings, finally
established in the 18th century, is considered a cornerstone of British
democracy.
Of course, legislators do not always tell the whole truth, and votes are
often the subject of private negotiations outside the chamber. But EC voters
and taxpayers are entitled to know how their representatives vote on
proposed legislation, and what reasons they give for it. It may be more
convenient for ministers to keep quiet on the matter, and later let 'the
Brussels bureaucracy' take the blame for unpopular directives. But if they
continue to behave like that they should not be surprised by public
disenchantment with the whole European enterprise.
