48. As noted, the date for payment of standard fees will be announced by public notice and published in the 

Federal Register

. For licensees, permittees and holders of other authorizations in the Common Carrier, Mass Media and Cable Services
whose fees are not based on a subscriber, line or circuit count, fees should be submitted for any authorization held
as of October 1, 1993. We have selected October 1 as the date for calculating these fees since October 1 is the first day
of the fiscal year and, therefore, current licensees subject to the fees would have benefited from out regulatory
activities since the beginning of the period covered by their payment.

In light of this decision, the comments by Orbital Communications Corporation, GE American Communications, Inc.
and Starsys Global Positioning, Inc. concerning appropriate payments for satellites that became operational after
commencement of the fiscal year are moot.

</FOOTNOTE>


49. In the case of regulatees whose fee payments are based upon a subscriber, line or circuit count, we have decided
that the number of a regulatee's subscribers, lines or circuits on December 31, 1993 will be used to calculate the fee.
We have selected the last date of the calendar year because many of these entities file reports with us as of that date.
Others calculate their subscriber numbers as of the last day of the calendar year for internal purposes. Therefore,
calculation of the subscriber fee as of that date will facilitate both an entity's computation of its fee payment and
our verification that the correct fee payment has been submitted. Cable systems should calculate their FY 1994 regulatory
fees using the subscriber data that was provided to the Commission for the 1993 Annual Report of Cable Television Systems
(FCC Form 325A) submission. Accordingly, the number of subscribers will not necessarily be based on December 31,
1993, but rather on ``a typical day in the last full week of December 1993.'' (

See 

FCC Form 325 Instructions at page 1). Finally, since entities in the Private Radio services pay their fees when applying
for an new, renewal or reinstatement license, we will require Private Radio applicants to submit a regulatory fee
with new, renewal and reinstatement applications filed following the effective date of these rules.



5. Method and Location of Payment



50. We proposed to adopt generally the same methods of payment for regulatory fees as we established for application
fees. See 47 CFR 1.1108(a). In addition, we proposed to establish a process to permit the electronic filing of fee payments,
initially on an experimental basis. Further, we proposed to permit payment of fees by credit card (VISA and Mastercard)
in some circumstances subject to the requirement that, when a credit card payment is made, the entire fee payment must
be made in a single credit card transaction.

51. Several parties have requested clarification of our requirements for multiple fee payments by Private Radio
licensees.

 Other parties support our proposals concerning payment methods, particularly our decision to accept credit cards
and electronic payments.

52. We have designed FCC Forms 159 (Remittance Advice) and 159C (Continuation sheet) to replace Form 155. We
are satisfied that the forms, and our rules, provide sufficient clarification of our requirements concerning multiple
fee payments. These forms are to be submitted with any regulatory fee payment in the mass media, common carrier and
cable services. Payors, in the Private Radio services making a single regulatory fee payment, other than by electronic
means or credit card, are not required to file a Form 159 as long as their accompanying application form provides the
information necessary to accomplish the payment.



6. Multiple Payments



53. Generally, we will permit any entity, including licensees in the private radio services, to make multiple section
9 regulatory (and section 8 application) fee payments within the same lockbox, including, where applicable, installment
payments. Under this procedure, a single payment form and a single instrument of payment may be used to cover multiple
regulatory fee payments.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 A multiple regulatory fee payment also may cover payments by more than a single regulatee. Regulatees making combined
payments of regulatory fees and application fees within the same lockbox for the Private Radio services may make payment
with a single payment instrument and are to submit with the multiple payment a Form 159 and, if needed, a Form 159C.
Also, any regulatee making payment by credit card, including licensees in the private radio services, must submit
a Form 159. See the specific instructions concerning the use of Forms 159 and 159C. A copy of the forms and instructions
may be obtained from the Federal Communications Commission, Forms Distribution Center, 2803 52d Avenue, Hyattsville,
MD 20781.

Payors of regulatory fees for vanity call signs must submit a Form 159 with their applications.

54. Each regulatee will remain solely responsible for assuring that its applications and authorizations are properly
accounted for and listed, and for submitting the full, cumulative payment covering each of its licenses and authorizations.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 As described below, payment deficiencies could lead to penalty charges, dismissal of applications and revocation
of authorizations. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Payment of a regulatory fee may be made by a third party, as NABER and NECA request. However, the entity subject to the
requirement to pay the fee will remain responsible for ensuring correct and timely payment.

</FOOTNOTE>


55. As proposed in our 

NPRM, 

we are establishing a single lockbox at our lockbox bank for the receipt of mass media, common carrier and cable regulatory
fees. The single lockbox will accept Mass Media, Common Carrier and Cable Services regulatory fee payments, and will
enable regulatees to submit fee payments for these services to the same lockbox and to combine their fee payments for
these service categories. However, Private Radio fees will not be accepted at this lockbox and, instead, should be
submitted to the lockbox designated for application fees covering the category of license or authorization for which
the payment is made. See sections 1.1152 through 1.1155 for the address, including lockbox number regarding payment
of regulatory fees for the specific categories of service.
