FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: EIE to restructure 'on its own'
EIE International, a Japanese property developer weighed down with debts of
Y700bn (Dollars 4.3bn), plans to restructure without help from its main
bank, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
On Monday, five leading Japanese banks said that they would halt lending to
EIE. The break with the banks came after a dispute with LTCB which has
Y190bn in loans outstanding to the company.
'We plan to restructure on our own,' an official said. EIE would continue
its important Sanctuary Cove and Bond University projects on the Gold Coast
of Queensland, Australia, he said.
LTCB decided to stop support for EIE after a disagreement over the company's
restructuring plan.
The bank proposed a sharp cutback in EIE's assets including an option of
bankruptcy, but Mr Harunori Takahashi, EIE president, opposed the proposal,
banking industry sources said.
Japanese press reports quoted Mr Takahashi as saying he planned to form a
new restructuring programme as soon as possible. He was reported to be
confident of EIE's restructuring since it 'needs little new money to
continue its business'.
An LTCB spokesman said on Monday that even if the bank sets aside provisions
against bad loans to EIE International, it will try to minimise the impact
on earnings for 1993-1994 by selling its shareholdings.
He denied media reports that LTCB will set aside Y80bn to Y100bn in
1993-1994 in provisions against bad loans to EIE.
