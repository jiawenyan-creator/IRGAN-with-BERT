  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan's economy remains in a 
slump with no bottom yet in sight, although an end is probably 
on the way, the economic planning chief said Friday [27 May]. 
  Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency (EPA), said his view "has not changed much" from a month 
ago, when he pronounced the economy to be in an "extremely 
severe" state at the outset of the cabinet of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata. 
  "As of now, we can't see the bottom," Terasawa told a 
regular 
news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  But he said he finds himself on the verge of declaring the 
economy to be "brightening" as such signs as consumption improve. 
  He noted such continued worries as falling capital spending 
but said, "there are not so many gloomy figures, so the bottom 
should be coming some time." 
  Terasawa also said he sees no connection between talk of 
raising the consumption tax from 3 percent as part of a broad 
tax system overhaul, and Hata's order to freeze hikes in public 
service charges for the rest of the year.
