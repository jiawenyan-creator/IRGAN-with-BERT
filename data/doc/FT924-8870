FT  09 NOV 92 / Observer: Forecasting the forecast
Deciding what numbers to extract from a forecast is, for the UK Treasury, as
much a function of psychology as it is of correctly interpreting economic
reality.
For this reason, just about everyone should be able to enjoy Observer's
latest competition. This is to anticipate the Treasury's forecast which will
be contained in Thursday's Autumn Statement.
In the past two years, official forecasters have sounded foolishly bullish
in their predictions of growth and demand - not that they have been short of
the company of City economists in their erroneous predictions,
However, those infamous green shoots still stay stubbornly underground, and
the need to calm the country ahead of an imminent general election has, for
the moment, passed. How gloomy can the boffins afford to be?
Equipped with the latest City projections, and a mild bent for amateur
psychology, readers are invited to fax, to 071-873-3926, their best attempts
to get inside the Treasury mind.
Forecasts of the forecast should encompass the following economic indicators
during 1993: growth in gross domestic product, in fixed investment, in
consumer spending and in manufacturing output; the size of the current
account deficit; and the year-on-year change in the retail prices index as
measured in the fourth quarter.
Entries should arrive by noon on Thursday and a bottle of malt whisky awaits
the set of numbers that most accurately reflects the official version of the
near-term fate of the UK economy.
To encourage the new spirit of glasnost inside the department, Observer
extends a special invitation to the denizens of Great George Street to enter
the contest themselves. It is, after all, possible that the numbers will be
altered at the 11th hour.
