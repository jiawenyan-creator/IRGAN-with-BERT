WINE; 
THREATS END BOOK-SIGNING TOUR 
Robert M. Parker Jr., author of five wine books and publisher of a wine 
newsletter, canceled a book-signing tour of Los Angeles and San Francisco this 
week after threats were made against him, his secretary said. 
Parker, an attorney who left that profession after founding the successful wine 
journal The Wine Advocate in 1979, couldn't be reached for comment on the 
report. 
Joan Passman, Parker's secretary, said that on the advice of police and 
attorneys, he was not making public comments about the situation. "There have 
been threats against him, and the events are under investigation," she said. 
A friend of Parker, who requested anonymity, said a caller made threats in 
which Parker's West Coast schedule was mentioned. Among the places Parker was 
to appear to sign copies of his new book "Burgundy" were Wally's in Westwood 
and the Wine House in West Los Angeles. He also canceled appearances at Draper 
&amp; Esquin and Pacific Wine Co. in San Francisco and at Beltramo's in Menlo 
Park.
