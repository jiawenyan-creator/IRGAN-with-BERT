Bulletin" No. 44/94] 
  [Text] Monday, March 7 -- A special session of the 
Estonian Government decided to propose high-level consultation 
to Russia in order to settle the differences between the two 
countries. The government also protested against Russia's 
attempts to destabilise the situation in the Baltic region and 
demanded that the troops withdrawal be completed by August 31. 
The Estonian Government statement stressed Estonia's 
willingness to continue the negotiations. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar told the journalists that the 
Russian additional conditions, including the demand of 23 
million dollars, contradict Russia's international obligation of 
a speedy, orderly and complete withdrawal. "The Estonian side 
never promised them any compensation," Laar said. 
  Foreign Minister Juri Luik explained that the consultations 
would help to settle the differences and to continue the talks. 
He also pointed out the threat of the Russian military 
presence, referring to the recent fire in a Russian military 
unit near Paldiski. 
  Riigikogu [parliament] Foreign Affairs Commission Chairman 
Vello Saatpalu had recommended to continue the negotiations in 
the territory of a third country, but Friday's [4 March] 
government session did not discuss it, government spokesman Ain 
Saarna said.
