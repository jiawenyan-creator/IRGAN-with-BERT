BRIEFLY 
Reservation System Breaks Down: The computerized reservation system for 
American Airlines failed for nearly 12 hours, hindering flight scheduling for 
the airline's passengers around the world. John Hotard, a spokesman for the Ft. 
Worth-based airline, said the Sabre II computer reservation network went down 
shortly after midnight and was reactivated just before noon Friday. The 
computer network, based in an underground bunker in Tulsa, Okla., drives 
American Airlines' computerized reservations system worldwide and provides 
services to more than 14,000 other entities, including car rental companies, 
hotels and a third of all U.S. travel agencies. There was no immediate 
explanation for the failure.
