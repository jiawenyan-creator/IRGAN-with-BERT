 

The California Olive Committee met on December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended a total expense amount of $3,748,290,
for its 1994 budget. This is $928,530 more in expenses than the previous year. The increase is primarily due to additional
funding for market development.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $27.21 per ton for the 1994 fiscal year, which is
$1.46 more in the assessment rate from the 1993 fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments
of 101,000 tons, would yield $2,748,210 in assessment income. This, along with approximately $1,000,000 from the
Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses.

Major expense categories for the 1994 fiscal year include $1,150,000 for the market expansion program, $990,860
for consumer affairs, and $173,730 for salaries. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $300,000
will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12526, March 17, 1994) and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act.

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994 fiscal year for the program began January 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
apply to all assessable olives handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which
was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action
as a final rule without change.
