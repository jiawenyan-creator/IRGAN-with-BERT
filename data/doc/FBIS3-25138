<F P=106> [Report on statements by Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special </F>
representative in Angola, in Luanda on 8 February--passages 
within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Chief Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special 
representative in Angola, was received this afternoon by 
President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The two 
exchanged views for some 30 minutes, particularly about the 
Angolan peace process. At the end of the audience, Blondin Beye 
was still the same man -- optimistic and confident. He said not 
even the latest military developments, particularly in Cuito, 
can stop the Lusaka negotiating process. 
  [Beye in French, fading into Portuguese translation] "The 
(?derailments) that we have seen in the past 48 hours will not 
[words indistinct], but we will continue." 
  Beye had just arrived from Cote d'Ivoire, where he attended 
the funeral ceremonies for Felix Houphouet-Boigny. While in 
that country he also discussed the complicated Angolan problem, 
meeting various officials. 
  [Beye] "I held talks with people involved in or worried 
about 
the Angolan dispute, notably the Ivorian authorities, the U.S. 
delegation and in particular George Moose, and the Portuguese 
delegation led by the minister of cooperation. I had useful 
talks with the Moroccan prime minister. I also met with the 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
delegation led by its secretary general and head of the UNITA 
team to the Lusaka talks. We discussed the latest developments." 
  Obviously, Beye was referring to the situation in Cuito, 
where Jonas Savimbi's men have launched new attacks. Beye 
regrets the situation. 
  [Beye] "I regret it profoundly. There is no need for it. It 
is necessary that what we do in Lusaka coincides with how people 
behave on the ground. We will tackle the situation, but we 
cannot do anything without the political will of both the 
government and UNITA. I still believe that both the government 
and UNITA have opted for dialogue. These derailments and 
confusion are deplorable, but we will do our best to cope with 
the situation." 
  Beye did not elaborate. He said the confusion is like 
flames fanned at a time when peace is near, adding: There are 
the enemies of peace and those who are afraid of peace. Blondin 
Beye leaves for Lusaka tomorrow.
