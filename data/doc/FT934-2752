FT  11 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: What the wise buyer will want on board -
Jancis Robinson finds plenty of seasonal bargains in the first part of her
high street wine choice
Fine wine-making techniques have been filtering down, yea even unto the
under-Pounds 3-a-bottle bracket. Indeed, the following British off-licence
chains and supermarkets have all but given up on expensive wine, leaving
that elite area to the independents.
This year's worthwhile fashions include cheap Portuguese reds, Argentinian
perfumed white Torrontes - and Riesling, in dry form, has finally been
allowed out of the closet.
The more expensive the wine, the more limited its distribution (LD). Star
ratings denote corporate commitment to wine quality.
ASDA****
This year's prize for the most improved wine selection. The Leeds-based
supermarket group now has a range of well-chosen, often unusual bottles.
WHITES
Hungarian Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 2.99. The dark, heavy bottle says Pounds 12
burgundy. The wine says fiery Hungarian white rather than restrained
Chardonnay. The combination is rated a Minosegi bor (quality wine) and is
well worth trying at the price.
Chilean Sauvignon Blanc 1991 Pounds 3.29. If the well-designed label is
correct, this wine is heading for its third birthday and yet still has
attractive, lemony zest.
Mount Barker Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 4.99. Goundrey. Full, pungent, big
Western Australian but with good balance. Very keen price.
REDS
Rowan Brook Cabernet Malbec 1992 Pounds 3.29. Good-value Chilean, not too
heavy or syrupy. The Chilean Cabernet Merlot at Pounds 3.49 is in the same
mould.
Pinot Noir Vin de Pays de l'Aude 1992 Pounds 3.75. Great price for Limoux's
oak-aged answer to red burgundy.
Barbera d'Asti 1990 Gemma Pounds 4.49. Lively, full, accessible example of
Piedmont's dominant grape.
Ribera del Duero 1987 Senorio de Nava Pounds 5.69. Intense, deep coloured,
oaky, quite chewy but dramatically powerful essence from Spain's most
fashionable red wine region.
SPARKLING
Sharffenberger Brut Pounds 8.99. A Californian that is not trying to be
champagne but which can offer more complexity and maturity than any
champagne selling at the same price.
AUGUSTUS BARNETT**
Poor old A Barnett has finally been swallowed up by Allied-Lyons and will
doubtless be 'integrated' with Victoria Wine in the New Year. Graphics could
do with a new broom.
WHITES
Chasan, Vin de Pays d'Oc 1992 Domaine le Ploges Pounds 3.79. Amazing how
popular this relatively recent crossing of Chardonnay with the sherry grape
(Listan) has become. It would not have happened had they decided to call it
Listonnay. Light, spritzy Chardonnay imprint on a decent wine from the
Languedoc.
Chardonnay, Vin de Pays d'Oc 1992 Domaine de la Tuilerie Pounds 3.99.
Definitely worth the extra 20p, if only for the label, but also for the
ubiquitous but well-made Ryman Chardonnay made outside Carcassonne. Heady
aroma, slightly short.
REDS
Ch Ormieres 1991 Minervois Pounds 3.99. Very appetising second wine from the
widely-admired Ch Fabas. The same sort of build as red bordeaux, and ready
to drink.
Ch Lascombes Pounds 13.99-Pounds 24.99. Until recently this Margaux second
growth was under the same ownership as AB and the company can therefore
offer an array of vintages, 1983-1990, at fair prices. The 1985 at Pounds
24.99 is a dream to drink now, the 1986 at Pounds 18.49 is closing up.
FORTIFIEDS
Warre's Quinta de Cavadinha 1982 Pounds 13.49. Extremely fine alternative to
vintage port and ready to charm.
Gonzalez Byass Matusalem Pounds 18.45 (at Oddbins and Safeway too). A great,
proper, sweet sherry that is one of the very few wines which could be served
with both cheese and Christmas pudding.
DAVISONS and FULLERS
London and environs only but well worth seeking out.
GATEWAY**
Some very silly prices until January 4 and some imaginative selections. Good
Spanish range.
WHITES
Castillo Imperial 1992, Alanis Pounds 1.79. Cleverly blended dry white from
Galicia in north west Spain. Clean, lively, Atlantic seaboard wine. Low key
label. Could be anyone's house white over Christmas.
Chablis Premier Cru 1991 Pounds 4.99. If you must spend an extra Pounds 3.20
for a recognisably smart name and obviously burgundian bottle, then you
won't find better value than this, although the wine is not that much more
interesting, per se, than the Galician above.
REDS
Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignons Pounds 1.99. Melnik, Russe and Svichtov
wineries' offerings reduced from Pounds 2.85. Too many matchsticks for me,
but never mind the quality . . .
Ch La Verdotte 1992 Margaux Pounds 4.49. It comes to something when Ch
Durfort-Vivens, the estate ranked only four places short of a first growth
in 1855, is flogging its second wine at this sort of price. This wine,
described with some licence on the back label as from 'the gravelly hills
north of Bordeaux', is usually Pounds 6.49 and is certainly ready to drink.
MAJESTIC***
Wines for bargain hunters rather than technopurists here. Parcels and job
lots a speciality. Minimum 12 bottles.
WHITES
Bergerac Sec 1992 Domaine de Jolie Coeur Pounds 3.49. Respectable dry white
with good fruit and a hint of apples.
Pinot Blanc 1992 Ch Oberlin Pounds 4.99. Soft but lively Alsace from the
city of Colmar's own domaine. Good value.
Trittenheimer Altarchen Riesling Kabinett 1990 Grans-Fassian Pounds 5.99. A
sensational palate-sharpener from one of the top middle Mosel producers.
Just 8 per cent alcohol: purity, zip, delicacy and perhaps a whiff of
elderflowers in a bottle. Reaches parts no champagne ever can.
Vouvray 1989 Marc Bredif Pounds 7.99. Textbook stuff with honey, flowers,
and not so much acid that it cannot be drunk now with a wide range of foods,
but this medium dry wine will continue to develop for decades.
REDS
Lightning Ridge Shiraz Pounds 3.49. A special export blend from Australia
although it is much lighter, juicier, more peppery, and more southern French
than the average Oz red.
Pinot Noir 1991 Fleur de Carneros Pounds 6.99. They are getting the hang of
Pinot Noir in California. This is a second label from Carneros Creek and is
of the fruit rather than earth school. It won't get any better but is just
the style of scented red to serve with turkey.
SPARKLING
Cremant de la Loire NV Langlois-Chateau Pounds 5.99. Reduced from Pounds
7.49 and a well-made wine from Bollinger's outpost in the Loire.
Ruinart champagnes. Ruinart has long been an insider's favourite and
Majestic offers non-vintage R de Ruinart at Pounds 16.99 or, for those who
revere age and stature in a champagne, Dom Ruinart Blanc de Blancs 1983 at
Pounds 32.50. There is a further 15 per cent discount on unsplit cases of
these and several other champagnes. The Dom Ruinart would tempt me if I were
organising a seriously smart party.
MARKS and SPENCER
The M&amp;S shelves carry a sort of civil service selection of wine, leavened by
the odd daring addition. Solid rather than inspiring.
WHITES
Chardonnay 1992 Domaine Mandeville Pounds 3.99 Another Vin de Pays d'Oc,
from a relatively cool corner of the Languedoc in the Minervois hills. More
Chablis than Australian.
Chardonnay-Semillon 1992 Rothbury Estate Pounds 4.99 Well crafted New South
Wales blend of nearly 60 per cent Chardonnay with a high proportion of
Cowra's glossy, golden fruit.
REDS
Domaine St Pierre 1992 Pounds 2.99 Special offer for December on this ripe
blend of Merlot and Syrah from Domaines Virginie in the Languedoc.
Domaine la CoCte aux Loups 1992 Bourgogne Pounds 3.99 Attractively soft,
juicy, light red burgundy from the far north of the region near Chablis.
Margaux 1989 Pounds 6.99 Scented, plump claret ready to drink now.
SPARKLING
Saumur Brut 1990 Bouvet Ladubay Pounds 6.99 Lovely wine-making, delicate
mousse.  Refreshing, lighter than champagne.
Veuve de Medts NV Premier Cru Pounds 12.99 Some real age and development on
this wine, from the co-operative Union Champagne (a high proportion of all
the cheap champagne currently available comes from the co-ops). A champagne
that could be drunk with food.
ODDBINS*****
Powered by the energising combination of sheer enthusiasm and a certain
arrogance, Oddbins' buyers are the wine trade innovators. Their two London
fine wine shops at Holborn and Notting Hill Gate are probably the best in
the UK.
WHITES
Australian 1993 Rhine Rieslings. The off-dry Valley Estates version offers
spine, acidity, perfume and a bit of sherbet for Pounds 3.25, while the
Penfolds Bin 202 at Pounds 3.95 (Pounds 3.99 at Thresher) is broader. The
Mitchelton Goulburn is seriously fine and dry (much drier than most Alsace,
for example) for Pounds 4.99, but the Mt Langi Ghiran at Pounds 5.99 is
worth it too, all lime, fizz and refinement.
Santa Carolina and Casablanca Chileans from Pounds 3.99. Well made and good
value, especially the Santa Rosa Vineyard Sauvignon at Pounds 3.99.
Moscato d'Asti La Serra 1992 Marchesi di Gresy Pounds 3.99. Light, grapey,
low in alcohol. Post prandial refreshment?
Schoffit 1992 Alsace. Here is a young producer who seems to be extracting
only the fruitiest, most explosive part of the grape, partly by keeping
yields to below 50 hectolitres per hectare (the average is more than 80),
and partly by gentle, protracted pressing. Oddbins has limited quantities of
the eye-opening Pinot Blanc Cuvee Caroline at Pounds 6.99, a vigorously racy
Riesling from the Harth vineyard at Pounds 7.99, and an exceptionally long
Gewurztraminer that smells appetisingly of bacon fat at Pounds 8.99. Even
more thrilling (and richer) are Bernard Schoffit's Grand Cru wines available
soon from the two fine wine stores.
Shaw &amp; Smith Sauvignon Blanc 1993 Pounds 7.49. Both powerful and delicate.
Political similes spring to mind.
Krondorf Show Reserve Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 7.99. Another elegant, lively
Australian white.
Monbazillac 1990 Ch la Borderie Pounds 9.99. Seriously fine barrique-aged
sweet wine; better than many a Sauternes. Should keep for five or more
years.
Vouvray Moelleux 1990 Trie de Grains Nobles Pounds 10.99. Another stunning
effort from Domaine des Aubuisieres. Drink now in its full and lovely youth,
or keep in a cool, safe place for five or more years.
REDS
Minervois 1992 Domaine d'Arbens Pounds 3.49. Full, round, exciting medium
weight red in the soft, fruity mould of a good Loire red. Useful.
Palacio de la Vega 1991 Pounds 4.99. Cabernet Sauvignon with 30 per cent
Tempranillo, one of the many interesting blends to be coming out of Navarre.
Lively with lots of oak.
McWilliams Cabernet Sauvignon 1991 Pounds 4.99. Well tamed mouthful of
Australian red.
Coldstream Hills Pinot Noir 1992 Pounds 7.99. Just the thing for the turkey;
ready, and extremely easy, to drink.
Mt Langi Ghiran Shiraz 1991 Pounds 7.99. Full, round, correct, still wearing
its barrique pedigree.
Leeuwin Estate Redgum Ridge Cabert 1990 Pounds 7.99. Unusually dry and chewy
for an Australian red, from one of Western Australia's most famous estates.
Another Pounds 2 secures the exciting 1989 grand vin.
Ridge Geyserville Zinfandel 1991 Pounds 11.99. A truly fine wine with with a
brambly punch and a long aftertaste. To drink or keep. Ridge's Santa Cruz
Cabernet Sauvignon 1991 at Pounds 13.99 is also stunning.
FIZZ AND FORTIFIEDS
A range of special offers.
SAFEWAY***
In many ways the antithesis of Marks and Spencer, Safeway's wine department
seems to be fuelled by pure instinct. Thus, Safeway is most useful as a wine
supplier to those who share its enthusiasms: modern Iberians and cheap
eastern Europeans, together with English and organic wines.
Out of 80 or so of their wines tasted recently, there were a number that
struck this palate as too quirky. But those listed below are of genuine
interest.
WHITES
Domaine de Malardeau 1992 Cotes de Duras Pounds 3.49 (LD). One of several
Hugh Ryman Sauvignons on the market made in this useful region on the
fringes of Bordeaux. The explosion of fruit seduces the palate as the label
does the eye.
Australian Chardonnay 1993 Pounds 3.99. Well-integrated lively fruit from
Riverina. Full bodied yet not sickly, proving irrigation can be a good
thing?
Falcoaria 1992, Almeirim Pounds 4.29 (LD). A Portuguese answer to Alsace.
Exciting, lively, aromatic white with a dry finish, made by peripatetic
whizzkid Joao Ramos.
Vinas del Vero Chardonnay 1991, Somontano Pounds 5.29 (LD). Textbook barrel
fermented Chardonnay with all the delicacy on the palate that entails - but
Spanish? A nail in the coffin of blind tasting as a rational activity. Vinas
del Vero, in the far north of Navarre, also produces a creditable, if rather
light, Pinot Noir 1989, listed by Safeway at Pounds 6.49.
Penfolds Organic Chardonnay/Sauvignon 1993 Pounds 5.99. A super-concentrated
yet quintessentially crisp offering from biodynamically sound fruit grown in
the cool(ish) Clare Valley of South Australia.
REDS
Alentejo 1992 Pounds 2.99. Juicy blackberries fashioned into an aperitif,
almost white wine, style at the Redondo co-op in southern Portugal. Good
value.
Young Vatted Tempranillo 1992 La Mancha Pounds 3.19. All winery, no taste of
the vineyard, but a juicy, good value red. An interesting comparison with
the very similar central Spanish red below.
Casa de la Vina, Cencibel 1992 Pounds 3.29. The Rioja grape Tempranillo is
fashioned into a lively red with a chewy finish carrying the lower rent
denomination Valdepenas.
Las Alturas, Mendoza Pounds 3.49 (LD), also from Victoria Wine. An
interesting Argentine red, made by Jacques Lurton from Bonarda, the Italian
grape variety that has become Argentina's most planted red grape variety
since so much Malbec has been ripped out. It tastes as though juice lurks
under a layer of appetising dust.
Quinta do Vale da Raposa 1992 Douro Pounds 4.49 (LD). A remarkably soft,
flattering red considering its provenance, the harsh Douro valley which is
better known for port. More evidence for the case against automatic
fortification.
Quinta da Pancas 1990, Alenquer Pounds 5.75 (LD). A superior bottling with
the powerful reek of new oak rather than any particular patch of western
Portuguese soil, but an eye opener by any standards.
Penfolds Cabernet Sauvignon 1989 Coonawarra Pounds 7.99. Well-balanced, full
flavoured Australian answer to claret. A gold medallist in this year's
International Challenge organised by Wine magazine. Available elsewhere.
SWEET WHITES
Domaine Brial 1992 Muscat de Rivesaltes Pounds 3.49 a half (LD). Pleasant,
smart packaging, light golden Muscat in the old Beaumes-de-Venise mould.
Ch de Berbec 1989 Pounds 3.49 (LD). Peachy smooth Semillon made sweet just
across the river from Sauternes. Great value. Not subtle.
NEXT WEEK: Sainsbury, Thresher/Bottoms Up/Wine Rack and Victoria Wine.
