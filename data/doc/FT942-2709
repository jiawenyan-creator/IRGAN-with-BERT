FT  17 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Nervous trading following a Bank of England warning on interest rates marked
the last full day of dealings in the current index futures and share options
contracts, writes Joel Kibazo.
In Liffe futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100, which will cease
trading this morning, traded in a tight range of around 10 points for most
of the session. Having opened at 3,015, it touched a low of 3,012 and a high
of 3,034, although most of the day's trading was carried out around the
3,025 level.
Dealers continued to roll positions forward into the September contract,
which assumes the market leader position after today's mid-morning expiry.
The decline in UK gilts was said to have had a less than usual impact on
trading.
The June contract closed at 3,025, down 17 from its previous close and at a
4-point discount to cash. Volume in June was a hefty 21,111 lots, and some
12,516 were dealt in the September contract.
In traded options, which today see the expiry of the June index options,
total volume was 35,783, against 33,182 in the previous day. The FT-SE 100
option traded 15,100 contracts. Argyll was the busiest stock option with
3,260 lots dealt, but the single biggest trade was carried out in
Pilkington, one house selling 2,000 of the November 180 calls at 11 1/2 p.
