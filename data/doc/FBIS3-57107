<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, head of the State Duma </F>
International Affairs Committee and a leader of the "Yabloko" 
bloc, by Vladimir Mikheyev, date and place not given: "Vladimir 
Lukin: I Know What Must Be Done But I Do Not Know Where"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Lukin is head of the State Duma 
International Affairs Committee and a leader of the Yabloko 
bloc. He preferred the parliamentary platform in the "house on 
the embankment" to his former residence as Russian ambassador in 
Washington. 
  "According to standing orders the committee must consist of 
at least 12 people and at most 35 and must be formed on the 
basis of the proportional representation of the factions. In my 
view this principle is important, but it must be combined with 
the deputies' professional qualities," Vladimir Lukin replied in 
an interview for IZVESTIYA. 
  [Mikheyev] Presumably, Ambartsumov, Adamishin, and Sheynis 
have a good chance of a place on the committee. They are all on 
the Yabloko faction's list. 
  Opinions of them may vary but they are eminent specialists 
in 
international relations, Lukin noted. 
  [Mikheyev] Asked the other day whom you would like to see as 
your successor in Washington, you virtually repeated the 
aphorism that "the most important thing is that it is a good 
man".... 
  [Lukin] In the term "a good man" I include a combination of 
professionalism and ethical norms. 
  [Mikheyev] Will you find a place on your committee for 
Deputy Kozyrev? 
  [Lukin] Ministers do not take part in the work of 
committees, in my opinion this will be stipulated in the 
standing orders. But if he prefers to concentrate on work in 
parliament, then why not? He is a professional. 
  [Mikheyev] How will your work be organized? 
  [Lukin] We do not have the conditions to satisfy even our 
most minimal requirements in this building. We do not have the 
premises. 
  [Mikheyev] Do you intend waiting until parliament's $500 
million "castle in the air" is built? 
  [Lukin] Why? To put it mildly, this solution is untimely. 
But since the Constitution proposes that we have a working 
parliament it is necessary to create the conditions for it. My 
view is that for a committee chairman a car is not a luxury but 
an essential means of transport. As for salary, there are 
rumors that everyone will be paid the same, from the chairman of 
the Duma to the deputy chairman of a committee. I do not know 
what the figure is. 
  [Mikheyev] The impression created is that you still do not 
feel that you have special powers, that you have the reins of 
power in your hands.... 
  [Lukin] In my opinion, the whole Duma does not have the 
reins of power. I know what must be done but I do not know 
where. 
  [Mikheyev] What do you, as chairman of the foreign affairs 
committee, see as the priorities of Russia's foreign policy? 
  [Lukin] At a time of crisis Russia's foreign policy must 
ensure every condition possible for overcoming the crisis. 
There is the creation of a favorable export climate. The rate 
of the ruble against the dollar is falling, it cannot be 
stopped, at least not long term, by financial manipulations; 
consequently it is necessary to export, it is necessary to earn 
hard currency. At the summit, for example, progress was made on 
the sale of Russian uranium to the United States -- we must 
continue in that vein. 
  Another area is to ensure the physical security of Russia 
and 
its citizens by diplomatic and economic methods so as not to 
have to resort to other methods. That is connected with the 
former Union republics. 
  [Mikheyev] Is there a complete coincidence of views between 
you and President Yeltsin? 
  [Lukin] I have never had disagreements with the president on 
foreign policy. I have been asked how I regard the "new 
thinking," to which I replied -- I do not know of any "new 
thinking." There is only right thinking or wrong thinking. The 
right thinking amounts to defending our national interests, 
which precludes two methods. The first is offering tender 
kisses and one-sided concessions. The second is howling and 
barking like a dog, which unites everyone in a coalition against 
us.
