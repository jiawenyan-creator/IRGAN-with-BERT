ANGELS MANAGE ONLY TWO HITS AND LOSE, 3-1 
Melido Perez pitched a two-hitter and struck out 12 as the Chicago White Sox 
ended the Angels' five-game winning streak as they beat them, 3-1, Friday in 
the first game of a doubleheader. 
The loss dropped the third-place Angels 4 1/2 games behind Oakland in the AL 
West. 
Perez (10-13) walked two in his first complete game of the season. He held the 
Angels hitless until Devon White got an RBI single with two out in the sixth 
inning, and also allowed Brian Downing's two-out double in the seventh. 
Jim Abbott (11-11) gave up three runs on seven hits in seven innings. Carlos 
Martinez doubled with one out in the second, advanced on a grounder and scored 
on Abbott's wild pitch. 
The White Sox made it 2-0 in the fifth when Sammy Sosa led off with a bunt 
single, moved up on a sacrifice and scored on Gallagher's single. Carlton Fisk 
and Martinez opened the seventh with singles, Sosa walked and Karkovice blooped 
a run-scoring single for a 3-1 lead. 
Mark McLemore drew a leadoff walk in the sixth, stole second and scored on 
White's single.
