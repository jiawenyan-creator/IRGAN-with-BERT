IN BRIEF; 
DUPER CLEARED, REINSTATED BY MIAMI 
Investigations by the Miami Dolphins and the NFL into allegations involving 
Mark Duper uncovered no wrongdoing, and the wide receiver has been reinstated 
and will report to camp next week, Coach Don Shula said. 
Duper was suspended last season for violating the league's substance abuse 
policy. Sources quoted in December by Sports Illustrated alleged that Duper had 
ties to a convicted drug dealer and has been a cocaine user since at least 
1986. 
"We haven't been able to substantiate or come up with anything from those 
allegations," Shula said Wednesday. The investigations by security officials 
from the team and the NFL have been concluded, Shula said. 
Duper plans to report next week for off-season workouts. Because of his 30-day 
suspension last Nov. 30, he will be subject to random drug testing.
