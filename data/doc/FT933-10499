FT  04 AUG 93 / Concern voiced on city economies
A SURVEY of participants in courses for potential civic leaders, run by the
charity Common Purpose, shows that economic issues dominate their concerns.
The charity, which brings together decision-makers from the public, private
and voluntary sectors, asked 500 participants what they believed were the
main problems facing their area of interest.
More than half - 51 per cent - said the economy and employment were the most
critical issues. Law and order was next highest.
