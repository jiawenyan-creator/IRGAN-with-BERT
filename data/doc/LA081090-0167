PERU GOV'T. URGES CALM AMID LOOTING, DEATHS 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's 2-week-old government appealed for calm 
today after a drastic austerity plan was met with shantytown lootings and 
protests in which security forces killed four people. 
Police opened fire on a mob of about 100 people looting a food warehouse in the 
northern city of Trujillo overnight, killing one man, police said. 
He was the latest victim of the backlash to the new austerity package. 
The austerity program, announced Wednesday night, included a 3,100% boost in 
gasoline prices, huge price increases in food staples and sweeping exchange and 
foreign trade reforms. 
Transport was paralyzed across the country for the second day in a row today as 
bus companies demanded the government boost fares to match the gasoline price 
rise. 
Most economists praised the plan as tough but necessary to rescue the state's 
bankrupt finances, but it sparked a rash of protests and lootings at shantytown 
food markets where security forces killed three people Thursday and injured 
four others. 
"Some adverse reactions . . . are absolutely normal, but we call . . . on the 
population to have patience and stay calm," Labor Minister Carlos Torres said 
in a radio interview. 
Lima appeared to be calm today. But crowds of people in at least three other 
cities swept through markets overnight stealing food, police and radio reports 
said. 
Supermarket owners posted armed guards at their doors, and most small 
shopkeepers closed for fear of looting or because they had no idea what to 
charge.
