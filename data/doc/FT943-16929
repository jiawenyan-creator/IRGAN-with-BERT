FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help boost Matthew Clark to
Pounds 10m
An aggressive programme of acquisitions helped Matthew Clark, the drinks
group, to increase annual pre-tax profits by 95 per cent, from Pounds 5.28m
to Pounds 10.3m.
Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive, said that integrating Grants of St James's
had yielded Pounds 8.5m of cost savings on an annualised basis, as promised
at the time of the Pounds 30m acquisition last October.
Of Pounds 10m provisions made to cover the purchase of Grants and
Freetraders, a drinks wholesale business, Pounds 4m had been spent in the
year to April 30. The remainder would be spent largely in the current year,
although the resulting cost savings would largely fall in the year after.
In the course of the year under review, the group raised Pounds 45m through
two rights issues, increasing its capital base from 9.8m shares to 22.7m.
The cost of acquisitions came to Pounds 51m.
Turnover tripled from Pounds 58m to Pounds 174m. The inclusion of
Freetraders for 10 months and Grants of St James's for six months added
Pounds 122m to turnover and Pounds 5.4m to operating profit.
Interest payable increased to Pounds 370,000 (Pounds 90,000) and after tax
of Pounds 3.32m (Pounds 1.74m) and minorities of Pounds 912,000 attributable
profit was Pounds 6.08m (Pounds 3.54m).
Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to 33.5p (29.3p). The final dividend
is raised by 7.5 per cent, in line with the company's forecast, to 10.75p
(10p), making a total of 18p (16.75p).
Net cash at the year end was Pounds 6m.
The shares rose 3p to 550p.
COMMENT
Assuming pre-tax profits of some Pounds 15.5m this year, headline profits
will have almost tripled in the space of two years. This indicates the pace
of change at Matthew Clark, and also the risks. The replacement of the old
family management by drinks industry professionals has had a galvanising
effect. There is no shortage of opportunities, particularly given the
structural upheavals still afflicting the brewing and pubs industries. But
the acquisitions being contemplated in principle are pretty varied, from
branded wine to cider manufacture. Shareholders will doubtless be called on
to assist the process further. Buying the shares is an act of faith in the
man-agement, but it might pay off.
