FT  10 JUN 92 / Ruling party expects easy win in Indonesian election
INDONESIA'S President Suharto (above left) watches people queueing to vote
yesterday in an election which his ruling Golkar party expects to be
returned to power with a substantial majority, William Keeling reports from
Jakarta.
Early reports suggested a high turnout of about 90 per cent, with
preliminary results expected later today. There has been little violence.
Gen Try Sutrisno, the chief of armed forces, warned on Monday of
'individuals and parties who want to turn back the clock' by preaching a
Marxist ideology. About 500,000 people died in a bloody backlash following a
failed communist coup d'etat in 1965.
Gen Sutrisno denied that there would be manipulation in counting the vote,
although government officials have conceded an element of fraud in past
elections.
In the last election in 1987, the Golkar party won 73 per cent of the vote.
Opposition parties were expected to make only marginal gains yesterday.
Despite the overwhelming support for Golkar, some voters in Jakarta
yesterday spoke of disillusion with the political process.
