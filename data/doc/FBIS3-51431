  [Text] Roseau, Dominica, 17 Jan, CANA -- Trade between 
Venezuela and some Caribbean Community (Caricom) states will get 
an additional boost, now that Venezuela has approved a mutual 
agreement for commercial fishing in the Caribbean, the 
Venezuelan Embassy says. 
  On December 16, the Venezuelan cabinet approved an 
"alternate 
proposal for commercial shipping to the Eastern Caribbean," a 
statement from the Embassy said. "The proposal aims to 
facilitate trade relations with this part of the Caribbean by 
augmenting the maritime transportation services existing at the 
moment." The agreement was approved December 27 and is in 
keeping with a trade and investment agreement between Caricom 
and Venezuela, which took effect one year ago. 
  Units of the Venezuelan Navy will be used on a commercial 
basis, and will serve initially, the Venezuela/Grenada/St. 
Lucia/Antigua route, the statement explains. These ports will be 
used as centres for the consolidation of freight, and it is 
hoped that other Eastern Caribbean countries will take advantage 
of what is regarded as a new opportunity for expanding 
export/import trade with Venezuela. 
  The move is also expected to strengthen intraregional 
shipping services.
