  [Text] Paris, April 22 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) and the French-based humanitarian aid group 
Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) launched a joint "urgent appeal" 
Friday [22 April] for a ceasefire in Gorazde to allow first aid 
and evacuation of the wounded. Medecins sans Frontieres 
(Doctors without Borders) said it asked French President 
Francois Mitterrand Thursday to intervene on the matter and 
Mitterrand expressed his full support for the initiative, a 
spokesman said. 
  "The situation has worsened tragically in Gorazde in the 
last 
few days," the group said in a statement. "Most of the wounded 
are dying from lack of care, the hospital is partially 
destroyed, water and electricity have been cut and food stocks 
have been shelled." Most of the 1,324 people wounded since the 
latest Serb offensive started against the Moslem enclave on 
March 29 are "civilians, women, children and old people," it 
said.
