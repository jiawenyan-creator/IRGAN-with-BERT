FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: R &amp; D 2 - Ballot Box
More scientists are joining the attack on the Conservatives' science policy.
Today, 17 members of British Scientists Abroad, who have already voted with
their feet by leaving the country, argue in a letter to The Times that
scientists leave Britain not because of the tax regime, but because 'higher
education and research as a whole has been systematically undervalued and
neglected in the past 13 years'. Many, they say, might be prepared to return
'if conditions were to improve'.
Last week, 20 leading researchers wrote a letter to the same paper
complaining at the way the 'progressive erosion of public support for
research' had demoralised the scientific community.
The latest letter warns that until a party is elected that understands
scientists' true motivation and is prepared to demonstrate a real commitment
to investment in science, their morale will not be restored, and they will
not be lured home. Unfortunately, however, the writers of this week's
letter, as those of last week's, seem unable to find any party that fits the
bill.
