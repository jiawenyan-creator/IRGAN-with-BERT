BRIEFLY 
Scott Paper Sells Northwest Land: Philadelphia-based Scott Paper Co. will sell 
194,000 acres of timberlands in western Washington to Crown Pacific Ltd. for 
about $230 million. Scott first announced plans to sell its Northwest 
timberlands in 1983, and the agreement with Crown, of Portland, Ore., 
represents all but about 16,000 acres of the land to be sold. Pulp and paper 
manufacturing at Scott's Everett, Wash., mill, which typically receives only a 
small amount of its wood fiber from the Northwest timberlands, will not be 
affected. The agreement calls for Crown to supply wood fiber to the mill from 
the purchased land. The sale, which is subject to approval by Scott's board, is 
expected to be completed this summer.
