FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a blanket ban on banks' double
charges
Sir, While I much appreciated your support for our cross-border credit
transfers initiative, a misunderstanding has crept into your editorial
('Paying the price', October 20).
You claim that 'there may be cases where customers are happy to split
charges' and suggest our proposed directive is 'too prescriptive' by banning
double-charging altogether.
Our proposal is that double-charging is banned only in those specific cases
where the customer has instructed the banks not to levy a charge on the
receiver.
Customers would remain entirely free to split the charges if they wished.
