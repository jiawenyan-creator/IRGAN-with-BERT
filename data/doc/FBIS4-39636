<F P=106> [Viktor Zamyatin report: "Russian-Brazilian Arms Trade. </F>
Russian Missiles To Emerge on Banks of Amazon"] 
  [Text] It was announced yesterday that Brazil will buy 
from Russia 110 "Igla" surface-to-air missiles (analogue of the 
"Stinger"). Russia has emerged on the Brazilian arms market for 
the first time. 
  Under the contract, the weapons will be delivered to Brazil 
by the end of this year. Brazilian authorities narrowed down 
their choice to the Russian missiles having become convinced 
that despite the low price tag (they are the cheapest in the 
world -- KOMMERSANT- DAILY), "Iglas" are not only a match for 
"Stingers" but are even superior to them in a number of 
parameters. The missile purchase is part of the $2 billion, 
four-year trade agreement signed in 1993. The cost of the 
missile contract has not been given. It is only known that $100 
million was earmarked to buy missiles from Russia for Brazil's 
army with some money remaining to effect some other payments. 
This means that the contract to buy "Iglas" would be followed 
by some others (Brazil, among other things, is showing interest 
in Russian helicopters). One cannot at this stage speak 
seriously about Russia's competing against the main suppliers of 
arms to the region -- the United States and France -- because 
the size of the deal concluded is too small. Incidentally, 
Brazil recently bought a batch of accoutrements in the United 
States. 
  Concurrently with the signing of the missile contract, 
Russia 
and Brazil also decided to exchange military attaches in their 
embassies. An agreement to this effect was signed by Georgiy 
Mamedov, Russian deputy foreign minister.
