FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Funeral plans
I HAVE specified in my will that I want an unattended cremation with no
religious service, no formalities such as mourners or flowers. Two local
funeral directors tell me this is 'possible,' but I so dread the thought of
burial that I should be grateful if you could confirm my will's validity.
What you wish to provide in respect of the disposal of your body (by
cremation and without ceremony) is lawful. If you make such provision in
your will and appoint an executor who is not likely to renounce probate (ie
will undertake the duty of administering your estate) the provision should
be effective.
