FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Fraud made easier by avarice
Sir, In your article 'Companies face new fraud threat from Nigeria'
(September 14), the impression given is that any business inquiry made by
any Nigerian company is to be avoided at all costs.
What your correspondents forgot to mention is the fact that any company
which willingly answers to the demands of tricksters is in fact looking for
a quick buck and will find trouble aplenty. It is a pity such companies have
to lose their money before they realise their folly.
What you should be asking is how many companies had answered such demands,
hoped for a wind-fall, lost some money, and are now licking their wounds.
Simply, avarice at its best.
