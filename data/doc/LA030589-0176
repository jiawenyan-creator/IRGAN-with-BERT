ANAHEIM HOME SHOW FOCUSES ON RESTORATION AND REMODELS 
The 14th Home Restoration &amp; Remodeling Show, opening Thursday at Anaheim 
Stadium, is expected to be the biggest gathering of its type on the West Coast. 
Delta Burke, a star of the "Designing Women" television series, will make a 
guest appearance from 4 to 8 p.m. Friday. She plays an interior designer on the 
show, but said she's interested in home improvement "because I'm a homeowner 
too." 
The show runs through next Sunday indoors at the stadium, under the principal 
sponsorship of Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan. The hours are 4 to 10 p.m. 
Thursday and Friday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday. 
Admission is $4.75 for adults, $2.50 for seniors and children under 12. 
Children under 12 accompanying their parents are admitted free. 
Exhibits will feature products ranging from carpeting, cabinets, roofing, 
plumbing fixtures, spas, tiles and appliances. Representatives from custom 
cabinetmaking firms, interior design concerns and furniture manufacturers will 
be on hand to answer questions.
