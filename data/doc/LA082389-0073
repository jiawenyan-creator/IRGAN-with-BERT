METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 10-YEAR CLEAN-AIR PLAN ANNOUNCED 
Mayor Tom Bradley said Tuesday that the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power will spend $1 billion over the next 10 years to reduce air pollution 
emissions from its 19 power plants. The mayor said the cost will increase the 
average homeowner's monthly electrical bill by 7% to 10%. DWP power plant 
emissions account for 2,329 tons, or 25% of the 9,340 tons of nitrogen oxide 
emissions from all power plants each year in the four-county South Coast Air 
Basin. 
The air pollution reduction program is required under rules adopted two weeks 
ago by the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Bradley said the city 
supports a compromise between the AQMD and Southern California Edison that gave 
utilities until 1999 to be in full compliance with the rules on nitrogen oxide, 
one of the two principal ingredients of photochemical smog. Originally, the 
AQMD staff had recommended a 1992 deadline.
