FT  19 FEB 93 / Ulcer drug helps Glaxo advance 16% to Pounds 819m
GLAXO, Europe's biggest pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up 16 per cent from Pounds 709m to Pounds 819m for the six months to
December 31. The result was achieved on turnover up 16 per cent from Pounds
1.97bn to Pounds 2.29bn.
The main driving force behind the higher than expected profits increase was
the strong growth of the ulcer treatment Zantac, the world's best-selling
drug.
Glaxo attempted to clarify its ambitions in the over-the-counter (OTC)
non-prescription drug market. Dr Ernest Mario, chief executive, said he
apologised if the market had been confused about the company's strategy.
There have been rumours, following the appointment of Mr Arthur Pappas last
month, that Glaxo might be preparing a rights issue to acquire
Warner-Lambert in the US which has a large OTC business.
Dr Mario said the company had a number of products, such as Zantac, that
might be switched to the OTC market. Mr Pappas had been appointed to help
develop the group's capacity to conduct such switches. However, that did not
mean Glaxo would buy OTC products or other companies just to increase
turnover in OTC. This statement calmed the City's fears and Glaxo's shares
lifted 22p to 684p.
Glaxo had limited price increases to below the rate of inflation, Dr Mario
said. Group sales, excluding exchange rates, rose 13 per cent. Only 1 per
cent came from price increases, with 12 per cent from volume growth. Because
the group does not manufacture drugs in Puerto Rico, Dr Mario said it was
less exposed than other drug companies to any moves by the Clinton
administration to curb the island's tax haven status. He said Glaxo had new
products capable of driving volume growth. Sales of new products, including
Imigran, the migraine treatment, and Serevent, an asthma drug, rose Pounds
92m, while established drugs improved by Pounds 83m.
