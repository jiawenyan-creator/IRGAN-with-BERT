FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney names new chief
financial officer
EURO DISNEY, the troubled leisure group which earlier this week announced
heavy interim losses and plans to raise new capital, has appointed Mr
Michael Montgomery, an executive with Walt Disney, its parent company, as
chief financial officer.
Mr Montgomery's appointment is the latest in a series of senior management
changes at Euro Disney in the year since the opening of its EuroDisneyland
theme park outside Paris.
He succeeds Mr John Forsgren, who becomes vice-chairman. Euro Disney said
the change was 'purely routine' and stressed that Mr Forsgren was being
promoted to his new role, where he will be responsible for the group's
relations with the financial and political communities.
However, Mr Montgomery, formerly treasurer of Walt Disney, which owns 49 per
cent of Euro Disney, will take responsibility for financial operations.
Both he and Mr Forsgren will report to Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who last
year took over as Euro Disney's chairman.
