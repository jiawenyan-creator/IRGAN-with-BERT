FT  09 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat
It was a pity Queens Moat's poor presentation of two relatively minor
matters distracted attention yesterday from a fine performance last year. In
marking its shares down by 5 per cent, the market concentrated on a
surprisingly fully-priced but small UK acquisition and a confusing stance on
depreciation policy. But as Forte's forthcoming results will doubtless
confirm, Queens Moat managed a significantly better trading result than its
peers.
The reasons for the mere 4 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits were
evident at the interim stage last August. The continental European hotels,
particularly in Germany, grew fast enough to offset most of the effects of
recession in the UK. Granted, the UK business was hard enough hit for the
group's self-employed managers to negotiate a 6 per cent fall in their
annual contributions. But on the other hand, that should allow UK profits to
recover more strongly when the market eventually improves, although more
than half of future revenues will be generated in Europe. On a forward
multiple of just 10, the shares look better value than Forte. But given the
sector's abiding lack of fashion among investors, that scarcely amounts to a
ringing endorsement.
