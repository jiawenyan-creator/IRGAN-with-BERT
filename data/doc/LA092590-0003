METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWYER ACCUSED OF BILKING CLIENTS RESIGNS 
FROM BAR 
An Inglewood attorney accused of bilking clients of at least $15,000 has 
resigned from the California State Bar after being hit with two separate 
misconduct cases involving a 22 complaints. 
Derl G. Brown's resignation as an attorney was accepted last month by the state 
Supreme Court "without prejudice," said bar spokeswoman Susan Scott. 
Brown may seek reinstatement to the bar in five years. 
Brown neither admitted nor denied the allegations against him, but his 
resignation closes the case as far as the State Bar is concerned. 
Brown did not return messages left on his answering machine. 
Scott said the two cases were filed with the state bar against Brown on Nov. 
15, 1989, and on March 12, 1990. The bar also filed counts against Brown for 
his failure to cooperate with the probe. 
Most of the complaints against Brown were filed by clients who said he accepted 
fees ranging from $250 to $3,600 but failed to perform any services.
