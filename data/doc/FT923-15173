FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Porz plant gives KHD new lease
of life - Andrew Fisher on prospects for the German diesel engine maker
FOR Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, the German maker of diesel engines, industrial
plant and farm equipment, the late 1980s were a corporate nightmare.
A disastrous move into the US agricultural sector led to heavy losses and
the company was forced to slash jobs and capacity. Those grim days are
thankfully over. KHD, whose origins go back to the first days of the diesel
engine, is now engaged on what Mr Werner Kirchgasser, the chief executive,
calls a process of 'strengthening from within'.
But there is still some way to go. Yesterday, he said at the annual meeting
that KHD would again make a loss in the first half of this year, though this
was because most business was done in the second half. He expected another
profit for the full year. Encouragingly, he said the new order inflow was 7
per cent higher in the first five months at DM1.6bn (Dollars 1bn), with a 22
per cent jump in industrial plant business.
Although the 'strengthening' process has succeeded to the extent of keeping
KHD in the black and stabilising turnover, Mr Kirchgasser admits: 'When
you're making a turnover of around DM4bn, a profit of DM10m (the net figure
in 1991) is insignificant'. In other words, KHD is still not far ahead of
break-even.
Nor is there much immediate prospect of a sharp upturn. Earnings will remain
low for the next few years, one reason being the slack world economy. As Mr
Kirchgasser told shareholders: 'No major improvements can be expected from
the economy in 1992. The phase of economic weakness in western industrial
countries is likely to be overcome only slowly.'
Last year, operating profits fell by 78 per cent to DM18m, though this was a
far cry from the DM402m loss of 1987. Mr Kirchgasser says the 1991 operating
result was depressed by DM100m because of weaker markets in its business for
standard engineering products. It had to resort to further capacity and
overhead cuts to offset some of this damage.
From 1995, however, Mr Kirchgasser expects KHD's fortunes to take a distinct
turn for the better. He has already forecast a renewed dividend for 1996 -
10 years after the last distribution - when operating profits should exceed
DM100m.
The reason for this optimism lies not just in the Herculean restructuring
efforts under Mr Karl-Joseph Neukirchen, who arrived in 1987 from SKF, the
ball-bearing concern, to overhaul KHD and return it to profit. It stems also
from another move by Mr Neukirchen, mow head of the Hoesch engineering
company which has been acquired by Krupp. That was the decision to build the
world's most modern diesel engine plant at a cost of DM600m in the Porz
district of Cologne.
Using all the latest manufacturing methods, KHD aims to increase
considerably its production of advanced fuel-saving, low-noise, and
environmentally-friendly diesels and attack new market segments. 'The
success of this investment will determine our future,' Mr Kirchgasser says.
'If it doesn't work, our forecasts will be out.' He is confident, however,
that the new Porz facility will give KHD a new lease of life. Roughly half
its turnover comes from diesels, though this division is currently in the
red as a result of the heavy spending at Porz.
KHD has developed several new engines for the plant, which will be operated
by its Deutz Motor unit and start production next January with an eventual
capacity of 150,000 engines a year. It aims to reduce delivery times to
three weeks from the present three months. Productivity will be much higher
than at its existing plant in Cologne-Deutz, which produces the same number
of engines with 1,800 people; Porz will have 600.
KHD's other diesel unit is Deutz MWM, based in Mannheim. While Deutz Motor's
products are designed for general industrial use and to be installed in
trucks, buses, and other vehicles (not cars), the larger engines of MWM are
used mainly for ships and energy production. The company's aim is to produce
around 200,000 engines a year from the mid-1990s compared with 150,000 at
present. Of these, more than half will be for industrial use, including the
construction industry. KHD also wants to raise the number of vehicle engines
from the present 10,000 to around 50,000.
Mr Kirchgasser does not expect much favourable news from the European farm
sector. It is in the engine division that the key to a more prosperous
future for KHD lies, and the new plant at Porz will be of crucial importance
in achieving that.
