POP MUSIC REVIEW; 
COUNTRY-FOLK-ROCK SINGER CARPENTER: DON'T CALL HER KAREN; 
FRESH FROM AN ENGAGEMENT AT THE ROXY, SHE BRINGS HER INTIMATE, MELANCHOLY STYLE 
TO THE BANDSTAND IN ANAHEIM ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
Early in her show at the Roxy on Thursday night, Mary-Chapin Carpenter told an 
odd little story about being chased down a backstage hallway recently by a 
confused woman inquiring "Karen? Karen?" 
This D.C.-bred country-folk-rock singer, who is doing a free show at the 
Bandstand in Anaheim on Sunday night, is more likely to be confused with 
Rosanne Cash, for whom she's sometimes a ringer, than with Karen Carpenter. 
Her "Shooting Straight in the Dark" LP isn't quite as nakedly confessional as 
Cash's current "Interiors," but it's not much less vulnerable. 
To be thirtysomething and single-something is to recognize too many intimate 
details in her often melancholic, always strong writing. 
Like Cash, again, Carpenter is destined to be remembered more for her 
songwriting than her performing, which is naturally limited by the downbeat 
nature of much of the material -- though, toward the set's end at the Roxy, she 
put her acoustic guitar down and let the rather polite backup band carry her 
through such stomps as NRBQ's sprightly rocker "If I Don't Have You" and her 
own two-stepper "How Do." 
Carpenter rarely comes off as a doormat in her pointed songs about losing in 
love. At times, however, you might wish she could work up a little more bile. 
In one unrecorded song, she did just that: "Opening Act" was a hilarious 
diatribe directed at a country headliner, unnamed except for a two-syllable 
profanity. 
"I'm not goin' bald, so I don't wear a hat," she sang in her own defense. "I 
don't wear tight jeans; I'm a little too fat." 
Nope, this isn't Karen.
