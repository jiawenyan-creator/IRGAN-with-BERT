FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ifil advances to L192.8bn
IFIL, the listed holding company controlled by Italy's Agnelli family,
raised net group profits by 18.6 per cent to L192.8bn (Dollars 130m) last
year from L162.5bn in 1991, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
Ifil said it spent about L230bn to take its stake in Saint Louis, the French
industrial holding company controlled by the Worms group, to 15.6 per cent
from 6.5 per cent. Ifil said its aim, in agreement with Worms, was to
increase its stake to a similar level to the 31.8 per cent held by Worms.
Net earnings for the parent company climbed by 13.6 per cent to L119.8bn,
prompting a L10 a share dividend rise to L140 for ordinary shares and to
L160 for savings stock. The value of Ifil's holdings, centred on the Fiat
cars group, Saint Louis, the BSN foods group and Accor, the French hotels
chain, rose to L2,025bn last year from L1,805bn at the end of 1991. The
holdings showed a capital gain of over L900bn.
