  [Text] Economics Minister Shim'on Shetrit says now that 
Israel has agreed to the Palestinian demand for international 
observers in Hebron, the Jewish settlers in the town must not be 
evacuated. In an interview with reporter Dick Winter, he called 
the agreement a victory for the Palestinians: 
  [Begin Shetrit recording] I hope that the fact that there 
are international observers, that all those who suggest moving 
out the Jewish residents in Hebron would stop talking about it, 
because you cannot at the same time say that in order to secure 
the security of the Palestinians you need international 
observers and at the same time to say get out all the Jews; 
either way. If they have accepted international observers, you 
assume that they are going to do this service of what is termed 
as protection of the Palestinians, so if was the requirement, we 
cannot agree both to this and to other measures. This is 
enough. [end recording]
