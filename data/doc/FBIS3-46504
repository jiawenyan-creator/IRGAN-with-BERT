  [Text] An Australian-based spokesman for rebels on the 
Papua New Guinea [PNG] island of Bougainville says government 
forces are maintaining their positions after an earlier advance 
towards the copper mine at Panguna. But, the spokesman, (Moses 
Havini), says Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] forces are 
monitoring the situation closely and remain on a (?first) state 
of alert. The PNG government says its troops are now about five 
kilometers to the southwest of the mine and will assess the 
situation before moving into the mining area itself. Reports 
that hundreds of civilians from the Panguna area are moving into 
government care centers are said to have been denied by the 
rebels. The government said it wants to regain control of the 
Australian-owned mine by the end of the year.
