FT  12 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: British Land
Mr John Ritblat may not have called the turn before in so many words. But
the Pounds 900m he has splashed out on properties since 1989 is an
indication that the British Land chairman had been expecting at least a
modest market recovery by now. Whether or not he was right yesterday to
predict that the worst is over, the important thing for shareholders is that
the company is well positioned to wait.
For one thing the profit and loss account looks in reasonable order, with
interest covered 1.3 times by net rents. There is, moreover, a Pounds 75m
unrealised surplus on trading properties to keep profits moving ahead in the
event of any tenant mishaps. The balance sheet, admittedly, is looking
stretched by the company's past standards with a gearing ratio of around 130
per cent if the convertible capital bonds are treated as borrowing. It is a
bit rich to exclude these for the purposes of calculating the ratio, then
point out that each 1 per cent increase in gross assets translates into a
2.6 per cent rise in net assets. That said, while British Land will not want
to push gearing higher than 150 per cent, it has ample facilities in place
and can always raise cash from disposals.
The question is how much further the net asset value has to fall. Its
overall 8.1 per cent running portfolio yield may be a full point lower than
Land Securities' and Great Portland's, but some would argue that this can be
explained by over-renting. British Land, moreover, looks to have written
down its City properties pretty savagely since 1989 by comparison with its
peers. At 215p the shares are not expensive, even assuming another modest
hit this year.
