FT  22 JUN 92 / Destabilising effects of exchange rate stabilisation
TWO per cent inflation, says Mr Norman Lamont, is the right destination for
the UK economy. But the chancellor has also reaffirmed the government's
determination to take sterling into the ERM's narrow bands at a central rate
of DM2.95 'in due course'. Given this commitment, Mr Lamont's talk of an
independent target for inflation is largely otiose. Inflation and economic
performance will have to be what exchange rate stabilisation permits.
The priority accorded to the exchange rate is no longer new. By 1985 Mr
Nigel Lawson - inventor-in-chief of Conservative monetary doctrines - had
already abandoned his attachment to domestic broad monetarism and embraced
exchange rate targetry. He proposed joining the ERM at a rate of about
DM3.75 in the autumn of that year. Denied by Mrs Thatcher, he allowed
sterling to fall, with the price of oil, to a low of DM2.75 in early 1987.
Throughout the subsequent five and a half years, stabilisation of the
exchange rate has been the chief immediate target of monetary policy, at
first informally and then, after October 1990, through ERM membership. The
policy has been reasonably successful in its own terms: sterling fluctuated
between DM2.70 and DM3.30 prior to ERM entry, since when it has remained
close to its central rate.
Has the exchange-rate-oriented monetary policy also succeeded in either
stabilising the domestic economy or lowering inflationary expectations?
Unfortunately the answer to both parts of the question is 'no'.
The behaviour of nominal gross domestic product is the obvious test for
macroeconomic policies, since their direct effect is always on nominal, not
real, variables. But nominal domestic demand (GDP, plus imports, minus
exports) is a still better test, since macroeconomic policy influences
output via demand.
The most stable period for British macroeconomic performance under the
Conservatives was between the second half of 1982 and the first half of
1987. During that period the year-on-year increase in nominal domestic
demand varied between a low of about 7 1/2 per cent and a high of about 10
1/2 per cent. Between 1987 and 1992, by contrast, the year-on-year growth of
nominal domestic demand has varied between a peak of about 14 per cent and a
low of less than 2 per cent.
The years in which exchange rate stabilisation has been the predominant
target for monetary policy have, therefore, seen far more macroeconomic
instability than those that followed the fierce, but largely necessary,
disinflation of 1979-82.
How successful has exchange rate stabilisation been in lowering inflation?
The best measure of inflation for this purpose is not short-term
performance, influenced as it is by transient events, but rather
expectations, as measured in long-term rates of interest.
Much weight is currently being placed on the reduction in the gap between
yields on British gilts and those on German Bunds, to about 1 percentage
point. But this reflects higher German yields more than lower British ones.
For the UK, changes in inflationary expectations can best be measured by
changes in the gap between the yields on index-linked bonds and those on
conventional gilts. At around 4 1/2 per cent, this gap is only a little
smaller now than in 1987.
Naturally, economists can explain away the poor performance of exchange rate
targetry. They can blame it on the failure to enter the ERM earlier; they
can point to the costs that would have had to be borne, in any case, to
lower the still excessive inflation rates of the mid-1980s; and they can
stress the glorious future of low inflation and stable growth that lies
before the UK economy.
Yet it remains undeniable that the macroeconomic instability of the past
five years has been considerable, while inflation is still not decisively
lower than in the mid-1980s. The view that fixing sterling to the D-Mark at
DM2.95 guarantees steady economic growth and price stability remains a hope,
not a fact.
