SIDELINES; 
TOP TRACK STARS OF '80S NAMED 
Ireland's Eamonn Coghlan, the world mile record-holder, and Mary Slaney, owner 
of six world or American marks, today were named the men's and women's Indoor 
Track and Field Athletes of the 1980s. 
The two middle-distance stars placed first in a poll in which athletes were 
nominated by 11 meet directors of the Mobil Indoor Grand Prix circuit and then 
voted on by media representatives in the meet directors' cities. 
Coghlan led the men's voting with 77 points, far ahead of sprinter-long jumper 
Carl Lewis, the runner-up with 48 points. Pole vaulter Sergei Bubka of the 
Soviet Union finished third with 45 points. 
In the women's voting, Slaney received 67 points to 55 for the second-place 
finisher, long jumper-hurdler Jackie Joyner-Kersee. Quarter miler Diane Dixon 
was third with 52 points.
