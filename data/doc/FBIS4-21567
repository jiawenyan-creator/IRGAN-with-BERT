  [Text] The Foreign Ministry spokesman this morning denied 
the report on IDF Radio and in HA'ARETZ according to which 
Israel and North Korea are conducting secret contacts. The 
Foreign Ministry says that the contacts between the two 
countries were stopped in the wake of a decision by the prime 
minister and foreign minister. Our political correspondent Udi 
Segal reports, however, that political sources in Jerusalem 
confirmed the report that contacts were held between the two 
countries in a bid to prevent North Korea from supplying Iran 
with long-range Nodong missiles.
