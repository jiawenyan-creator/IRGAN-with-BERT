  [Text] Havana municipal labor directorates have implemented 
several regulations, approved by the provincial administrative 
council, to better control self-employment. The following 
measures have been implemented since May: 

  -  Rent is being 
collected for the use of public areas; 
  -  Monthly fees have been 
increased in 30 categories; 
  -  State entities are authorized to 
utilize this personal [as heard]; 
  -  The production of plastic 
items has been banned. 

  Provincial authorities have determined the amount of rent to 
be collected, which will go directly to the provincial budget, 
according to location. 
  The ban on manufacturing plastic items stems from the 
effects 
that this is having on the national economy due to the misuse of 
that resource.
