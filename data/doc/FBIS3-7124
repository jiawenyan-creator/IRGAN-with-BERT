  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed says the 
industrialized countries should not obstruct any effort to 
impose a total ban on the dumping of industrial waste in Third 
World countries, particularly Asia. The prime minister said 
that those countries should in fact take steps to end the export 
of industrial waste to developing countries. He felt that 
industrial waste should not be exported to developing countries 
because [words indistinct]. 
  He told reporters this after visiting the Kuala Lumpur Tower 
project at Bukit Nanas in Kuala Lumpur. Dr. Mahathir was asked 
to comment on the claim by Green Peace, an environmental 
protection group, that seven industrialized countries oppose the 
efforts to impose a total ban on the export of industrial waste 
to Third World countries. The countries are Australia, Britain, 
Canada, Germany, Holland, Japan, and the United States. When he 
was asked to comment on the protests by international 
organizations against Malaysia's ban on the Oscar-winning movie 
Schindler's List, he said the people outside the country should 
not object to the decision because it was Malaysia's right to 
ban any film in the country. On a Jewish organization's claim 
that the film was banned because he was anti-Semitic, Dr. 
Mahathir said he was not anti-Semitic but he was anti- Zionist 
expansionism and the conquest of Arab territory by the (?Jews).
