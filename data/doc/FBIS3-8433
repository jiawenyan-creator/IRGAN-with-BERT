  [Excerpts] Istvan Kulcsar reports on the foreign affairs 
spokesman's regular press briefing today. 
  [Kulcsar] [Passage omitted] At the news conference Foreign 
Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman took several questions regarding 
the foreign ministers' meeting of the Central European 
Initiative in Trieste last weekend. He replied: 
  [Begin Herman recording] At the foreign ministers' 
consultation, it could be detected that certain countries were 
backing out from handling the national minority issue. A 
proposal had been made earlier -- and every country of the 
organization agreed with this proposal in the initial stages -- 
to work out a document about the protection of national minority 
rights. The original idea was to ratify the document at a 
special foreign ministerial conference to be convened in 
Hungary. The attitude of Slovakia and the Czech Republic is 
currently less favorable than that of the former Czechoslovakia 
had been. 
  Nevertheless, preparations of the document on the protection 
of national minority rights are continuing. The national 
coordinators will meet again in the near future, and we hope 
that this new consultation will produce progress in the 
formulation of the document. [end recording]
