COURT RULING ON HOLIDAY DISPLAYS 
So the Supreme Court is confused about how to apply the First Amendment 
provision about religion to the display of creches, saying that it is all right 
in one situation but not in another. That the Supreme Court can't make up its 
mind whether or not it is all right to display a creche is odd because the 
First Amendment is straightforward and to the point about religion. 
Paraphrased, it says, "Don't establish an official religion and do let people 
practice religion freely." 
All that is necessary in judging a situation is to turn those two ideas into 
the questions: "Does it establish an official religion?" and "Does it interfere 
with the practice of religion?" Any time the answer to both is "no," the 
situation is acceptable. There is a simple solution. 
Invite each of the major religions -- Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, 
Hinduism, Shintoism, Zoroastrianism and American Indian -- to pick a major 
holiday season from its religious calendar and, during that season, to have a 
display in public places and to present programs in school. In that way, 
religion is freely exercised; no official religion is established; everybody 
has a chance to learn something about everybody else. This is called "being 
ecumenical."
