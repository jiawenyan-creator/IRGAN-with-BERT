FT  10 MAR 93 / Top civil servants should be accountable, MPs told
TOP civil servants should be put on five-year contracts and be accountable
for their performance in policy-making, according to Mr Graham Mather,
president of the European Policy Forum, the free-market think tank.
Mr Mather says in a submission to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service
committee that senior mandarins cannot escape blame for 'systematic policy
failure under governments of different colours'.
He says these failures have included stop-go economic policies,
underperforming state education and the recent fiasco over the pit closures.
According to Mr Mather sterling's departure from the exchange rate
mechanism, the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the
events surrounding the supply of arms to Iraq revealed by the
Matrix-Churchill trial have all raised issues about the conduct of civil
servants and the responsibilities of ministers. He says that if Whitehall's
560 top policy-making civil servants were on five-year contracts, paid at
market rates, it would be easier to hold them to account.
The recommendation would apply to permanent secretaries, deputy secretaries
and under secretaries, all of whom are responsible for policy-making.
Mr Mather says that if the initiative was combined with a requirement to
advertise the posts, it would also make a period of working in the Civil
Service more attractive to successful executives from the private sector.
