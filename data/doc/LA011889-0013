BAKKER PLEADS INNOCENT TO CHARGES HE MISUSED MILLIONS IN PTL FUNDS 
Evangelist Jim Bakker pleaded not guilty Tuesday to federal charges that he 
diverted millions of dollars from his PTL television audience for personal use. 
Bakker's lawyer, George T. Davis, asked U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor during the 
hearing for a gag order for all parties involved, based largely on comments by 
the retired federal bankruptcy judge who supervised the sale of PTL assets. 
In seeking the gag order, Davis presented Taylor with a copy of a recent 
newspaper article in which retired U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds called 
Bakker a "sawed-off little runt." 
Taylor said he would consider the request, instructing attorneys to draft a 
consent order and present it to him by Thursday for approval. The magistrate 
told Davis he was concerned that Bakker would go on television and talk about 
the case, but he issued no formal request for Bakker to keep quiet. 
Bakker was silent during the hearing, but made a statement afterward. 
"I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment," Bakker said. 
"The judge asked for no conversations about this case, but I'd like to say that 
Tammy and I are thrilled to be back on TV." 
The Bakkers began broadcasting "The Jim and Tammy Show" from their leased home 
near Charlotte earlier this month. Bakker did not appear on the telecast 
Tuesday. 
Bakker quit the PTL ministry in March, 1987, after admitting a sexual encounter 
with former secretary Jessica Hahn and paying her money to keep quiet. The 
ministry he founded sought reorganization in bankruptcy court a few months 
later. Last month, a Canadian businessman bought the ministry's assets at a 
bankruptcy auction. 
Taylor tentatively scheduled the trial for the court's February term but set no 
specific date. He also gave the attorneys 15 days to file other motions.
