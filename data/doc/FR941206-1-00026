 Limitations with respect to use of Mechanically Separated (Kind). 


(a) A poultry product required to be prepared from a particular kind of poultry (e.g., chicken) shall not contain ``Mechanically
Separated (Kind)'' described in 381.173, that is made from any other kind of poultry (e.g., Mechanically Separated
Turkey). 
(b) Mechanically Separated Chicken described in 381.173, that is made, in whole or in part, from fowl as defined
in 
381.170(a)(l)(vi), shall not be used in baby, junior, or toddler foods. 
(c) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' described in 381.173 shall not be used in poultry products that are
composed of whole or intact poultry muscle and expected to be as such by consumers (e.g., chicken steaks, chicken fillets,
and cured turkey thighs), except that it may be used for binding purposes (i.e., to hold poultry muscle together) at
a level that is sufficient for that purpose. 
(d) ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' or ``Mechanically Separated (Kind) Meat'' described in 381.173 shall
not be used in the formulation of a poultry product or meat food product, unless such use conforms with any applicable
requirements of the definitions and standards of identity or composition in this subchapter or part 319 of this chapter.

(e) Other than ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' made from fowl, Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' may be used in
any product defined by regulatory standards of identity and composition, except those products identified in paragraph
(c) of this section, whereby ``Kind'' or ``Kind Meat'' is being used, provided that it is identified as ``Mechanically
Separated (Kind).''
