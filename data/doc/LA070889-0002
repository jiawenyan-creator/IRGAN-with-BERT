ELVERA K. LACK; LANDOWNER'S DAUGHTER 
Elvera Keating Lack, the last of eight children of Andrew J. W. Keating, who at 
one time owned 64,000 acres between West Los Angeles and Santa Monica, died 
Sunday in Brentwood where she had lived much of her life. 
She was 102. 
Mrs. Lack -- who was married first to John A. Forthmann, son of the founder of 
the Los Angeles Silk Co., and later to George M. Lack, a Brawley real estate 
developer -- inherited with her mother, brothers and sisters the acreage on 
which Culver City sits today. 
After Keating's death in a shipwreck in 1901 the land -- situated roughly 
between La Brea Avenue, La Cienega Boulevard, Pico Boulevard and southwest to 
today's Marina del Rey -- was tied up in court for several years until the 
youngest child turned 21. (Two of Keating's sons died in the shipwreck with 
him.) 
The family gradually sold it between 1911 and 1920. 
Perhaps the most significant parcel was 93 acres of barley fields purchased by 
Harry Culver for a $2,000 option. Culver City was later incorporated in 1917. 
Keating was British by birth and a Chilean nitrate magnate by profession when 
he purchased in 1892 what came to be known as Rancho Bonita Meadows. The 
Keating family used it originally as a winter home.
