FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: British Biotech new cancer drug - Third
promising treatment makes company one of best in sector
The first clinical trials of a new cancer treatment from British Biotech,
revealed yesterday, showed that the drug has no significant side effects and
triggers a potentially useful reaction in volunteers.
The drug, code-named BB-10010, is the third of British Biotech's cancer
drugs to show promise in trials.
The success so far of the others, led by Batimastat, has made the company
one of the best share-price performers this year in the UK and US
biotechnology sectors.
Yesterday, the shares rose 18p to 598p, giving a market value of almost
Pounds 300m, making it the tenth biggest in the UK and US sectors combined.
BB-10010 was tested on 36 healthy volunteers. As well as demonstrating its
safety, tests on the volunteers showed that the number of white blood cells
in the blood increased, as predicted in animal trials.
Quantitative measurements of this effect will be made at the next stage of
trials.
The drug has two potential uses: to protect the bone marrow from damage
during chemotherapy and to mobilise white blood cells so that they can be
'harvested' from the blood before chemotherapy and reinjected afterwards.
Currently, patients have bone marrow itself removed before chemotherapy and
replaced afterwards, an awkward and painful treatment.
Tepnel Life Sciences, the biotechnology company, has signed a marketing deal
for its Daras technology, a product for screening DNA patterns in infectious
diseases. Peers, the New York-based subsidiary of the Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan, will seek suitable licensing or joint venture partners for Tepnel
in Japan.
