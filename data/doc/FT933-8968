FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hoogovens cost-cutting takes
effect
FIRST-HALF losses at Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, fell
sharply compared with the last six months of 1992, as cost-cutting measures
started to take effect in the steel sector.
The improvement came despite continued difficulties in aluminium, where
Hoogovens is being hit by cheap imports from the former Soviet Union.
Losses including extraordinary items were Fl 189m (Dollars 97m), up from Fl
49m a year earlier but down from Fl 546m in the 1992 second half. The
company had previously predicted that the net loss excluding extraordinary
items would be unchanged from the last six months of 1992.
Extraordinary charges were Fl 25m compared with Fl 363m in the 1992 second
half. Turnover was down 9.5 per cent at Fl 3.5bn.
In its first forecast for the second half, Hoogovens said losses on normal
business operations would fall even though aluminium was unlikely to
improve.
The news sent the company's shares - which have surged recently along with
other cyclical Dutch shares - up Fl 4.80 to close more than 10 per cent
higher at Fl 51.30.
Losses in steel, before tax or extraordinaries, were more than halved to Fl
70m from Fl 158m in the 1992 second half but were down only slightly from Fl
76m in the 1992 first half.
Mr Maarten van Veen, chairman, said Hoogovens was one of the few leading
European steel groups to have raised steel output. But the product mix had
also shifted in favour of lower-margin semi-finished steel.
The company said yesterday that it planned to raise prices for finished
steel in October and January, on top of increases in April and July.
Nevertheless, prices remained well below their 1991 peak.
