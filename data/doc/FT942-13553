FT  25 APR 94 / Bid to cool fury over Schneider
Deutsche Bank main board directors will today attempt to calm the storm over
the bank's involvement in the DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) bankruptcy of the Jurgen
Schneider property group.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chairman, will lead a press conference flanked
by senior managers most closely involved in the granting of loans to the
fugitive Mr Schneider.
Mr Georg Krupp is supervisory board chairman at Deutsche's main property
lending arm, Deutsche Centralbodenkredit, based in Cologne. Mr Ulrich Weiss
is the director responsible for a Mannheim division which is understood
recently to have granted Mr Schneider an interim credit.
Deutsche Bank is owed a total of DM1.2bn, according to Mr Kopper. Most is
secured against valuable, although uncompleted, developments in west
Germany.
Mr Kopper last week warned of 'consequences' at board level if an
independent internal inquiry proved 'mistakes' had occurred. He later added
in a television interview that 'a system error' must have been made. As a
mortgage provider, Centralbodenkredit had even stricter lending guidelines
than the parent.
He did not know why the amount of lettable space in the property in question
had not been checked. The sums were certainly big enough to justify a visit.
Mr Kopper also claimed that Deutsche was a victim. Its pride in its status
as a 'star pupil' had been hurt by its being found not doing its homework
properly.
Deutsche was also a victim in the recent near-collapse of the
Metallgesellschaft group, which was saved only after Deutsche and Dresdner
Bank led a financial consortium which agreed to fund a DM3.4bn rescue
package.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche director who chaired the Metallgesellschaft
supervisory board, and helped arrange the rescue, also came under
considerable external criticism at the time.
