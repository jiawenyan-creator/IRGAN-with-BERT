Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Agriculture proposes to revise the National Forest System rangeland management regulations to
update direction for management of domestic livestock, to place grater emphasis on stewardship of the rangeland
resource, to clarify the link between the livestock grazing permit and forest plans, and to clarify the range management
planning and decisionmaking process. In addition, the Department proposes to improve administration of livestock
grazing permits, and to achieve greater consistency between the grazing management regulations of the Forest Service
and the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Department of the Interior. The intended effect of this proposed rule is to
provide for healthy, diverse, sustainable rangeland ecosystems on National Forest System lands.



By separate rule published elsewhere in this separate part of the 

Federal Register

, the Forest Service is proposing a revised system for determining livestock grazing fees on National Forest System
lands and other lands under Forest Service control.
