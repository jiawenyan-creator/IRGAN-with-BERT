A glum start to the week for parents unless they are lucky or foolish enough
to have blind confidence in their little darlings. In Watchdog about
children and smoking (BBC 1, 7.30), we learn that one in five children aged
15 is a regular smoker. World in Action (ITV, 8.30) investigates children's
sex lives and the high level of teenage pregnancies. If only our society
would redefine its concept of childhood by copying the Romans for whom it
ended at 14, matters would seem less dismal.
Among the ingredients of racial prejudice is the belief that blacks have
genes to make them sports champions. In Will to Win; Myth and Reality (BBC
2, 7.40), academics cast doubt on the idea and point instead to the social
factors that take blacks to the top in some sports but not in others.
The Late Show (BBC 2, 11.15) has always been uneven. Last week it served up
an account of an architectural competition that was boring and pretentious.
Playwright David Hare ought to be good material but much depends on whether
the programme's silly-pretentious tendency has been kept in check.
