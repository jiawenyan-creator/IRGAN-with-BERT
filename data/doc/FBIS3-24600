  [Abstract] Russian public health clinics are not equipped 
with domestic kits for determining thyrotropin (TT) even though 
there is a critical need for them in the diagnosis and treatment 
of thyroid gland diseases. The goal of this research was to 
develop a sensitive immunoenzyme test system, based on 
high-affinity monoclonal antibodies (monoAB), for quantitative 
determination of human thyrotropin. One monoAB was immobilized 
on polystyrene microtitration plates; another was conjugated 
with horse radish peroxidase (HRP). The analysis was 
technologically effective, it was conducted in one step, and it 
took 2.5 hours to complete. The detection limit of TT was 0.1 
IU/ml. A highly sensitive three-step test system, utilizing 
a 
streptavidin-biotin complex, was proposed that made it possible 
to detect 0.01 IU/ml TT. Figures 4; references 14: 2
