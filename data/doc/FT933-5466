FT  03 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Bubbly
inspires easy explanation
SCIENTISTS can make laymen understand 'unexplainable' physics theories, Mr
William Waldegrave, the classically educated minister for science, proved
yesterday. What helped convince him was an analogy based on Lady Thatcher.
Last April Mr Waldegrave offered a bottle of champagne for the best
explanation of the significance of the Higgs boson in lay terms on a single
side of paper.
The Higgs boson is an elementary particle, which plays a key role in
theories about the structure of matter and the origins of the universe.
Physicists want to spend billions of pounds to prove its existence by
building a new generation of atom smashers.
Yesterday, at the British Association meeting at Keele, Mr Waldegrave
awarded bottles of champagne to five winners - all professional physicists -
from 117 entrants.
The most imaginative winner was Mr David Miller of University College,
Lon-don, who put forward a 'quasi-political explanation'.
'Imagine a cocktail party of political party workers who are uniformly
distributed across the floor, all talking to their nearest neighbours,' Mr
Miller begins. 'The ex-prime minister enters and crosses the room. All the
workers in her neighbourhood are strongly attracted to her and cluster round
her . . . '
The Higgs boson would, in short, provide the mechanism by which particles
acquire mass.
His explanation moved Mr Waldegrave to remark: 'It happens with present
prime ministers, too.'
He added: 'Now I see why it's (the Higgs boson) important.' The competition
had made him more sympathetic to plans to build a new atom smasher at CERN,
the European nuclear research centre near Geneva, Switzerland.
Although he could not guarantee that the UK and other members of CERN would
provide the funds, 'if we cannot find the money - and that's going to be
hard pounding - I will recognise it as a loss'.
