ABOUT OLD HAWAII 
Jerry Hulse's story July 15, "Hawaii, My Old Friend," was great for a lot of 
reasons, not the least of which was his listing of the inexpensive lodgings in 
out-of-the-way places. I'm a little tired of publications assuming we can all 
spend, or even want to spend, $250 a night on a room.
