DISABILITY FOR 2 POLICEMEN 
The two Long Beach police officers who have received stress disability 
retirements did not reach that point through their "own alleged misconduct." 
Their psychological problems stemmed from the media portrayal of their actions. 
They were vilified, humiliated, whipped, crucified, tried, convicted, and 
sentenced -- and their trial hasn't started yet. 
Do these officers really stand any chance of a fair trial? 
I doubt that there is anyone in Southern California who hasn't seen and formed 
an opinion about the carefully edited videotape that was heralded as truth by 
the media, or failed to read any of the slanted editorials published after the 
fact.
