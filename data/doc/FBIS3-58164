  [Text] Brussels, Jan 10 (AFP) -- NATO leaders endorsed 
Monday [10 January] a plan for military cooperation with their 
former Soviet bloc enemies as a step towards possible 
enlargement of the 16-member alliance, NATO sources said. 
  The said the U.S. proposal, dubbed "Partnership for Peace," 
was adopted on the first day of a two-day summit aimed at 
building a new security order for Europe after the Cold War. 
  The scheme would offer Russia and its ex-satellites 
cooperation in planning, training and other activities as well 
as crisis consultations. It would be considered an essential 
but not automatic step towards NATO membership.
