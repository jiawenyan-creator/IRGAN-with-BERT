TODAY AT THE AFI FESTIVAL 
Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film 
Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century 
Plaza Cinemas: 
'Up Your Alley' 
United States, 1989, 93 minutes 
7 p.m. 
 Laughs, romance and thrills among the downtown homeless: a sexy newspaper 
reporter (Linda Blair) joins forces with a wino ex-comedy writer and an amiable 
shopping-cart fatso to track down a trash-heap slasher. Meanwhile, lecherous 
L.A. newspaper editors seduce their staff in Jacuzzis. Once in a while, some 
humor, life and verve seep though in the otherwise coy street scenes, but 
star-producer-writer Murray Langston and writer-director Bob Logan do prove you 
can craft a reasonable equivalent for the usual studio-made $15-million fiasco 
for only $150,000 -- an achievement in itself. MICHAEL WILMINGTON
