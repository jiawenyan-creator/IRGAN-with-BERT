  [Text] Tbilisi, 10 Jun -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev says that the peace-keeping mission of the Russian 
forces in Abkhazia can start immediately, if the conflicting 
sides agree to this. This will become possible if he receives 
an agreement from the Tbilisi and Gudauta leaders, with whom he 
will hold consultations throughout today. 
  In the first part of the day Grachev discussed this 
possibility with Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian 
state, in Tbilisi, and in the afternoon he will hold similar 
talks with Vladislav Ardzinba, the Abkhazian leader, in Gudauta. 
  Incidentally, the minister added that the airborne regiment 
of the Russian Armed Forces, which is stationed in Gudauta and 
which has been officially included in the composition of the CIS 
peace-keeping forces, can be brought in for the beginning of the 
peace-keeping mission. This decision will be in keeping with 
the latest well-known edict by Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
on rendering assistance in settling the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict, and at the same time it does not run contrary to the 
decision of the Federation Council, which for the time being is 
holding back from carrying out a peace-keeping mission in the 
conflict zone.
