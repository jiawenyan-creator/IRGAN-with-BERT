  [Abstract] A study examined the effect of low-temperature 
annealing at 200C for 100 hours on the structure and 
superconducting properties of 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-[/]. Two series of 
single crystals measuring 1 x 2 x 0.1 mm with stoichiometric and 
nonstoichiometric compositions were prepared. The first were 
grown by the method of dissolution in a melt, with a 
close-to-eutectic mixture of BaO and CuO serving as the solvent. 
The melting and crystallization were performed in 
Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-stabilized zirconium dioxide 
crucibles. The starting mixture consisted of 44.8 percent BaO, 
53.5 percent CuO, and 1.7 percent Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. 
Before the crystallization, the melt was held at 1,030C for 
4 hours, cooled at a rate of 1/h from 1,000C to 
880C, and then further cooled to room temperature at a rate 
of 100/h. The single crystals in the second series were 
subjected to additional oxidative annealing in an oxygen 
atmosphere at 400-650C for 26 hours to achieve oxygen 
stoichiometry. The specimens were studied on a DRON-3M automated 
system. The low-temperature annealing was conducted at 200C 
for 35 and 100 hours. In complete consistency with 
Khachaturyan's theory, the structure of the single crystals with 
a stoichiometric composition (i.e., 
YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7[/]) turned out to be 
stable and did not undergo any noticeable changes as a result of 
the low-temperature annealing at 200C for 100 hours. Their 
coarse twin structure was completely maintained, their 
diamagnetic response curve remained virtually unchanged, and 
their high temperature of transition to a superconducting state 
prior to annealing remained the same. The single crystals with a 
nonstoichiometric composition, on the other hand, underwent 
significant changes after low-temperature annealing for 200 
hours. Their coarse twins were replaced by a finely disperse 
tweed structure, and many differences between their 
electron-diffraction patterns recorded before and after 
annealing were evident. Their striation after annealing was 
attributed to waves of atomic displacements. Figures 7;
