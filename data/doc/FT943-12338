FT  26 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Missing link on training
Does training for owner-managers of small companies make their businesses
more successful at creating jobs or increasing profits? The answer is that
it might, but it might not.
According to research into the benefits of training, collated by Warwick
University's Professor David Storey*, there is no evidence to suggest that
more training leads to better business performance.
'The lack of a clearly demonstrable link between training and firm
performance is one of the reasons why many firms are reluctant to invest in
human resources,' say Newcastle University researchers.
The findings have startled the Confederation of British Industry. Until now
the CBI has tended to trot out Department of Trade and Industry figures that
training can reduce failures in businesses from a rate of one in three to
one in 10. Storey says he has failed to find the ultimate source of this DTI
claim.
Following Storey's research, the CBI has convened a working group to look at
the effectiveness of training. And it is circulating a questionnaire to its
members with the intention of developing a policy on management development
in smaller companies ahead of the CBI conference in November.
'There is a feeling that training is 'a good thing',' says Ian Peters, CBI
deputy director for smaller companies policy. 'There has never been an
attempt to measure training against specified objectives.'
The CBI agrees with Storey and other academics that the government has
tended to measure inputs - how many training courses are provided - rather
than whether the courses do any good. 'Particularly with the development of
Business Links there is a need to be more focused on the sorts of support
the government is providing,' says Peters.
