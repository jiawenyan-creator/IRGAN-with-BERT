'HOMELESSNESS IN SUBURBIA' AND SHEEN'S OFFER OF A SANCTUARY 
This is to tell Sheen that I support his recent statements regarding the poor 
and the homeless. 
Although I don't live in Malibu, I would say that if there were a hundred 
Martin Sheens in this part of the world we would really have a much gentler, 
kinder nation. Last October I saw him in the very first ranks of peaceful 
demonstrators to walk across the cattle guard at Mercury, Nev., in an attempt 
to stop nuclear testing. Several hundred men and women from all across the 
United States came to express their desire to stop nuclear testing and to draw 
attention to the enormity of the crime against humanity that nuclear testing 
is. 
That Sheen involves himself in such activities and in his other concerns for 
the ill-housed is testimony to the man's concern for the human condition. We 
who are well-fed, well-housed, etc., should take our hats off to him. 
How different the world would be if another Hollywood actor had been this 
concerned with the ill-clothed, the ill-fed, the ill-housed in this, the 
richest country in the world.
