FT  09 JUL 93 / World Trade News: The Timetable - Countdown To a GATT Deal
Mon July 12: Negotiators return to Geneva after seven-month lapse.
Representatives from 96 countries not involved in the quad process receive
briefing on what has been agreed bilaterally so far.
July 12-July 31: Gatt signatories meet one-on-one to swap market opening
offers. The 'most favoured nation' rule means an offer to one must be
extended to all.
End-July: Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director general, is expected to call a
full meeting of the trade negotiating committee - the umbrella body under
which the Uruguay Round is being negotiated - to summarise progress through
July, and to define plans for autumn.
August: Gatt summer break. Valuable time wasted.
September 1 - December 15: Negotiations resume. No structure yet firm. Legal
drafters for the final text of the Uruguay Round final act will work in
parallel, ensuring agreement terms are legally watertight.
December 15: President Clinton's 'fast track' authority expires. This
authority gives him the right to present a Uruguay Round agreement as a
single package to Congress in a take-it-or-leave-it way. Without this it is
assumed a deal as complex as Gatt would never get through since compromises
that made the deal acceptable 110 Gatt signatories could be amended.
January 1 1994: New Gatt agreement comes into effect. Many will need to
introduce it provisionally, since ratification could take some time into
1994.
