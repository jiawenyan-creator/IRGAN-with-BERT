<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
was duly appointed receiver for each of the financial institutions specified in 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

. The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of these receivership
estates are insufficient to satisfy all classes of claims, asserted or unasserted against the receivership estate.
Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable state and federal law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend,
distribution or payment to any other creditor and therefore the claim of any such creditor is worthless.
