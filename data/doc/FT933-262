FT  30 SEP 93 / Hungary devalues as policy shifts
HUNGARY yesterday further relaxed its exchange rate policy by devaluing the
forint by 4.5 per cent, leaving the national currency 15.1 per cent down on
a year ago.
The government cited the 'need to adjust the forint's exchange rate to its
real rate on international money markets'. Yesterday's was the fifth
devaluation this year and the increasing frequency of currency changes
indicates a shift from Hungary's earlier policy of real appreciation of the
forint.
Behind the change lies a precipitous drop in exports, which in the first
seven months of the year were 27-28 per cent down on a year earlier.
Independent analysts and the National Bank of Hungary's own forecasters now
predict that the export collapse could leave the current account in deficit
by Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) for the year.
The Hungarian authorities aim to finance the current account with capital
inflow but a shortfall of the order forecast would exceed expected foreign
direct investment of Dollars 1.5bn for 1992.
The increasing pace of currency depreciation offers relief to exporters.
But the latest devaluation will increase import prices at a time when
consumer inflation has in any case rebounded to stand at 22.3 per cent in
the year to August.
To offset the inflationary impact of devaluation and allow financing of the
1993 public-sector deficit of 6.8 per cent of GDP, the National Bank of
Hungary has increased interest rates.
Last week the central bank raised its base rate by three points to 22 per
cent.
