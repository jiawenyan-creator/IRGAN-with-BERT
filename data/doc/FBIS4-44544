Beijing"] 
  [Text] Tokyo (Agencies via XINHUA) -- NEC Corp announced 
last week that it had reached an agreement to set up a computer 
software development venture in Beijing next month with the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences. The NEC-CAS Software Laboratories 
Ltd. will be capitalized at 150 million yen ($1.5 million), with 
NEC holding 90 percent and the Institute of Software of the 
Academia Sinica holding the remaining 10 percent. 
  NEC said the venture would start operating in July with 50 
employees, rising to 200 at a later stage. Software sales are 
targeted to climb from 60 million yen ($576,000) in the first 
year to 200 million yen ($1.92 million) by 1999. The new 
company, said to be the first software development venture in 
China, will focus on developing open-system UNIX-based 
middleware and computer-aided software engineering products for 
the Chinese market. 
  Due to the progressive development of downsizing and open 
systems in recent years, the demand for portable computers and 
workstations in China has expanded rapidly, NEC said. "There is 
a high expectation of rapid growth in the personal computer and 
workstation markets due to rapid growth in Chinese industry," it 
added.
