  [Text] Warsaw, 29 Mar--I am a civil servant who found out 
from the mass media that he allegedly is a candidate for the 
posts of deputy prime minister and minister of finance. I am a 
subject of speculation, but I am not speculating myself, and I 
have no way of balancing all of the elements connected with the 
risk, Leslaw Paga, chairman of the Securities Commission, told 
Radio Eska [Polish private radio station] on Tuesday. 
  On 27 March, Lech Walesa told journalists that he would not 
have anything against Paga's candidacy. "It is very nice that 
the president has a positive opinion about me", Paga said. To 
the question of whether he would like to become deputy prime 
minister, he answered: "I am doing what I am doing, and I hope 
to be able to continue doing it for some time, and, after 
finishing my work for the commission, I would like to work for a 
large bank." 
  I have no way of saying yes or no, Paga replied to the 
question of whether Dariusz Rosati would be a good minister of 
finance. "I do not know him personally, only from earlier press 
articles," he added.
