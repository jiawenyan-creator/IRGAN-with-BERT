Endangered and Threatened Species; Coho Salmon in Scott and Waddell Creeks, CA

ACTION:

 Notice of determination; status review. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has determined that the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon populations in central California do not constitute
a ``species'' under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and, therefore, do not qualify for listing under the ESA at this
time. However, as part of a coast-wide status review NMFS is conducting of coho salmon populations in California,
Idaho, Oregon and Washington, NMFS will determine if the two California populations are part of a larger evolutionarily
significant unit that qualifies for protection under the ESA. A review of Oregon coho salmon stocks is expected to
be completed in July 1994 and all stocks by October 1994.

Background 



On March 11, 1993, NMFS received a petition from the Santa Cruz County Planning Department (petitioner) to add naturally
spawning Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon (

Oncorhynchus kisutch

) to the list of threatened and endangered species and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. The petition contained
information on electrofishing and trapping catch data to demonstrate declining population trends; provided information
on geographic location, spawning distribution, and anadromous life history to illustrate evolutionary significance;
and provided information on geographical isolation, distinctive life history and body size characteristics, and
effects of hatchery fish to illustrate reproductive isolation. NMFS published a 

Federal Register

 document (58 FR 33605, June 18, 1993) indicating that the petition presented substantial scientific information
that suggested listing might be warranted. To ensure a comprehensive review, NMFS solicited information and data
concerning the present and historic status of the Scott and Waddell Creeks coho salmon, and whether this stock qualifies
as a ``species'' under the ESA. NMFS also requested information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for the
Scott Creek and Waddell Creeks coho salmon. NMFS obtained information and data from several State, Federal, and local
sources concerning the historic and present coho salmon abundance and distribution, water quality, fishery management
practices, land management practices, hatchery management impacts, life history characteristics, and stock identification.




Biological Information 



The NMFS Southwest Region prepared a technical report entitled: ``Status Review for Scott Creek and Waddell Creek
Coho Salmon'', which provides more detailed information, discussion, and references. The report is available upon
request (see 

ADDRESSES

) and is summarized below. 

Scott Creek and Waddell Creek are neighboring watersheds that flow into the Pacific Ocean within 4 miles of one another.
These two streams are located on the north coast of Santa Cruz County approximately 15 miles to the north of the City
of Santa Cruz, California. Scott Creek's main stem is 18 miles long, with 35 miles of tributary length, and a watershed
that covers 35 square miles. Waddell Creek's main stem is 12 miles 
long, with 45 miles of tributary length, and a watershed that covers 26 square miles. 

Coho salmon (

Oncorhynchus kisutch

) are anadromous along the Pacific coast from Chamalu Bay, Mexico, to Point Hope, Alaska, through the Aleutians, and
from the Anadyr River, U.S.S.R., south to Hokkaido, Japan. In California, coho salmon historically used most of the
accessible coastal streams from Monterey County north to the Oregon border.
