FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Receiver called in at Allied Partnership
Allied Partnership Group, the environmental contractor and fork lift truck
distributor, said yesterday that a receiver had been appointed to the group
holding company following an application from Humberclyde Industrial
Finance, a leasing company.
Shares in Allied Partnership were suspended last Thursday at 9 3/4 p and on
Friday the company unsuccessfully tried to set aside Thursday's appointment
of Touche Ross as the receiver.
Humberclyde said that the receiver had been appointed last Thursday at
12.15pm.
Dew Group, which is the main construction company within APG, is currently
trading profitably and continues to have the support of its bankers, APG
said.
Humberclyde had taken the step of appointing the receiver to protect its
security interests which it believed were in danger of being undermined by
the granting of additional security to other parties.
