  [Text] Banja Luka, 4 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces this 
morning launched a heavy attack from the direction of Prusac and 
Bugojno against Serb defense lines five kilometers south of 
Srbobran [Donji Vakuf] the information service of the 1st 
Krajina Corps of the Srpska republic army announced in Banja 
Luka. The Muslims used 82-mm mortars, anti-aircraft and infantry 
weapons. The defense lines have not changed, but several Serb 
fighters were wounded. Members of the Srpska republic army 
responded to the fire, after which the firing stopped. 
  This report also denies yesterday's news broadcast by 
Croatian and Muslim media that their units reached a position 
one kilometer from the center of Srbobran. Serb military 
sources also deny that combined Muslim and Croat units took part 
in the attack, saying that this is a propaganda trick. They 
stress that the attack on Serbobran is conducted mainly by 
Muslims who earlier escaped from the town and also members of 
the 370th Donji Vakuf Brigade of the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army.
