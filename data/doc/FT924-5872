FT  25 NOV 92 / Gaviria government hit by M-19 resignation
COLOMBIA'S influential ex-guerrilla movement M-19 yesterday resigned from
President Cesar Gaviria's government, in protest at a crackdown on left-wing
rebels, Reuter reports from Bogota.  It also called for UN mediation to stop
bloodshed in the country.
The move by the M-19 Democratic Alliance came after Mr Gaviria ignored a
plea from its leaders to order a ceasefire in the war against the rebels.
M-19's withdrawal, which means the resignation of Health Minister Gustavo de
Roux and 350 lesser officials, is the first important loss of political
support Mr Gaviria has suffered since declaring a state of emergency on
November 8 to fight the estimated 8,000 Marxist rebels.
