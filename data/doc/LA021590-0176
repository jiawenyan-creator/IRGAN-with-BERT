ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
LOCAL LEADERS VIEW SITE OF ART CENTER 
Representatives from the city government and local art organizations and 
business leaders met this week to survey the future site of the Huntington 
Beach Art Center. 
The 11,000-square-foot building at 538 Main St. was bought by the city in 1988 
for $750,000 from Southern California Edison Co., which had used it for 
business offices. 
The art center will be the inland anchor of the city's Main-Pier area 
development center. 
At an open house ceremony, Councilman Peter M. Green thanked the FHP medical 
group, which on Tuesday gave a $75,000 check to the Huntington Beach Art Center 
Foundation, the fund-raising arm of the center. 
The center is scheduled to open in spring, 1991, and will include three 
galleries covering 4,000 square feet of exhibition space, a performance room, a 
studio and a bookstore. The renovation of the building is expected to cost 
about $750,000, bringing the total cost of setting up the center to about $1.5 
million. JOHN PENNER
