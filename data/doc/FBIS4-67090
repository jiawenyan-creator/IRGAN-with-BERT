  [Text] Regarding the case that the United States has 
issued a warrant demanding a Thai member of House of 
Representatives to make clarification on a narcotics trafficking 
charge against him and U.S. authorities have frozen the assets 
in the United States of the said suspect, Foreign Affairs 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri this morning met with 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to inform him of what the Foreign 
Ministry would do next on this matter. The foreign minister told 
reporters after his meeting with the prime minister that he will 
contact the U.S. Embassay for further information. The matter 
also has adverse effects on the parliamentary institution and 
Thai people, and the Thai Government has not been idle on the 
matter, said Prasong. Regarding this, the Foreign Ministry has 
always followed up on the developments since it was first 
informed on 12 January 1993. The Office of the Supreme Attorney 
General has reported on the matter to the Foreign Ministry and 
also notified the suspect and his colleagues of their 
wrongdoings, telling them to give explanations to the court in 
the United States. 
  [Begin recording] [Prasong] I will contact the U.S. Embassy 
for further information, because once an accusation is made 
against a Thai, it also affects all the others--both the 
parliamentary institution and the country as a whole. Therefore, 
I would like to know about the additional information and 
evidence. I will contact the U.S. Embassy, because it used to 
contact the Foreign Affairs Ministry before on this. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Sir, when did they first inform us 
of 
the matter? 
  [Prasong] Around 12 January 1993. However, they [U.S. 
authorities] have been following this case for nearly 10 years, 
according to a report. 
  [Reporter] Sir, [words indistinct] what action will you 
take? 
  [Prasong] This is the responsibility of the authorities. I 
myself will coordinate the Office of Narcotics Control Board and 
police authorities in charge of narcotics work to give them 
information. 
  [Reporter] As an MP [Member of Parliament], what would you 
say about this? 
  [Prasong] It is up to the House of Representatives to 
consider. [end recording]
