MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK 
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the long-feuding leaders of the Rolling Stones, 
are both expected to be on hand tonight in New York when the celebrated British 
rock group is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A source close to 
the band said, however, that the odds are against all five members of the 
Stones being on hand, so there probably won't be an official reunion on stage. 
But there are rumors of a reunion tour later this year. The band hasn't toured 
since 1981. Phil Spector, the reclusive, L.A.-based record producer whose "wall 
of sound" style was one of the most distinctive ever in rock, is also scheduled 
to attend. He was named a non-performing member of the hall of fame. ALEENE
