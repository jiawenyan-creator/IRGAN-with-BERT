  [Text] Cape Town June 16 SAPA -- Azapo [Azanian People's 
Organization] will not hesitate to take up arms against the 
government of national unity if it restricted political freedom, 
said Jomo Kwodi, deputy president of the Azanian Students' 
Congress, the student wing of the Azanian People's Organisation. 
Mr Kwodi was addressing a small crowd of supporters at Azapo's 
June 16 commemoration rally in Guguletu in the Cape peninsula on 
Thursday. 
  Many of the speakers at the rally condemned the government 
of 
national unity and committed Azapo to struggle for what they 
termed true political rights, Cape-based TANIS [expansion 
unknown] news agency reported. 
  Another speaker at the rally, Azapo's political commissar Mr 
Mzukisi Madlavu, condemned salaries that were paid to members of 
parliament. "MPs have no right to earn wages that exceeds those 
of skilled public servants, while some of them have no specific 
duties." He said the money could be effectively used to help 
the Reconstruction and Development Programme.
