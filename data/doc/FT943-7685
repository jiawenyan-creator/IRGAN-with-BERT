FT  22 AUG 94 / This Week: The Mask - Film / Video
Put Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies on hold. Resist The Flintstones, if
you have resisted thus far. The best summer holiday treat is The Mask. This
special-effects comedy scores in all departments. Its star is special - the
rubber-faced, high-speed comedian Jim Carrey. Its plot and trick photography
are dazzlingly effective: a young bank clerk's new found power to take any
cartoonish shape he wants, from slavering Disneyish wolf to 3D eye-poppings,
jaw-droppings and heart-leapings. And the comedy is pacy and assured, mixing
high farce, low knockabout and delectable medium-rare impersonations.
If we must have a silly season, this is top-class silliness. Elsewhere, amid
the nuclear Arnolds and neolithic Freds and Barneys, you need to find an
art-house for anything like challenging cinema. Best offbeat pleasure is
America's Go Fish, a tale of lesbian manners light on polemics and strong on
charm and raunchy wit. (Do not take the children or Aunt Edna). Also from
America: the sleekly subversive crime thriller The Last Seduction, with
Linda Fiorentino as a runaway wife, expert at handling stolen cocaine,
sudden sex and swapped identities.
The best homegrown British film - though fast swelling from coterie comedy
to international sell-out - is still Four Weddings and a Funeral. Eight
actors and a phenomenon (Hugh Grant, a sort of matinee-idol Bertie Wooster)
show that the English can still be stylish in laughing at themselves and at
persuading others to do so.
And a video last word, especially for those with children. Disney's Aladdin
is within reach of your VCRs from next week. The songs are jolly, the
colours are resplendent and Robin Williams's motor-mouthed genie is the best
possible warm-up act for Jim Carrey in The Mask.
