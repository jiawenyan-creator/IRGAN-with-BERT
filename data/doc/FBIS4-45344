  [Excerpts] Victoria, Tamaulipas, 14 May--Today, Benjamin 
Lopez Aquirre, the federal congressman representing Matamoros, 
maintained that there are still "narcos" working as policemen on 
the border, especially in the State Judicial and municipal 
forces. He claimed that they are helping to transport drug 
shipments from that area. 
  He emphasized that drug traffickers who have infiltrated 
this 
border state's police forces are collaborating in the "business." 
  As he explained, this problem persists, despite the efforts 
made by the offices of the national and state attorneys general 
to combat it. 
  He indicated that this state office should conduct a 
thorough 
investigation of the lifestyle of every agent, noting that its 
attention should be focused on commanders and ex-police chiefs 
who have amassed huge fortunes. [passage omitted] 
  He declared: "There are many policemen in these 
circumstances 
in Matamoros, but the same thing applies to Reynosa and Nuevo 
Laredo." 
  Adding that programs such as testing for drugs have been 
useful, he remarked, however, that they only help to detect the 
members addicted to cocaine or marijuana who have been receiving 
drugs from the "narcos," so as to keep those individuals in the 
latter's service. 
  As for the assertion made by the state attorney general, 
Raul 
Morales Cadena, to the effect that Matamoros "is free from 
`narcos'" because Juan Garcia Abrego has moved his center of 
operations to Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, the legislator commented: 
"Not to my knowledge." 
  Nevertheless, he admitted that the violence generated by the 
drug traffic "has declined in recent months." 
  He concluded by saying that, for a long time, Matamoros has 
not experienced confrontations between rival "narco" rings in 
broad daylight, in central sections of the town. These 
confrontations had been causing panic among the population in 
the past.
