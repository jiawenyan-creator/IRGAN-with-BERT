FT  20 NOV 92 / London chefs put expansion on menu
THE NUMBER of large, high-quality restaurants opening in London this year
has been greater than at any time since 1986, according to a report
published yesterday.
The editors of the Harden's London Restaurants guide say the fall in the
capital's property prices has resulted in restaurateurs being able to afford
larger premises.
There is also now a larger group of English chefs able to compete with their
counterparts in large cities abroad.
The report says 10 London restaurants with more than 75 seats and catering
to the middle and upper markets have opened this year, compared with three
last year and one each in 1989 and 1990. The new openings included the
Criterion, Christopher's and 5th Floor at Harvey Nichols.
The report says that of the 692 restaurants mentioned in its guide at the
beginning of the year, 17 have closed and 23 have new names or owners. The
editors say restaurants that closed were offering poor value for money,
suffering from a poor location or were in Soho or outer Chelsea and Fulham -
areas affected by the end of the 1980s boom.
Mr Peter Harden, co-editor of the report, said: 'There isn't a single
example of a large, prominent mid-to-high-quality restaurant closing over
the past year. London hasn't had in the past these big, metropolitan
eateries you find in New York. It now has.'
Average cost at the restaurants named was Pounds 24.71, down from Pounds
24.77 a year ago.
