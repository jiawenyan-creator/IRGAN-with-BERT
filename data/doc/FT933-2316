FT  20 SEP 93 / Attack hits Georgia peace hope
GEORGIA teetered yesterday between slender peace hopes and fears of
worsening civil war as its leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, issued a
desperate plea for outside help, Reuter reports from Sukhumi.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported that Georgian and Abkhazian
representatives signed an unexpected agreement to withdraw their forces from
the war zone in Abkhazia, where fresh fighting last week shattered a
seven-week-old peace deal.
But the agency reported almost simultaneously that Abkhazian separatist
forces had broken through to the outskirts of Sukhumi, the government-held
regional centre.
Earlier, Mr Shevardnadze called on Russia and the west to help stop the
rebels. He said his country was 'being pushed to the abyss'.
