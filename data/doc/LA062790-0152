KATHLEEN TURNER GIVES BENEFIT AUCTION THE SLIP 
Sure, anyone can give someone the slip, but actress Kathleen Turner's slip 
costs $1,200. 
The slip, which she has been wearing in the play "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," was 
one of 29 items sold Tuesday night at a black-tie dinner and auction for Easter 
Seals. 
The auction raised $30,000 for the charity that aids people with disabilities. 
Bidding for the slip started at $500 and quickly grew after auctioneer Diddi 
Lynn Worsole informed potential buyers that the slip was not in the room 
because Turner was wearing it just a few blocks away. 
"She's sweating in it right now," Worsole said. "Maybe there will be a little 
perfume on it." 
The bidding quickly escalated in increments of $100 until Staten Island real 
estate broker Henry Setaro came in with the top bid of $1,200. 
"It's the closest I will ever get to Kathleen Turner," Setaro said. "I hope 
they don't wash it before I get it."
