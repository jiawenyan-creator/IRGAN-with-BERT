  [Text] The Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has 
intensified its campaign to protect intellectual property rights 
[IPR]. Earlier today, DTI filed counterfeiting charges against 
two clothing retail outlets of Walt Disney products that have no 
authorization from the legitimate copyright owners. DTI 
Undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez headed the raiding team which 
filed the charge sheets against the two outlets in Shoppesville 
Complex in Greenhills, San Juan. 
  Those charged will face a fine of up to P150,000 [Philippine 
pesos] or cancellation of permit and other penalties. Ordonez 
assured that DTI is following a more speedy procedure in filing 
charges. 
  [Begin recording] [Ordonez in progress] ...because what I 
have here [displaying child's clothing] is Walt Disney, but this 
is fake -- counterfeit. This is not right, okay? We need not 
go to the police, go to the court, go to the judge, and go to 
the mayor. No need. As long as there is a consumer that comes 
to us and has the receipt and brings something like this, the 
consumer can make a complaint at our office. Within three to 
five days, the violators were arrested. That was what happened. 
  This one, I was the one who personally bought it. So, they 
can not fool us anymore. Aside from this, even if I did not buy 
this one, if there is a complaint, and there is a receipt and 
the product is presented, they will be caught. 
  [Disney representative, in English] I'm very glad that DTI 
has decided to take corrective action on counterfeiting in the 
Philippines because it is really a big problem here. We have 
local manufacturers paying taxes to the government, and they are 
badly affected by the counterfeits. Now, stopping counterfeits 
from retailers will really help solve the problem. [end
