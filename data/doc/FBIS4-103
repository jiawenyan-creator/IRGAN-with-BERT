  [Text] The DAILY TIMES rejects Nigeria's efforts to have a 
permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council as it has 
been making conscious efforts to have a place for Africa in the 
supreme organ of the UN. Reporting further on this move, the 
paper quotes Nigeria's minister of external affairs as stating 
that it will give all the regions in the world equal and fairer 
presentation.
