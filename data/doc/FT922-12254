FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (13): A second wave
INVER HOUSE Distillers' senior still-man at its Knockdhu Distillery, Mr Bill
Pennet (right) was in a celebratory mood after learning that the company had
won an export award. Inver House has increased its overseas sales by an
average of 20 per cent for the past four years. Over 90 per cent of its
production goes overseas.
'Inver House is leading the second wave in the growth of the Scotch whisky
overseas market,' says Mr Bill Robison, the company's chairman and chief
executive. 'We possess one of the strongest distribution networks available
to any independent distiller,' adds Mr Graeme Thomson, the sales and
marketing director.
Since its management buyout in 1988, Inver House has acquired two Speyside
distilleries and entered into joint ventures with international
distributors, including Barton Brands of Chicago and Distilleries Ryssen of
France.
The company's brands include Catto's, MacArthur's, Hankey Bannister and
Coldstream Gin.
