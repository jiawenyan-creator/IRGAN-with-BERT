  [Text] Yerevan February 21 TASS -- Georgian Prime Minister 
Otar Patsatsia left for home today after he failed during a 
one-day visit to reach an agreement with Armenian leaders on 
disputed economic matters, a source in the Armenian Government 
told ITAR-TASS on Monday. 
  Patsatsia was received by Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan and Premier Grant Bagratyan behind closed doors. 
Although the contents of the talks were not made public, they 
apparently dealt with the problems of transporting Armenia-bound 
goods via Georgian territory. 
  Patsatia refused to sign an agreement proposed by Yerevan 
according to which Georgia should bear more responsibility in 
case natural gas supplies were cut off or limited, the source 
said. 
  Armenia receives natural gas through a pipeline passing 
across Georgia which has several times been exploded. 
  Also disturbing for Armenia is that cargo trains with wheat 
and other goods destined for Armenia come from Georgia with 
delay or are plundered while passing through its territory.
