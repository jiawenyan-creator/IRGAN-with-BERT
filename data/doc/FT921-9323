FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Thai banks' net profits rise
COMBINED net profits of the 15 Thai commercial banks rose to Bt19.46bn
(Dollars 807.5m) in 1991, up 25.4 per cent from Bt15.52bn a year ago,
according to Bangkok Bank, Reuter reports.
Bangkok Bank said the slower rate of earnings growth, compared with 1990
when profits soared 85.4 per cent, may be due to an economic slowdown, wide
interest rate fluctuations, and higher operating expenses and staff
salaries.
Bangkok Bank said its 1991 record profit of Bt7.3bn accounted for 37.3 per
cent of total net after-tax earnings of all Thai banks.
Bangkok Bank was followed by the Thai Farmers Bank with Bt3.4bn, or a 17.5
per cent share, and the Siam Commercial Bank at Bt2.7bn, a 13.8 per cent
share.
Total Thai bank lending rose a combined 21.8 per cent in 1991, to an
outstanding Bt1,797.4bn at the end of December.
