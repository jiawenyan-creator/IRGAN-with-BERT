FT  06 SEP 94 / Observer: A diplomat's diplomat
After months of coyness on the part of Anatoly Adamishin, it is official.
Russia's first deputy foreign minister is bound for London as the next
ambassador to the Court of St James, succeeding Boris Pankin who was first
told he would have to vacate the ambassadorial mansion almost a year ago.
A 37-year veteran of the foreign ministry, Adamishin has garnered much of
his considerable experience on the west European desk. He spent two long
spells in Rome, and professes his Italian to be better than his 'poor' (but
in reality fluent) English.
Highly respected within the diplomatic community, the new man also knows his
way around the newly-independent Soviet states. He was recently heard
lamenting the West's tendency to label as 'neo-imperialism' any Russian
attempts to promote stability round its borders. No doubt it is a point he
will hope to hammer home in his new posting.
Meanwhile, Pankin may feel a trifle aggrieved. As ambassador to Prague, he,
alone among the Soviet ambassadors, stood up publicly against the attempted
coup in August 1991. The post of foreign minister, given to him as reward
for his valour was soon lost, and the Anglophile's tenure in London has been
shorter than he would have wished. Perhaps the former journalist fancies
turning his hand to an informed account of the end of the Soviet foreign
ministry and the creation of its Russian counterpart.
