  [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- Reliable cease-fire and 
termination of combat operations in Nagorno-Karabakh are 
absolute priorities of the Russian concept of Karabakh 
settlement, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Information 
and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here 
today. Many problems caused by the armed confrontation will 
have no solution without these conditions, he added. 
  Bearing in mind some unclear mass media reports, Karasin 
specified the Russian concept of Karabakh settlement and said 
the second stage of the settlement shall include troops pullback 
from the territories occupied in combat operations, resumption 
of the functioning of communications and the return of refugee 
to places of their permanent residence. 
  Political negotiations on the legal status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh will be expedient only at the third stage and 
under more favourable conditions, stressed Karasin. He said 
this idea is supported by all the conflicting sides, who "think 
that the Karabakh future status should be established on a 
compromise basis through negotiations".
