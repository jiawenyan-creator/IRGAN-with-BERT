FT  20 SEP 94 / 'Enfant terrible' of fashion dies
Franco Moschino, one of Italy's leading fashion designers, died on Sunday,
aged 44, after a long illness, his fashion house said yesterday. He had
surgery for an abdominal tumour two years ago and had battled against
illness since then. News of the designer's death was withheld until
yesterday to allow his funeral to take place in strict privacy. Moschino
studied at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in Milan. He began his career as a
freelance illustrator for designer Gianni Versace's fashion house in 1974.
He launched his first collection in 1983. He was an 'enfant terrible' of
Italian fashion, poking fun at the fashion world and becoming renowned for
outrageous ensembles. He once designed a ball gown of garbage bags.
