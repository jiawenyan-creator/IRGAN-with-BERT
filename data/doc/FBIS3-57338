  [Text] Yerevan, January 25 (SNARK)--Home Affairs Minister 
Vano Siradegyan told SNARK today the attempts to establish 
active cooperation with the Georgian Home Affairs Ministry had 
no success so far. 
  "We repeatedly offered to organize joint protection of the 
gas main, the bridges and other objects on the territory of 
Georgia which are vital for Armenia. But each time we were 
rejected", said the minister. He added that the Georgian 
Government doesn't want another state's military units to be 
located on the territory of Georgia. "And this position does 
make sense" noted Vano Siradegyan.
