  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Japan welcomed Friday [4 
February] the United States announcement that it will lift its 
nearly two decades-long trade embargo against Vietnam which is 
expected to pave the way for normalization of Washington-Hanoi 
ties. 
  "Japan welcomes the decision made by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam as a 
significant step toward the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam 
relations," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada said. 
  Japan regards the U.S. decision as "contributing not only to 
the improvement of the U.S.-Vietnam relationship but also to the 
peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region," Terada said. 
  He said Japan has been making diplomatic efforts to 
facilitate the improvement of U.S.-Vietnam ties, such as urging 
Vietnamese Government officials to cooperate with the U.S. in 
resolving problems involving Americans Missing in Action (MIAs) 
in the Vietnam war. 
  Tokyo has also been telling the U.S. Government it is "very 
important to ameliorate" Washington-Hanoi ties, he said. 
  Clinton announced Thursday he would lift the 19-year-old 
trade embargo against Vietnam, citing "tangible progress" in the 
accounting of American MIAs. 
  He also said the U.S. and Vietnam have decided to exchange 
liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington to facilitate more 
progress on the MIA issue. 
  But Clinton said the measure does not constitute a 
normalization of diplomatic relations, saying, "before that 
happens, we must have more progress, more cooperation and more 
answers." 
  The U.S. imposed an economic embargo on communist-ruled 
North Vietnam in 1964 and extended it to the whole country when 
the U.S.-backed regime in Saigon fell to communist forces in 
April 1975.
