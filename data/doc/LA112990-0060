DOG SHOOTING PROMPTS ANIMAL TRAINING FOR DEPUTIES; 
PETS: SESSIONS WILL BEGIN NEXT YEAR AS PART OF A LARGER PROGRAM TO FAMILIARIZE 
OFFICERS WITH WEST HOLLYWOOD. 
In the wake of the recent shooting of a homeless man's dog by a Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputy, the city of West Hollywood and the sheriff's station 
there have agreed to provide the city's 130 deputies and officers with special 
training in the handling of animals. 
The training sessions will start after Jan. 1 as part of a larger program 
designed to familiarize deputies with the West Hollywood community, said Nancy 
Greenstein, assistant to the city manager. 
"The training program was already in the works, but after the shooting happened 
we decided to add it into the program," she said. 
A deputy's shooting Sunday of Baby -- a mixed-breed dog belonging to Robert 
Uderos, a 36-year-old homeless man -- has sparked an outcry among animal-rights 
activists, who accused the deputy of cruelty to animals. 
The city's Public Safety Commission, which reviews complaints about deputy 
misconduct, plans to take testimony in the incident when it meets Dec. 10. 
The shooting occurred in a parking lot in the 600 block of La Peer Drive, where 
Uderos and another homeless man had been sleeping. When the deputy ordered the 
two to leave, the dog charged, according to sheriff's officials. The officer 
drew his gun and fired three times, hitting the dog twice. 
On Wednesday, animal-rights activists disputed the sheriff's report that the 
dog provoked the shooting. "The dog never charged the deputy," said Bill Dyer. 
"He just positioned himself between Uderos and the deputy." 
The dog was rushed to a nearby animal hospital where it died. Both Uderos and 
his friend, Arnold Morales, were arrested after the shooting. Morales was 
charged with loitering and also was being held on an unrelated drug charge. 
Uderos was charged with a form of trespassing and has been released.
