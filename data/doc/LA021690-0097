METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 32 YEARS TO LIFE IN KILLING OF 
YOUTH AT MALL 
A gang member who accidentally killed a teen-ager when he opened fire on a 
rival at a mall crowded with Christmas shoppers was sentenced Thursday to 32 
years to life in prison plus a consecutive term of life in prison. 
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp gave Roger Leon White, 23, of 
Van Nuys the maximum sentence possible. 
He will not be eligible for parole for 27 years, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Shellie Samuels. Authorities described White and his intended victim as gang 
members. 
A jury on Jan. 4 convicted White of first-degree murder in the Dec. 16, 1988, 
death of Sergio Alpuche, 16, also of Van Nuys, at the Panorama City Mall. 
Alpuche, an "A" student at Birmingham High School with no gang affiliation, was 
shopping for Christmas presents when he was shot.
