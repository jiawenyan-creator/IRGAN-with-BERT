FT  08 FEB 93 / Letter: A wartime lesson for funding large PSBR
Sir, The last time the UK had the problem of funding a very large public
sector borrowing requirement was during the second world war. A crude
adaptation of war-time funding techniques to the circumstances of today
would be as follows:
1) Keep open a gilt-edged tap with yields that the government would pledge
not to increase, so that investors would have no incentive to delay
purchases in the hope of a better yield later on. (In the war the gilts tap
yield was set at 3 per cent: obviously it would now have to be set more or
less in line with present market rates).
2) Keep base rates and money market rates on average well below the yields
on tap gilts, so as to make gilts an attractive investment.
3) To deter the banks from unduly monetising the national debt (which would
be a profitable operation with long rates higher than short rates and no
likelihood of them increasing) subject each bank to a call of special
deposits equal to, say, half its net investment in gilts. (In this way
special deposits would play much the same role as war-time Treasury Deposit
Receipts.)
An obvious disadvantage is that the authorities' control over the broad
money stock would probably be even more precarious than hitherto. Its
obvious advantage is that it's one way of selling a lot of gilts.
