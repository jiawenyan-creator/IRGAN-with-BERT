  [Text] The transfer of areas to PLO control will continue 
in the Gaza Strip today. Today they will receive control over 
the Rafah and Khan Yunus areas. Last night the Palestinians 
received control over Dayr al-Balah. Riots occurred in this 
town last night; youths hurled stones at IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] soldiers and fired shots in the air. Electricity supply 
to the Qatif Bloc was cut off last night, but the problem was 
corrected. 
  This morning the Dayr al-Balah area will be officially 
handed 
over to the Palestinians in a small ceremony. Some 150 more 
Palestinian policemen will enter the Gaza Strip today via the 
Rafah border terminal. The IDF is continuing its evacuation, 
which will proceed according to the rate of entrance of the 
Palestinian forces. Our military affairs correspondent Karmela 
Menashe reports that only operational forces remain in most IDF 
installations in the Gaza Strip.
