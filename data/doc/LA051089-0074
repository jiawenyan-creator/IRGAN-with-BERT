METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JPL, BLACK SCHOOLS START JOINT PROGRAMS 
In an effort to increase the number of blacks entering science and engineering 
fields, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Caltech signed agreements Tuesday for 
a joint academic program with seven historically black colleges and 
universities in the South. 
"The black colleges and universities have a great resource we have not been 
tapping," said Martin Leipold, manager of the program for JPL. He said the 
Pasadena area lab will offer summer research jobs to the students, and JPL 
scientists and Caltech professors will lecture at the schools. 
The agreements are with Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, the 
Morehouse School of Medicine, Spelman College and Morris Brown College, all in 
Georgia, as well as Jackson State University in Mississippi and Tuskegee 
University in Alabama. JPL, a center for outer space exploration, is run by 
Caltech for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
