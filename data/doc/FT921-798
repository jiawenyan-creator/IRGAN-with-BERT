FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Redundancy costs push Lopex into red
Lopex, the marketing and communications group, was forced into the red in
1991 after a Pounds 1.28m exceptional charge for redundancy costs.
Pre-tax losses came to Pounds 398,000, compared with profits of Pounds 4.93m
last time. Before the exceptional, profits would have been Pounds 883,000.
Lord Marsh, chairman, blamed the recession and the consequent decline in
trading activity for the downturn. He said the austere 1990s had left 'many
companies dressed in a very tight corset', adding that all of the group's
businesses had been adversely affected.
Turnover declined to Pounds 206.6m (Pounds 242.7m),leaving revenue down at
Pounds 58.7m (Pounds 73.6m). Trading profits were sharply reduced to Pounds
2.38m (Pounds 6.67m).
However, Lopex has largely eliminated its borrowings: in June 1990 they were
Pounds 24m.
Losses per share were 4.76p (earnings 9.17p) and shareholders will receive
no payment for the year (4p) with the passing of the final dividend (1.1p).
