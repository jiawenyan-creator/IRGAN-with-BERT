FT  06 DEC 94 / NatWest breaks ranks on Sundays
National Westminster Bank is planning to open several branches over the next
two Sundays to take advantage of the pre-Christmas shopping rush.
NatWest is thought to be the first of the UK's big four clearing banks to
break ranks and open branches in some main retailing centres on a Sunday.
About 20 branches in eight of the bank's 19 regions will be open from
10.30am to 3.30pm and are likely to offer a full counter service, enabling
customers to withdraw cash and check balances. The branches will be staffed
by volunteers.
The bank said it would consider in the light of the experiment whether to
extend the service throughout the year. Banking staff fear such a move by
NatWest would be the first step to seven-day working as its competitors
would almost certainly follow suit.
