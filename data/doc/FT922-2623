FT  16 JUN 92 / World News in Brief: Midnight blast off Regent Street
destroys car
An explosion in central London last night destroyed a Mercedes mini-cab but
no injuries were reported. Police were treating the blast - seconds before
midnight in St Alban's Street, between Regent Street and Haymarket - as the
work of the IRA.
Scotland Yard said the explosion was caused by a device similar to the 2lb
bomb used in Victoria Street, Westminster, last week.
Early today police said two men, one of them armed, hired the Mercedes and
forced its driver at gunpoint to cruise round the West End before ordering
him to stop. They ran off after telling him he had 15 minutes to get away.
The driver was believed to be raising the alarm when the bomb went off.
Police later carried out a controlled explosion on a suspect vehicle parked
in Haymarket but it proved to be a false alarm.
