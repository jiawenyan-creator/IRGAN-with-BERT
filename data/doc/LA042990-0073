CURRENT PAPERBACKS: STEINLEN'S CATS BY FRANCOIS FOSSIER (ABRAMS: $14.95) 
Although a relatively obscure figure today, Theophile-Alexandre Steinlen 
(1859-1923) was one of the most popular poster and graphic artists in belle 
eepoque Paris. 
He obviously adored cats, and depicted their every mood, capturing the gloss of 
a sleek coat, the extension of a stretch or the sensual luxury of a pose in a 
few sensitive lines or brush strokes. His realistic lithographs are 
exceptionally tactile, while the glowering, stylized feline on his famous 
poster for Rudolph Salis' Chat Noir cabaret must rank as the ultimate Halloween 
cat. An ideal gift for a cat lover.
