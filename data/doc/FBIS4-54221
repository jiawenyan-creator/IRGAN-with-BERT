  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
negotiation team, which arrived in Pyongyang on 24 May when the 
replacement of fuel rods was ongoing, began full-scale 
negotiations with relevant North Korean officials from 25 May. 
  During the negotiations on 25 May, the IAEA stressed that 
replacing fuel rods while not allowing inspection was a serious 
violation of the nuclear accord but North Korea only reconfirmed 
its previous stance that IAEA's demands cannot be accepted due 
to its special position of withholding the withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  According to a well-informed IAEA source, the negotiation 
will continue on 26 May even though there is no sign that the 
replacement of nuclear fuel rods may be suspended during the 
negotiations. 
  Relevant IAEA officials said that the IAEA inspection team 
completed its mission of inspecting North Korea's radiochemical 
laboratory but failed to extract samples from spent fuel rods of 
the five-megawatt reactor in question.
