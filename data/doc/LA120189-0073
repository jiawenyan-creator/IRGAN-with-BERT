WATER MAIN BREAK CAUSES CAVE-IN 
A water main break in San Francisco's Forest Hill neighborhood, just west of 
Twin Peaks, spilled thousands of gallons of water and caused a large street 
cave-in. "We lost a couple of hundred thousand gallons," estimated Marty 
Lieberman, manager of the San Francisco Water Department's distribution 
division. "We don't know what caused it. It could have been damaged in the 
(Oct. 17) earthquake. Who knows? But we've had other breaks in this area and 
don't know why." With water pouring down Laguna Honda Boulevard for more than 
two hours, auto, bus and underground trolley traffic was disrupted. The cave-in 
on Laguna Honda, where it meets Dewey Boulevard, stretched for about 150 feet 
and was about 25 feet wide at some spots. Municipal Railway underground trolley 
traffic through the Forest Hill station was stopped for a short time but then 
resumed officials reported.
