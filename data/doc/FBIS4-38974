<F P=106> ["Contradictions Must Be Settled at Elections, Telman </F>
Gdlyan, Cochairman of the People's Party of Russia, Believes" -- 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI headline] 
  [Text] There are a lot of people who doubt the possibility 
of maintaining civil peace in the country. I do not share these 
doubts. I am convinced that society is mature enough to 
understand the dangers which we have recently come up against. 
Now individual sections of this society will no longer opt for 
sharp confrontation, understanding that this is too dangerous 
and is liable to result in self-destruction. They must not 
cross this line. 
  Therefore, in my estimation, no matter how much our boat is 
tossed about, we will successfully get through the period until 
1995, and will settle our contradictions at the next 
parliamentary elections. I think that we will also live to see 
the next presidential elections. If we cross these two bridges, 
then we will smoothly cross over into a normal constitutional 
system of rule. 
  I believe that everyone who signed the Social Accord Treaty 
in Russia should strive for this. It should be understood that 
the treaty is not a code which contains sharp restrictions, it 
does not demand things from its participants which should not be 
demanded -- such as giving up ideological and political 
convictions. Ideological and political differences will 
undoubtedly remain, but this document contains a main, pivotal 
thing: Agreement not to resort to violence in the political 
struggle under any circumstances. And that is the main thing 
that should unite society.
