FT  31 MAR 94 / Lithuania fixes exchange rate
Lithuania decided yesterday to peg its litas currency to the US dollar in an
attempt to attract more foreign investment and pave the way for full
convertibility, a government spokesman said. The litas was set at four to
the dollar from April 1, a compromise between exporters who wanted a lower
rate of around 4.2 and economists who preferred 3.8-3.9. Lithuania is the
second of the three Baltic republics to fix its exchange rate. Estonia has
pegged its kroon at eight to the D-Mark since it was introduced in 1992.
Lithuanian currency trading has been in turmoil since parliament voted on
March 17 to link the litas to either the dollar or the D-Mark. The daily
Respublika newspaper said the authorities had sold Dollars 10m in the past
week to defend the litas. Commercial bankers were critical of the decision
to tie the litas, saying it was unnecessary and would disrupt the currency's
stability. The prime minister, Mr Adolfas Slezevicius, defended the move on
television, saying it would enable foreign investors to forecast accurately
the exchange rates they would be dealing with.
