  [Text] Members of the Jerusalem Committee headed by Faysal 
al-Husayni decided tonight to set up another follow-up committee 
headed by al-Husayni to watch carefully developments on 
Jerusalem. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the 
committee members demanded the immediate lifting of the closure, 
which cuts the city off from the territories. They blamed 
Israel with attempting to decide the status of Jerusalem 
unilaterally at this stage of the process.
