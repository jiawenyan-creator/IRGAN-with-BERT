THE GRAFFITI MESSAGE 
How ridiculous can politicians get? The City Council -- at the instigation of 
Joel Wachs -- proposes to collect an initial fee (euphemism for tax) of 50 
cents per month to clean up graffiti. 
Of course this will be added to DWP bills along with a number of other non-DWP 
charges, hopefully to escape the attention of taxpayers. 
This is clearly sending the wrong message to the vandals. 
We are saying: "It's all right to create graffiti and we are willing to pay 
additional tax to clean up after you." The City Council is confident the tax 
will go unnoticed. 
Is that the message we should be sending? 
Why not attack the problem at its source? Have a special police group organized 
to deal with it. 
Have the vandals, as they are caught, clean not only their own mess but also 
some of the residual mess. 
Their residence until the job is completed: Jail. 
A tax -- hopefully not disguised as a DWP fee -- would be appropriate for such 
an effort.
