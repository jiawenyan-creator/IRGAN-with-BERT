FT  23 JUN 94 / Four vie for docks project
The London Docklands Development Corporation has shortlisted four developers
to submit proposals for a Pounds 100m exhibition centre in the Royal Docks.
The London International Exhibition Centre; Earls Court and Olympia; SAIR
(Studi di Architettura &amp; Ingegneria Ruiniti); and Collective Development
Consortium International are due to submit detailed design and financial
proposals by the end of September.
A study for the development corporation concluded that the Royal Victoria
Dock site had potential to accommodate about 100,000 sq m of exhibition
space, with adjacent conference and hotel facilities.
The corporation may invest its land in return for an equity share in the
project.
It said it intended to announce the successful bidder before the end of the
year. Work is expected to start on the site late next year, and the first
phase of the exhibition centre could open by 1998.
