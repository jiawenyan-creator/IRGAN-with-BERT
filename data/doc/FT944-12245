FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: RJ Kiln sets up 'employee trust'
R J Kiln, the Lloyd's agency, has taken the unusual step of setting up an
'employee trust' to own all the shares in the company on behalf of its
workers, writes Raplh Atkins.
Mr Colin Murray, chairman, said the company believed it was the first in the
City to make such a move.
The aim was 'to ensure that all those responsible for the future success of
the company should benefit from their efforts'.
Those participating in the trust will be allocated a share of profit
commissions earned during the time they are employed by the company and
possibly for a limited number of years after their retirement.
Kiln, which employs about 300 people, manages nine syndicates in the Lloyd's
of London insurance market.
Existing shareholders - mainly current or retired employees and their
families - have been offered renumeration in the form of loan stock plus a
coupon and an agreed share of profits over the next three years.
