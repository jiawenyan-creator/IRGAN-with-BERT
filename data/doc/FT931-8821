FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Asylum bill deal averts defeat
MINISTERS staved off defeat in the Lords yesterday over its proposed changes
to asylum law, with a modest last-minute concession which they said would
introduce a further safeguard into the system, Alison Smith writes.
Lord Ferrers, the Home Office minister, promised that - at all the larger
British embassies and consulates dealing with immigration applications - a
new scheme would ensure that a senior manager would review at the end of
each day all refusals by entry clearance officers. Where a decision was
reversed a visa would be issued.
Peers voted 148-124 against a move to streamline the right of appeal by
introducing a role for an adjudicator who would decide whether someone
should have leave to appeal.
