SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS HEAD INTO BREAK PONDERING MOVES 
Coach Ron Newman said there is a good chance the struggling Sockers will make a 
trade sometime between the Major Indoor Soccer League's owners meetings Monday 
and Tuesday and the league's all-star game on Wednesday. Both the meetings and 
the game will be held in San Diego. 
Newman and Socker President Ron Cady said a number of players are being 
considered, including Tacoma midfielder David Hoggan. Cady, however, said a 
Hoggan trade is unlikely from a public relations standpoint. Hoggan, who 
head-butted former Socker Hugo Perez two seasons ago, causing Perez to lose a 
tooth, was given a 30-day suspension by Star Coach Keith Weller earlier this 
week for leaving the team during a game. 
"That's not the kind of attitude we condone," Cady said. "I'd be greatly 
surprised if he's here by the end of (the all-star week)." 
According to Socker Owner Ron Fowler, the team will consider trading forward 
Damir Haramina, who hasn't suited up for nine consecutive games. 
"I think Damir is available if the right deal could be made," Fowler said. "He 
hasn't demonstrated the intensity that we would like to see. At this point in 
the season, with our record, you run out of patience." DON PATTERSON
