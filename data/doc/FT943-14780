FT  13 JUL 94 / More schools reported to be doing simplified tests
Government measures to simplify the compulsory testing of schoolchildren
appear to have been successful in raising the number of schools taking the
tests, according to figures released yesterday by the Department for
Education.
The National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, has claimed that
fewer than 10 per cent of schools took part in the tests.
Early figures from the Schools Curriculum and Testing Authority, the quango
in charge of testing in England and Wales, show that about a third of
secondary schools took the science and maths tests for 14-year-olds. Just 23
per cent of schools set the English test, which has been at the centre of
controversy over its content and evaluation.
Last year 2 per cent of secondary schools took part following a boycott by
the three largest teaching unions over the workload.
More than half of primary schools took part in testing seven-year-olds this
year compared with 18 per cent last year.
And most ordered the prototype tests for 11-year-olds due to be introduced
next year. The department said that there had been 'a high level of
participation' in the pilot tests.
The NUT, which boycotted the tests for the second year running, said that
the figures did not show how many pupils had sat all three tests or what
proportion of the results had been reported to the government.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary, said: 'I stand by my claim that very few
schools - primary or secondary - will have reported test results to the
government in full.'
School organisation and career structures should be changed to allow
teachers more time to teach, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers has
told the teachers' pay and conditions review body.
The union said that education reforms had increased the administrative
burden on classroom teachers and suggested that schools should band together
and employ more administrative staff.
