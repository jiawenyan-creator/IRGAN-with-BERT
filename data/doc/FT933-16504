FT  03 JUL 93 / Haiti junta accepts Aristide deal
Haiti's military leaders yesterday accepted a UN proposal to restore ousted
president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN
Correspondent, in New York.
Father Aristide did not respond immediately but last night appeared likely
to agree. The exiled president had refused to enter direct talks with
General Raoul Cedras, the junta leader, but was being pressed to meet him
face to face to conclude the pact.
Negotiations have been going on all week at a high security US military base
on an island in New York harbour, with Mr Dante Caputo, a former Argentine
foreign minister, mediating on behalf of the UN and the Organisation of
American States.
Under his plan the UN would retrain the Haitian police who have been accused
of murder, torture and other atrocities in a long reign of repression. An
earlier idea to send 500 UN troops to the country to oversee the return of
democracy was apparently abandoned.
