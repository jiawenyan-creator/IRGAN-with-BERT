FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Champagne lifts Remy Cointreau
turnover
Remy Cointreau, the French drinks group, yesterday invigorated the
international drinks industry with a 24 per cent increase in net profits for
the six months to September 30 to FFr129m (Dollars 21.8m) from FFr103.8m.
Despite slower growth in the third quarter - due mainly to tax changes in
China - turnover for the nine months to December was up 6.2 per cent to
FFr4.67bn, led by a 9.1 per cent rise in champagne sales.
Mr Marc Heriard Dubreuil, joint managing director, said: 'We are optimistic
that full-year results will show an improvement on the previous year. The
last quarter generally benefits from the impact of sales in south-east Asian
markets, particularly over the Chinese new year.'
First-half operating profits rose to FFr357.7m from FFr327.7m on sales 12
per cent ahead at FFr2.68bn.
Growth was achieved in all sectors of the business. Sales of champagne -
Piper Heidseck, Charles Heidseck and Krug - for the first nine months
totalled FFr556.7m, against FFr510.3m, with a 30 per cent increase in
exports to the UK leading a worldwide recovery.
Prices were maintained and margins would improve as the effects of cheaper
grapes worked through over the next few years, said Mr Dubreuil.
Cognac sales to end-December rose 5 per cent to FFr1.93bn, despite a
temporary lull in shipments to China after tax changes in December.
With growth in most leading markets, Remy has increased its market share to
19 per cent and overtaken Martell as number two in the cognac sector.
Liqueurs and spirits turnover increased by 5.4 per cent to FFr1.3bn. Sales
of Cointreau rose after a 10-year decline.
The alliance with Highland Distilleries, the Scotch whisky group, continued
to prosper. Overall, whisky sales were 24 per cent ahead and Remy now
handles more than half of Famous Grouse exports.
