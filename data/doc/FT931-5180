FT  08 MAR 93 / NY bomb site probe must wait
NEW YORK police and FBI say it could be another week before thorough
investigation of the bomb crater under the World Trade Centre complex is
possible, because of structural repairs required, Nikki Tait writes from New
York.
Yesterday, however, there were indications that the site where a sixth
victim of the blast might have been killed, had been found.
