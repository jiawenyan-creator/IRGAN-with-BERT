 The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1994, Public Law 103418, provides for a COLA
for each of the rates in sections 1114, 1115(1), 1162, 1311, 1313, and 1314 of title 38, United States Code, that were
increased by the amendments made by the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1993, Public Law

increased rates are also required to be published in the 

Federal Register
