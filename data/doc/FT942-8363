FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Eastern plans low-cost take-off
Eastern Airlines, the defunct US airline, hopes to emerge from bankruptcy as
a low-cost carrier similar to Southwest Airlines, according to the
court-appointed trustee for the company.
Mr Martin Shugrue, who wants to re-start the airline as an alternative to
pressing ahead with its liquidation, told a conference in Las Vegas the
airline would aim to penetrate carefully-selected US markets which were
either overpriced or under served.
Mr Shugrue said the airline would fly from three main cities - Atlanta,
Indianapolis and Philadelphia - to destinations initially including Boston,
Orlando, Miami, Tampa and Detroit.
He said the airline hoped to begin operations in October next year with an
initial fleet of 14 McDonnell Douglas DC9s making 78 trips a day between the
eight cities.
Eastern Airlines, once one of the best known names in US aviation, went into
bankruptcy in March 1989 amid a bitter power struggle between its unions and
its then chairman, Mr Frank Lorenzo.
It was grounded in January 1991.
Mr Shugrue, a former vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Pan
American World Airways, announced last month he wanted to get the airline
flying again. He said Eastern's creditors would get more money back through
a re-start than they would through a liquidation.
Mr Shugrue told the Las Vegas conference the plan had the approval of the
bankruptcy court, but could only go forward if he could raise sufficient
capital to begin services and see off any competition An initial
capitalisation of Dollars 100m would provide that cushion, he said.
