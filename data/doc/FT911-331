FT  13 MAY 91 / Managers cautious on US equities
BRITISH institutional fund managers remain optimistic about the prospects
for UK and Japanese equities, but are becoming noticeably more cautious
about US stocks, a Gallup survey revealed yesterday.
A monthly poll of institutional investors produced by Gallup for the
securities group, Smith New Court, also found that fund managers intend to
increase their weighting in UK property and run down their holdings of cash.
It is widely believed that the British economy will improve over the next
year, with only 4 per cent expecting it to deteriorate further.
Base rates are forecast on average to fall to 10.3 per cent in a year's
time.
Investors are enthusiastic about the outlook for global equities over the
next year, with the FT-SE 100 index expected to rise from 2523 at the time
of polling last week, to a mean 2747, the Dow Jones Average from 2939 to
3113, and the Nikkei index from 26,478 to 29,064.
However, in the short term, investors appear to be taking a more cautious
view of the equity markets.
Bulls of the UK market over the next three months outnumbered bears by only
3 per cent. A balance of 22 per cent was bearish about the US market and 12
per cent more were bearish about the continental European markets.
The May survey covered 92 institutions handling funds totalling Pounds
380bn.
