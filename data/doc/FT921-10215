FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Imasco's earnings soar 60%
IMASCO, the financial services, fast-food, tobacco and retailing group,
posted a sharp increase in profits in the final quarter of 1991.
It lifted net profits to CDollars 94.4m (USDollars 81.3m), or 74 cents a
share, an advance of 60 per cent on the CDollars 59m, or 44 cents, recorded
a year earlier. Revenues rose 2 per cent to CDollars 1.38bn.
The company is 40 per cent controlled by BAT Industries, the UK-based
tobacco group.
For the year, Imasco earned CDollars 331.6m, or Dollars 2.56, up 12 per cent
from CDollars 295.1m, or Dollars 2.25, in 1990. Revenues were CDollars
5.4bn, a rise of 4 per cent.
On a consolidated basis, tobacco products provided 45 per cent of operating
earnings, financial services 37 per cent, retailing 13 per cent and fast
food 5 per cent.
Imasco said the tobacco business had been strong in spite of a sharp
increase in taxes. Share of the domestic cigarette market was up 2 per cent
to 62 per cent.
In spite of bigger loan loss provisions, earnings at Imasco's Canada Trust
arm, where a recent US acquisition made a contribution, were up 4 per cent
to CDollars 209.5m.
The recession hit the US fast-food business, but Imasco hopes new leadership
will reverse the downward trend in earnings.
