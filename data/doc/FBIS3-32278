  [Text] President Fidel Castro last night attended the 
farewell reception held for Beatriz Paredes Rangel, Mexican 
ambassador to Cuba, with whom Castro talked at length. Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina and other government leaders, 
representatives of the different sectors of the national life, 
and the diplomatic corps accredited in Cuba also attended the 
reception. 
  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has designated 
Ambassador Paredes, a distinguished Mexican political figure, 
chairman of the National Commission for Development and Justice 
for the Indian Populations of Mexico [Comision Nacional de 
Desarrollo y Justicia de los Pueblos Indigenas de Mexico]. 
  While serving as ambassador to Cuba, Paredes did outstanding 
work toward optimal development of the relations between the two 
countries, which has won her the respect and esteem of the 
authorities and the population of Cuba. 
  In the name of her government, the diplomat yesterday 
afternoon donated to Casa de las Americas 115 works of folk art 
from the various Mexican states, and she reiterated to the 
Cubans that Mexico has never, nor will it ever, abandon them.
