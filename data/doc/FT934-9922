FT  08 NOV 93 / Brazilian minister denies tax allegation
BRAZIL'S finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso last night strongly
denied allegations published in a weekly news magazine that he might have
avoided tax on the purchase of a farm.
However, the allegations threaten to add to the state of political paralysis
in the country, brought about by corruption hearings under way which involve
several leading politicians.
The magazine, Isto E, published documents which it said showed the farm was
greatly undervalued on official records, thereby subject to lower tax bills.
The minister denied all the magazine's charges and said in some cases it had
published false information for political reasons. Mr Cardoso is already
under fire from opponents because of his assumed ambitions in next year's
presidential elections.
The farm was bought in 1989, before Mr Cardoso became finance minister
earlier this year, and the amounts of money involved were small. Mr Cardoso
has been a vocal critic of Brazil's widespread tax avoidance. According to
some estimates, only half the country's eligible tax payers contribute, and
this is partly to blame for the government's budget deficit, likely to reach
Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.5bn) next year.
Despite Mr Cardoso's vehement denials, the allegations are likely to damage
his reputation and hinder the work of the finance ministry.
He and his team are preparing new privatisation measures as well as trying
to get enough political support in Congress for fiscal reforms as part of a
constitutional revision under way.
The revision has already been seriously held up by separate corruption
hearings.
