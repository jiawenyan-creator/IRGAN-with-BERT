FT  08 MAY 91 / Letter: Short-term tax
Sir, I agree entirely with Mr Allen Sykes' analysis (Letters, May 3) of the
role of institutional shareholders in corporate governance. However, he
makes no recommendations, other than more discussions.
By their very nature, such shareholders will never willingly give up their
present freedom to make quick profits. There is only one solution to put new
life into British industry. Capital gains should be subject to penal rates
of tax if they arise from shares held for a short time, and to very low
rates if held for a long time. There is no other way of making institutions
support companies planning for long-term rather than short-term profits.
The City will not like it, but the health of our industry is more important
by far than merchant bankers', unit trust holders' or even life policy
holders' short-term profits.
