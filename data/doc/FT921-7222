FT  24 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Decision on Chelsea ground likely this week
THIS WEEK looks like being a crucial one for Cabra Estates, the property
company which owns Stamford Bridge, home of Chelsea football club, writes
Jane Fuller.
Tomorrow, SB Property, which is 83.5 per cent owned by Cabra, will seek a
High Court injunction to force Chelsea to pay Pounds 22.85m for the ground.
The price was set by an independent valuer last November and it relates to
Chelsea's 1988 exercising of an option to buy.
A case involving a counter-claim for damages from Chelsea, which Cabra has
applied to the court to strike out, may also be heard.
Chelsea, which is chaired by Mr Ken Bates, is taking other legal action. It
wants to buy Stamford Bridge, but Mr Bates has yet to give any details about
finance.
Mr John Duggan, Cabra's chairman, said the aim was to get Chelsea to
complete the contract. If it did not, action would be taken against it.
Eviction of the first division club is one possibility.
Cabra, which last year lost Pounds 11.3m pre-tax and had year-end debt of
Pounds 52m, has delayed the publication of its interim results for more than
two months because of the uncertainty over Stamford Bridge.
The figures for the six months to September 30 are due to come out on
Thursday. In the first half of 1990-91, the company lost Pounds 5.24m.
Its share price has fallen to 7p from nearly 120p in mid-1989, when Mr
Duggan became chairman after the takeover of Marler Estates which brought in
both Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, Fulham football club's ground.
This month has seen further buying of Cabra shares by Mr Ashraf Marwan, an
Egyptian financier, who now owns about 27 per cent.
