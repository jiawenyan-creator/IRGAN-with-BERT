FT  23 JAN 92 / Ulster talks no nearer resuming
NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders failed yesterday to agree a time and
venue for a 'round-table' meeting to discuss how obstacles to formal
negotiations on the province's future could be overcome, Ralph Atkins
writes.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, was engaged in careful
diplomacy to arrange the meeting in order to revive his attempts to resume
formal negotiations which ended last July.
Three out of the four leaders gave Mr Brooke positive indications that they
would take part after he wrote to them late on Tuesday. The exception was
Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party.
Mr Brooke's original hope of a meeting of political leaders today has been
abandoned. His invitation appeared designed to increase the pressure on
political leaders to come to the negotiating table in spite of the proximity
of the general election.
Ministers believe that, although there are technical agreements to be
resolved, the biggest obstacle is a show of political will by the
participants.
