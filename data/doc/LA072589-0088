VALLEY EARNINGS: TEKELEC QUARTERLY EARNINGS DROP 57%; REVENUE UP 
Tekelec, a Calabasas maker of equipment used in testing telecommunications 
products, said its second-quarter earnings tumbled 57% from a year earlier 
despite a 12% increase in revenue. 
Tekelec's net income for the three months that ended June 30 dropped to 
$563,000 from $1.3 million a year ago, but its revenue climbed to $8.25 million 
from $7.40 million. For the first half of this year, Tekelec's profit fell 25% 
to $1.81 million from $2.40 million, and its six-month revenue rose 23% to 
$17.4 million from $14.1 million. 
Tekelec blamed the reduced earnings on higher costs and less than expected 
growth in revenue. The costs were associated with the introduction of a 
product, and higher engineering and customer service expenses.
