FT  17 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Bad news from the factory gate
FT-SE Index: 2,519.5 (-23.3)
Yesterday's figures on UK producer prices are perhaps the clearest
indication yet of why UK interest rates are unlikely to fall further in the
immediate future. The March headline figure for manufacturers' output price
inflation of 6.3 per cent - unchanged from the two preceding months - is
plainly at odds with the latest signals on price expectations from the
Confederation of British Industry. But in relation to input prices
especially, the trend is unmistakeable. Throughout 1988 and 1989, the
monthly index number for output prices averaged 1.15 times that for input
prices. It has been rising steadily ever since, and now stands at 1.29
times.
This does not imply any widening of profit margins, since it leaves out of
account the simultaneous acceleration in average earnings. The point is
rather that, despite recession and strong sterling, UK manufacturers seem
broadly to have been able to maintain a cost-plus pricing regime. This also
leaves out of account the fact that the inflationary effect of excess demand
in the late 1980s was mainly seen not in manufacturing but in the service
industries, where the effect is harder to measure. The whole picture remains
hard to reconcile with the tales of distress from the corporate sector. The
government can be forgiven for treading the middle path just the same.
