FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce Power sells Victor
Rolls-Royce Power Engineering is selling Victor Products, its specialist
lighting subsidiary, through a Pounds 10m management buy-in backed by 3i,
the venture capital group.
Mr Keith Jordan, a former divisional managing director at GEC, will take
over as chief executive of the engineering company.
Victor Products, which was a listed company until February 1988, is raising
Pounds 6m through equity finance and Pounds 6m through bank debt, to cover
the costs of the purchase and build up working capital.
The new management will own 20 per cent of the equity, and the remainder has
been underwritten by 3i, which is likely to bring in two other venture
capital groups.
Victor Products is based in north-east England and manufactures hazardous
area lighting, primarily for the mining and oil and gas industries.
Its reliance on the mining industry has been heavily reduced since the
1980's, although British Coal remains a sizeable customer. It has also
developed subsidiaries in South Africa and the US.
Mr Jordan plans to introduce new lighting products and expand the company's
export markets, which currently account for only 10 per cent of domestic
production.
Victor Products has had a turbulent recent history. It was bought out for
Pounds 13.8m by Northern Engineering Industries in January 1988 and a year
later, its parent company was taken over by Rolls-Royce.
