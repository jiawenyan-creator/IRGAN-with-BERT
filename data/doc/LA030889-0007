THE WORLD 
Nearly 20,000 Israeli militants, led by armed settlers from the occupied West 
Bank, demonstrated in Tel Aviv in favor of renewed Jewish settlement in the 
occupied territories. Amid the regular evening traffic jams, protesters drove 
three flatbed trucks carrying prefabricated houses that they said would be the 
nucleus of a new settlement near the Arab West Bank town of Ramallah. However, 
organizers said settlement will begin only when official authorization is 
received -- before the end of the week, they hope.
