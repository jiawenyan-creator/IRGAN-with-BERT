FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian partners sign Dollars
765m copper mine deal
BRAZIL'S SALOBO mining site should be producing 150,000 tonnes of copper and
eight tonnes of gold a year beginning in 1998, according to projections by
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, one of the partners in a joint venture accord to
exploit the site that was signed yesterday.
CVRD, Brazil's state-controlled mining concern, and holder of Salobo's
mineral rights, will team up with Morro Velho, a leading Brazilian gold
mining company that is half-owned by Anglo American. The two companies will
control equal shares of the Salobo venture.
The copper deposit is estimated at 1.2bn tonnes of ore. It is located in the
Carajas region, in the state of Para, in the Amazon. Development costs are
estimated at Dollars 765m. Initial engineering studies will begin
immediately and should be completed in 18 months. Overall investment
requirements are relatively modest because the site can rely on much of the
infrastructure already in place for CVRD's nearby iron ore operations.
The scheme will include an on-site plant to transform the mineral into metal
 -because of its special composition, the Salobo copper concentrate would
have a limited market.
Morro Velho's capacity and willingness to tackle an integrated project
weighed heavily in CVRD's decision to choose the company from a list of
potential partners, said Mr Helio Blak, CVRD superintendent for development.
