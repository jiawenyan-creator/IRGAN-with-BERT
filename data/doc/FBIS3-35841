  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 31, BNS -- Alexander Gusev, an adviser 
to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, visited on Jan. 
27 the fuel terminals the Russian Army owns in Estonia. 
  The delegation he led met with representatives of the 
Scantrans and the Lukoil ES companies and toured the terminals 
situated in Viimsi on the outskirts of the Estonian capital and 
on Kopli Peninsula. 
  A specialist at Scantrans, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, confirmed in an interview with BNS that a delegation 
visited Estonia; he couldn't say, however, who its members were. 
  The Russian fuel terminals will probably be handed over to 
Estonia before May and placed under the Defense Ministry, the 
Scantrans specialist said. Handover deadlines, however, are 
pending negotiations, he added. 
  The Scantrans official dismissed speculations that one of 
the 
aims of the delegation's visit to Estonia was to determine the 
companies to which Russia is prepared to sell the terminals. 
  The underground terminal in Viimsi has a capacity of about 
47,000 cubic meters, and the capacity of the overground terminal 
is 20,000 cubic meters.
