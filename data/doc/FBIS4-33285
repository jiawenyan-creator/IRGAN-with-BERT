  [Text] The generation of electricity will include a deficit 
of 415 megawatts next week. This figure is consistent and does 
not alter the normal rationing program, as happened in the phase 
ending 3 June. This means in layman's terms that there may be 
fewer blackouts nationwide, barring unforeseen circumstances. 
The Electric Union has also reported that this is an acceptable 
balance given the current situation in the country, adding that 
maintenance work scheduled for thermoelectric centrals at the 
national level continues at a positive pace. A unit of the 
Carlos Manuel Cespedes Central, in Cienfuegos, will soon undergo 
minor maintenance work. This will not affect the average daily 
generation of 1,420 megawatts significantly. It has been 
officially reported that if this pace of repair and maintenance 
in the country's plants continues, a 60-percent generation level 
will be achieved by December.
