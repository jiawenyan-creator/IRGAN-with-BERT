FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage buying lifts
Nikkei for fifth day in a row
Arbitrage buying pushed share prices higher for the fifth consecutive
trading day, as the rise of the Nikkei index above a technical resistance
level cheered investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 136.13 to 19,406.98, having fluctuated between
19,193.64 and 19,417.88. Having lost ground in the morning on profit-taking,
futures purchasing in the afternoon prompted index-linked buying, and the
Nikkei's rise above 19,340, considered by traders as an important resistance
level, prompted short-covering.
Volume was 250m shares, against 254m. 'Most of the trading is still
arbitrage linked, but some foreign investors are buying to cover their short
positions ahead of the year-end,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
Institutional investors remained absent ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting in
the US.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 10.59 to 1,524.90, while
the Nikkei 300 moved up 1.79 to 281.76. Advances led declines by 724 to 265,
with 192 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 0.59 at
1,272.74.
Overseas investors bought financials: Industrial Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank rose Y30 apiece to Y2,830 and Y1,880 respectively. Brokers were
also higher, with Nomura Securities adding Y30 at Y2,030.
Reports of the popularity of new 32-bit electronic games lifted Sony Y50 to
Y5,550. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker which has also recently
introduced its new game hardware, climbed Y110 to Y5,750. But some
high-technology issues lost ground on profit-taking: Fujitsu fell Y7 to
Y970.
Steel issues rallied on bargain hunting, having been sold off by overseas
investors. NKK put on Y5 at Y274 and Nippon Steel Y3 at Y362.
Sakai Ovex, a synthetic fabrics manufacturer, lost Y6 at Y657 after
fluctuating in speculative trading.
Privatisation stocks were higher, with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone up
Y5,000 to Y844,000. Investors were encouraged by reports that the government
had approved NTT's plan to lift basic subscription charges and directory
assistance rates from February next year.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 118.91 to 21,045.85 in volume of 106.9m
shares.
Roundup
The region was mixed, with many investors awaiting the outcome of
yesterday's US FOMC meeting.
HONG KONG reversed an early 99-point loss but trading was relatively thin
ahead of the US rates decision. The Hang Seng index ended 88.99 ahead at
8,267.33, in turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn, down from Monday's HKDollars
2.8bn.
Brokers said that the late rally was fuelled by buy orders from Europe for
Hang Seng index constituents.
Overall market sentiment remained bearish and activity was subdued as many
foreign fund managers had already closed their books for the year.

and Hang Seng Bank added HKDollars 1.50 each at HKDollars 83.75 and
HKDollars 57. Bank of East Asia surged HKDollars 1.55 to HKDollars 30.80 on

SEOUL remained worried about liquidity and the composite index dipped 4.63
to 1,023.99, a sixth consecutive decline.

cash deposit requirements for institutional investors failed to boost blue

and Samsung Electronics fell Won1,900 to Won107,000.

institutional buying of Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia. The composite
