  [Excerpt] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said 
Israel would have to analyze very carefully all the information 
which he had just received from the head of the U.S. peace team, 
Dennis Ross, about the Clinton-al-Asad summit. Peres made it 
clear that not all his doubts about al-Asad's intentions had 
been dispelled, and Israel would have to investigate the 
significance of al-Asad's public statements in direct 
negotiations with Syria. Nevertheless, Peres agreed with Ross 
and with President Clinton that there are grounds for 
encouragement in al-Asad's statement. 
  [Peres] Basically, we are very glad that the negotiations 
with the Syrians will be renewed on the level of the head of the 
missions by the end of the month, and that there is a feeling of 
a more promising air that was created in the meeting between the 
President of the United States and the president of Syria.
