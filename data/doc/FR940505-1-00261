 For all sources subject to the FIP cap reduction requirements, all information required as part of the facility's
Title V operating permit. For sources not subject to Title V, sources shall submit all information which would be required
for sources subject to Title V.

This information shall include, for example, test or demonstration methods used to demonstrate achievement of the
VOC emissions reductions required in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(B)

 of this section. The methods may include but are not limited to:
(1) the test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and
(2) data and engineering calculations approved by EPA documenting process modifications that were made to reduce
VOC emissions.

(B) Beginning January 1, 2001, each owner or operator of a facility which is subject to the limitations of this paragraph,
as described under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section, shall limit actual monthly emissions of VOC from
the subject facility to the level calculated by the following equations:

The range 0.04 to 0.09 reflects the 4% to 9% cumulative annual rate of emission reductions currently under consideration.
In the first year, emissions would be reduced by 4% to 9% off of baseline levels; in the second year, emissions would
be reduced by 8% to 18% off of baseline levels, and so on until the minimum 20% VOC reduction is made. As discussed in the
preamble to the regulations this range of annual reductions is based on EPA's preliminary rate of reduction analysis
and may change as the analysis continues prior to final promulgation of this FIP. In addition, EPA plans to review this
value every three years after final rule promulgation.
