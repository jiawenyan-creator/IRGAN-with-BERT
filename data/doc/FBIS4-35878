  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says Saudi 
Arabia is obstructing the peace process. He told reporters in 
Jerusalem the Saudis had broken their promise to lift the Arab 
boycott and had taken a negative position at the arms control 
talks. On other issues, Peres said Israel insists that the 
Palestinian autonomy institutions be in Jericho, not Jerusalem, 
and he hoped Israel relations with Italy would remain cordial in 
spite of the appointment of three neofascists to the new Italian 
Government. Jack Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Peres was 
speaking to reporters after a meeting with the visiting 
Philippines Foreign Minister Roberto Romulo. Peres was asked if 
it is true that Saudi Arabia is obstructing the peace process. 
  [Peres] Yes, there are disappointments in our country about 
the Saudis' position on two or three issues. 
  [Katzenell] At the beginning of the peace process, Peres 
said, Saudi representatives promised Jewish audiences in the 
United States that if Israel changed its settlement policy, the 
Arabs, including Saudi Arabia, would lift the economic boycott 
against Israel. 
  [Peres] We did our part. I do not think it was reciprocated. 
  [Katzenell] In addition, Peres said, the Saudis adopted a 
negative attitude at the recent multilateral talks on arms 
control in Qatar. [passage omitted] 
  [Katzenell] Turning to the problem of the three neofascist 
ministers in the new Italian Government, a Foreign Ministry 
official told me this morning that Israel is not even 
considering the recall of its ambassador. Foreign Minister 
Peres admitted that the neofascists do pose a problem, but 
Israel would do nothing hasty. He would be meeting the new 
Foreign Minister Antonio Martinio and would listen to what he 
had to say sympathetically. [end recording]
