'JAPAN SEEKS WORLD INFLUENCE' 
So Japan has told the U.S. that it wants a greater say in global political and 
economic affairs. Well, isn't that special? 
I hope President Bush lets them know quite clearly that we will be willing to 
share a more equal role with them when they are willing to take a more equal 
role in the tasks and costs of defending the Pacific. When they do, I'll be 
glad to see us engage in power-sharing!
