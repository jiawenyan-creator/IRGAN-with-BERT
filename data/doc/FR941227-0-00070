nuclear power plant 

means any nuclear 
power reactor that is used predominantly in the trade or 
business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy, if 
the rates for the furnishing or sale, as the case may be, 
either have been established or approved by a public utility 
commission or are under the jurisdiction of the Rural

reactor) located on a multi-unit site is a separate nuclear 
power plant. The term 

nuclear power plant

 also includes 
the portion of the common facilities of a multi-unit site 
allocable to a unit on that site.
