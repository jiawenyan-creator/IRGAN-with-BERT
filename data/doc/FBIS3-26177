  [Text] Beijing, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government firmly opposes any form of official contact between 
Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China, 
said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman here today. 
  Wu Jianmin, the spokesman, reiterated the official stand of 
the Chinese Government at a weekly press conference here this 
afternoon. 
  When asked to comment on a report that the Taiwan 
authorities 
have sent officials on a secret visit to Hong Kong and Macao to 
hold consultations with the Hong Kong and Macao Governments on 
matters concerning air services, he said that air routes between 
Taiwan and Hong Kong and between Taiwan and Macao are those 
between three places with China's territory. 
  Prior to 1997 and 1999, Britain and Portugal are responsible 
for the administration of Hong Kong and Macao respectively, Wu 
said. 
  During the transitional period, he added, if an airliner of 
Hong Kong or Macao wishes to enter into a non-governmental 
arrangement straddling 1997 or 1999 with an airliner of Taiwan 
on air services between them, the British side or the Portuguese 
side should consult the Chinese Government in advance.
