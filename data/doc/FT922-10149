FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): New BES offered
The 1992-93 tax year is but a month old and already there is a new Business
Expansion Scheme. Johnson Fry is offering a 'buy-back' offer in conjunction
with Mortgage Express, TSB's central lender which withdrew from the market
for new business last year. The BES company - called the Johnson Fry
Mortgage Express Super Growth Scheme - will buy property from Mortgage
Express. TSB has covenanted to buy it back in five years, should Mortgage
Express fail to do so, at a price equivalent to Pounds 1.15 for every Pounds
1.00 share. The company says it is launching now to avoid possible falls in
interest rates.
