FT  17 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Foreign brokers offered
Singapore seats
THE Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) yesterday offered seats to seven
foreign securities companies, allowing them to trade directly in the market
under the new category of 'international members'.
Membership will cost the foreign brokers SDollars 8.2m (USDollars 4.9m).
They will be allowed to undertake deals of any size for foreign clients, and
deals of at least SDollars 5m for local customers.
The seven, chosen from 11 applicants, are Baring Securities, Credit Lyonnais
Securities, Daiwa, Nikko Merchant Bank, Nomura, Smith New Court Securities
and Yamaichi Merchant Bank.
'These seven foreign securities companies were selected on the basis of
their contributions to the development of the Singapore securities market,'
the SES said. 'The exchange also believes that these companies have the
resources and are in a position to continue to contribute to the development
of Singapore as a regional securities trading centre.'
Singapore's plan to admit 100 per cent foreign members was announced in
October 1990, and brokers have been waiting impatiently for yesterday's
announcement.
Previously, foreign brokers could deal either as part of a joint venture in
which they were allowed a maximum 49 per cent stake, or by working through a
local broker and sharing commissions.
The SES, which is trying to attract more foreign institutional business,
said it would take 'all necessary measures' to achieve its objective of
promoting Singapore as the centre for trading regional securities.
