FT  11 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Effect on actuaries' valuations of
dividend limits 'broadly neutral'
Sir, Lex ('UK savings', April 25) considers the effect of a reduction in
dividend payouts on actuaries' valuations of pension funds.
Actuaries' valuations reflect both the current dividend income and
anticipated future increases in that income. If current dividends were
lower, the higher earnings retained by companies would be expected to
produce higher earnings in future years, and in turn higher dividend growth.
The overall effect on actuaries' valuations of pension funds should be
broadly neutral.
So fears that any restriction of dividends might cause an increase in
companies' pension fund contributions and therefore a reduction in the
government's tax take should prove groundless.
The effect of the change in the tax treatment of dividends introduced by the
Finance Act 1993 was different. The reduction in the income received by
pension funds went to the Exchequer. As a result, actuaries did indeed place
a lower value on the assets of pension funds, in many cases causing an
increase in companies' pension fund contributions.
