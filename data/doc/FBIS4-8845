  [Text] Sarajevo, April 18 (AFP) -- Serb forces pounded 
away at Gorazde Monday, ignoring their latest ceasefire 
announcement, the Red Cross and UN officials said. 
  The UN peacekeeping force here reported tank, artillery and 
sniper fire on the mainly Moslem town in eastern Bosnia. 
  Earlier in the day the United Nations said the Bosnian Serbs 
had agreed to an immediate ceasefire, the second in two days. 
Sunday's truce was ignored as well.
