NATION IN BRIEF; 
FLORIDA; 
HURRICANE WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL STORM 
Hurricane Nana lost its punch, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center 
in Miami expected it to slowly continue losing strength as it remained nearly 
stationary in the Caribbean. Nana, which is now designated as a tropical storm, 
had top winds of 70 m.p.h., but it still posed a threat to Bermuda. Nana, the 
eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, moved north-northeast at 
nearly 5 m.p.h. and was expected to turn toward the northeast today.
