DWP COMMISSIONERS ADOPT SURCHARGE FOR WATER-RATIONING 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commissioners on Thursday adopted 
a water-rationing surcharge plan that would levy higher rates as city residents 
save more water. Officials said that if residents use less water, the DWP would 
need the extra money to cover fixed costs. 
The new rate, described as a "floating surcharge" must be approved by the City 
Council and could be considered today when the council debates Mayor Tom 
Bradley's rationing plan. Under the current water rationing ordinance, a 
surcharge of 9 cents per billing unit is added to the monthly bill. If the 
residents continue to save at the 15.5% rate achieved in June, officials said 
the surcharge could go up by at least 4 more cents per billing unit under the 
floating rate.
