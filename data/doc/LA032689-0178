BURBANK'S LEWIS DASHES QUALITY 800 FIELD IN PASADENA GAMES 
Although Todd Lewis of Burbank High considers the 1,600 meters to be his best 
event, he defeated some of the state's top runners in the 800 at the Pasadena 
Games at Occidental College on Saturday night. 
Lewis, runner-up in the 1,600 at last year's Southern Section 3-A Division 
championships, came from behind to win the 800 in 1 minute, 55.37 seconds. 
Among Lewis' victims were Morgan Bateman of Crescenta Valley, the defending 
Southern Section 4-A Division 800 champion, Eric Smith of Redlands, the 
fifth-place finisher in last year's state championships, and Troy Collins of 
Hemet. 
Running conservatively the first lap, Lewis was eighth (58.7) at the 400-meter 
mark. Frank Sharp of Eisenhower led in a relatively slow 58.1. 
After moving into seventh down the back stretch, Lewis launched his finishing 
kick with 230 meters left and quickly moved into fifth before sweeping past 
leaders Jason Jenkins of Eisenhower and Bateman with 120 meters to go. 
Though Bateman displayed an impressive burst of speed down the home stretch, he 
finished second in 1:55.66. Jenkins placed third in 1:56.11 with Smith fourth 
in 1:56.75. 
Lewis, who ran 1:55.9 for 880 yards -- equivalent to a 1:55.2 800 -- in a 
triangular meet at Hoover High 10 days ago, ran a 4:27 1,600 leg in the 
distance medley relay a half-hour after his 800 victory, anchoring the Bulldogs 
to a fifth-place finish. 
Running the 800 to improve his speed for the 1,600, Lewis will make his first 
serious effort of the season at the longer distance at the Arcadia Invitational 
on April 8. 
"I'm really looking forward to that race," said Lewis, who has run 4:14.5 for 
1,600 meters. 
Charles Brown of Channel Islands and Greg Sheets of Taft also won individual 
events, Brown taking the 300-meter intermediate hurdles in 39.33 and Sheets 
soaring 14 feet, 6 inches in the pole vault. 
Brown placed second in the 110-meter high hurdles (15.20) behind JacquinWebb of 
Eisenhower (14.94) earlier in the evening. 
Sheets, runner-up in last year's City Section championships, cleared the 
winning height on his third attempt before missing three tries at a personal 
best of 15-3. 
In other events, Mike Williamson of Thousand Oaks and Craig Lawson of Granada 
Hills placed third and fourth in the 3,200 meters, and Cindy Byrneof Canyon 
placed third in the girls' 300 low hurdles.
