Albania and Romania, difficulties and the achievements in 
economy and the democratization of life, the necessity of the 
strengthening of the relationship between the two countries, 
were the main issues treated in the meeting between the chairman 
of the Romanian Senate, Mr. Gherman, and Mr. Arbnori, the 
speaker of the Albanian Parliament, in Bucharest. 
  Albania is an old country, with European tradition and with 
geographical and political significance, stressed Gherman, 
pointing out that "the importance of a country it is not 
measured by its square miles." 
  Gherman and Arbnori, also discussed the problem of Kosova. 
Mr. Arbnori expressed Albanian stand toward this issue, 
pointing out that "we are not for border changes by force, but 
this does not mean not to protect the national and human rights 
of the Albanians there." 
  While Mr. Gherman pointed out that Albania will not be short 
of Romanian aid, and it was also confirmed by President Iliescu. 
The solution, he said, should be accomplished only with 
political means, avoiding the war in any case.
