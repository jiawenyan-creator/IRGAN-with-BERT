FT  31 JAN 94 / Observer: Rate for the job
Weekend reports that MPs are threatening to boycott the BBC because it has
stopped paying them for their TV and radio appearances, seem a bit wide of
the mark. After all the BBC's new policy has been in place for almost a year
and it doesn't seem to have led to any drop in the number of MPs wanting to
grab the BBC microphones.
It's surprising that the BBC did not call the MPs' bluff earlier. Only a few
mavericks, such as former defence minister Alan Clark, refuse interviews
because there's not enough money on the table.
