FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Renong plans disposal of TV,
newspaper interests
MALAYSIA'S Renong group, the sprawling conglomerate controlled by the United
Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the country's main political party, has
announced plans to sell the bulk of its newspaper and TV interests.
Renong is to sell its 48 per cent stake in The New Straits Times Press
(NSTP), Malaysia's largest newspaper and publishing group, and its 43 per
cent shareholding in TV3, the country's only privately-owned TV station, for
MDollars 800m (USDollars 320m).
A management buyout of both enterprises is being undertaken with Realmild, a
company formed by four senior NSTP executives, taking the entire Renong
shareholding in both companies.
The deal values Renong's 86.5m NSTP shares at about MDollars 7.12 each and
the 36.7m TV3 shares at MDollars 5 each. Mr Mohamd Noor Mutalib, a Realmild
official, said a premium had to be paid to gain control of the two
companies.
Realmild is believed to have close links with Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's
finance minister. Mr Anwar is said to be positioning himself to succeed Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister.
