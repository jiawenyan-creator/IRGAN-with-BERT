  [Text] Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan assessed as 
generally positive the way the Basic Cooperative Production 
Units [UBPC's] are operating, stressing that a greater 
dedication to work, a more sensible use of resources, and 
increased intiative in seeking solutions to problems can be 
seen. Jordan, who is also a member of the Politburo of the 
Communist Party of Cuba, explained that because the UBPC's were 
formed very recently, it is of crucial importance to develop and 
consolidate administrative competence within them and, in short, 
learn to be better owners. 
  With reference to UBPC autonomy, Jordan warned that people 
should not confuse autonomy with anarchy, but affirmed that the 
UBPC's really are independent, and that the existence of a 
program to ensure the availability of products required by the 
population does not constitute a contradiction. 
  Jordan highlighted the role of the enterprises regarding 
their relations with the UBPC's, which includes technical and 
material support and consultation. 
  The minister highlighted the fact that some 1,400 housing 
units have been built in the first quarter [of 1994] -- the 
largest figure in history for such a period.
