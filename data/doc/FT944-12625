FT  01 NOV 94 / Council reform faces further setback
Plans to abolish five county councils are likely to be abandoned after NOP
public opinion surveys revealed strong hostility to change.
But Herefordshire and Worcestershire, merged in the 1974 local government
reorganisation, now seem certain to be split again.
Last week the Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham,
abandoned plans to replace six county councils with all-purpose unitary
authorities after opposition in the surveys.
The cross-party Association of District Councils, which backs unitaries,
said the commission had put too much emphasis on the surveys. Low turn-out
figures demonstrated widespread ignorance, it said.
The survey results published yesterday were:
Hereford &amp; Worcester: A unitary Herefordshire received overwhelming support.
Fifty-nine per cent supported a two-tier system for Worcestershire. Turnout
was 17 per cent.
Nottinghamshire: The single most popular option was to make no change at
all, favoured by 38 per cent. Turn-out was 12 per cent.
Staffordshire: A new unitary combining Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under
Lyme was most popular, with 45 per cent support. Turnout was 12.67 per cent.
Surrey: Keeping the status quo was favoured by 77 per cent of respondents,
with only 19 per cent backing the commission's original preferred option of
splitting the county into five unitaries. Turnout was 12.5 per cent.
Warwickshire: Only 20 per cent backed the commission's preference for two
unitaries. Turnout was 13.2 per cent.
Wiltshire: Making Thamesdown, centred on Swindon, a unitary had virtually no
opposition. Outside Thamesdown 60 per cent favoured the status quo. Turnout
was 10 per cent.
The commission is expected to make final proposals next month.
