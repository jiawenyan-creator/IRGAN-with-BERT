FT  15 OCT 93 / Lloyd's proposals anger Names
LOSS-MAKING Names at Lloyd's of London have reacted angrily to new proposals
that would radically reduce their influence at the insurance market in the
run-up to the planned admission of corporate capital next year.
The move could influence Names - the individuals whose assets support the
market - to reject rule changes necessary for the new corporate members, at
a decisive extraordinary general meeting next week, say leaders of the loss
makers.
A consultative document issued earlier this week proposes that voting rights
should be more closely linked to the size of capital committed. This step
would be favoured by new investors.
The document also suggests that those Names who are no longer actively
underwriting at Lloyd's should have less voting power than active Names. But
many of the less active Names are trapped in the market because of their
participation in syndicates which have past years of account left 'open'
because of uncertainty over future claims
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, one of
the largest organisations of loss-making Names with about 3,000 members,
said: 'This is completely outrageous. It turns us into a tiny minority of
the Lloyd's electorate.' The Treasury yesterday announced proposed taxation
arrangements for corporate members at Lloyd's.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary, said the rules 'should be broadly
consistent with those that currently apply to corporate insurers generally'.
Unlike individual Names, corporate members will not be able to set aside
funds in a special reserve. However, the Treasury said 'further
consideration' would be given to the matter in the light of responses to the
consultative document on equalisation reserves for corporate insurers.
