  [Text] Today (at around 11:35 Moscow time) the Russian 
president's envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin 
leaves for Ljubljana from which he will leave for Zagreb for 
meetings with the Croatian leadership. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax that Churkin 
intended to examine implementation of the Croatian-Serb 
agreement aimed at putting an end to hostilities in the Serb 
Krajina republic on Croatian territory reached under the 
mediation of Russia. 
  Churkin is also expected to visit Belgrade where he will 
discuss the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  Interfax also learned from sources in the Russian Foreign 
Ministry that Churkin would go to Tallinn next week. He will 
meet officials in the Estonian Foreign Ministry in order to 
settle the problems which the state delegations have failed to 
solve. 
  An agreement on this visit was reached during the recent 
meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and 
Estonian President Lennart Meri.
