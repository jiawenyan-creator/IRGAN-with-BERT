FT  02 NOV 92 / Case for wage subsidies in east Germany grows
THE ABJECT failure of the international economic forecasting fraternity in
recent years has given economists a bad name. But the economic disaster in
east Germany provides a powerful retort to those who argue that economic
analysis has no predictive power. The collapse of the east German economy
was foreseeable and avoidable. But the warnings were ignored.
The 'desolate' state of the east German labour market, as described in last
week's bleak economic report from the five leading economic institutes, lies
at the root of the united Germany's growing fiscal and monetary and
political problems.
Yet this collapse was predicted long ago, most notably in the spring of 1991
by Mr George Akerlof and his colleagues at the University of California at
Berkeley (FT, 13.5.91). They argued that the pace of convergence of east
German wages to west German levels, given the poor state of east German
industrial productivity, would render 90 per cent of east Germany's
industrial capacity obsolete.
The subsequent path of events appears to support their analysis. Average
wages in the east rose by an average 38.3 per cent between 1988 and 1991 to
about 50 per cent of west German levels. The result has been to squeeze the
profits of existing industry while blunting the incentive for new investment
in east Germany. Producer prices have fallen by over a third since 1989,
raising the real wage faced by producers by 180 per cent. Measured in
dollars, wages in east Germany are at least three times higher than in other
former communist economies, as the chart shows.
Little wonder that east German output continues to collapse. Manufacturing
output in the eastern Lander was 3.6 per cent lower in August than a year
ago, while capital goods production was 16.1 per cent lower. Official
unemployment has risen to 14.6 per cent, while 'real unemployment' -
including people in job-creation schemes or re-training - is about a quarter
of the potential workforce.
The pains and the gains in the east have been unevenly shared. Mr Alan
Krueger and Mr Jorn-Steffen Pischke have examined the change in the
structure of wages and unemployment since unification.*
Not surprisingly, they find there was less wage inequality in the East
Germany before unification than in West Germany or the US. The top 10 per
cent of wage earners earned 142 per cent of the median wage in East Germany
in 1988, compared to the 173 per cent in West Germany and over 200 per cent
in the US.
Since unification, wage inequality has grown. Between 1990 and 1991, the
earnings of the top 10 per cent rose twice as fast as the average, raising
the wages of the top 10 per cent to 160 per cent of the median wage. But a
combination of union agreements and government unemployment subsidies has
prevented the wages of low paid workers from falling relative to the
average, as the upper chart shows.
Low wage workers have, in fact, had above-average wage growth, increasing
the wage of the bottom 10 per cent from 68 per cent to 70 per cent of the
median between 1988 and 1991, compared to 62 per cent in west Germany and 48
per cent in the US. This has meant a disproportionate squeeze on
labour-intensive industries, with unemployment falling hardest on the
low-skilled. The unemployment rate for university-educated east Germans was
6 per cent last year, compared to 33 per cent for people with a secondary
education.
Lower unemployment requires a fall in both the relative and the real wages
of unskilled workers. But the German government could reduce unemployment
and maintain the living standards of low-paid workers by subsidising their
employment rather than unemployment. A temporary wage subsidy would lower
the cost of labour for industry in the east, speed privatisation and
encourage new investment. The Berkeley economists' predictions were correct.
So was their policy advice.

      INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.

civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US -
help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all
jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite
