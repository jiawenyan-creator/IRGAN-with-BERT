The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
D airspace for Grant County Airport, WA. The reclassification of airspace which became effective September 16, 1993,
encompassed the Moses Lake Municipal Airport. The FAA endeavors to exclude satellite airports located within Class
D Airspace where safety would not be substantially compromised. This action would avoid any adverse impact on the
Moses Lake Municipal Airport and simplify ATC coordination responsibilities between the primary and the satellite
airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
