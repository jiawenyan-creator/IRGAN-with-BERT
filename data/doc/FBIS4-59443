  [Excerpt] Informed military sources in Aden have denied 
Sanaa's rumors that its forces today managed to take complete 
control of the al-Dali' area and that they captured a large unit 
of the forces of the Abud Brigade which are concentrated there. 
These sources stated that this is completely false and confirms 
the continuation of battles in that area. The forces of unity, 
democracy, and modernization are waging energetic defensive 
battles against the forces of the bloody al-Ahmar gang despite 
the intensity and savagery of the artillery, rocket and air 
attacks on the villages of al-Dali' province. 
  The sources also found it strange that the media of the 
ruling gang in Sanaa continue to talk about besieging Aden and 
that the entry of forces into Aden is subject to a political 
decision. This is (?nonsense) and [word indistinct] that no 
mind belies, nor does logic accept. [passage omitted]
