  [Text] Johannesburg March 23 SAPA -- Elections in 
Natal/kwaZulu would not be a write-off, African National 
Congress [ANC] Deputy Secretary-General Jacob Zuma said on 
Wednesday [23 March]. He said the ANC was determined the 
elections should go ahead in spite of the Inkatha Freedom 
Party's [IFP] decision not to contest them and to mount an 
anti-election protest throughout the province. 
  Addressing a press briefing in Johannesburg, Mr Zuma and ANC 
Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe called for the Transitional 
Executive Council and electoral bodies to ensure a free and fair 
in Natal/kwaZulu. If this could be ensured only by the 
Executive Council taking over the kwaZulu administration, they 
would be prepared to call for this step. "The situation is 
explosive," Mr Radebe claimed. 
  A meeting would be held at Durban's Currie's Fountain on 
Friday to start a protest campaign. The ANC in Natal and the 
party's National Executive Committee was discussing rolling mass 
action. 
  Mr Radebe said the meeting would demonstrate the majority of 
Zulus wanted the elections to go ahead. Opinion polls indicated 
only 18 per cent of the electorate would support the IFP. 
  He said the National Peacekeeping Force had to be deployed 
in 
the region. Mr Zuma said he could not prescribe what steps the 
executive council should take. It was disturbing that the pre- 
election period was being disrupted by means of resources 
claimed to have been provided to the kwaZulu government by the 
central government. 
  They said there had been a breakdown in law and order in 
Natal/kwaZulu. 
  Mr Zuma said attempts at international mediation between the 
ANC and the IFP were continuing. The ANC would continue these 
efforts until it became clear there was no point in carrying on.
