  [Text] Guangzhou, April 6 (CNS) -- Governor of Guangdong, 
Mr. Zhu Senlin, speaking at a provincial meeting on the media 
and ideology held here today, said that the export-oriented 
economy had become an important economic pillar in the province 
with one-third of the capital needed for the build-up coming 
from overseas and foreign-funded enterprises registered with the 
province numbering some 40,000 in addition to some 30,000 
enterprises undertaking various kinds of business related to the 
import of material from abroad. 
  Mr. Zhu said that the gross domestic product (GDP) achieved 
by Guangdong between 1991 and 1993 grew at an annual rate of 
over 20 percent on average. It is expected that it can realize 
an eightfold growth in its GDP by 1997 over that in 1980. 
  He pointed out that during the past three years Guangdong 
saw 
an annual increase of close to 100 percent in the introduction 
of foreign capital which was valued at US$2.58 billion in 1991 
and rose to US$9.65 billion last year, an amount making up 26 
percent of the actual use of the total foreign capital in the 
country. The province also saw a rapid rise in foreign trade 
during the last three years with a share of 19 percent of the 
total export nationwide in 1991 climbing to 41 percent last year. 
  Mr. Zhu said that judging from the first few months of this 
year, economic development in Guangdong was quite sound. 
Exports province-wide were valued at US$4.53 billion last 
January and February, 120.7 percent up over the same period last 
year. The actual use of foreign capital was put at US$1.345 
billion or a gain of 57.7 percent while the industrial output 
value, the sales value and financial revenue maintained quite 
big growths.
