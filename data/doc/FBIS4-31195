  [Text] According to Slovak Interior Minister Ladislav 
Pittner, the law on place-name signs will have to be resubmitted 
to the Bratislava parliament. Ladislav Pittner warns that, as a 
result of the bill's defeat on 3 June, irrendentism could become 
stronger. 
  The Bratislava paper UJ SZO has written that the reason the 
bill on bilingual place-names failed was that, among the members 
of the Miklos Duray-led Coexistence Movement, one had voted 
against the bill and two abstained. Because of this, 
Coexistence made sure that Slovakia would not get closer to 
Europe and that the Hungarians and the Slovaks would further 
distance themselves from each other, the Bratislava paper writes.
