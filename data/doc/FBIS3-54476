Intention To Conclude Military Agreement with China"] 
  [Text] Kuwait, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Kuwaiti Defense 
Minister Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah has confirmed that Kuwait intends 
to conclude a defense agreement with the Chinese Republic but 
denied any inclination to hold a similar agreement with Italy. 
  He said that the dialogue between the Kuwaiti and Chinese 
sides is continuing, in order to agree on a formula for a 
defense agreement, and expressed hope that the agreement will be 
concluded in the near future. 
  In a statement to reporters yesterday, Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah 
said that Kuwait's policy on security agreements confines them 
to the UN Security Council permanent member states to the 
exclusion of others. He added that Kuwait has no intention of 
concluding security agreements with any Arab state. He said: 
There are previous agreements in this connection such as the 
"Damascus Declaration" and the "Arab Joint Defense Pact" within 
the framework of the Arab League. 
  In reply to a question from AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the Kuwaiti 
defense minister denied that joint Kuwaiti-Italian naval 
exercises were held with a view to concluding a security 
agreement with Italy. 
  Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah stressed that the Kuwaiti force in 
Somalia operating within the UN's UNOSOM-2 will continue to 
perform its humanitarian duties until the United Nations 
terminates its UNOSOM-2 operation in Somalia. 
  On the defense budget supplement for the Kuwaiti Army, left 
pending at the National Assembly since last year, Shaykh 'Ali 
al-Sabah said that he "considers it to have been approved, 
having been passed by the National Assembly's Interior and 
Defense Affairs Committee." 
  In reply to a question about the body found in the 
Palestinian embassy building in Kuwait, the minister said that 
it has not been identified yet and that the investigations are 
continuing.
