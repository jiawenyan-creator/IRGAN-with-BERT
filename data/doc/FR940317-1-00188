 

The proposed amendments to Rule 15c212 will assist brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers in
satisfying their obligations under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and specifically under
section 15(c)(2), by conditioning the underwriting and recommendation of municipal securities on the availability
of current issuer information. By providing an efficient and timely means of access to disclosure, the proposed amendments
will ensure that information will be available in the future regarding underwritten securities. As a result, brokers,
dealers, and municipal securities dealers will be better able to recommend municipal securities in the secondary
market based on current issuer information. Fraud and manipulation in both the primary and secondary markets for
municipal securities thus will be deterred. Furthermore, the availability of secondary market disclosure to all
municipal securities market participants will assist investors in protecting themselves from misrepresentation
or other fraudulent activities by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers. 

For these reasons, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 15c212 to prohibit a broker, dealer, or municipal
securities dealer (``Participating Underwriter'')
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 from purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection with a primary offering of municipal securities with
an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more (``Offering'')
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 unless the Participating Underwriter has reasonably determined that the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken
in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of the holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information
to a nationally recognized municipal securities information repository (``NRMSIR''). The prohibition would apply
to underwriters that have committed contractually to act as an underwriter in an Offering on or after the effective
date of the rule amendment. This proposal responds, in part, to a suggestion in the 

Joint Statement on Improvements in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure

,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 in which a broad spectrum of municipal securities market participants supported wider dissemination of issuer information
and improved mechanisms for such dissemination, to assure that securities professionals have a sufficient factual
basis on which to recommend secondary market transactions.
