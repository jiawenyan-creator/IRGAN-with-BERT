FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ras to raise L2,300bn to pay for
Elvia
Riunione Adriatica Sicurta, the Italian insurer controlled by Allianz of
Germany, is to raise at least L2,300bn (Dollars 1.5bn) with an issue of
shares and bonds at a deep discount to the market price.
The capital increase will pay for its acquisition of Elvia, Switzerland's
fifth-largest insurance company, which should be completed next year.
Allianz, which controls just over 50 per cent of Ras, announced at the end
of last month that the Italian insurer would buy a 60 per cent stake in
Elvia from Swiss Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurer. Swiss Re
is selling its non-core businesses.
Although the capital increase was expected, the timing, with Italian and
world markets depressed, hit the Ras share price. Ordinary shares in the
company fell 5.6 per cent to L17,882, compared with an opening price of
L18,949 and an offer price of L12,000 a share. Allianz has already indicated
it will underwrite its share of the capital increase.
