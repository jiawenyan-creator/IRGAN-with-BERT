THE WORLD 
Scientists have for the first time found high levels of ozone and acid rain 
over thousands of miles of virgin rain forests of Central Africa, the New York 
Times said in a report from Freiburg, West Germany. It said the discovery by 
separate teams of scientists from France and West Germany was particularly 
alarming because the pollution exists throughout the year and is comparable to 
levels found in industrialized Europe and North America. The scientists said 
the pollution is largely caused by fires set by farmers and herdsmen to clear 
shrubs and to stimulate the growth of crops and grass.
