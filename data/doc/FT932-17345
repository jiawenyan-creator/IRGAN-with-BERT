FT  01 APR 93 / Observer: Unacceptable face
Stand firm the Brits. Although the Royal Navy is no longer able to put
foreigners in their place, the police remain ever ready. Witness the
limousine whose journey from Heathrow airport to London was blocked by an
eagle-eyed traffic patrolman who lengthily grilled the chauffeur about why
he wasn't wearing his seat-belt.
The man in the back took the delay not only patiently but in good humour -
so much so that one of the officers snatched open the rear door and told him
to wipe the smile off his face or he'd be nicked as well.
He happened to be Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the European Community's new
commissioner for the internal market, on his way to Whitehall for meetings
with ministers.
Perhaps he'll mention the incident when he addresses Euro-MPs this morning.
His subject is easing checks on Europeans travelling between Community
countries.
