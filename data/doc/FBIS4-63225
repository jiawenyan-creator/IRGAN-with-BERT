  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- The Chinese Embassy in Russia 
expressed "concern" over the visit of the Dalai Lama to Moscow. 
Spokesman of the embassy Zhang Zhiming told TASS on Friday that 
"China views the activities of the Dalai Lama as political in 
their essence and aimed at splitting the country". 
  The Chinese Embassy "attentively and with great concern 
follows the activities of the Dalai Lama" in the Russian 
capital, he added. 
  The spokesman stressed that Russian-Chinese relations are 
developing in a good way and that the basic principles of such 
relations had been fixed in a number of agreements. "The 
Chinese side hopes that the Russian Government will abide by the 
principles regarding the Dalai Lama", he stressed. 
  The spokesman expressed hope that the stay of the Buddhist 
leader in Moscow will not acquire an official character. If he 
holds meeting with any officials this may result in 
complications", he warned. 
  On Thursday sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry said 
Dalai Lama is on a private visit and no official contacts with 
him are planned. Russia views Tibet as an integral part of 
China and treasures relations with that country, according to 
the sources.
