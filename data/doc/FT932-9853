FT  12 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs demand shipping support
TORY backbenchers will turn up the heat on ministers over a further issue
today, as senior Conservatives renew calls for extra help for the shipping
industry.
Sir Giles Shaw, a former trade minister and member of the powerful executive
of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, has proposed a change to the Finance Bill
to give the shipping industry 100 per cent first-year capital allowances.
Other senior Tories have backed his amendment. The opposition is expected to
support it at the debate tonight. On Monday a backbench rebellion over the
plans to extend Value Added Tax to domestic fuel cut the government's
Commons majority to just 10.
Today's move is the latest in a long series of Tory backbench campaigns to
try to persuade the government to assist the shipping industry.
The MPs are still finalising their tactics. If they do not press the matter
tonight then one option is to return to the issue at the next detailed
discussion of the Budget legislation later in the summer.
One rebel said yesterday: 'If people of our sort of calibre tell ministers
to take it seriously, then they've got to take it seriously, and I shall be
astonished if they don't'
But Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury economic secretary, is expected to stick
to the previous government line, saying ministers still believe it would be
difficult to justify the tax break. The last attempt to win tax concessions
for the shipping industry came in the 1991 Budget process when more than 100
Tory MPs supported the proposals but failed to obtain an effective vote.
