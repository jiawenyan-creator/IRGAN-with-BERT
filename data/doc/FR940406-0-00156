86.60298 

Definitions. 



Section 86.60298 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from 86.60284. Where
a paragraph in 86.60284 is identical and applicable to 86.60298, this may be indicated
by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see 86.60284.''
Where a corresponding paragraph of 86.60284 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement ``[Reserved].''.


(a) through (b)(2) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.60284. 

(b)(3)(i) 

Configuration

, when used for LDV exhaust emissions testing, means a subclassification of an engine-system combination on the basis
of engine code, inertia weight class, transmission type and gear ratios, axle ratio, and other parameters which may
be designated by the Administrator. 

(ii) 

Configuration

, when used for LDV refueling emissions testing, means a subclassification of an evaporative/refueling emission
family on the basis of evaporative and refueling control system and other parameters which may be designated by the
Administrator. 

(4) 

Test sample

 means the collection of vehicles of the same configuration which have been drawn from the population of vehicles of
that configuration and which will receive emission testing. 

(b)(5) through (b)(8) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.60284. 

2. A new 86.60398 is added to subpart G to read as follows: 



86.60398 

Test orders. 



Section 86.60398 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from 86.60388. Where
a paragraph in 86.60388 is identical and applicable to 86.60398, this may be indicated
by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see 86.60388.''
Where a corresponding paragraph of 86.60388 is not applicable, this is indicated by the statement ``[Reserved].''.


(a) through (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.60388. 

(d) A manufacturer may indicate preferred assembly plants for the various engine families and evaporative/refueling
families produced by the manufacturer for selection of vehicles in response to a test order. This shall be accomplished
by submitting a list of engine families with the associated evaporative/refueling families, and the corresponding
assembly plants from which the manufacturer desires to have vehicles selected, to the Administrator. In order that
a manufacturer's preferred location for issuance of a test order for a configuration of a particular engine family
and/or evaporative/refueling family be considered, the list must be submitted prior to issuance of the test order.
Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the above list, the Administrator may, upon making the
determination that evidence exists indicating noncompliance at other than the manufacturer's preferred plant,
order selection at such other plant where vehicles of the configuration specified in the test order are assembled.


(e) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.60388.
