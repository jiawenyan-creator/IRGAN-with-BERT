  [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- A final assessment by Civil 
Defense today indicated that more than 40,000 square km were 
damaged by the recent rains and floods in Cuba's eastern 
provinces. 
  The irregular weather situation from 18 to 25 May caused 
most 
of the damage in Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Camaguey 
Provinces. Civil Defense reported the total or partial 
destruction of 4,370 houses and damage to another 38,720. 
  A total of 9,000 km of roads and highways, 20 railroad 
bridges, and 18 others located on interurban roads were damaged 
by the waters of overflowed rivers and dams. Approximately 
4,500 square km of fields, mostly planted with sugarcane, rice, 
tubers, and vegetables were flooded. 
  More than 250,000 people were affected, 38,600 of whom were 
evacuated from their homes. Approximately 172,450 farm animals 
were also evacuated. A significant number of dams, microdams, 
aqueducts, and electricity and telephone services were also 
damaged. 
  Civil Defense said that at this time all sectors of the 
economy are analyzing the secondary damages caused by the 
rainfall, although without halting the intense recovery activity 
under the direction of a ministerial commission created for this 
purpose.
