  [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front -- AVF] General Constand Viljoen has resigned 
from his position as the chairman of the AVF's Directorate of 
Generals. Gen Viljoen announced the decision at a news 
conference in Pretoria on Saturday [12 March], adding that 
Friday's events in Bophuthatswana had convinced him to take part 
in the election under the Freedom Front [FF], and to take on the 
National Party [NP] and the African National Congress [ANC] on a 
political level. He added he would remain as military adviser 
to Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg. 
  Gen Viljoen said he doubted if he would ever carry out 
another operation with the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[Resistance Movement -- AWB]. He said they had disobeyed orders 
not to enter Bophuthatswana on Friday and once inside refused to 
leave. 
  Turning to the candidates list of the Freedom Front, CP 
[Conservative Party] MP Pieter Mulder, who also attended the 
news conference, revealed the names of other CP MPs who might 
contest the election under the FF banner. 
  They are Dr. Mulder, his brother Corne Mulder (Randfontein), 
Mr Joseph Chiole (Pretoria West), Carl Werth (Natal CP leader) 
who two days ago resigned from the CP, Pieter Groenewald 
(Stilfontein) who submitted the list on Friday night, Mr Willem 
Botha (Uitenhage), and others. 
  Gen Viljoen, who is heading the FF candidate list, said a 
meeting would be held soon to choose a leader. His name 
appeared on top in order to beat the registration deadline. "I 
don't want to pull away the AVF's power base, I intend to create 
my own," he said. Dr. Mulder confirmed a committee had been 
established to maintain unity in their ranks. This was aimed at 
managing a split which the decision to participate in the 
elections could cause. There were differences in strategy over 
how to obtain a volkstaat [homeland] but there was no division 
over the concept itself, he said.
