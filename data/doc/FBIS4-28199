  [Text] Phnom Penh, June 8 KYODO -- Khmer Rouge leader Pol 
Pot has a serious brain illness, a Cambodian Government 
spokesman said Wednesday [8 June]. 
  The spokesman did not identify his source of information. 
  Another senior government official told Kyodo News Service 
that he has not confirmed the report. 
  Pol Pot, held responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge regime in the late 
1970s, disappeared from public in the early 1980s. 
  He is reportedly hiding in the Thai-Cambodian border area 
and 
escaped from the Khmer Rouge's capital town of Pailin during a 
Cambodian Government offensive on the rebels' headquarters in 
March.
