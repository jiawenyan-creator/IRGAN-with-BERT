FT  16 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: DSS view of cards not a smart
marketing move
Sir, The failure of the government's efficiency unit to swing the social
security department behind 'smart' cards suggests it should improve its
customer marketing focus ('DSS resists identity card scheme for benefit
claims', April 14).
Rather than position this initiative as a means of reducing benefits fraud
the real potential for a citizens' smart card would lie in the avoidance of
the seemingly endless and repetitive form-filling of personal data
associated with most people's contacts with government-run institutions.
The value of the time potentially saved by the many could far exceed the
savings from eliminating fraud by the few]
By emphasising the advantages to consumers of public services (and even
making the card optional), civil liberties concerns need not be more acute
than those relating to other forms of smart plastic which are gaining
consumer acceptance.
