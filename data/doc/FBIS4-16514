  [Excerpts] It has already been reported that the first 
stage of work of the Zhogorku Kenesh's 14th session ended 16 
April in Bishkek. Boris Grigorievich Bazhan, people's deputy 
from Moskovskiy rayon and chairman of the Engels kolkhoz, was 
interviewed by our correspondent. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Bazhan] We passed quite 
workable laws, especially on pensions. The government informed 
us about what lies ahead. The prospects are not brilliant. The 
situation is very serious. Many enterprises are at a 
standstill. The main thing is that nobody knows where all that 
money has gone. In practice, the enterprises cannot settle 
payments -- they are all bankrupt. Prime Minister Dzhumagulov 
said that these bankrupt enterprises are to blame, and first of 
all the state is to blame. The government is the number one 
bankrupt because the state owes the farmers a lot of money. It 
has not paid us for meat, milk, wool, or grain since 1993 for 
one single reason only: it announced subsidies for foodstuff and 
then we did not receive any payment from the budget. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is my impression that we are heading for nowhere. We are 
waiting for decisive measures from the government, from the 
president, but in fact we are still hanging around. Nobody is 
interested in working. All these new taxes, dues, and so on -- 
they are not workable for one simple reason: Nobody has any 
money. [passage omitted] 
  It is a shame to say it but those who do not produce 
anything 
are much better off than those who do. [passage omitted] 
  This spring is very difficult. We should have sown winter 
wheat on 2,600 ha but we lost 1,000 ha because it was too humid. 
The sowing campaign leaves much to be desired. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]
