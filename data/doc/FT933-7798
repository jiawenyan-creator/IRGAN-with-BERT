FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Reed Elsevier poised to complete airline
guides buy
REED ELSEVIER, the international publishing group, said yesterday that it
was set to complete the purchase of Official Airline Guides, the former
Maxwell company, within the next two to three weeks.
In May, Reed signed a non-exclusive letter of intent to buy the business for
Dollars 425m (Pounds 285m) from Price Waterhouse, the joint administrator of
Maxwell Communication Corporation.
At this stage it is thought highly unlikely that another bidder will come
forward.
Mr Nicholas Jones, Reed deputy director corporate relations, said last night
that due diligence work would shortly be completed.
'We are now just waiting for the details to be pored over by the lawyers,'
he said.
Reed already owns ABC World Airways Guides, and has obtained US anti-trust
clearance to acquire OAG, which had operating profits of Dollars 44.5m last
year.
It believes that putting the two guides together will allow it to compete
better with the electronic systems operated by many airlines.
If the deal goes ahead, the acquisition will be by Reed Travel group, a
subsidiary of Reed Elsevier.
