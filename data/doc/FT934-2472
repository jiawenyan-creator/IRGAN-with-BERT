FT  14 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Granville teams up with
Postel - In a Nutshell
Granville, the private investment banking group, has strengthened its links
with Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, and formed a joint venture to
manage the two groups' private equity portfolios.
The new venture, Granville Private Equity Managers, will manage Postel's
Pounds 195m private equity fund, Granville Development Capital's existing
funds and an additional Pounds 50m which Postel has allocated for new
investment in the next three years.
The deal is an example of the kind of consolidation that venture capital
industry observers expect to see over the next 18 months. A number of
venture capital groups are struggling to raise capital for new funds and
thought to be seeking strategic mergers.
Postel already has a 16 per cent stake in Granville. Two Postel fund
managers, John Brakell and Ray Maxwell, will move across to the new venture.
