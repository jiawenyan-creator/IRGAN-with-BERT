METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROUND-THE-CLOCK TALKS URGED IN TEACHERS 
STRIKE 
Petitions containing more than 900 signatures from parents and other residents 
urging the Beverly Hills school board to begin round-the-clock talks with 
striking teachers were delivered to district headquarters Tuesday afternoon, 
according to a newly formed parents group. 
The group, called Children First, began circulating the petitions Friday night. 
The petitions also ask the board to "explore creative financial alternatives" 
to provide raises for the teachers. 
Meanwhile, on Day 7 of the strike, attendance appeared to be stabilizing. 
Districtwide, it was at 58% Tuesday, down slightly from Monday's 60% but up 
from the 43% of last week. 
Also on Tuesday, about 170 Beverly Hills teachers, many dressed in black, 
marched outside Hawthorne School to protest what they said were the autocratic 
and anti-union policies of the principal there. The teachers union had filed a 
charge with the Public Employment Relations Board, accusing Principal Ann 
Picker of undermining the union and of harassing union representative at the 
school. 
The employment relations board is investigating the case, board attorney Tom 
Allen said. He said the charge is not directly connected to the strike over 
wages and benefits. 
Picker has declined to comment on the union's charge, referring inquiries to 
Supt. Robert French. On Tuesday, French reiterated his support of Picker. He 
said the case is a personnel matter and that it is "totally improper" for the 
union to bring it up during the strike. 
Teachers are demanding an 18% salary increase over two years. The district says 
it can afford only 11%.
