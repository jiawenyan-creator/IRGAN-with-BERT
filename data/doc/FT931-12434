FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic attacks AT&amp;T
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph's plan to take a one third stake in McCaw
Cellular Communications, the largest cellular telephone operator in the US,
came under attack yesterday from one of the seven 'Baby Bell' local
telephone companies, which urged the Federal Communications Commission to
investigate the deal, writes Martin Dickson.
Bell Atlantic, which operates in the mid-Atlantic seaboard region, said the
union would create 'competitive and public interest concerns of the most
fundamental kind.' It added that two other Baby Bells - New York-based Nynex
and Southwestern Bell - had also asked the FCC to investi-gate.
The Baby Bells were spun off from AT&amp;T, America's largest long-distance
carrier, under an anti-monopoly court settlement in 1984. This banned the
Baby Bells from telephone manufacturing and the long distance market.
Bell Atlantic said AT&amp;T's 'overnight transformation' into its largest
wireless competitor made it imperative that Bell Atlantic be freed of the
1984 constraints.
