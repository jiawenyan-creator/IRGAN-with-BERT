FT  20 AUG 93 / Management: Legal dangers of stress
Got a headache? Can't sleep? Drink too much? Feel depressed? Got high blood
pressure?
One solution for victims of stress could be to sue your employer, according
to employment lawyers Nicholas Rochez and Mark Scoggins of Davies Arnold
Cooper, the commercial law firm. They say it is likely that a British
company will be sued for stress in the next five years.
In a recent report* they argue that stress cases will follow the path of
other injuries at work. They say that laws which were drafted to prevent
accidents can easily be turned to include mental effects of stress.
Employers who have taken no steps to identify and reduce stress at work may
well find themselves having to pay up.
Companies will doubtless argue that to extend the law to cover stress would
put an unrealistic burden on them. After all, people who do stressful work
know that the pressure is part of the job, and are usually paid enough to
compensate for it, or so the argument goes.
Lawyers point out though that similar claims were made about asbestosis,
coal miners' lung and noise-induced deafness. Cumulative trauma claims will
evolve the same way, the law firm argues. If they are right, companies
should act now to avoid getting themselves into legal hot water later.
Insurers should take note too. At the moment companies are covered against
claims causing 'bodily injury or disease'. But it is possible that a UK
court could rule that these policies also include mental injury, as has
happened in New York.
But even if stress never reaches court rooms, companies which take a
positive stand on the problem and attempt to do something about it, will
have more direct spin-offs in terms of lower absenteeism and a happier
workforce.
