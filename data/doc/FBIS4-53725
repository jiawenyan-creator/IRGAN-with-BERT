  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
Monday appointed Pak Kon-u, secretary-general of the 2002 World 
Cup Bidding Committee, as vice foreign minister in a reshuffle 
of seven vice ministerial posts. 
  Kim Yong-chin, commissioner of the Korean Customs 
Administration (KCA), was appointed vice finance minister and Yi 
Sok-chae, assistant economic planning minister for budget, 
became vice agriculture, forestry and fisheries minister. 
  Industrial Advancement Administrator Pak Un-so was named 
vice 
trade, industry and energy minister. 
  Yi Hang-kyun, assistant finance minister, replaced Kim 
Yong-chin as commissioner of the KCA, while Pak Sam-kyu, 
assistant minister for industry, took over for Pak Un-so. 
  Lawyer Cho Kyong-kun was appointed the first state vice 
minister for political affairs. 
  Chu Ton-sik, senior presidential press secretary, said, 
"President Kim carried out the vice-minister-level personnel 
changes in the seven ministries after considering the senior 
officials' specialties and ability to control their ministries." 
  Chu added that President Kim is scheduled to confer letters 
of appointment on the new vice ministers at 5:50 Monday 
afternoon [0850 GMT 23 May]. 
  A presidential secretary said that the president has 
postponed changing the vice foreign minister to carry out the 
vice minister- level personnel changes simultaneously, although 
he decided on the change after the vice minister "created policy 
confusion in the Foreign Ministry." [sentence as received] 
  "The new adviser to the first state minister for political 
affairs was appointed on the recommendation of First State 
Minister So Chong-won," he said.
