  [Text] An attempt is being made to resolve the issue of the 
elimination of chemical weapons behind the scenes without public 
debate, scientist Vil Mirzayanov declared in an interview with 
Interfax. 
  He said every effort should be made to keep the Duma from 
ratifying a treaty on chemical weapons destruction. 
  He said that "since Russia does not have an environmentally 
safe technology for chemical destruction, the period of chemical 
weapons scrapping should be prolonged from 10 years, as is 
envisaged in the treaty, to 25-30 years." 
  He called for an early debate on the issue with the leaders 
of parliamentary factions from Russia's Choice Party, Russian 
Unity and Concord Party, Yavlinsky's Association, Communist 
Party, and Liberal Democratic Party. 
  Mirzayanov argued that the proposed technology of burning 
chemical weapons could not guarantee safety and explained that 
this method provided for burning toxins in special hermetically 
sealed chambers and for filtering the resulting gasses. 
  "But here the question arises as what to do with the 
filters, 
which absorb poisonous pollutants", Mirzayanov said. Besides, 
in his words, nothing guarantees that through the filters 
chemical weapon components could not pollute the atmosphere. 
  He urged the Duma to sanction a chemical weapons inventory. 
In his words, "a weapon that has been buried is as dangerous as 
a weapon planned to be sealed." Mirzayanov noted that 
"pollutants have not only instantaneous but also delayed impact 
on people." 
  He predicted adverse effects for the next generation and 
said 
that "gradual but damaging changes are taking place in humans."
