FT  17 AUG 94 / Decline in VAT registrations
The number of companies registered for value added tax last year fell 1.7
per cent from 1992 levels, official figures showed yesterday.
The number of company deregistrations rose from 206,000 in 1992 to 218,000
last year, the Department of Trade and Industry statistics showed.
There were 190,000 new registrations of companies last year, almost
unchanged from the previous year. This brought the number of companies
registered to 1.6m at the end of last year.
The latest figures include an adjustment for an increase in the VAT
threshold in November 1993 from Pounds 37,600. The change is estimated to
have reduced registrations by 2,000 and increased deregistrations by 3,000.
