SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 







A. Background





As part of the Defense Management Review, the DARC reviewed regulatory text and clauses at the component level of the
military departments for possible elimination or combination into higher level regulations. Based on that review,
two clauses are recommended for inclusion into the FAR, Schedule of Government-Furnished Property and Use on No-Charge-Basis_Government
Facilities, Special Test Equipment and Special Tooling. The first clause will be used by contracting officers to
describe the items of Government-furnished property to be provided to the contractor, and the second clause will
authorize for the contractor's use on a no-charge basis, Government facilities, special test equipment and special
tooling. These clauses provide controls on the use of Government property by identifying the items of property furnished
under a contract or used on a no-charge basis, and the clauses also describe the obligations of both parties in regard
to the property.





B. Regulatory Flexibility Act





This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 because the clauses identify and authorize property for use by the contractor which is mutually beneficial to both
parties and do not burden the contractor. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed.
However, comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Such comments must be submitted
separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.,

 (FAR case 91114), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of OMB
under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

 Therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply.
