FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan offers to cut some import duties
JAPAN has told the European Union it is prepared to remove import duties in
three industrial sectors to encourage progress in the deadlocked world trade
liberalisation talks.
The offer comes in a letter from Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, to
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, due to visit Tokyo on
Sunday and Monday to discuss the Uruguay round of Gatt talks, the agreement
deadline for which is just a month away, December 15.
Japan would be prepared to lift tariffs on electronics, scientific equipment
and pulp and paper and calls on the EC to do the same, says Mr Hata's
letter. He says Japan has already offered to reduce import duties on
industrial goods by an average of 60 per cent, as against the 33 per cent
offered by the EC and the US's 37 per cent.
Japan will seek to encourage progress in Gatt at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum meeting next week.
Frances Williams adds from Geneva: Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of
Gatt yesterday rebuked negotiators for wasting time 'on arcane technical
points of doubtful importance' and warned against the temptation to leave
all important concessions until the last possible moment.
