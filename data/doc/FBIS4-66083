<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "No Formal Agreement With Moscow </F>
on Relations With NATO"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 25 May (BELGA) -- NATO Deputy Secretary 
General Sergio Balanzino on Wednesday [25 May] ruled out the 
signing of a formal agreement with Russia on starting 
consultations between Moscow and the Atlantic alliance. 
  Sergio Balanzino said: "A formal protocol has been ruled out 
by the Council (the North Atlantic Council, comprising the 16 
NATO countries)." He was speaking in Brussels at a news 
conference at the end of a meeting of NATO and East European 
defense ministers. 
  General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, for his 
part 
stated outside the meeting that Russia would unconditionally 
join the Partnership for Peace (PFP) proposed by NATO to the 
other European countries, and essentially to its former 
adversaries of the Warsaw Pact. On Wednesday morning, however, 
he requested that a permanent mechanism be set up for 
consultation with the alliance. 
  However, Mr. Balanzino, replacing NATO Secretary General 
Woerner, who was officially absent so as not to interrupt his 
period of convalescence, said that if Russia were to join the 
PFP it would have no access or veto rights on decisions made by 
the Atlantic alliance. 
  Mr. Balanzino repeated that Moscow will also have to sign 
the 
same document as the other Partnership countries. 
  He continued: "We trust there will be no changes to the PFP 
framework document that Russia will sign. This document is 
exactly the same for everyone." 
  He did, however, accept that the great sway held by Russia 
as 
the second great power and a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council will be "taken into consideration" in the dialogue to be 
established on a "step by step" basis between the alliance and 
Moscow.
