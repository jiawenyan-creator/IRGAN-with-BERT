FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bramalea nears debt agreement
BRAMALEA, the property group controlled by Toronto's Edper-Bronfman group,
has negotiated an agreement that may smooth the way to restructuring the
company's CDollars 5bn (USDollars 4.06bn) debt.
Lawyers representing holders of CDollars 525m of secured debentures said
they will recommend an exchange into Bramalea stock and new five-year
secured debentures.
The debenture holders, if they finally approve, would receive slightly more
than 50 per cent of Bramalea's equity.
