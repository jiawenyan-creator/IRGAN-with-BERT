SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.1003 in the 

Federal Register

 of September 3, 1993 (58 FR 4692021). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before
October 4, 1993. No comments were received, and the amendments are adopted as proposed with the exception of the following
technical amendment. Section 3.1003(a), as here amended, will provide that the amount represented by a returned
and canceled check will be payable to the living person or persons in the order of precedence listed in 3.1000(a)(1)(4),
which deals with accrued benefits. Section 3.1000(a)(4) provides, in effect, that, where there is no living person
in the classes identified in 3.1000(a)(1)(3), the amount of accrued benefits payable is limited to
the amount necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness or burial. We are adding to 3.1003(a),
as originally proposed, a similar statement to ensure that there is no confusion on the amount of a returned and canceled
check that may be paid in such a situation.




The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601612.
The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial
and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.

There is no affected Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number.
