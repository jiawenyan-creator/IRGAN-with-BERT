<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F>
Xavier Gautier in Sarajevo; date not given: "The United Nations 
Is Not Protecting Anything, Not Even Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] In Sarajevo, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic is 
regarded by many Bosnians as the most capable, and certainly the 
most ambitious, politician. The message of this 47-year-old 
man, whose jaw is constantly clenched and who was "exiled" to 
Libya under Tito, to the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) is 
virulent. But he refrained from demanding the blue helmets' 
withdrawal. 
  [Gautier] What is the current situation in Gorazde? 
  [Silajdzic] The Serbs have attacked the city of Gorazde with 
30,000 soldiers, supported by 19 tanks and more than 100 pieces 
of large-caliber artillery, which arrived from the barracks of 
Uzice and Kraljevo in Serbia, and from Podgorica in Montenegro. 
Trapped by the arms embargo, the Bosnians have no means to 
defend themselves. The international community has sentenced us 
to death. The Serbs intend to conquer the city and cleanse it of 
its population to complete their "Greater Serbia." They will 
now extend this strategy to the remaining parts of eastern 
Bosnia which still escape them. 
  [Gautier] Can the city hold out? 
  [Silajdzic] It is still defended and Gorazde will defend 
itself to its last bullet. 
  [Gautier] Are other "safe areas" threatened? 
  [Silajdzic] The United Nations is not protecting anything, 
not even Sarajevo. The Serbs are regaining their large-caliber 
weapons, which had been placed under the control of the blue 
helmets... The Serbs will first try to expand into the 
northeastern part of Bosnia. Then it will be the turn of the 
Bihac pocket, where the French blue helmets are currently 
deployed. 
  [Gautier] You attack the United Nations fiercely. Do you 
want the blue helmets to withdraw? 
  [Silajdzic] No. What we are demanding is arms, in other 
words the lifting of the embargo imposed on us by the United 
Nations. It is the United Nations itself which has placed us in 
this quagmire. It must extricate itself from it, together with 
us. 
  [Gautier] Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic has just made a 
lengthy visit to Washington. Has he received American 
assurances on the lifting of the arms embargo? 
  [Silajdzic] In principle, the United States refuses to back 
the UN blockade imposed on us. But we must be realistic: In 
Congress things are not really moving in our favor. 
  [Gautier] So Bosnia no longer has any allies? 
  [Silajdzic] French policy fortunately is changing in our 
favor. French planes took part in the air strikes against (the 
Serbian forces around) Gorazde in a support role. We are 
grateful to France for that. 
  [Gautier] What do you hope the French will do? 
  [Silajdzic] That they simply stand by their principles of 
justice and freedom. 
  [Gautier] Aside from words, what support have you obtained 
from Arab and Muslim countries? 
  [Silajdzic] What else could they do? Their hands are tied 
by the big powers. 
  [Gautier] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, your ally, said 
recently that the main danger threatening Bosnia is Islamic 
fundamentalism. What do you think of that? 
  [Silajdzic] The danger which is indeed threatening this part 
of the world is that of fundamentalism, an ethnic or fascist 
fundamentalism. In our camp, I have never seen Muslims destroy 
a single church in Bosnia. 
  [Gautier] To give a few examples: Last summer, Muslim 
fundamentalists blew up a swimming pool and shot at swimmers in 
Zenica. Muslims also massacred Croatians in the village of 
Uzbol... 
  [Silajdzic] There have been incidents, it is true, but you 
must compare what can be compared. Help us combat this 
barbarism. Bosnia is a civilized country.
