'QUAKE'S A CROCK,' GEOLOGIST DECLARES 
One man's prediction of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault from Illinois 
to Mississippi will prove to be a total non-event, a geologist said. 
But many residents waited anxiously for today to come and go, the day New 
Mexico climatologist Iben Browning said was the most likely for a quake. 
Skeptics partied to music like "Shake, Rattle and Roll" and ordered Jell-O for 
dessert so they could watch it wiggle. Seth Stein, chairman of the Northwestern 
University Geology Department, joined a long list of experts rejecting 
Browning's prediction: "I'll state it as clearly as I can: Browning's 
prediction has been evaluated and determined to be complete nonsense, without 
scientific foundation -- which is our jargon for: 'It's a crock.' "
