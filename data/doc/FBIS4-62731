  [Text] Baku (16 May) TURAN: On 14 May the speaker of 
Parliament, Rasul Guliyev, spoke on national TV. As was earlier 
reported, the opposition accused him of "betraying interests of 
Azerbaijan" when he signed the Bishkek protocol. He rejected 
these accusations and said that he signed the Bishkek protocol 
"since there is no other way out of the situation." 
  At the same time, Guliyev accused the opposition of 
attempting to seize power and warned that they will bear a 
responsibility for that. 
  The statement by Rasul Guliyev coincided with an assault by 
an armed group on the headquarters of the National Independence 
Party, the closure of the independent television channel, "BMT," 
and an order from Baku's mayor Alakhverdiyev for evacuating 
"AZADLIG," the opposition newspaper, 
  From their premises [sentence as received]. It should be 
mentioned that all the abovementioned organs of the media and 
parties have been severely criticizing Rasul Guliyev over the 
past days due to his signing of the Bishkek protocol. 
  Beginning on 14 May, the police took the control over the 
building where the AZADLIG editorial offices are located (for 
the third time this year) and warned the employees that they 
must evacuate the building. The leadership of the newspaper was 
not presented officially represented with an order by Baku's 
mayor. 
  The authorities are demanding the evacuation from the 
premises by the following organizations: TURAN News Agency, 
Azerbaijan's Centre for Democratic Reforms, Centre for Strategic 
Researches, AZADLIG newspaper and Polyglot International Centre. 
All the above-mentioned organizations are independent and 
non-governmental.
