LOCAL; 
CAR FLIPS ON FREEWAY; 3 INJURED 
Three family members were injured, two of them seriously, early today when the 
car in which they were riding veered off the Golden State Freeway near Gorman 
and flipped over, authorities said. 
The driver, Katherine Aguirre, 21, and Brandon Aguirre, 1, were thrown from the 
car in the 4 a.m. crash, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mark Ehly. 
Bryan Aguirre, 26, remained inside the vehicle, Ehly said. 
All three were taken to Henry Mayo Memorial Hospital in Newhall, where 
Katherine Aguirre was listed in critical condition and Brandon in stable 
condition. Bryan Aguirre received only minor injuries, Ehly said. It was not 
immediately known where the family lives. 
They had been traveling north on the freeway near Hungry Valley Road when the 
car drifted off the highway and down an embankment, Ehly said. 
The cause of the accident has not been determined, but it appeared the driver 
may have fallen asleep, he said.
