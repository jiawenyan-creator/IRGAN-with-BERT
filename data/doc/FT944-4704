FT  07 DEC 94 / Siebe goes for growth after jump in profits
Siebe, the international controls group, yesterday said it would accelerate
its global expansion programme following a 28.5 per cent increase in
first-half profits.
The company, one of the UK's largest engineering companies, saw pre-tax
profits increase from Pounds 93m to Pounds 119.5m in the six months to
September 30, as sales rose 13 per cent to Pounds 1.01bn.
Welcoming the figures, Mr Allen Yurko, chief executive, said they provided a
strong platform for growth both organically and by acquisition. 'We're
stepping up our expansion and we'd like to enhance our presence in eastern
Europe, the Far East and South America,' he said.
Although North America remained its largest market with increased sales of
Pounds 465.1m, against Pounds 435.6m, the group is keen to exploit growing
demand in Asia and the Pacific Rim, where turnover rose 34.9 per cent to
Pounds 136.8m.
Mr Yurko said the group, which manufactures products ranging from
sophisticated process controls systems to mass-produced components, would
seek acquisitions in the region but was likely to focus initially on further
joint ventures.
In recent months, Siebe has announced plans for three acquisitions totalling
Pounds 79.7m, while its new subsidiaries - Eckardt and NAF - made first time
sales contributions of Pounds 52m.
The group's acquisition strategy, financed partly from borrowings and funds
left over from last year's Pounds 184.3m rights issue, would continue at a
similar pace, Mr Yurko added.
Profits on continuing operations, meanwhile, rose from Pounds 121.2m to
Pounds 139.7m.
The improvement was underpinned by its two largest divisions - temperature &amp;
appliance controls and controls systems - which reported increased profits
of Pounds 57.4m (Pounds 52.9m) and Pounds 57.2m (Pounds 43.2m) respectively.
'Control systems has been a real sizzler and orders have increased by more
than 30 per cent,' said Mr Yurko.
Its contribution was offset, however, by declining profits in safety and
life support systems and specialist mechanical engineering, which was hit by
cuts in defence spending.
Earnings per share rose from 13.2p to 16.2p, and the group declared a 10 per
cent increase in the interim dividend to 4.03p (3.66p).
