FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exempt transfers
What time limits apply to gifts qualifying as exempt transfers? In other
words, how long before and after the date of marriage may they be made?
There is no specific time limit relating to gifts in consideration of the
marriage, but the gift must be in consideration of the marriage. So, it must
be made at the time of the marriage or shortly before. Strict proof is
required when a gift made after the marriage is alleged to be in
consideration of it. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward).
