FT  08 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: The coal dust settles
Judging by the hardline noises coming from the electricity generators,
British Coal's 'reprieved' pits are not long for this world. In February,
there was much talk of the government forcing the generators to take an
additional 65m tonnes of coal over five years. National Power and PowerGen
offered to take 40m tonnes. Now it seems a only a few million tonnes may be
bought this year and next, and the pits will close.
Since a basic five-year coal deal has been signed, much of the uncertainty
about future coal prices has been removed. That deal requires the generators
to take less coal than hitherto, so they can start to run down stocks and
release cash. Similarly, the very strong underlying profits and cash flow of
the business has partly been masked by heavy provisions and a high capital
spend. The generators now have a secure financial cushion which will allow
them to release profits, cash and dividends over the next three years.
Dividend increases of 15 per cent compound will doubtless tempt investors
offered leaner pickings elsewhere, especially if voluntary market share
reductions mean that the generators avoid an appointment with the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Yet while there is still plenty of air to come out of the tyres further down
the profit and loss account, boosting turnover will remain a problem.
National Power intends to spend Pounds 1bn overseas to find new revenues.
PowerGen is sniffier about the rates of return available. The success or
otherwise of diversification may finally mark a point of difference between
the two companies.
