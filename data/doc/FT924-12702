FT  20 OCT 92 / Broker finds green solution to case of the missing shares
DOCUMENTS potentially worth more than Pounds 30m disappeared from a
Birmingham stockbroker's office on Friday and nobody knows if they were
stolen or accidentally put out with the rubbish.
The missing papers were letters of allotment destined for investors who
bought shares in the Pounds 61.7m flotation of Trinity Holdings, which -
ironically - builds chassis for dustcarts as well as Dennis fire engines and
buses.
The few hundred letters, which covered 25m shares, were delivered by a
security firm to the office of stockbroker Albert E. Sharp early on Friday
morning, before the receptionist arrived. Someone signed for them, but the
box was not there when executives looked for it later.
Such letters can normally be used to deal in shares until formal share
certificates are printed. They have to be sent to shareholders before
dealings in the shares can begin, and their disappearance could have delayed
yesterday's start to the company's Stock Exchange career.
But anyone trying to deal in the missing letters will be easily caught.
When their absence was discovered, Sharp and Baring Brothers, Trinity's
merchant bank, quickly arranged for new letters to be printed on green,
rather than white, paper. It has yet to be decided who will pay for the
second print run.
These were posted on Saturday and dealings began yesterday as planned. The
shares closed at 129p, a comfortable premium to the 120p issue price.
