In previous funding cycles, the Institute has supported national and regional conferences on State-Federal judicial
relationships and the Chief Justices' Special Committee on Mass Tort Litigation. In addition, the Institute has
supported projects developing judicial impact statement procedures for national legislation affecting State
courts, and projects examining methods of State and Federal court cooperation; procedures for facilitating certification
of questions of law; the impact on the State courts of diversity cases and cases brought under section 1983; the procedures
used in Federal habeas corpus review of State court criminal cases; the factors that motivate litigants to select
Federal or State courts; and the mechanisms for transferring cases between Federal and State courts, as well as the
methods for effectively consolidating, deciding, and managing complex litigation. The Institute has also supported
a clearinghouse of information on State constitutional law decisions, educational programs for State judges on
coordination of Federal bankruptcy cases with State litigation, and a seminar examining the implications of the
``Federalization'' of crime.
