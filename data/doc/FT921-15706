FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: Schultze backs current value
accounting
MR Walter Schultze, who was named as the new chief accountant at the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, yesterday reiterated his support for the
principle of current value accounting.
In his first speech since being selected for the job, Mr Schultze, currently
a partner with the international accountancy firm, KMPG Peat Marwick,
praised the efforts of Mr Richard Breedon, SEC chairman, to have current
value accounting introduced for certain assets held by financial
institutions.
At present, banks and thrifts carry financial products, such as stocks and
bonds, in their balance sheets at historic cost. The issue is contentious
and other agencies have argued such a move would increase the vulnerability
of financial institutions when they are already deeply troubled.
The SEC has formal responsibility for accounting standards and rules, but
delegates much of the task to the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB), an industry body. Mr Schultze was reported as saying that market
value accounting 'has to pass everyone's test of relevance', and that some
of the issues needed to be tested in practice.
'The trick will be to find the point of trade-off between the obvious
benefits and the cost of getting market value information that will be
relevant to investors.'
