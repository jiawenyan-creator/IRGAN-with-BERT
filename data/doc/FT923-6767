FT  21 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's lowers ratings on two
Japanese banks
MOODY's Investor Service, the US credit rating agency, yesterday lowered the
long-term ratings of the Industrial Bank of Japan and Norinchukin Bank, two
of Japan's leading banks.
Japanese banks face mounting non-performing property related loans due to
the sharp fall in the country's real estate market. While the banks have low
direct exposure to the domestic real estate sector, they are experiencing
severe problems because of loans to non-bank financial institutions which
lent heavily to property related developments in the late 1980s.
IBJ, the largest long-term credit bank, saw its long-term debt lowered from
Aa2 to Aa3. Moody's said the downgrade was based on the bank's real
estate-related asset quality trends, as well as long-term profitability. The
agency expressed concern over the effect of IBJ's weak internal controls on
the credit quality of the bank.
Increasing competitive pressures due to financial deregulation are also
expected to erode IBJ's profitability.
Moody's also lowered its long-term debt ratings of Norinchukin, the central
banking institution for agricultural co-operatives, from Aa1 to Aa3. Moody's
said the downgrade reflected the bank's vulnerability to asset quality
deterioration, and the weakening condition of the smaller financial
institutions related to the agricultural co-operative system.
