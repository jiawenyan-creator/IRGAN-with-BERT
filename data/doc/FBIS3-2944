  [Text] Pyongyang, March 15 (XINHUA) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors today left the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) after two weeks of inspections 
of the country's nuclear facilities. 
  They declined to talk about the inspection process and said 
that results will not be released immediately. 
  The inspection of seven of the nine DPRK nuclear sites was 
agreed to in a February-15 accord between the IAEA and the DPRK. 
Pyongyang described the accord as one aimed at ensuring nuclear 
safety. 
  The IAEA is expected to negotiate with the DPRK on 
inspection 
of the remaining two nuclear facilities to verify that the DPRK 
is not developing nuclear weapons. 
  The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency suspects that the DPRK 
is developing nuclear weapons in the two facilities. 
  The United States has made the implementation of IAEA 
inspections one of the conditions for opening the third 
U.S.-DPRK high-level meeting, scheduled for March 21 in Geneva.
