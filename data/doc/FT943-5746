FT  02 SEP 94 / People: Amec
Amec, the engineering and construction group which has been struggling to
recover from the recession, has replaced Dennis Clark, 46, head of its
process and energy business, which accounts for about a third of Amec's
Pounds 2.1bn turnover.
Clark is an oil and gas man who took over as managing director of Press, the
offshore engineering operation, after most of its top management team
defected to a rival firm ten years ago. He joined the Amec board in May 1990
and has been responsible for running one of the more resilient parts of
Amec's business.
Clark's departure has surprised some analysts. Amec, which publishes its
interim figures next week, stressed that there was nothing ominous about his
exit. Sources close to the company said it derived from differences in
management style rather than poor financial performance. It is understood
that Amec feels that it has not been as successful in the international
market as it should have been. Ex-Wimpey executive George Payne, 46, who has
been Amec's commercial director since 1993, has taken over as chairman of
Amec's process and energy sector.
