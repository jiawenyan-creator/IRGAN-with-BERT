  [Text] The memorandum on the economic policy of the Russian 
Government and the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is nearly ready 
for signing. The basic indices of this document which will have 
to be sent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been 
agreed, CBR Board Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told INTERFAX. 
He thought that the memorandum could be sent to the IMF before 
the Russian parliament approves the 1994 budget. 
  After analyzing the memorandum the IMF ruling body will 
decide on making the second part, worth $1.5 Bn, of the systemic 
credit available to Moscow. 
  Gerashchenko thought that Russia would have that amount as 
early as in May. The credit will be used to offset the budget 
deficit which is expected to be 62.4 Tn rubles. The credit will 
be distributed through the Russian interbank market.
