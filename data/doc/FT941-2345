FT  22 MAR 94 / Italian newspaper launched
Mr Indro Montanelli, the 84-year-old doyen of Italian journalists, was set
to rediscover his voice today as editor-in-chief of a daily newspaper making
its first appearance on the country's news-stands. La Voce, which is
expected to have a liberal political flavour, is published just in time for
next weekend's general election and a few months after Mr Montanelli stepped
down as editor of Il Giornale after the proprietor, Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
entered politics as leader of Forza Italia.
Mr Montanelli, a veteran anti-communist whose support for the populist
Northern League in last year's mayoral elections in Milan is said to have
been worth thousands of votes, is of such stature that his name will appear
under the newspaper's masthead. He has, however, criticised all sections of
the Italian right wing and, in recent interviews, has advised voters to
'choose the lesser evil' by weighing up candidates and voting tactically. La
Voce, a Milan-based broadsheet with an editorial staff of 75, is aiming at a
break-even circulation of 100,000. Financial backers, which include the
Benetton group, are limited to a 4 per cent stake.
