  [Text] Military sources in Aden have revealed one of the 
barbaric methods used by the military command in Sanaa with the 
pilots who carry out air raids on the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen. The same sources told the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, Aden, that 
the Air Force Command of the bloody al-Ahmar family is making 
the ejectable seats on military planes inoperative. These seats 
are used by pilots to bail out when their planes have been hit. 
  The sources added that this method used by the influential 
military commands without the pilots' knowledge confirms the 
disregard these commands have for the lives of the pilots who 
carry out these savage raids. These sources recalled a similar 
method used by Iraqi military commands with their pilots during 
the Gulf War and said that this method currently used by the 
military commands in Sanaa confirm beyond any doubt the 
involvement of Iraqi military expertise in the dirty war waged 
by the al-Ahmar gang against the Democratic Republic of Yemen.
