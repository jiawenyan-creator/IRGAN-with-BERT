  [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- An editorial appearing in 
TRABAJADORES newspaper, mouthpiece of the Cuban unions, reports 
that over the next 90 days, the new state agencies set up as 
result of recent law-decrees will operate "with the necessary 
number of workers to get the job done." 
  In an editorial entitled "The Central Administration Sets 
the 
Example and Scores the Tune," the weekly newspaper indicates 
that the State Council law-decree" is aimed at ensuring a more 
agile and efficient centralized government more in tune with the 
conditions of the special period." 
  The editorial stresses: "This administration will only 
utilize necessary personnel and will therefore become more 
cost-effective." It adds "attempts to duplicate foreign models 
have resulted in the over-dimensioning and hypertrophy [el 
soberdimensionamiento y la hipertrofia] of the state's central 
apparatus and other areas of the administration." 
  TRABAJADORES points out: "The reduction and reorganization 
of 
the central organizations will be followed by the drafting of 
proposals over the next 90 days for these new state bodies to 
operate with only essential personnel." 
  The unions' mouthpiece stated, however, that "management 
cannot divorce itself from the workers that are being laid off 
but, rather, must ensure their well-being until they have been 
relocated." 
  The magazine emphasizes: "Political courtesy and fraternal 
treatment must be the distinctive trademark of this task, 
together with the determination and strength to see it through." 
  Later, it adds: "The country has sufficient work for all 
workers, officials, specialists, professionals, or technicians 
who seek to serve the fatherland unselfishly and who are willing 
to work to save it." 
  TRABAJADORES concludes by saying: "This is a great 
opportunity we should not squander because it will allow us to 
discard paternalistic trends."
