FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: PosGold issues innovative
fixed-interest 'gold bond'
Poseidon Gold, which is part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy
Poseidon group, has launched an innovative ADollars 200m (USDollars 147m)
fixed-interest 'gold bond' issue, where both principal and interest payments
are denominated in the metal.
The issue overall will represent 400,000oz of gold, and each note 25oz. The
10-year bonds will carry an interest rate of 2.65 per cent for the first
five years, and 3.8 per cent there-after.
Investors will be able to redeem their bonds after five years, although
PosGold said that it expected that the terms of the issue 'would ensure that
investors retain the bonds to maturity in 2004'.
The redemption or maturity values will depend on the price of gold at that
stage.
PosGold said it believed the issue, which was lead-managed by Merrill Lynch,
was the first of its type in international capital markets - adding that it
knew of one other issue, by Freeport-McMoran of the US, which was 'remotely
similar'.
PosGold, which is believed to be one of Australia's largest gold producers,
said that the aim of the issue was to refinance existing bank debt.
The bonds have been rated BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency.
