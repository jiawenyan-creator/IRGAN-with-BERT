FT  26 JAN 93 / Engineering plant to shed 50 workers
PALLION ENGINEERING, which took over Sunderland's last shipyard as a base
for heavy fabrication, is making half its 100 employees redundant, blaming
the recession.
The company also confirmed that Mr Bob Clay, the chief executive, had
resigned. Mr Clay was Labour MP for Sunderland North when he led the
campaign to save Sunderland's last shipyards. He resigned his seat before
the last election.
