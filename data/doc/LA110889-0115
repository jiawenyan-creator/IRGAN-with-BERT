ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN TO ADD 2 MEMBERS 
A suggestion to add two members to the City Council and hold council elections 
by district was rejected by the council Monday on a 3-2 vote. 
Councilman John Kelly, who made the proposal, said it would allow better 
representation of the entire community. 
"Three of the five present council members live south of Walnut Street," Kelly 
said. 
Councilman Earl J. Prescott supported Kelly's idea but the majority disagreed, 
saying Tustin is too small to warrant elections by district. 
"This would make people not accountable to the city as a whole," Councilman 
Ronald B. Hoesterey said. 
Kelly and Prescott disagreed with the majority of the council on another 
election issue as well -- the shift of local elections from November to April. 
Although the change was approved on a 3-2 vote last month, the ordinance was 
reintroduced Monday for the purpose of making a technical change. 
Mayor Ursula E. Kennedy and Councilmen Richard B. Edgar and Hoesterey say they 
support the change because April elections allow greater focus on local issues 
and lower campaign costs for candidates. 
Kelly and Prescott say they support November elections because they cost the 
city less and draw more voters. 
Resident Berklee Maughan told the council that as soon as approval is final, 
Nov. 20, he and other residents will begin circulating a referendum aimed at 
overturning the council's decision. 
The council was scheduled to consider another election measure as well, but it 
was continued until the next meeting at the request of Prescott. He had 
suggested asking voters to decide whether they would prefer elections in April 
or November, but City Atty. James Rourke advised him that the law allows only 
an advisory vote. Prescott said he wants a chance to study Rourke's written 
opinion. SHANNON SANDS
