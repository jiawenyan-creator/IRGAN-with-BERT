Applicant's Representations



1. SBSA is a company organized and existing under the laws of South Africa. SBSA is authorized and regulated in South
Africa by the Office of Banks, Registrar of Banks of South Africa. As of December 31, 1993, SBSA had shareholders' equity
of 3.3 billion South African Rand (U.S. $925 million).

2. SBSA requests an order to permit it, as the custodian or subcustodian of foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents
(collectively the ``Assets'') of investment companies (other than investment companies registered under section
7(d) of the Act), to maintain such assets in the custody of the following entities: Stanbic Bank Botswana, Ltd., Stanbic
Bank Kenya, Ltd., Standard Bank Namibia, Ltd., Stanbic Bank Uganda, Ltd., Stanbic Bank Swaziland, Ltd., Stanbic
Bank Zaire, s.z.a.r.l., Stanbic Bank Zambia, Ltd., and Stanbic Bank Zimbabwe, Ltd. (collectively, the ``Foreign
Affiliates'').

3. The Foreign Affiliates are direct subsidiaries of Applicant or SBIC Africa Holdings, Ltd. (``SBIC Africa'').
SBSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Bank Investment Corporation, Ltd. (``SBIC'') and SBIC Africa is a wholly-owned,
direct subsidiary of SBIC. Each Foreign Affiliate is a bank incorporated under the laws of a country other than the
United States and is regulated as such by the relevant country's government or an agency thereof.



Applicant's Legal Analysis



1. Section 17(f) of the Act provides that a registered investment company may place and maintain its securities and
similar assets in the custody of a bank or banks meeting the requirements of section 26(a) of the Act, a member firm of
a national securities exchange, the investment company itself, or a system for the central handling of securities
established by a national securities exchange. Section 2(a)(5) of the Act defines ``bank'' to include banking institutions
organized under the laws of the United States, member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and certain other banking
institutions or trust companies doing business under the laws of any state or the United States. Neither SBSA nor the
Foreign Affiliates falls within the definition of ``bank'' as that term is defined in the Act.
