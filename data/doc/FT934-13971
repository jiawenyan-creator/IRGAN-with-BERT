FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Murdoch spells out plans for
succession
MR Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, said he
hoped to remain chief executive of the Australia-based international media
company for another 10 years, AP-DJ reports from Melbourne.
He said he expected that one of his children would take over the role of
chief executive in 10 years time, while he became non-executive chairman. Mr
Murdoch, who is 62, said he felt 'very well'.
'The ideal is I would continue doing what I am doing for another 10 years
and hand over the chief executive role to one of my children and stay as a
tolerant, guiding hand, non-executive chairman,' Mr Murdoch said in answer
to a question about retirement plans.
Asked what would happen if he were to 'fall under the proverbial bus' before
these succession plans are implemented, Mr Murdoch said his wife, Anna,
likely would assume the role of News Corporation chairman.
'I don't see her as being the chief executive of the company,' Mr Murdoch
said in an interview with the Herald Sun, one of News Corp's newspapers.
