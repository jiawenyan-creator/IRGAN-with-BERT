PROSTITUTION STING NETS 62 
Sixty-two men were arrested in the sports arena for soliciting prostitutes 
Friday night, marking the San Diego Police Department's second largest 
overnight crackdown, a police spokesman said. 
"Operation John," deploying female police officers dressed as prostitutes, 
swept the Midway, Rosecrans and sports arena area monthly in response to many 
complaints from residents and business owners. 
"We want the community not to be bothered by this business," spokesman Bill 
Robinson said, adding that similar operations are being planned in other parts 
of the city. 
Among the 62 arrested was a 15-year-old, a teacher and a Michigan man in San 
Diego for his brother's graduation from boot camp. So far 211 people have been 
arrested in the sting operations on misdemeanor charges of soliciting for 
prostitution. 
The 62 arrests marked San Diego vice's busiest night since 63 people were 
arrested recently in a similar operation in the 3200 block of Main Street.
