MICHAEL SHAWN DIES; CHOREOGRAPHER 
Michael Shawn, a leading Broadway choreographer who sued the producers of "Legs 
Diamond" claiming that they fired him because he had AIDS, has died at age 45 
of complications from the disease, hospital officials said today. 
Shawn learned that he was infected with the AIDS virus in late 1987 shortly 
before he became the choreographer for "Legs Diamond." He was dismissed from 
his job and sued the producers for $2.75 million in a case that many thought at 
the time could provide a legal precedent for AIDS discrimination cases. But the 
case was settled out of court.
