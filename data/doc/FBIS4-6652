  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- The Economic Planning 
Agency said Tuesday [19 April] regional economies generally 
remain stagnant although some bright factors are seen in Kyushu 
and Hokkaido. 
  In Kyushu, southern Japan, industrial production indexes 
improved consecutively in January and February, compared with 
the preceding months, the agency said. 
  The agency added, however, sales at large retail stores 
remained sluggish in major urban regions, including Tokyo, 
Nagoya and Osaka.
