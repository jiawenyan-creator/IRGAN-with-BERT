  [Text] Amman--Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is 
expected to visit Jordan in the very near future to offer 
condolences to His Majesty King Husayn on the death of the 
mother of all Hashmeites and Jordanians, Her Majesty Queen Zin 
al-Sharaf. 
  Informed Palestinian sources have not ruled out the 
possibility that 'Arafat's visit may start this morning. He 
will brief His Majesty King Husayn on the latest developments in 
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations following the signing of 
the agreement on Palestinian self rule in Gaza and Jericho. The 
agreement was signed in Cairo yesterday.
