  [Text] Seoul, March 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States plan to deploy Patriot missiles at American 
military bases in April, a well-placed source said Monday. 
  The two countries, while emphasizing that they can hold the 
annual joint military drill "Team Spirit" anytime, will wait a 
while before making a final decision on whether and when to 
resume it, the source said. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam told his national 
security aides that the Patriots are purely defensive in nature 
and ordered them to start negotiations with U.S. officials on 
deployment as soon as possible. 
  Gary Luck, commander of UN Forces in South Korea, earlier 
asked President Clinton for the Patriots to beef up his defenses. 
  The Seoul government persuaded the Clinton administration 
against deploying the missiles, however, concerned that it might 
provoke North Korea in the middle of negotiations on Pyongyang's 
nuclear program. 
  Seoul's stance on the Patriots "irritated" Washington at the 
time, the source said on condition of anonymity. 
  As to whether and when Team Spirit would be resumed this 
year, the source said the two sides had not made a final 
decision. 
  "Although the principle is to go ahead with the military 
drill, there are those who think it is an overreaction," said 
the source. 
  Seoul and Washington announced on March 3 that they would 
suspend the drill this year, timed with the arrival of 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors in 
Pyongyang.
