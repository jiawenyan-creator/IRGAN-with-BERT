SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a council-prepared amendment
to a fishery management plan be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval.
The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an amendment, immediately publish a notice that
the document is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider public comment in determining
approvability of the amendment. 


Amendment 7 proposes the following actions. (1) The eastern zone commercial quota for the Gulf migratory group of
king mackerel would be divided into equal quotas for Florida east and west coast fisheries. The Florida east coast
sub-zone would encompass the waters off the east coast of Florida from a line extending directly east from the Volusia/Flagler
County, Florida boundary (29
&cir;25
&rsquo;N. lat.) to a line extending directly east from the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary (25
&cir;20.4
&rsquo;N. lat.). The east coast sub-zone would exist from November 1 through March 31, when the boundary separating
the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel is a line extending directly east from the Volusia/Flagler
County, Florida boundary. From November 1 through March 31, the Florida west coast sub-zone would encompass the waters
off the southeast, south, and west coasts of Florida from the Dade/Monroe County, Florida boundary to a line extending
directly south from the Alabama/Florida boundary (87
&cir;31
&rsquo;06
&rsquo;
&rsquo;W. long.). From April 1 through October 31, when the boundary separating the Gulf and Atlantic migratory
groups of king mackerel is a line extending directly west from the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary (25
&cir;48
&rsquo;N. lat.), the west coast sub-zone would extend from the Monroe/Collier County, Florida boundary to the Alabama/Florida
boundary. (2) The west coast sub-zone quota would be further subdivided into equal quotas for fishermen harvesting
with hook-and-line and those using run-around gillnet gear. (3) Persons would be allowed to fish under the gillnet
quota in the west coast sub-zone only aboard vessels that have endorsements on their Federal commercial mackerel
permits to fish with gillnets in that sub-zone. All harvest of Gulf group king mackerel in the west coast sub-zone by
vessels with such an endorsement would be counted against the gillnet quota. 
Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 7 are scheduled for publication within 15 days.
