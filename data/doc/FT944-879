FT  23 DEC 94 / Pools renew call to change lottery
Football pools operators are renewing their campaign to persuade the
government to do something about their disadvantages compared with the
National Lottery.
The pools have lost a significant slice of their revenue to the lottery and
some executives fear that the viability of their industry, which employs
45,000 full-time and more than 80,000 part-time workers, could be undermined
in the long term.
National Lottery sales are going particularly well in the run up to
Christmas and yesterday Camelot, the lottery operator, revised its estimate
of the Christmas Eve jackpot to Pounds 8m from Pounds 6m.
The lottery, it is believed, has already led to a reduction of about 12.5
per cent in the weekly takings of Vernons, the pools subsidiary of Ladbroke.
Littlewoods, which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the pools market,
concedes that it has been hit by the lottery but Mr Tony Hodge, marketing
manager, said the effect had been 'relatively minimal'. He would not give a
percentage but Littlewoods' revenue drop is almost certainly less than 9 per
cent.
The main concern of the pools companies is the higher percentage of income
they must pay to the government and good causes.
The lottery pays 12 per cent tax and gives a further 28 per cent to good
causes. The pools are taxed at 37.5 per cent and pay a further 5 per cent
plus 5p in every 105p to good causes - sport and the arts.
The last 5p for the Foundation for Sport and the Arts is 'voluntary' and
Vernons says it will consider giving notice to terminate the payment if the
revenue trends worsen.
Vernons, with less than 20 per cent of the market, would also like to see a
fiscally neutral tax banding system introduced to help smaller pools
companies.
Littlewoods also wants the right to advertise on television. Although it is
concerned by long-term damage to its business, it is not at the moment
thinking of ending the 5p payment to the Foundation for Sports and the Arts.
