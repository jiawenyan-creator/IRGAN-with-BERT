THE SIDELINES; 
RAMON RAMOS SHOWS SOME GAIN 
Ramon Ramos, the Portland Trail Blazer who suffered severe head injuries in an 
automobile crash, is showing some signs of improvement, a spokeswoman for 
Oregon Health Sciences University hospital said. 
"He continues to make progress daily and is doing some things that indicate he 
is making some contact," said spokeswoman Marcia Williams. 
Dr. Kim Burchiel, head of neurosurgery for the hospital, said that Ramos is 
progressing as expected and that he thinks Ramos will improve substantially 
over the next month or two. 
The rookie forward was injured when his speeding sports car went out of control 
and flipped on an icy portion of Interstate 5 south of Portland on Dec. 16. 
Williams said Ramos is not in a full coma, but gives no indication he is aware 
of conditions around him.
