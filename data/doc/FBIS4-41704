  [Text] The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
(LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, has left the office of Nizhniy 
Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov that he had seized for two hours 
supported by other deputies of the State Duma and local party 
activists. Zhirinovskiy was not satisfied with the reception he 
had been given and in protest seized the office of the governor, 
currently on a visit abroad. 
  The LDPR leader left the administration building promising 
to 
"kick out" the governor's female secretary and execute his 
assistant by firing squad. 
  At a meeting with the public in the House of Architects, 
Zhirinovskiy spoke against the restoration of the former Soviet 
Union, because in then [as reveived] "the republics would have 
to be fed." Instead, he supported "a Russian state within the 
borders of the former Soviet Union." Zhirinovskiy promised to 
accomplish the task and abolish ethnic formations within Russia 
in five years, if he came in power. 
  At the same meeting, State Duma LDPR Deputy Yuriy Kuznetsov 
said that "only Russians must rule Russia, as Chechens in power 
may squander Russia's assets to their villages, while Jews could 
smuggle them all abroad." 
  On June 28, Zhirinovskiy is scheduled to visit Arzamas-16, a 
center of the nuclear industry.
