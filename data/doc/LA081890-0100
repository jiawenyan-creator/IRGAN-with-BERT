RUELAS REMAINS UNBEATEN; CURRY WINS TUNEUP 
Rafael Ruelas of Arleta ran his record to 20-0 with 17 knockouts by stopping 
Job Walters of Jamaica in the ninth round of a scheduled 10-round featherweight 
bout Friday night. 
Ruelas, 19, who fights out of the Ten Goose Boxing Club in Van Nuys, is ranked 
No. 20 by the World Boxing Council. 
He dropped Walters with a left hook in the first round. 
By the eighth round, Walters' right eye was bleeding and badly swollen. In the 
ninth, Ruelas, 126 1/2, rocked Walters (12-5) with another left hook and then 
landed several punches until referee Toby Gibson stopped the fight at 2:10 of 
the round. 
Walters, 125, came into the fight off impressive victories over former world 
champions Bernardo Pinango of Venezuela and Azael Moran of New York. 
In the main event at Bally's Casino Resort, Donald Curry knocked out Jose Duran 
Martinez with a right uppercut in the fourth round of their middleweight bout. 
Curry, 156, the former world welterweight and WBC super-welterweight champion, 
is the International Boxing Federation's No. 1 middleweight contender and will 
meet champion Michael Nunn Oct. 18 in Paris. 
Curry, of Ft. Worth, improved to 33-3 with 24 knockouts. Martinez, 159, of San 
Juan, Puerto Rico, fell to 15-5, six by knockout.
