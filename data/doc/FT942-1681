FT  23 JUN 94 / Funds invest record Pounds 15bn
Net investment by UK institutions rose by Pounds 2.2bn in the first quarter
of this year to a record Pounds 15.4bn, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday.
The main beneficiaries were UK government securities with a net inflow of
Pounds 5.2bn, the highest quarterly figure since at least the fourth quarter
of 1992. UK pension funds accounted for the majority of this inflow,
investing Pounds 3.3bn - more than the figure for the whole of 1993.
Mr Neil Badger, a CSO statistician, said it was unclear what had accounted
for the shift, although the perception that the UK stock markets were
overvalued may have played a role, as well as the higher yields offered on
the government's heavy calendar of gilts offerings.
Anecdotal evidence from the pensions industry suggests that increasing use
of asset/ liability models may have been a factor.
An increasing proportion of UK pension-scheme members are receiving pensions
or have frozen pensions after redundancy or a move to a new employer.
Pension-scheme actuaries have called on schemes to match liabilities to
these current and deferred pensioners to fixed-income securities and pare
their holdings of equities.
The CSO said pension funds had a net disinvestment in UK equities of Pounds
561m in the first quarter, continuing a trend which began in the third
quarter of last year. They increased holdings of overseas equities by a net
Pounds 178m, reducing holdings of foreign government bonds by Pounds 289m.
Net investment by pension funds increased in the first quarter to Pounds
2.3bn from Pounds 0.9bn in the fourth quarter of last year, the highest
level for investment since the second quarter of 1992.
Anecdotal evidence from the industry suggests that corporate pension
'contributions holidays' financed by hefty surpluses are running out.
