  [Text] Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage said that exports 
of Cuban medicines could serve as part of the payment of its $48 
million debt to Brazil. Two weeks ago, the two countries signed 
an agreement worth $30 million covering the purchase of about 
200 kinds of medicines for distribution in public health 
programs. 
  Lage said the shipment of meningitis vaccine that Brazil 
bought, on which the "use by" dates had expired, will be 
exchanged free of charge. "That is all we can do," he said. On a 
four-day visit to Brazil, Lage also hopes to advance some 
technical-scientific cooperation projects in the petrochemicals 
and tourism areas. "We are open to foreign capital, and are 
specifically interested in Brazil because it is the largest 
country in Latin America," he said.
