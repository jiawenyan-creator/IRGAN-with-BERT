FT  19 AUG 93 / Romanian railway strike at an end
ROMANIA'S nationwide train stoppage ended yesterday as the last strikers
went back to work. The week-long pay dispute had brought the country's
railways to a near standstill and blocked international traffic through the
Balkans, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
The government had threatened to sack all the strikers and replace them with
pensioners unless they returned.
