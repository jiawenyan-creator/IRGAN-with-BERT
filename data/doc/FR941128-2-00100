SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. General 


The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100503) amended the Privacy Act of 1979 (5
U.S.C. 552a) by establishing the conditions under which computer matching involving the Federal Government could
be performed and adding certain protections for individuals applying for and receiving Federal benefits. The Computer
Matching and Privacy Protection Amendments of 1990, set out in section 7201 of Pub. L. 101508, further amended
the Privacy Act regarding protections for such individuals. The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer
matching by Federal agencies when records in a system of records are matched with other Federal, State, or local government
records. Among other things, it requires Federal agencies involved in computer matching programs to: 
(1) Make written agreements with the other agency or agencies participating in the matching programs; 
(2) Obtain their Data Integrity Boards' approval of the match agreements; 
(3) Furnish detailed reports about matching programs to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget; 
(4) Notify applicants and beneficiaries that their records are subject to matching; and 
(5) Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating, or denying an individual's benefits or payments.
