  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] only responded today to the mediators' proposal 
-- one day after the deadline. UNITA has only accepted one of 
the 18 suggestions made by the mediators. For UNITA the only 
point worth considering for Angolan reconciliation is a national 
campaign through the media. Maria de Lourdes Lopes reports from 
Lusaka: 
  [Lopes] The debate on national reconciliation continues. 
UNITA responded today to the draft document on specific 
principles presented by the mediators and by the observers. In 
18 points, UNITA clarified what, in its opinion, should be done 
to achieve national reconciliation. UNITA only used one of the 
mediators' suggestions -- the one advocating a media campaign to 
help pacify tempers. UNITA's response comes one day after the 
deadline set by the mediators. 
  On Tuesday [15 February] morning, when the government's 
delegation handed in its response, UNITA said it needed time to 
study the draft presented by the UN mediators. Alioune Beye 
gave UNITA until the end of Friday afternoon, but the meeting 
set for yesterday did not take place: UNITA wanted more time. 
Today it gave its answer. In the 18 principles it puts 
forward, UNITA dedicates one to its own statutes as the main 
opposition party. Another pertains to the security of its 
leaders. According to a source from the negotiations, who 
declined to give any further details, UNITA also proposed a 
public competition to chose the Republic's symbols. The 
mediators and the observers are already working on the 
documents. Tomorrow morning they are expected to present a 
proposal on specific principles, including the sugestions from 
both sides.
