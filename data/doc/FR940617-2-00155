Exemptions From Rules 10b6, 10b7, and 10b8 During Distributions of Certain French Securities



June 7, 1994 


Pursuant to delegated authority, the Division of Market Regulation issued the following letter granting class exemptions
(``Exemptions'') from rules 10b6, 10b7, and 10b8 (``Trading Practices Rules'') under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate distributions in the United States of securities of certain highly capitalized
French issuers. The Exemptions permit distribution participants and their affiliated purchases to effect transactions
in France that otherwise would be prohibited by the Trading Practices Rules, subject to certain disclosure, recordkeeping,
record production, and notice requirements. 
The Exemptions have been issued in the context of a continuing review of the Trading Practices Rules, and are published
to provide notice of their availability.

English Translation of the Letter



Dear Mr. Becker,



I am writing in connection with possible offerings of equity securities of certain French companies involving a distribution
of some or all of the Securities in the United States.

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The term equity securities shall include equity related securities such as convertible or exchangeable bonds and
warrants. Such equity related securities may be issued by the issuer of the equity securities itself or by a subsidiary
of such issuer. Offerings of straight debt securities are outside the scope of this letter.

</FOOTNOTE>


With reference to the policy statement issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 3, 1993, I am writing
to request exemptions from rules 10b6, 1067 and 10b8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
for French issuers to the extent set forth in part III below.



I. Offerings By French Companies



The structure of an offering of equity securities in a French company varies depending on whether it is a primary or
a secondary offering.



A. Primary Offerings



French law grants shareholders of a French company pre-emptive rights to subscribe for shares issued by such company.
French law also authorizes shareholders, voting at a shareholders meeting, to renounce such pre-emptive rights.
In practice, in the case of a renunciation of such pre-emptive rights, most offerings are conducted so as to grant current
shareholders a priority right to purchase new shares before the general public during a period of 5 to 10 days.



1. Offerings With Pre-emptive Rights



Offerings with pre-emptive rights permit the current shareholders to participate in the capital increase 

pro rata 

or to sell their pre-emptive rights, which are securities separable from the shares, on the market. The existence
of a negotiable pre-emptive right permits detachment of the offering price from the stock market price, because the
shareholders who do not want to participate in an offering can, by selling their rights on the market, be compensated
for the dilution which could result from an offering price which is significantly less than the market price and/or
than their share in the net assets. The discount from the stock market price is generally 10% to 20%. The technique of
an offering with pre-emptive rights is principally used for offerings of shares rather than for those of ``composite
securities'', such as bonds with warrants or bonds convertible into shares, for reasons of valuation and quotation
on the appropriate stock market.
