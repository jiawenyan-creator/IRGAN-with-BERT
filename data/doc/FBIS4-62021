  [Text] Bonn, 11 May--"The results of the first day of the 
visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to the FRG speak for 
themselves. Relations of friendship and trust justify 
themselves. The Russian-German summit meeting produced a 
resolution to the question of the withdrawal of troops from 
Germany." Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who was 
commenting on the results of the talks at the request of the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, said this today. 
  "I do not believe," the minister noted, "that it was right 
to 
whip up passions from all sides over this question and to make 
various statements. Everything can be settled in a normal 
manner, precisely by holding the send-off ceremony for Russian 
troops in Berlin. We will hold some cultural event afterwards 
in Weimar. Therefore, the federal chancellor's idea remains 
alive and in force. And, in essence, such solutions lay the 
foundations for the future." 
  When asked by the ITAR-TASS correspondent what he thought of 
the accord reached during the talks between Yeltsin and Kohl, 
Colonel General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the 
Western Group of Forces, said: "This is a wise decision by our 
leaders."
