SAN DIEGO / INDUSTRY NOTES: HOMEFED LAYS OFF 183 WORKERS IN WAKE OF 2ND-QUARTER 
LOSS 
HomeFed Bank has laid off 183 employees, or 3.7% of its work force, over the 
last two weeks in efforts to trim expenses in the wake of its $108-million 
second-quarter loss. 
The savings and loan said 100 of the layoffs were a direct result of plans to 
scale back single-family loan originations. 
Another 60 of the layoffs were due to HomeFed's closing its 12-office escrow 
division and another 23 due to cutbacks in its commercial banking operation. 
HomeFed would not rule out further layoffs but said none are now planned. 
HomeFed President Robert Adelizzi said the cutbacks were linked to HomeFed's 
plan to "trim down the volume of our loan originations. . . . Instead of $6 
billion in total loan originations, it may be closer to $3 billion" next year, 
Adelizzi said. 
Adelizzi also said HomeFed intends to control its growth, keeping its asset 
level stable at the existing $19-billion level. 
HomeFed's second-quarter loss last month caused a significant reduction in its 
capital, the cushion that protects it against losses. As a result, the thrift 
announced plans to close its out-of-state loan offices, to stop making 
commercial real estate loans and to trim expenses. CHRIS KRAUL
