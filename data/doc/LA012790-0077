METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PIPE BURSTS, FLOODS 4 FLOORS OF HIGH RISE 
Four floors of a downtown Los Angeles high-rise occupied by International 
Business Machines Corp. were flooded early Friday when an air conditioning 
water pipe burst. 
The floors in the Wells Fargo Center at 355 S. Grand Ave. were drenched with 
about 40,000 gallons of water, standing 2 inches deep in some places. 
The 1 1/2-inch pipe apparently ruptured on the 16th floor and the water flowed 
to the 15th, 14th and 12th floors before it was shut off, City Fire Department 
spokesman Jim Wells said. The cause and extent of damage to IBM sales, 
education and corporate offices was not immediately known.
