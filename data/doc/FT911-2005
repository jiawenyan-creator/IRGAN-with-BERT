FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental incurs heavy loss in
first quarter
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier caught up in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings, reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 194.8m, which it
blamed on the domestic recession and the impact of the Gulf war on air
travel.
However, Mr Rick Shuyler, chief financial officer, said he was optimistic
the airline would 'continue to show marked progress with its restructuring
and that the summer months will be quite favourable for the company'.
Continental said it had a first-quarter operating loss of Dollars 157.8m, on
revenues of Dollars 1.3bn. This compared with operating income of Dollars
8.8m and net income of Dollars 21.3m on revenues of Dollars 1.3bn in the
same period last year.
The results were only for Continental Airlines and not other affiliates of
its holding company, which will report consolidated results soon.
Mr Shuyler said: 'The Gulf war had a significant restraining effect on
worldwide travel, but by the end of the quarter we saw a resurgence in
demand. The recession also challenged our ability to develop traffic and
maintain favourable yields during the first three months of the year.'
Continental is considering a reorganisation involving unsecured creditors of
its parent and the main airline business converting into equity.
