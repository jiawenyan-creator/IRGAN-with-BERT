FIRED COACH FILES RIGHTS SUIT AGAINST SCHOOL, NCAA 
Gary Moss, fired as Sam Houston State basketball coach after the NCAA issued 
sanctions against him, has filed a lawsuit against school officials and others, 
including NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz. 
In the lawsuit, filed here Wednesday, Moss claims that his constitutional 
rights were violated because a hearing on his firing was not held. 
In his second season at Sam Houston State, Moss was fired Jan. 7 after the NCAA 
sanctioned him for violations it said he committed while head coach at West 
Texas State. It was the first time penalties were levied against a coach no 
longer at the school. Moss coached the Buffaloes from 1984-87. 
The NCAA's committee on infractions ruled that WTSU illegally recruited players 
and provided them with free airplane travel, cash and use of telephone credit 
cards. 
The NCAA placed Moss on three years' probation, banned him from postseason 
coaching this year and prohibited him from off-campus recruiting and speaking 
engagements during the 1989-90 academic year. 
WTSU was hit with three years' probation and a ban on postseason play this 
year. 
In the lawsuit, Moss also asked District Judge Bill McAdams for a restraining 
order reinstating Moss' salary and other benefits as Sam Houston coach. He also 
requested that school officials not name a replacement. 
Named in the lawsuit were Sam Houston President Elliott T. Bowers, Athletic 
Director Ron Randleman, Vice President of Administration E. Rex Isham, state 
Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox, NCAA Director of Enforcement David Berst and Executive 
Director Schultz.
