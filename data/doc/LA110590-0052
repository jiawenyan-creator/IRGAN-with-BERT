VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
FREEWAY ADVISORIES TO BE BROADCAST 
Motorists seeking to avoid construction-related delays on the Ventura Freeway 
in Los Angeles County can now turn to the airwaves. 
The California Department of Transportation is broadcasting traffic advisories 
on 1610-AM to warn motorists of lane, ramp and connector-road closures caused 
by the Ventura Improvement Project, which will continue until early 1992 in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
The broadcasts in both English and Spanish will air during peak construction 
periods between Thursday and Sunday nights, when post-midnight traffic in 
certain areas is reduced to a single lane in each direction. Roadside signs 
have been erected to alert drivers when the messages are airing. 
The $76.1-million project, begun last November, will add a lane in each 
direction on a 15-mile stretch between Woodland Hills and Universal City.
