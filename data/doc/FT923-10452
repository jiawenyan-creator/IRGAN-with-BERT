FT  30 JUL 92 / Board selection methods attacked
THE WAY non-executive directors are appointed was strongly criticised
yesterday in a survey published by the Stock Exchange and ProNed, an
organisation that promotes their role in British companies, Andrew Jack
writes.
Only 14 per cent of 491 chairman, chief executives, directors, institutional
investors and audit partners believed that the way non-executives were
chosen was satisfactory, while most felt that non-executives were not
effective in their jobs.
Few companies examined had a nomination committee, a written job profile or
a detailed search procedure to help select non-executives. The chairman
generally had dominant influence over their selection.
The majority called for a code of best practice to help formalise
appointments procedures, while more than half of the institutions and
auditors want a more formal selection process that could be explained to
shareholders.
Mr Colin St Johnston, managing director of ProNed, called selection
processes for non-executives 'slapdash' and called for 'a much more
rigorous, independent and objective process of appointment to ensure they
are used effectively'.
