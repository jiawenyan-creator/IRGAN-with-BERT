FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rail fare plans may displease
Tories
THE GOVERNMENT yes-terday appeared to be risking further backbench
displeasure over its rail privatisation plans by proposing only loose
controls over fares in an amendment to the Railways Bill, Richard Tomkins
writes.
Five weeks ago Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, headed off a
backbench revolt over the rail privatisation plans by promising measures to
guard against big fare increases and to ensure continuation of discount
fares for the young and old.
The government's proposals yesterday went before the Lords committee which
yesterday started its detailed examination of the bill.
The new clause on fares does not give the government direct control.
Instead, it authorises the franchising director to tackle the subject in
franchising agreements.
The franchising director is not compelled to do this, however. The clause
only requires it 'if it appears to the franchising director that the
interests of persons who use, or who are likely to use, franchised services
so require'.
The new clause says every franchisee will be required to participate in
every discount fare scheme approved by the franchising director for the
young, elderly or disabled.
