FT  13 DEC 94 / Observer: French lesson
An Englishman was explaining to a Frenchman and his wife what the British
mean by sangfroid. 'It's when you come home early, discover your wife in bed
with your best friend, and slip away unnoticed to return at your normal
time,' he said.
'That's not sangfroid, that's savoir faire,' the Frenchman protested.
'Sangfroid is when you interrupt them, but invite them to carry on.'
'Rubbish,' exclaimed his wife. 'That's laisser-faire. Sangfroid is when your
husband invites you to carry on and your lover can.'
