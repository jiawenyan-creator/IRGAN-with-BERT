FT  02 MAR 93 / Rise in university graduates forecast
those other than the former polytechnics - will be 6.6 per cent higher in
1993 than last year according to the Graduate Employment Service.
A further rise of 8.2 per cent is expected by 1994, bringing the total
increase between 1991 and 1994 to 24 per cent.
Growth in the supply of graduates is not being matched by demand from
employers, the service says. But graduate unemployment has been held down by
the numbers going on to teacher training and further academic study.
