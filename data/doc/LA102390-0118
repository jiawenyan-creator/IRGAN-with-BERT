WORLD PREMIERE OF 'IMPRESIONES' 
When Glendale Symphony Orchestra music director Lalo Schifrin asked his 
audience to observe a moment of silence for the late Leonard Bernstein at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Sunday night, he was paying tribute to a kindred 
spirit. Like Bernstein, Schifrin knows no professional bounds, feeling 
comfortable wherever he chooses to hang his hat as a pianist, composer or 
conductor. 
The difference, of course, is the unfathomable gap between true genius and a 
versatile craftsman. Still, the craftsman can shine in the right setting -- and 
with the world premiere of "Impresiones" Sunday night, Schifrin has come up 
with a most engaging concert piece. 
Inspired by a Federico Garcia Lorca poem, this six-movement, 33-minute trumpet 
concerto is loaded with attractive Spanish- and South American-influenced 
tunes, harmonic colors and rhythms. The scoring is always resourceful, with a 
pronounced Gil Evans influence in the winds, and there are plenty of moments of 
bravado and repose for the flashy, authoritative trumpet soloist, Doc 
Severinsen. 
Some might be put off by sweeping melodic passages that threaten to turn into 
the opening credits of a TV miniseries. Yet "Impresiones" easily held one's 
attention over its long haul, a good sign of sound construction. 
Elsewhere, the concert found the Glendale Symphony in rather mediocre form in 
its season opener. The strings made a messy hash of the admittedly difficult 
Mendelssohn Overture to "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and Schifrin's routine 
reading of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" (in Ravel's orchestration) 
lacked the imagination that he displayed as a composer earlier. RICHARD S.
