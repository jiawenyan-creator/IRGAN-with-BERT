nuclear power station by Vladimir Nazaryan] 
  [Text] [Nazaryan] A year ago, when it became obvious that 
the energy crisis in Armenia was insurmountable and that the 
situation was deteriorating with every passing winter, the 
republic government adopted the decision to de-mothball the 
nuclear power station at Metsamor. Eighteen months were set 
aside for reactivating one of the two 400 MW power units. 
However, soon it became clear that it was impossible to master 
this task single-handed, and that the station was not likely to 
resume production by the following spring. 
  The signing of a Russian-Armenian agreement has brought new 
hope. According to this document, all restoration work 
including recommissioning will now be carried out jointly. The 
Russian side will be responsible for all engineering and 
technical operations necessary to start up the station again, as 
well as for the delivery of nuclear fuel and all help required 
in training specialists. The Armenian side will be in charge of 
the safety and physical protection of the nuclear power station. 
Furthermore, Armenia guarantees that it will not make use of 
nuclear and other special materials needed at the nuclear power 
plant for the production of nuclear weapons or the achievement 
of any other military aims.
