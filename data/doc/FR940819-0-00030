 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) hereby amends the regulations that establish designated ports for the importation,
exportation, and reexportation of plants by adding the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ports at Gulfport,
MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are
listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), or listed under the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The USDA has adequate facilities
and personnel at these ports to qualify the ports as designated ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants under the terms of the Act and CITES. The addition of these ports to the list of designated ports will facilitate
trade and the enforcement of the Act and CITES.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), requires, among other things, that plants be imported, exported,
or reexported only at designated ports or, under certain limited circumstances, at nondesignated ports. Section
9(f) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1538[f]) provides for the designation of ports. Under section 9(f)(1), the Secretary of
the Interior (Secretary) has the authority to establish designated ports based on a finding that such an action would
facilitate enforcement of the Act and reduce the costs of that enforcement. The United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) and the Secretary are responsible for enforcing provisions of the Act and the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) relating to the importation, exportation, and reexportation
of plants listed as endangered or threatened under the Act or listed under CITES. 

The regulations in 50 CFR part 24, ``Importation and Exportation of Plants,'' are for the purpose of establishing
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants. Plants that are listed as endangered or threatened
in 50 CFR 17.12 or in the appendices to CITES in 50 CFR 23.23 are required to be accompanied by documentation and may be
imported, exported, or reexported only at one of the USDA ports listed in section 24.12(a) of the regulations. Certain
other USDA ports are designated for the importation, exportation, or reexportation of specific listed plants. Section
24.12(e) of the regulations contains a list of USDA ports that are, for the purposes of the Act and CITES, designated
ports for the importation, exportation, and reexportation of plants that are not listed as endangered or threatened.
(The USDA regulations in 7 CFR 319.37 contain additional prohibitions and restrictions governing the importation
of plants through those ports.) 

In a March 24, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice (59 FR 13921), the Service proposed that the USDA ports at Gulfport, MS, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, WA, be
listed as designated ports for the importation of logs and lumber from trees that are listed as endangered or threatened
under the Act or listed under CITES. 



Comments Submitted 



The Service's March 24, 1994, notice invited the submission of written comments regarding the proposal for a 60-day
comment period ending on May 23, 1994. One comment was received by that date, from a lumber company. The commenter fully
supported the proposed rule. 



Requests for Public Hearing 



Section 9(f)(1) of the Act provides that any person may request an opportunity to comment at a public hearing before
the Secretary of the Interior confers designated port status on any port. Accordingly, the Service's March 24, 1994,
notice invited public hearing requests, which were required to be received by the Service on or before May 9, 1994.
No such requests were received.
