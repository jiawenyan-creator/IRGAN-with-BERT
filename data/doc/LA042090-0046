AFRIKANERS AGAINST APARTHEID AREN'T RARE 
Scott Kraft's excellent article on Andre Brink on April 17 has one significant 
misstatement. He says that Brink, as an Afrikaner, is a rarity in 
anti-apartheid literature. 
Fortunately, Brink has many peers in his Afrikaans community. 
A generation ago, when Afrikaans authors began to seriously attack the 
shibboleths of their society, the novelists earned the collective title Die 
Sestigers, or Men of the Sixties. One could name a dozen writers, including 
Prof. J. M. Coetzee of Pochefstroom University who won the coveted Booker Prize 
in England. Athol Eugard is both a playwright and novelist. 
Nor were they all male. The sentimental novel about apartheid in Afrikaans was 
written by Elsa Joubert. Entitled "Poppy Nogena," it traces the endless trials 
and tribulations of a black domestic battered hither to yon by government 
regulations. It was a sensational bestseller in Afrikaans, was translated into 
English and became a successful play. 
Whatever their past sins, Afrikaners are redeeming themselves as a moral people 
in their churches, their politics and their literature. Andre Brink is a fine 
example and Kraft does him justice. But he is not a rarity.
