FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Leslie Wise falls to Pounds 2.5m as
increased costs hit margins
INCREASED COSTS, following sterling's devaluation, cut margins at Leslie
Wise Group.
Pre-tax profits at the textiles concern fell 12 per cent, from Pounds 2.86m
to Pounds 2.52m, in the year to November 30 in spite of a 20 per cent
increase in turnover to Pounds 48.7m.
Mr Neil Wise, who took over as chairman at the turn of the year following
the death of his father Leslie, said sales had risen from start-up
operations and from exports. Overseas sales were ahead 30 per cent at Pounds
6.9m.
Mr Wise said the cost of materials bought in dollars or D-Marks had risen by
up to 25 per cent. Negotiations with suppliers and switching the country of
supply would ameliorate the situation. The price increases passed on to
customers might amount to 10 per cent.
Bad debts, including one arising from Berkertex's insolvency, totalled
nearly Pounds 150,000 and the closure of two out of seven start-up design
companies cost a similar amount.
He said bankers to smaller private companies, 'who have normally been
supportive, are acting mercilessly'.
If such a string of short-term problems could be avoided this year, margins
could be rebuilt.
Operating profit was just over 2 per cent down at Pounds 2.84m. Interest
costs rose to Pounds 321,000 (Pounds 51,000). Debt was increased by Pounds
470,000 of final deferred payments on acquisitions dating back to 1988-89.
Year-end gearing stood at 40 per cent on shareholders' funds of about Pounds
7m.
Leslie Wise supplies retail groups such as Burton and Etam. Mr Wise said
there were glimmers of hope of high street recovery but what was needed was
a sustained period of buoyant trading.
The final dividend is held at 2.25p to give an unchanged total of 4p.
Earnings per share slipped to 4.96p (5.8p).
