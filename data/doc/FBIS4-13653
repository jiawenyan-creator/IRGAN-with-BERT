  [Text] Ramallah -- Fatah has expressed its profound 
concern over the escalation of Israeli practices against the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories. This escalation 
has caused the daily fall of martyrs and wounded from the 
bullets of Israeli soldiers at a time when Rabin's government is 
claiming that it is keen on achieving peace and a political 
settlement. 
  A statement issued by Fatah yesterday queried the type of 
peace that Rabin's government is seeking while practicing such a 
systematic policy against the sons of the Palestinian people in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This week four martyrs, in 
addition to scores of wounded, fell in the Ramallah area alone 
from the bullets of Israeli soldiers. 
  The statement noted that this group of martyrs and wounded 
fell while there is talk about peace and at a time when Rabin's 
government is raising a furor over the murder of some Israelis 
and the United States joins with it in condemning these murders. 
Whereas, everyone bites his tongue and does not talk about the 
daily wounds that our people are sustaining at the hands of the 
occupation forces. Even worse, our peoples's reaction is 
depicted as terrorism while no one describes Israel's practices 
as terrorism. 
  The statement stressed that the countries which are trying 
to 
establish peace in the region should, first and foremost, stop 
Israeli practices and the killings. No one should ask our 
people to capitulate and die daily. This is impossible. 
  The statement called on the world to shoulder its 
responsibility in halting Israeli practices.
