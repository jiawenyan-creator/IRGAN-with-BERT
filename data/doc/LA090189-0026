NEWSWIRE 
Greg LeMond, newly crowned world cycling champion and two-time Tour de France 
winner, agreed to a three-year, $5.7-million contract with a combined French 
team. 
An international bidding war sparked by the most dramatic Tour de France finish 
in history has elevated LeMond to the same tax bracket as America's 
highest-paid baseball, football and basketball players. 
He will be paid $1.8 million in 1990, up from a reported $500,000 to $750,000 
this year.
