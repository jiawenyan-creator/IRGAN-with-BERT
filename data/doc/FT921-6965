FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics in Brief
ENERGY: The 12 regional electricity companies will be expected to meet their
obligation to buy the most economic fuel available in future purchases, be
it coal, gas or something else, Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, assured
MPs yesterday.
His remarks - in response to a question from Mr Geoffrey Lofthouse, the
Labour MP for Pontefract and Castleford - followed last week's comments on
the competitiveness of many new gas-fired power stations by Mr Malcolm
Edwards, British Coal's commercial director, who is expected to leave the
company shortly.
The regional electricity companies had been anxious to back independent
generation projects in order to gain bargaining power with National Power
and PowerGen, the two big generators, Mr Edwards has said.
Meanwhile, the government appointed management consultants Ernst &amp; Young to
examine the feasibility of moving the Department of Energy's Petroleum and
Engineering Directorate to Aberdeen.

PUBLIC INFORMATION: Mr John Major is to make a commitment to greater
openness in Whitehall one of the planks of the Citizen's Charter proposals
in the Tory manifesto.
Downing Street said yesterday that Mr Major was particularly interested in
seeing how information which could help the public judge whether they were
getting a better service could be made more available. He was not, however,
attracted to a freedom of information act, which he believed, could have
'perverse effects'.
The prime minister is said to be ready to look at the application of the
'30-year rule' governing official papers.
