  [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The Ministry of Defense 
revealed Friday that the military activities of North Korea's 
Army and Navy are not surpassing peacetime levels while those of 
the Air Force have picked up slightly. 
  In the first briefing on Pyongyang's military activities 
since it decided to keep the media informed on a daily basis, 
the ministry added that the North Korean Air Forces' activities 
involved flight training within the boundaries of their bases 
and no threatening tactical training was being conducted. 
  The ministry quoted radio Pyongyang as saying that "the 
nuclear problem and other outstanding issues could be solved 
smoothly if the United States respected our sovereignty and 
treated us fairly." However, the ministry said Pyongyang was 
waging psychological warfare by also denouncing Seoul through 
its central broadcasting station, which commented that "the 
South's insistence on the inevitability of sanctions on the 
North is an anti-national act which is aimed at hurting (those 
of) the same blood." 
  It said the North's strategy is intended to foster unrest 
and 
confusion in the South. "It is desirable for the people not to 
react sensitively to each threatening word from the North but to 
devote themselves instead to their jobs."
