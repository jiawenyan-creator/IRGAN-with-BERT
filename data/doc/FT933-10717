FT  03 AUG 93 / Recession abroad hampers industry
THE PACE of US economic activity quickened slightly in July, but recession
overseas continued to take a toll on US exports and the vulnerable
manufacturing sector, according to the purchasing managers' index.
The index, a closely watched barometer of the health of manufacturing, rose
to 49.5 per cent from 48.9 per cent in June. A reading below 50 per cent
suggests manufacturing is generally declining.
However, a separate report from the US Commerce Department yesterday said
construction spending, propelled by a big increase in government spending,
rose by 1.2 per cent in June. That was the largest gain this year, following
an increase of 1.1 per cent in May.
The purchasing managers' index, based on surveys by the National Association
of Purchasing Management, had mixed signals for the economy. Exports are
weakening but so are imports, which dropped for the third time this year.
There was some indication that that fall reflected a lessening of imports
from Japan due to a strong yen.
The new orders component of the index began to climb back in July, rising
sharply to 53.1 per cent. But another component, measuring 'orders backlog',
registered its first net decline this year. The inventories index fell to
46.7 per cent, down from 48.2 per cent in June.
Mr Dan Seto, an economist with Nikko Securities, warned of continued
stagnation in the economy as long as manufacturing business continued to
restructure.
The improvement in construction spending stemmed largely from increased
outlays for highways and other government projects. Spending in June rose to
a seasonally adjusted yearly rate of Dollars 460.1bn (Pounds 308.7bn) - a
gain of Dollars 5.5bn.
But private construction spending, a much more important component in
economic recovery, was up only 0.3 per cent in June compared to May.
