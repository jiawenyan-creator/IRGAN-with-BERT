FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cullen's dips to Pounds 608,000
CULLEN'S HOLDINGS, the food retailer, experienced a fall in annual profits
despite a strong performance from its neighbourhood food stores and an
increase in turnover from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 20.6m.
The pre-tax figure for the year to March 1 fell from Pounds 825,000 to
Pounds 608,000, reflecting primarily the decline in profits from the sale of
franchises on existing stores.
Retail operations contributed Pounds 509,000 to operating profits, an
increase of almost 40 per cent over the previous year, reflecting the
strength of the neighbourhood food store operation.
The company has launched two new food retail formats, a prototype patisserie
cafe and chicken and ribs restaurant which also supplies speciality foods to
the stores.
Development and launch costs of these prototypes have been written off
within the Pounds 146,000 exceptional items, which also include compensation
paid to a former director.
There is currently no debt and an unchanged dividend of 0.5p is recommended,
payable from earnings of 1.5p (2.8p).
