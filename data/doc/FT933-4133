FT  10 SEP 93 / Jobs rule favours lower castes
INDIA'S ruling Congress (I) party has said that 27 per cent of civil service
jobs are to be reserved for socially deprived citizens, writes Shiraz Sidhva
and agencies in New Delhi.
But it denied yesterday that the move, announced on Wednesday, was purely
for electoral gain with polls due in five states over the next few months.
The announcement came three years after nearly 100 people killed themselves
in protest over a similar proposal.
Some 22 per cent of government jobs are already reserved for India's
so-called disadvantaged castes.
'We have only fulfilled a promise we made 40 years ago in our party
manifesto,' said a Congress (I) spokesman, reacting to a warning from the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India's largest opposition party, not to
'politically exploit' the 'sensitive issue'.
The Hindu fundamentalist party supported the government's move, but said 'no
single party could take credit' for implementation of the recommendations by
an official commission 14 years ago.
