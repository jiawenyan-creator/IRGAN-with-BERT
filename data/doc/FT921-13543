FT  21 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes below
21,000 on investment trust selling
Tokyo
SHARE prices plunged on selling by investment trusts and financial
institutions, and the Nikkei average closed below 21,000 for the first time
since October 1990, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei finished 407.55 down at 20,913.82 as arbitrage-related trading
and selling by investment trusts continued to dampen sentiment. The index
hit a high of 21,381.00, but later fell to the day's low of 20,684.74 in the
afternoon.
Volume eased to 220m shares from Friday's 240m. Declines overwhelmed
advances by 853 to 128, with 142 issues unchanged. An estimated 263 stocks
dropped to their lowest levels since the beginning of last year. The Topix
index of all first section issues lost 25.35 to 1,574.91, although in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended just 0.48 off at 1,205.50.
In spite of foreign buying, many market participants fear that the index
could fall below 20,000. Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg commented: 'There is
evidence of further selling by domestic investors.'
However, some said the market was oversold. 'The difference between the
levels of the 200-day moving average and the daily index movements are
overstretched,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. However, he added that
a recovery depended on participation by domestic institutions.
Fund managers at domestic life insurers said they were ready to buy shares
once the Nikkei dropped below 20,000. Arbitrageurs, on the other hand, were
seen stepping up selling as the gap between futures prices and the cash
market narrowed.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y3,000 to a record low of Y698,000.
Leading high-technology shares were also weak, with Mitsubishi Electric down
Y4 to Y558 and Toshiba losing Y12 to Y624.
Akai Electric dropped Y45 to Y660 on reports that the company had projected
a 70 per cent fall in profits for the current year to November.
Banks were seen actively cross-trading to realise profits ahead of the March
book closing. Shares in regional banks were actively traded, with Chiba Bank
down Y63 to Y987.
Some automobile makers were higher on hopes that the US Big Three auto
companies' plans to increase production in the first quarter would alleviate
the pressure from the US on Japanese car makers. Toyota Motor advanced Y20
to Y1,420 and Honda Motor gained Y10 to Y1,430.
In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 506.74 to 22,273.10, its lowest level
since January 1988, on small-lot selling and margin liquidations. A total of
109.4m shares changed hands.
