FT  25 JUN 92 / Call for guidelines in corporate NHS
HEALTH authority and trust hospital boards should agree a set of principles
governing their corporate behaviour, Mr Philip Hunt, director of the
National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, said yesterday.
Mr Hunt, speaking at the opening of the association's conference in
Harrogate, joined a growing call for the National Health Service to develop
its own distinct managerial ethic.
In addition to a code of ethics for managers, said Mr Hunt, health boards
needed to 'accept their responsibility for setting the parameters within
which their managers operate'. This would involve an authority declaring its
commitment to factors like quality objectives and accountability to the
community.
He said there was a need to establish a clearer strategic, long-term vision
for the NHS, moving away from interminable debates about structures and
regional tiers of management. This must include giving more attention to the
personal development of staff and enhancing their contribution to the
service.
Mr Bill Darling, association chairman, called on the government to give
assurances on the introduction of arrangements for the care of elderly and
handicapped people in the community. Ministers are determined the reforms
will go ahead in spite of worries that they might complicate the
introduction of the council tax. But important funding issues remain to be
resolved.
