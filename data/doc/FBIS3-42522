  [Text] St. Petersburg. At the Central Scientific Research 
Institute of Robot Technology and Technical Cybernetics 
specialists are completing testing a manipulator for the Buran, 
a multiply reusable space ship. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-USP-001C-14A>           Spatial Tests of the Manipulator </FIG>


  This original development of the body of institute 
scientists 
and designers is intended for putting satellites and scientific 
modules into orbit and removing them from orbit and has the same 
many degrees of freedom as the human hand. The length of the 
space "arm" is 15.3 m, its mass is 350 km and the rate of 
movement of a load weighing up to 30 tons (in space) is about 4 
cm per second. The principal model of "arm" control is 
automatic, but a manual mode, with the operator's intervention, 
also is possible. 
  The photograph shows finalization of spatial tests of the 
manipulator.
