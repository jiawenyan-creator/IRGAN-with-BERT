1 KILLED, 2ND SHOT IN DRIVE-BY ATTACK 
A 19-year-old man was killed and another person wounded Tuesday during a 
drive-by shooting attack on a group of people standing in front of a house in 
El Modena, an unincorporated area within Orange, authorities said. 
Neither victim was identified by sheriff's deputies. 
The shooting occurred about 6:40 p.m. when a gray Honda sedan with four or five 
men inside pulled up outside the house on the 18800 block of Vine Street, 
Mendez said. 
"One of the suspects leaned out the window of the car and fired several shots 
at the group," Sheriff's Department Lt. Jay Mendez said.
