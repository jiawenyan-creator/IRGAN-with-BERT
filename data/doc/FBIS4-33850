  [Text] The assessment of the first year of government 
can only be described as positive, Defense Minister Mario 
Rene Enriquez stated yesterday. 
  We have currently entered a phase in which social 
tranquillity and the return of peace is one of the 
administration's major achievements, realized through 
strengthening the constitutional system and respect for it, in 
order to make the law prevail in our country, the minister 
said. 
  He noted that the crisis the country experienced last year 
has not been totally overcome since the reasons that led to it 
still exist, adding that overcoming it will depend on the entire 
Guatemalan people. Even the peace process falls within this 
framework, he added, since every topic is being discussed with 
utmost seriousness, seeking to resolve the other parties' 
demands, which go beyond constitutional order. This does not 
mean, however, that there is no political commitment to sign an 
agreement to end the armed conflict, for which the reduction of 
the Army will be considered a necessity at the end of this 
century. 
  It is worth noting, he said, that peace in 
our country does not just constitute signing a document, rather 
meeting the economic needs of the majority of the people of 
Guatemala, combating extreme poverty until it is eradicated, and 
gradually overcoming the signs of an underdeveloped country. 
This government is establishing the bases to make this an 
irreversible reality for future governments. 
  He added that the current situation establishes a 
redefinition of the role the armed institution plays in 
Guatemalan society, since it is now in all areas of national 
territory, because, it goes without saying, this is the role the 
Constitution mandates.
