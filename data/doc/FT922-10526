FT  30 APR 92 / Amazons sail to rescue of boatyard
THE Nancy Blackett, a 28-foot cutter once owned by the writer Arthur
Ransome, has come to the aid of an ailing family-run boatyard business.
The cutter was named after Ransome's heroine in his most famous book, the
children's adventure story Swallows and Amazons. Nancy was the captain of
the Amazon, 'a fine little ship, with varnished pine planking'.
In recent years, the Nancy Blackett has been less than fine, languishing in
Scarborough harbour, sunk and a danger to shipping. Now, with advice from
the Rural Development Commission, the cutter has been partly refitted and
made ready for commercial use by Harbour Marine Services, a small boatyard
in Southwold, Suffolk.
Just over a year ago, Mr John Buckley, the owner of the business, was
suffering through a combination of spiralling interest rates, customer debts
and cashflow difficulties. He approached the commission, the government
agency that promotes the economic and social wellbeing of rural communities.
He said: 'It's amazing what you spend without realising it. The commission
sent an adviser along who told us how to keep a tighter control on things,
how to talk to the bank manager, and talk back to him.'
Advice has included taking on the contract to complete the refitting of the
Nancy Blackett. The contract is worth only Pounds 3,500 a year in
maintenance - some 10 per cent of the boatyard's annual turnover - but is
expected to bring in many additional local and inter-national customers
because of the popularity of the boat.
