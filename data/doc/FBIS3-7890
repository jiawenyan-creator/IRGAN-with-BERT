  [Text] Sofia, February 25 (BTA) -- Following is the full 
text of a press release which BTA received from the press centre 
of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry: 
  "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria 
has been following closely developments in the Middle East. It 
has welcomed the positive results achieved in the 
conflict-settlement negotiations between Israel and Palestine. 
However, the fact that in the last few months enemies of the 
peace process have been stirring up tensions by terrorist acts 
against members of the Arab and Jewish communities is cause for 
serious concern. The latest tragic sanguinary incident in 
Hebron bears further evidence of the difficulties with which the 
road to a peaceful settlement is strewn. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, while condemning this act of terrorism which caused the 
death of dozens of innocent people, expresses its conviction 
that the sensible approach will prevail and that such extremist 
acts would not invalidate the progress achieved so far and block 
the further development of the Middle East peace process."
