FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: The over 45s: possessed of wisdom but rejected in
advertising (2)
Sir, Those of us who have reached the magical age of 45 might be intrigued
by one aspect of Diane Summers and Catherine Milton's article 'On the Shelf
at 45' (Management, May 19). The authors remind us that 'Ageism is against
the law in the US - but unlike racism and sexism it is not outlawed in job
selection in the UK.' There is no requirement that your newspaper perpetrate
the de facto although not de jure inequities in appointments advertising in
the FT.
I often wonder about the age of the editors and sub-editors who glance
through the myriad notices in your paper and read phrases such as 'the ideal
candidate will be 26 to 35 years of age'. I work with 70-year-olds who have
the vitality and vision of any starry-eyed young executive you would want to
meet. I have worked with 30-year-olds who are stodgy fossils dragging down
an organisation.
The place to begin ending the stereotypes is in your own advertisements.
