 

Equipment and Facilities Requirements


All poultry slaughtering establishments would be required to comply with the same equipment and facility requirements,
which would be essentially those of the present SIS, NELS, and NTIS inspection systems, extended to accommodate inspection
at the proposed on-line/off-line inspection station. For example, establishments would have to furnish adjustable
inspection stands and shadow-free lighting with a minimum intensity of 200 foot candles and a color rendering index
of 85 at the inspection stations. Also, guidebars would have to be installed at both inspection stations in all establishments
to permit birds to be moved smoothly and consistently to the edge of the trough running below the conveyor so that birds
would be properly presented to the FSIS inspector.


Linespeed


Maximum linespeeds allowed under optimal conditions would remain the same under the proposed system. The proposed
system does not prescribe specific hand motions which in the past have been a determining factor in the rate at which
an inspector could inspect each bird. This system would allow the inspector flexibility in the technique used to inspect
each bird. Also, this proposal would eliminate the presentation for FSIS inspection of those birds with condemnable
conditions.
FSIS also considered the impact linespeeds have on the safety and wholesomeness of poultry. A study was conducted
between June 1990 and May 1991 at a poultry establishment to determine if the microbiological quality of poultry carcasses
was different when processed at varying linespeeds. The general conclusion was that mean bacterial counts and 

Salmonella 

prevalence did not change significantly with varying processing linespeeds.

Also, there are data to support the incidence of 

Salmonella 

on whole broiler carcasses declined from 36.9% to 25.0% between 1979 and 1992 irrespective of changes in linespeeds.

Other factors do impact the microbiological quality of the product such as chlorine and other antimicrobial treatments
as well as process control and the adherence to good manufacturing practices by the establishment.

Based on this information, maximum inspection rates for young chickens would remain at 70 birds per minute for establishments
without approved slaughter PQC programs and at 91 birds per minute for establishments with approved slaughter PQC
programs. The rates for turkeys with J-type opening cuts and weighing under 16 lbs. would be 20 birds per minute at establishments
without such PQC programs and 51 birds per minute at establishments operating such PQC programs. The rates for such
turkeys weighing more than 16 lbs. would be 16 birds per minute without such PQC and 41 birds per minute with such PQC.
The rates for turkeys with bar-type opening cuts weighing under 16 lbs. would be 20 birds per minute at establishments
without PQC programs and 45 birds per minute at establishments operating PQC programs. The corresponding rates for
such turkeys weighing over 16 lbs. would be 16 birds per minute without a PQC program and 35 birds per minute with a PQC
program. (See Table 1.)
