  [Text] Tokyo, April 23 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) have searched branch offices of four major shutter makers 
suspected of operating a cartel, sources within the commission 
said Saturday [23 April]. 
  The offices, in Hiroshima Prefecture in western Japan, were 
checked to see if they were operating a cartel over private 
construction projects there, the sources said. 
  The four makers -- Sanwa Shutter Corp., Bunka Shutter Co., 
Suzuki Shutter Mfg Co. and Toyo Shutter Co. -- are suspected of 
conducting prearranged bidding and making secret price 
arrangements for construction projects in the prefecture for the 
past several years. 
  The FTC suspects the four makers of violating the 
antimonopoly law. It is also investigating branches of the four 
firms in other regions over suspected similar illegal 
activities, the sources said. 
  The head of the general affairs department of Toyo Shutter 
said the FTC made an inspection of its Hiroshima branch in 
January or February this year, but denied it was involved in 
forming cartels. 
  The four companies account for about 80 percent of the total 
sales of shutters in Japan, industry sources said. 
  Sanwa, Bunka and Suzuki are based in Tokyo and Toyo is based 
in Osaka.
