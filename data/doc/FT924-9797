FT  04 NOV 92 / Hurd in talks with Danes
Britain last night reaffirmed its desire to avoid upsetting the Maastricht
ratification process, in spite of difficulties posed by Denmark's proposals
for changes in the treaty, writes David Marsh, European Editor. In talks
between Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, and Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, his Danish opposite number, in London the British
government said it wanted to work towards an accord with Denmark without
'reopening' the treaty to fresh negotiation.
