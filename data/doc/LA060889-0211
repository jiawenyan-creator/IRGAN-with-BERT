THE SIDELINES; 
UNION FILES GRIEVANCE FOR ALBERT HALL 
The Major League Baseball Players Assn. has filed a grievance on behalf of 
former Atlanta Braves outfielder Albert Hall, who was released this spring 
after he voluntarily sought treatment for alcohol abuse. 
The grievance charges that the release was without cause and seeks 
reinstatement to the Braves for Hall, who signed a minor-league contract with 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 23 and has since played for their Class AAA 
affiliate in Buffalo. 
Hall, 31, entered an Atlanta rehabilitation clinic Feb. 21 for treatment of 
alcohol dependency. After completing the 28-day program, Hall joined the team 
in West Palm Beach on March 22, eight days before the club left spring 
training. He appeared in two games as a pinch-runner and never had an at-bat 
before being given his unconditional release March 31. 
Hall would have earned $250,000 this year but the Braves absolved themselves of 
Hall's contract upon releasing him.
