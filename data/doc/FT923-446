keeping the wheels turning

URBAN TRAFFIC congestion is not a new problem, but new solutions are being
sought.
Where once planners accommodated traffic growth by building more roads, in
many towns and cities this is no longer seen as environmentally acceptable.
As a result, public transport is increasingly coming back into its own.
However, as demand for public transport grows, so does the problem of who
should pay for it. Governments cannot afford to pick up the bill, and the
difficulties of obtaining developer contributions were highlighted earlier
this year when cash-strapped Olympia &amp; York, the developer of Canary Wharf
in London's Docklands, defaulted on its planned contribution to the cost of
extending London Underground's Jubilee Line.
The solution, according to Chris Bushell in his foreword to the annual
edition of Jane's Urban Transport Systems, is to charge motorists for use of
the roads and to apply the proceeds to the provision of better public
transport. This in turn might tempt more motorists to abandon their cars.
In practice, however, political realities have discouraged the widespread
application of this idea. Hence, this comprehensive guide to the state of
urban transport around the world highlights - in sometimes depressing detail
 -a widening gap between supply and demand, a situation which is likely to
persist as long as the nettle remains to be grasped.
