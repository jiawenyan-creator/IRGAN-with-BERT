FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Expansion for Great-West Life
Great-West Life, a key company in Mr Paul Desmarais's North American
financial services group, is taking effective control of Confederation Life,
Canada's fourth biggest life company, with an initial cash infusion of
CDollars 225m.
The planned merger will create Canada's biggest group health and life
company.
Confederation, a mutually-owned company with US and European operations, was
caught by the property market collapse and lost CDollars 29m in 1993 after a
CDollars 137m loan loss provision. It finished 1993 with nearly CDollars 1bn
of non-performing assets. Total assets were almost CDollars 20bn (USDollars
14.4bn).
Great-West, held indirectly by Mr Desmarais's Power Corp of Canada, now
ranks as Canada's third biggest life company with CDollars 25bn assets. Its
business is split evenly between Canada and the US.
It will buy CDollars 75m of Confederation preferred stock and make another
CDollars 150m capital available, and take a majority of boardroom seats.
Several other Confederation assets will be sold and the total initial
capital infusion will rise to CDollars 400m.
But Great-West will not assume Confederation's troubled mortgage and
property portfolio.
Negotiations were complicated by problems in linking a mutual company with
shareholder-owned Great-West. About 276,000 Confederation policyholders are
likely to approve the deal and the government reaction was positive.
