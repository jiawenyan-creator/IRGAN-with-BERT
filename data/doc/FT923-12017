FT  21 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Europe suffers a crisis of confidence
EUROPEAN government bond markets were hit by a crisis of confidence
yesterday, suffering a sharp fall early in the day until intervention by
central banks in the foreign exchange markets relieved fears of higher
European interest rates.
The central banks of several European countries sold D-Marks and bought
dollars in the afternoon session, lifting the pressure on weaker currencies
within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Italian government bond market was worst hit by the initial bout of
selling, since the lira is seen by international investors as a prime
candidate for devaluation within the ERM. On the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, the September bond future plummeted from an
opening level of 93.61 to hit a low of 91.85.
On the cash market the May 2002 fixed-rate bond closed at 91.88, for a gross
yield of 13.97 per cent, having closed on Friday at 93.35. Shortly before
the central banks intervened the 10-year bond hit a low of 91.30 - a full
two points below Friday's close.
The persistent weakness of the Italian market in recent weeks has been
driven by concern over the long-term future of the lira within the ERM.
Yesterday's foreign exchange intervention pushed the D-Mark lower, relieving
pressure on the Italian currency.
Against the D-Mark, the Italian unit recovered from L762 to around L760 by
the close. This was enough to stimulate a rally, as investors moved to cover
short trading positions by buying stock.
The Italian market is unlikely to recover until the pressure on the lira is
removed. Analysts noted yesterday that the Italian authorities are
supporting the currency by maintaining very high money market interest
rates, potentially damaging the financial system. Yesterday one-month
interbank funds were trading at around 19 per cent, from a stable level of
around 12 1/2 per cent before the latest bout of volatility.
The pattern was repeated in other European markets. In Paris, the benchmark
10-year 8 1/2 per cent government bond closed on a yield of 9.03 per cent,
from 8.97 per cent on Friday. The yield spread over German government bunds
at this maturity remained at 88 basis points.
GERMAN government bond prices may have moved less violently than those of
most other European markets yesterday, but they still experienced what by
most measures was a highly volatile day. With volume on Liffe running at a
large 90,000 contracts, the bund futures contract, which had opened at
87.21, plunged to 86.75 before recovering after the intervention in the
exchange markets to 87.12.
The market now has its eyes fixed on June's growth in broad money, expected
to be announced this week.
THE UK government bond market first fell in line with sterling on the
foreign exchange market before rallying as the UK currency gained ground.
The benchmark long-dated gilt, the 9 per cent stock maturing 2011, closed at
100 15/16 for a yield of 8.89 per cent, having opened at 101 5/32 .
On Liffe, the September gilt futures closed at 98.15, up slightly from 98.13
at the opening and well above the low of 97.25 hit shortly before central
banks intervened against the D-Mark. Volume was an active 49,000 contracts.
Sterling fell below DM2.83 in early afternoon before central banks selling
the German currency allowed sterling to improve to DM2.8410 by late
afternoon in London.
The market was little moved by money supply figures for June which pointed
to a depressed state of domestic economic activity. Narrow money, M0, fell
0.8 per cent in the month, for a year-on-year rate of growth 1.3 per cent.
Analysts said short-dated gilts are unlikely to gain until investors believe
that the next move in UK interest rates will be down and money market
interest rates move lower. Yesterday interbank funds traded at 10 3/8 - 10
1/4 per cent from two months to one year, against a base lending rate of 10
per cent.
WEAKNESS in overseas and domestic equity markets modestly boosted US
Treasury prices yesterday morning.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  1/4 at 103
29/32 , yielding 7.657 per cent. The two-year note, however, was down  1/32
at 101 11/32 , yielding 4.254 per cent.
The sustained decline in worldwide stock markets sparked early buying of
government securities yesterday by retail and speculative players in
anticipation that investors would be lured from falling equities into
Treasuries.
Apart from the equity-related business, trading activity was quiet, with
participants mostly holding fire until after Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to
Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. The market
hopes that Mr Greenspan will provide some insight into the Fed's current
views on the economy and monetary policy.
