  [Text] Uzbekistan has cut by one-quarter the deliveries of 
natural gas to Kazakhstan. This is already the second penalty 
since the beginning of this month on the part of the Uzbek side, 
and it is connected with Kazakhstan's arrears in payments, which 
amount to $90 million U.S. dollars to date.
