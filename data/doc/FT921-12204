FT  28 JAN 92 / Private banks start to open in Taiwan
PRIVATELY owned banks have begun opening in Taiwan this month, ending a
40-year monopoly by government-run institutions and setting the stage for
intense competition.
Grand Commercial Bank and Dah An Commercial Bank have begun operating, and
13 more are due to to follow soon under licences issued last May. The new
banks have a minimum capitalisation of Dollars 400m (Pounds 221m) and are
backed by some of the biggest names in Taiwanese industry.
Among shareholders are Lucky Cement, Far Eastern Department Stores, Asia
Cement, Evergreen Shipping, Formosa Plastics, China Rebar, Pacific
Enterprises, Tainan Spinning, President Business Group.
The change is part of the ruling Nationalist (KMT) government's programme of
financial liberalisation, which in 1991 included facilitation of trading in
bonds and foreign exchange, and allowed trust companies to apply to convert
to banks.
With their targeting of medium and small businesses, the new banks will also
play a role as the first alternative to Taiwan's underground financial
markets. The government banks' unwillingness to lend to any but fully
collateralised concerns has meant that underground banks have flourished.
Conservatism about lending stems from the government's tight monetary policy
to avoid the mistakes which led to hyper-inflation when they were in power
on the mainland over 40 years ago.
Mr Peter Kurz, of Baring Securities, said Taiwan's large supply of capital
and strong manufacturing base gave it the potential to be a key financial
power worldwide, although it lacked the necessary financial services as yet.
