FT  07 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Thin volume as world follows the Dow
The unanimity with which world equity markets followed the US lead in last
week's rally is reflected in the fact that every single national component
of the FT-Actuaries World Index rose in local currency terms. However, the
increases were often achieved on thin, holiday-week volume.
Wall Street, moving up steadily on the back of the Federal Reserve's
pre-Christmas one-point cut in the discount rate, rose by 3.0 per cent. US
share prices are now 10.4 per cent above the level of a month ago, and 31
per cent higher than they were at the depths of the pre-Gulf war gloom in
early January 1991. Japan moved up in response to a half-point reduction in
the official discount rate on Monday December 30.
The biggest jump came in Finland, one of the worst performers in 1991, where
there was a one-week rise of 7.8 per cent. Other Scandinavian markets showed
mixed results. Share prices in Norway, seriously eroded by banking scandals
in 1991, and by weakness in the shipping and oil markets just before
Christmas, recovered to register the next best rise in Europe. Sweden put in
a below-par performance, with Ericsson, once mightily fancied, still licking
its wounds and brokers recommending sales into the recent bounce in the
shares.
There were strong gains in Australia, up 4.3 per cent as a new team of
Treasury ministers took over the steering of the economy; in Mexico, up 3.5
per cent after the country figured in year-end reviews as the
best-performing bourse of 1991; and in the UK.
Continental Europe lagged behind on aggregate, Wall Street-influenced
bourses in Amsterdam and Zurich outperforming the rest.
The poorest performers were still able to eke out an increase on the week.
South Africa lost its way on weak precious metal prices; and in Malaysia,
the government investment fund, which has been buying recently, was absent
from the market for part of last week.
