FT  13 JAN 93 / Ulster troops fired without warning
UNDERCOVER troops shot and killed an IRA terrorist without first giving him
a chance to surrender, an inquest in Northern Ireland ruled last night.
The decision by the coroner's jury in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, that troops
did not challenge Seamus McElwaine could open the way for legal action by
his relatives.
In the shooting, which took place nearly seven years ago near the village of
Roslea, Co Fermanagh, McElwaine was killed and another terrorist wounded as
they prepared a culvert bomb ambush on security forces.
At the time McElwaine was on the run from the top-security Maze prison after
being part of a IRA jailbreak.
The inquest jury also decided that five minutes after the four soldiers
involved first shot McElwaine, they fired again as he lay injured.
The troops insisted that the pair were challenged just before they opened
fire.
Last night Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, called for the four
soldiers to be charged with murder and for Mr Archie Hamilton, the defence
minister, to face criminal charges.
It claimed that the ruling once again highlighted Britain's 'shoot-to-kill'
policy.
