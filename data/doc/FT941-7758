FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Rothschild looks to China
NM Rothschild is to set up a representative office in Shanghai to build up
its corporate finance and bullion finance operations in China.
The company has received approval from the People's Bank of China, and the
office will open next month.
Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman, said: 'Rothschilds began doing business
in China 150 years ago. Conditions have never been more promising.'
Rothschild, in an alliance with Smith New Court, its 26.5 per cent-owned
associate, was one of the first merchant banks to compete for mandates for B
shares - China-listed shares that could be owned by foreign investors.
The merchant bank is keen to participate in financing bullion projects in
China, an area where foreign involvement is soon expected to be allowed.
The office will employ only a small number of staff, but its primary aim
will be to raise the bank's profile in Shanghai, which is rapidly evolving
as China's new financial centre.
