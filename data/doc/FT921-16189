FT  06 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Increase reported in use of
performance pay
PERFORMANCE pay is gradually filtering down organisations from executives to
the shopfloor, according to a survey by Incomes Data Services, the pay
analysis organisation.
IDS remains sceptical about many aspects of performance pay and says pay
policies designed for a period of competitive expansion may not be suitable
for harsher times.
A survey of IDS's subscribers shows that 25 per cent of companies have an
element of merit pay for manual workers. For salaried staff, more than 80
per cent use merit awards.
IDS says a surprising number of companies have a uniform 'general plus
merit' policy for all employees but few companies have wanted, or been able,
to introduce an entirely merit-based approach.
This contrasts sharply with France where companies have adopted merit pay on
such a scale that less than half the manual workers covered by the annual
Ministry of Labour survey receive a standard general increase. Nine out of
10 of France's biggest companies had a 'general plus merit' policy in 1990.
In Britain merit pay systems introduced for manual workers focus on skills
assessment and acquisition, usually associated with new working methods.
