FT  26 FEB 93 / SE criticises annual reports
NEARLY 30 per cent of quoted companies failed in their most recent annual
reports to meet the requirements laid down by the Stock Exchange.
The exchange said it had written to all the companies warning them to make
amends in their next annual report.
Some 648 of the 2,200 quoted companies did not comply with the continued
listing obligations laid down by the exchange in its regulatory 'Yellow
Book'.
Errors included omitting to provide a breakdown of results by business
segment or region, and failure to provide sufficient detail of borrowings.
