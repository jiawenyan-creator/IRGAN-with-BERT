  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman announced 
that four soldiers were killed and five wounded in a Hizballah 
ambush in south Lebanon this morning. Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq 
told us a short time ago that it was a planned ambush that 
involved at least 15 Hizballah terrorists, as well as other 
forces which fired from a distance. Syria could always prevent 
such attacks, Lieutenant General Baraq told our correspondent 
Moshe Nussbaum. 
  [Begin recording] [Baraq] At around 1100 this morning one of 
our patrols, which was opening up a road to Sujud, was ambushed 
with light weapons and RPG fire from several hundred meters 
away, as well as with Sagger missiles from a distance. We 
sustained several casualties in the initial attack. A firefight 
ensued and lasted about an hour. All together, we have four 
fatalities -- I can not give you their names because their 
families have not yet been notified -- and five casualties. 
Three casualties were sustained in the incident itself and two 
others later. I wish to express the condolences of the entire 
IDF to all the families. These soldiers were among our best 
fighters. 
  A war has been going for some time along the Lebanese 
border. 
We regrettably suffer fatalities. We cause heavy losses to the 
other side, but we are also having a tough time. Following the 
conflagration, there were exchanges of fire in the region. We 
rushed in extra forces, including helicopter gunships. Later, 
there were several Israel Air Force attacks against targets from 
which the perpetrators of the attack originated, as well as 
other sites. I assume that the other side also sustained 
casualties. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] To what extent can 
responsibility for the incidents be placed on Syria? 
  [Baraq] Hizballah is responsible. We hold them mainly 
accountable for this, and we will make them pay. In our 
opinion, had the Syrians been interested they could have 
contributed to an effective action by the Lebanese Government to 
restore calm or cease Hizballah activity, but they are not doing 
so. It only depends on them and the Lebanese. We will continue 
to fight Hizballah as much as necessary. [end recording]
