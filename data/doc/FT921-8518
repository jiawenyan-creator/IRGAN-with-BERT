FT  17 FEB 92 / Exploding some 1980s 'unemployment' myths
RISING unemployment rates in the US and across Europe are injecting a new
urgency into the search for effective policies to help the unemployed return
to work when these economies eventually recover. That makes now a good time
to expose the fallacies which underpin one supposed cure for the problem of
long-term joblessness: limiting the period that the unemployed can claim
unemployment benefit.
The latest proponents of this view are Professor Richard Layard and Dr John
Philpott of the London-based Employment Institute. In a recent booklet
entitled Stopping Unemployment, they argue that unemployment benefits should
be limited to a maximum of 12 months, and combined with extensive
counselling and retraining. Their policy recommendations are based on two
pieces of evidence: first, that those countries which restrict the duration
of unemployment benefit, in particular the US and Sweden, have not suffered
from persistent long-term unemployment in the 1980s; and second, that the UK
government's Restart programme, which since 1986 has required every
unemployed person to attend regular interviews to ensure they are 'actively
seeking work', has encouraged many of the long-term unemployed to return to
work.
At first sight the evidence does appear to support Layard and Philpott's
conclusions. The US and UK unemployment records are tracked in the top two
diagrams, which show the relationship between available job vacancies and
the adult male unemployment rate in each year between 1970 and 1990. US
unemployment tended to rise in recessions, when vacancies were low, and fell
back as vacancies recovered. But in the UK in the early 1980s this downward
sloping curve appeared to shift to the right. Vacancies rose yet
unemployment remained stuck above 10 per cent. Only after 1986 did
unemployment fall rapidly. So limiting the availability of unemployment
benefits does appear to sharpen the incentives for the unemployed to apply
for vacant jobs.
Yet a closer look at the evidence suggests a different conclusion. The
problem is that the OECD's unemployment rates only tell half the story and
are thus a misleading way of measuring how much of the population is out of
work. They include only those people who are actively seeking work, thereby
excluding all those 'discouraged workers' who have stopped searching. A
better measure of joblessness is the non-employment rate, the percentage of
the population which is not in work regardless of whether they are looking
for work.
Measuring 'unemployment' using non-employment rates reveals that the UK has
not had more male joblessness than the US over past decade. Instead, as the
lower charts show, the UK has spent the last two decades catching up with
the US. By 1990 the US and UK had the same male non-employment rate. But the
US had a higher male non-employment rate over most of the last 20 years.
Similarly, Restart does not appear to have succeeded in helping the
long-term unemployed to return to work. While the UK unemployment rate
almost halved between 1986 and 1990, the non-employment rate fell by just
0.5 percentage points. Instead, the long-term unemployed have largely been
re-classified out of the unemployment statistics. Following their
interviews, many of them appeared to be claiming sickness and invalidity
benefit instead. In 1986, 900,000 men were claiming this benefit, just
50,000 higher than in 1980. But between 1986 and 1990 male recipients rose
by 25 per cent to 1.12m, while the number of women claimants more than
doubled.
Why does the US have so many more discouraged workers than the UK? One
reason might be the limited duration of US unemployment benefits. The US
long-term unemployed have no incentive to appear to be searching for work
and thus feature in the OECD's unemployment rate, whereas in the UK, where
benefits are only paid to active job-seekers, they do have such an
incentive. So while the duration of benefits does not appear to affect the
level of non-employment, it may well determine the distribution of the
non-employed between being classified as unemployed and economically
inactive.
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data
for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly
and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the
percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and
are positive unless otherwise stated.  The unemployment rate is shown as a
percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading
indicator are end-period values.
