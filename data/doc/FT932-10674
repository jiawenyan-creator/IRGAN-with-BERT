FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: StanChart directors forfeit bonuses
STANDARD CHARTERED, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday
disclosed that none of its directors will receive bonuses this year because
of the Pounds 305m loss in the Bombay securities trading scandal.
Mr Rodney Galpin, the retiring chairman, told the bank's annual meeting that
no performance bonuses - which comprised 20.6 per cent of executive
directors' pay last year - would be paid this year. Mr Galpin's pay rose by
29 per cent to Pounds 393,000 last year.
The bank also disclosed that it was establishing a new risk management
function as part of a wide-ranging management restructuring.
Mr Galpin said it was acting to remedy the weaknesses exposed by the
securities trading scandal.
A representative of Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, who holds 14.94 per cent of
Standard Chartered's equity, was among shareholders who asked critical
questions about the Bombay loss at the meeting.
Mr Galpin said that Bombay should 'never have happened' and that checking
and control of Standard Chartered's activities around the world were 'very
much at the forefront of our mind' since the fraud in India had been
exposed.
