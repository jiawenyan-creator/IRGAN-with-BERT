FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Salvesen director departs
Christian Salvesen, the UK distribution, specialist hire and food services
group, yesterday announced the departure of a director who co-founded its
Aggreko business, which recently caused the group to issue a profits
warning.
Mr Gordon Tourlamain, 50, joined Salvesen when it acquired Aggreko UK in
1984. Aggreko, which hires out generators and temperature control equipment,
was a star performer until recently.
However, Salvesen's highly rated shares fell sharply in February when the
group said Aggreko was suffering from increasing competition in the US and
Europe. Last night the shares closed up 2p at 262p - well below last year's
peak of 398p.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said Mr Tourlamain's departure was 'quite
amicable - he's not leaving us because we have had a difficult time with
Aggreko'.
Salvesen said full responsibility for Aggreko would now be assumed by Mr
David Yorke, who founded the business with Mr Tourlamain. Mr Yorke would
report directly to Mr Masters.
Sir Alick Rankin, Salvesen's chairman, said: 'We are all grateful for all
Gordon's achievements over the years. He was responsible for introducing
Aggreko to the Salvesen group and he leaves behind him a strong and
profitable business.'
