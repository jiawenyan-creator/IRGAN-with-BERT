  [Text] Paris, 9 Apr -- The French Foreign Ministry has 
today granted a "limited entry visa" to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], who 
intends to take part in the session of the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), which opens next week 
in Strasbourg, Catherine Colonna, deputy to the official 
spokesperson of the French Foreign Ministry, told ITAR-TASS. 
  The limitations pertain to both the validity of the visa in 
terms of duration -- it has been granted for the five days of 
the session -- and in terms of place of stay -- Zhirinovskiy has 
no right to leave Strasbourg. Thus, this is only a permission 
to be on French territory, rather than to visit France, 
Catherine Colonna pointed out. 
  According to a spokesperson from the diplomatic department, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Strasbourg as part of a 
Russian parliamentary delegation at the invitation of the 
Council of Europe. In accordance with the agreement between 
France and the EEC, Paris does not have the right to refuse 
anyone invited to the Council of Europe an entrance visa, C. 
Colonna explained. 
  The deputy of the official spokesperson of the French 
Foreign 
Ministry said that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had been notified of 
all restrictions connected to his stay in Strasbourg. The LDPR 
leader was informed that all general requirements made of 
foreign citizens visiting French territory apply to him. 
Furthermore, V. Zhirinovskiy was reminded that all his 
activities during his stay in France had to be in character with 
the mission with which he was arriving in Strasbourg, that is, 
they have to relate exclusively to the PACE session. 
  "We do not intend to give Mr. Zhirinovskiy an entrance visa 
for visiting France as the republic's Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe has already frequently pointed out," C. Colonna stressed.
