LOCAL; 
LOTTO PRIZE MISSED; NOW $12 MILLION 
No player picked the six winning numbers in the mid-week Lotto 6-49 drawing, 
leaving the $5.7-million jackpot unclaimed, state lottery officials said today. 
The jackpot for Saturday's drawing was estimated at $12 million. 
The numbers drawn Wednesday were 23, 31, 32, 33, 46 and 48. The bonus number 
was 29. In the five-of-six plus bonus category, two players won prizes of 
$745,343 apiece, said spokeswoman Kathy Manzer. They will be identified after 
submitting claims to lottery offices.
