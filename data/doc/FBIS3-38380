  [Begin recording] [Chissano] [This meeting] has served as a 
reiteration by the president of the Portuguese republic of 
continuing support for the Mozambican peace process. 
  [Correspondent] Did you talk about the delay in assembling 
the government troops in the confinement areas? 
  [Chissano] Yes, I informed him that there is a delay in 
assembling the troops on both sides, not just on the 
government's side. 
  [Correspondent] What about [UN representative] Ajello's 
statement? 
  [Chissano] Which one?

to

that regard, because the delay in assembling the troops can 
easily be rectified.

Portuguese military? 
  [Chissano] It is fine. Preparations have already begun with
