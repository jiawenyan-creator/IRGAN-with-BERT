  [Text] Tianjin, February 6 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, the largest 
industrial city in north China, is to employ more foreign funds 
to improve facilities and operations of a third of its old 
businesses this year. 
  The city will complete the transformation of all the 
existing 
old enterprises in eight years, in order to resume its important 
position in China's industry, according to an official of the 
city economic committee. 
  He said that in 1994, 120 state-run factories will become 
joint ventures. Over 70 foreign-funded projects will go into 
operation. 
  Backed by skilled workers and strong technology, the city 
has 
seen good results in the campaign to upgrade old businesses. 
  At present, the output value and sales of the industrial 
joint ventures have accounted for 48 percent of the total. 
  It is also reported that 18 upgraded enterprises have 
reached 
100 million yuan in output value each, with a batch of 
competitive products entering the domestic market. 
  The official said that last year, the city's industrial 
sector introduced 600 million U.S. dollars for 197 
foreign-funded projects. 
  Tianjin has more than 5,000 enterprises in the fields of 
electronics, textiles, pharmaceuticals and machinery, with 
nearly 100 national name-brands.
