FT  08 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Private talks in the park
The UK government is pressing on with its programme to privatise the
maintenance of the eight royal parks in and around London despite furious
opposition from the Transport and General Workers Union which represents the
royal parks' 340 employees.
The scheme, the brainchild of Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, has
also been criticised by some MPs and peers. But there has been no lack of
tenders from landscaping and ground maintenance companies.
Heseltine sees the policy as an extension of compulsory competitive
tendering which has led many local authorities to put out park maintenance
to private contractors. It is estimated that this market is worth Pounds
700m a year.
The results of some of the tenders are expected to be announced in the next
few days. However, it is already known that Glendale Industries, based at
Chorley, Lancashire, has won the Pounds 500,000 per annum three-year
contract for the maintainance of Green Park and St James's Park in central
London.
Glendale has made bids for some of the other royal parks contracts. 'We
believe we can provide a better service in most of them and a better quality
of horticulture for the same or less money than they are costing at the
moment,' said Tony Hewitt, managing director of Glendale.
But Ron Tindall, district officer of the TGWU, says: 'It is purely political
 -privatisation for privatisation's sake.'
Heseltine is unrepentant. 'It is important that we get value for money and
draw up contracts with high-quality specifications. If you make changes
people always predict disaster.'
The upkeep of the parks, which is the responsibility of the Environment
Department, costs Pounds 20m a year. In addition to the two contracted to
Glendale there are Regent's Park, Hyde Park, Greenwich, Bushey, Richmond and
Kensington Gardens.
