FT  17 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Communications recording equipment
Following an order from Bergamo Airport, contracts to supply communications
recording equipment to Italian airports won by RACAL RECORDERS have now
exceeded Pounds 1m. In the past two years the company has sold equipment to
both major and secondary airports as part of the country's civil aviation
authority upgrade programme.
The order from Bergamo Airport is for a Wordsafe voice logging recorder.
This desktop, multi-channel voice logging recorder, provides a range of
configurations from 4 to 32 channels and over 24 hours of continuous
recording on a single VHS cassette.
During the last two years, significant contracts have been awarded by the
AAAV (Azienda Autonoma Assistenza al Volo) to Racal Recorders for its ICR64
multi-channel communications recorder, used to record voice communications
between air traffic controllers and aircrew.
Racal's ICR64 recorders have been installed at a number of airports in Italy
including Milan-Linate, Rome-Fiumicino, Napoli, Turin, Bologna and Brindisi.
Racal Recorders, part of the Racal Electronics Group, is based in Hythe,
Hampshire.
