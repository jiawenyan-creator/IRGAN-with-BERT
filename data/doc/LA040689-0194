U.S. REVOKES EX-DICTATOR'S VISA 
The United States has revoked the visa of Paraguay's ousted dictator Alfredo 
Stroessner, U.S. officials said today. 
Asked to comment on reports that Stroessner was seeking to come to the United 
States for medical treatment, a State Department official said he knew of no 
visa request. 
"Stroessner's visa has been revoked. He'd have to reapply," the official said, 
adding that a visa request from Stroessner, like all others, would be given due 
consideration. Another State Department official, a Latin American specialist, 
said it was highly unlikely that the request would be approved, given 
Stroessner's background as a harsh foe of democratic liberties. 
The United States maintains Stroessner can get adequate medical care in Brazil, 
where he has lived in exile since being toppled by a former ally in a bloody 
coup last February.
