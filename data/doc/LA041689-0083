RAP 
Easy-E and N.W.A. are a disgrace to rap music, their community, and the people 
in their community. I can't understand why people enjoy listening to such 
degrading garbage. 
Both Eazy-E and N.W.A. claim to rap about he realities of black people in the 
black community. I'm a black teen-ager who lives in a black community, and I 
can't relate to such nonsense.
