This notice addresses only the services for third/fourth/and fifth freedom operations. Third-country code-share

BACKGROUND: 

On May 24, 1994, representatives of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a new Agreement for
Transitional Arrangements for Air Transport Services. Under provisions of this Agreement, scheduled combination
services are subject to seasonal frequency limitations. For the upcoming winter season, U.S. scheduled combination
carriers may operate a total of 253 weekly round-trip frequencies for U.S.-Germany (third/fourth freedom) services
and 120 weekly round-trip frequencies for Germany-third country (fifth freedom) services.

 The Agreement further provides that thirty days prior to each traffic season, each Party shall notify the other Party
through diplomatic channels of the initial allocation of the frequencies among its airlines.

Article 6, Section 1 (A)(1) provides that airlines designated by the United States may operate 106 weekly round-trip
fifth freedom frequencies during the upcoming winter season. Furthermore, under the Section 1 (A)(2), an additional
14 weekly round-trip fifth freedom frequencies are available provided that the United/Lufthansa rights in the London-Germany
market noted in Appendix B to the Agreement have been effectuated. Since United and Lufthansa are operating these
services, the additional 14 frequencies are available to U.S. carriers this winter season.
