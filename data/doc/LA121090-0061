TV REVIEWS; 
'LITTLE MATCH GIRL' HAS SOCIAL VALUE 
"The Little Match Girl" (at 7 tonight on HBO), a new animated special from 
producer/director Michael Sporn ("Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile"), transforms Hans 
Christian Andersen's bleak story about an unloved child freezing to death on a 
snowy night into a contemporary parable of compassion. 
It's New Year's Eve, 1999. 
Angela, the title character, lives with her mother and father in an abandoned 
New York subway station; she supports her kindly mother and father by selling 
matches to theatergoers in Times Square. 
On her way uptown, Angela, who looks like Ludwig Bemelmans' Madeline, befriends 
a stray dog, Albert. As they huddle in a vacant lot against the driving cold, 
she lights some of the matches, and is rewarded with visions of her favorite 
aunt, a friendly street musician and her grandmother, who take Angela and 
Albert on magical adventures in the city. 
Angela's plight touches the hearts of the uncaring rich people, who come to the 
aid of the homeless families in the subway station, ensuring that "the first 
day of the new age had a joyful beginning." 
In this unusually atmospheric special, Sporn depicts New York as a cold montage 
of dull blues and lavenders, with Angela's red coat providing the only spot of 
color. F. Murray Abraham's understated narration and the mournful saxophone 
solos in Caleb Sampson's jazz score emphasize the downbeat feeling of the 
uncaring metropolis. 
Its gently didactic social message makes "The Little Match Girl" a more 
valuable program for children and their parents to watch than the simple-minded 
tales of furry little animals "saving" Christmas that have become standard 
holiday fare. CHARLES SOLOMON
