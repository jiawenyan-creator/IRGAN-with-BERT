  [Abstract] Hot flue gases are filtered by a stainless steel 
grid with a wire diameter of 0.003-0.004 mm. The housing of the 
unit contains multiple units consisting of several stages each. 
The height of the housing and the number of units are determined 
by the type of fuel and the rate of gas flow. Each unit contains 
a latticed disk attached to the face of the first stage. The 
diameter of each stage is determined by the diameter of the 
previous one. The effectiveness was tested. The number of solid 
particles is determined, as is the dependence of the degree of 
scrubbing on the number of filters for a particle size of 1.0 
m. Scrubbing decreased with the number of filters. By 
regulating the number of filters one can obtain the optimal 
ratio of the gas dynamic resistance of the scrubber and the 
degree of scrubbing. The device is most effective on particles 
1.0 m in size and greater. A 70% rate of scrubbing 
can be 
obtained. The device can be removed and cleaned for repeated 
use. Figure 1; table 1; references 4: 3 Russian, 1 Western.
