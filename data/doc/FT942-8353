FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sega shows first profits fall in
12 years
Sega, the video games group, last year suffered its first fall in profits
for 12 years, coming under pressure from a rising yen and weak demand in
Europe and Japan.
Revenues for the year ended March, improved 2 per cent to Y354bn (Dollars
3.38bn) but pre-tax profits tumbled 23 per cent to Y42.5bn.
Sega said that the US market had been buoyant and had contributed
significantly to profits but demand from Europe was weak.
The company, which relies for nearly 70 per cent of consolidated sales on
overseas markets, was hurt by the yen's sharp appreciation.
Sega is cutting costs and moving software manufacturing overseas in order to
counter the impact of the strong yen.
It is confident that efforts to move into new areas will pay off this year.
It will introduce a new advanced games machine in the autumn. It has already
opened a games theme park in Osaka and will open another in Yokohama in
July.
The company expects revenues and pre-tax profits this year to remains fairly
stable at Y360bn and Y43bn respectively.
