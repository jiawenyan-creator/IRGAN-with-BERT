FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Allegation on council angers Labour
LABOUR MPs erupted in fury during Scottish questions yesterday as a
succession of Tories highlighted alleged breaches of duty at a local
authority that includes the parliamentary seat of Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, David Owen writes.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, indicated that he was considering whether
the allegations might amount to a breach of Monklands District Council's
statutory duties.
Answering a question from Mr Bill Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North,
regarding the authority's use of public money, Mr Lang said the Commission
for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland could submit a report to him if it
concluded the council had illegally authorised expenditure.
The row resulted from a contribution from Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover,
who said many Scots had been 'shocked to learn that 22 relatives of Labour
councillors are employed by Monklands District Council'.
