AN INDY REPEAT FLAUNTS HISTORY; 
AUTO RACING: LAST YEAR'S WINNER, EMERSON FITTIPALDI, STARTS ON THE POLE WITH 
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT NO ONE HAS WON CONSECUTIVE INDIANAPOLIS 500S IN ALMOST 20 
YEARS. 
When Emerson Fittipaldi rolls off the starting line today in defense of the 
title he won so dramatically in last year's Indianapolis 500, history will be 
against him. 
No driver has repeated at Indy in almost 20 years, and only four have 
successfully defended their championship in 73 years. The last one, Al Unser, 
who won in 1970 and '71, is in today's race in an Alfa-Romeo. 
The others were Bill Vukovich, 1953-54, whose grandson, Bill III, is also in 
today's race as the youngest driver among the 33 starters; Mauri Rose, 1947-48, 
and Wilbur Shaw, 1939-40. 
"I know it is very difficult to repeat here, but the pressure has only made me 
work harder to try and win again," Fittipaldi, the Brazilian veteran, said as 
he watched a midweek rain wash the Indianapolis Motor Speedway clean for 
today's race. The weather forecast calls for an overcast sky with early-morning 
rain. 
"I knew before I came to Indianapolis that there would be a lot of pressure on 
me and my family," Fittipaldi said, "because there would be such a demand on my 
time, but I feel I have managed to control the situation so that I am relaxed. 
It is the price of being the champion, but it is a price I am happy to pay." 
The 43-year-old, two-time former Formula One world champion, who retired for 
two years before joining the American open-wheel racing circuit in 1984, will 
start on the pole today in a new Penske Chevy V-8. He qualified two weeks ago 
at a record 225.301 m.p.h. 
Starting on the pole could be another historical footnote indicating that 
Fittipaldi won't repeat. Only twice in the past 18 years has the pole-sitter 
won the 500. Both times it was Rick Mears, Fittipaldi's teammate, who did it in 
1979 and 1988. 
One thing is different for Fittipaldi this time. Today he is with a different 
team, having taken his Marlboro sponsorship from the Pat Patrick-Chip Ganassi 
team to the Super Team of Roger Penske. The switch was part of a reported 
$30-million, three-year contract between Penske and the Philip Morris Tobacco 
Co. for his cars to carry the red-and-white colors of their product. 
The move took Fittipaldi from a one-car operation to a three-car team with 
former Indy 500 winners Mears and Danny Sullivan as teammates, a situation he 
likes. 
"(Among) three cars, I get much more information," Fittipaldi said. "That's the 
big advantage. I remember last year, at Phoenix and Long Beach, then 
Indianapolis, to set up the car was much more difficult. Because I was by 
myself, the information I was getting in testing the car and I was giving (team 
manager) Morris Nunn, I would say, was less than half the information I get now 
after practice." 
Being on the Penske team should give Fittipaldi another edge. The team has a 
record seven 500 victories, five in the last decade: Mark Donohue, 1972; Mears, 
1979; Bobby Unser, 1981; Mears, 1984; Sullivan, 1985; Al Unser, 1987; and 
Mears, 1988. 
Fittipaldi won in a PC-18 that Penske sold to the Patrick-Ganassi team last 
year. 
Mears will start in the middle of the front row, with the surprising Dutchman, 
Arie Luyendyk, on the outside. Mears will be making a record 10th front-row 
start. He and Bobby Unser had been tied with nine each. 
Sullivan is in ninth position, on the outside of the third row. 
"I'm not complaining," Sullivan, 40, said. "Rick and Emmo (Fittipaldi) came 
here in March and tested and got ahead of me. I was at home having a baby -- or 
rather, my girlfriend was having a baby -- so I missed that and fell behind. 
But all the guys put their heads together after each race or each practice, and 
I feel like my setup for the race is just the same as theirs." 
In the second row is another former winner, Bobby Rahal, with the Andrettis, 
son Michael in the middle and father Mario, who won back in 1969 and is still 
looking for No. 2, on the outside. 
"I think it will be a much closer race than it was last year," Fittipaldi said. 
Last year's race was decided on the next-to-last lap when Fittipaldi, trying to 
pass Al Unser Jr. for the lead, touched wheels with Unser's Lola and sent him 
into the wall. However, the rest of the field was six laps or more behind. 
Fittipaldi said: "I would say you have about seven, eight drivers with a good 
chance of winning: Rick, Danny, Al Jr., Mario, Michael, Bobby and Arie, he's 
been a surprise to everyone. 
"I have a good feeling about my own car and my own chances, but I think I will 
have close competition the whole race." 
The younger Unser, who had been favored to win the pole after an unofficial lap 
of 228.502 m.p.h. during practice, will start in the seventh position after 
being able to average only 220.920 in four qualifying laps. 
"Qualifying was a setback," Unser said. "I made some changes (to the car) I 
shouldn't have done and I learned from it. A.J. (Foyt) kind of put it best. He 
said he made some changes, rolled the dice and won. I rolled the dice and it 
came up craps. I learned from it and we'll go on from there. 
"I haven't second-guessed last year at all. It's still with me. The day I lose 
it is the day I reach 198 laps again. I would like to complete the 500 miles 
here, which I have yet to do." 
Rahal, Unser's best friend and teammate on the Galles-Kraco team, believes that 
repeating in the 500 is no more difficult than trying to repeat in any other 
race. Rahal won in 1986 in a race delayed one week by rain. 
"It's difficult enough to win here one year, much less two," Rahal said. "Five 
hundred miles is a long way to go, and the length of the race multiplies the 
problem of repeating. Multiple wins at the same track, like mine at Laguna Seca 
(1985-86-87) or Little Al's at Long Beach (1988-89-90) are not the norm. They 
are unique. 
"If anything, though, Emmo is highly motivated and seems hungrier than ever to 
win again. When you've won something, you know what it tastes like and you want 
to taste it again. He will be very tough to beat." 
One thing is fairly probable, and that is that a 1990 model British-built car, 
powered by a British-built Chevrolet Ilmor engine, will win. 
The first three rows are all Chevrolets. The Penske trio of Fittipaldi, Mears 
and Sullivan are driving Penske cars made in Poole, England. The other six -- 
including Foyt -- are driving Lolas made in Cambridgeshire, England. 
Foyt will be making a record 33rd consecutive start in the 500. At 55, he also 
will become the oldest driver to start the race, surpassing Dick Simon, who was 
54 years 8 months in 1988. 
Chevrolets have won the first two races, Mears at Phoenix and Unser at Long 
Beach, and in both races the first seven finishers were Chevys. 
The only Chevrolet not in the first three rows will be driven by rookie Eddie 
Cheever, who took over for the Ganassi team after Fittipaldi left. Cheever, who 
drove for nine years in Formula One, is the fastest qualifier of three rookies. 
The others are Scott Goodyear and Dean Hall.
