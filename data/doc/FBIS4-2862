  [Text] Shanghai, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China produced 
250,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of international 
containers last year, becoming the biggest producer in the world. 
  This was announced at a ceremony held here today to mark the 
inauguration of a Special Containers Committee of the China 
Container Industry Association. 
  The container industry started in the United States in 1956. 
China began producing containers in the 1960s. In 1989, the 
country's annual output of containers amounted to 30,000 TEU. 
  In recent years, a batch of Sino-foreign joint ventures for 
containers was set up in China. Many of them have gone into 
production. The Shanghai Far East Container Co. Ltd., a joint 
venture established by the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and 
Taiwan, went into production in December 1992. Last year, the 
company's output reached 11,000 TEU of various containers. The 
quality of the company's products meets international criteria. 
  At present, most of the country's container enterprises are 
located in the Chang Jiang Delta and Pearl River Delta in 
south-east China.
