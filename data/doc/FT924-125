FT  30 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
Activity in most LME base metals was subdued in the post-Christmas/pre-New
Year holiday hiatus. Business will be slow to pick up until next week,
dealers predicted. COPPER prices consolidated around earlier highs in the
afternoon, with interest dwindling after Chinese buying in the morning.
Sterling's weakness assisted the upward movement in the LEAD market, where
prices were supported by influential commission house buying. London's
robusta COFFEE dipped sharply in late trading and finished with losses of up
to Dollars 22 on key nearby positions. Conditions were nervous with the
market having entered a more volatile phase after its recent steady advance.
GOLD eased on the London bullion market, under pressure from a strong dollar
and light producer selling in a thin market. Dealers noted gold was up
around R1,018 a troy ounce compared to only R1,004 last week and in
Australian dollars it was holding above the key ADollars 480 level.
