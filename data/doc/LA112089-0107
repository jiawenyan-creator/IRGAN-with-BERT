ROYALS; 
EDITOR FIRED FOR ROYAL PHOTOS 
The publisher of The People newspaper said today that he has fired its editor 
for publishing photographs of Princes William and Harry that were deemed to be 
"not acceptable." 
Wendy Henry, who was appointed six months ago by publisher Robert Maxwell to 
edit the Sunday tabloid newspaper, had no comment on her dismissal. 
The front-page photos showed 7-year-old William in a pose captioned: "Willie's 
sly pee in park," and a series of pictures of 5-year-old Harry in a tussle with 
schoolmates. 
Their parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, issued a statement deploring 
them as an intrusion into the boys' privacy and a security concern. 
The photos appeared to have been taken in a garden square at the school the 
boys attend.
