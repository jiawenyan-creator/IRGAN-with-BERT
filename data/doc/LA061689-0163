THE SIDELINES; 
'GLASNOST' RIVALRY MOVES TO L.A. 
The USC-Illinois football game originally scheduled to be played in the Soviet 
Union as the Glasnost Bowl has been rescheduled for Labor Day at the Coliseum. 
The Sept. 4 game, which will be played at 5 p.m., will give USC seven home 
contests in 1989 and will be shown live nationally on ABC-TV. 
The Glasnost Bowl was canceled last week by Raycom Inc., its organizer, because 
of contract difficulties.
