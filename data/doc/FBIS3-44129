  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, today 
held discussions with Benin's foreign minister, Mr. Sossou 
[title and name as heard], at the Castle, Osu. They discussed 
the situation in Togo and Liberia. Briefing newsmen on 
deliberations between the president and the Benin foreign 
minister, Ghana's foreign affairs minister, Dr. Obed Asamoah, 
maintained that the situation in Togo is an internal crisis. He 
said it is the view of Ghana that the Togolese Government, by 
shutting the door in the face of opposition and by brutalizing 
the Togolese people, has created a situation whereby the people 
are ready to fight against oppression. Dr. Asamoah said that 
President Rawlings feels that the Togolese authorities must 
create the right political and psychological atmosphere in the 
country. 
  On the question of Togolese refugees in Ghana, Dr. Asamoah 
said under international conventions, it would be incorrect for 
the country to send them back. The authorities will, however, 
make sure that Ghana is not used by some asylum seekers to raise 
tension between her and Togo. Dr. Asamoah said it is 
unfortunate that Togo always adopts an attitude that prevents it 
from looking into itself to solve problems, but uses Ghana as a 
smooth screen. 
  Mr. Sossou said in his capacity as chairman of ECOWAS 
[Economic Community of West African States], President Soglo, in 
collaboration with the other leaders in the West African 
subregion, would try to resolve differences between Ghana and 
Togo. What is needed, he said, is goodwill and understanding by 
the two nations. Benin's foreign minister said he visited Togo 
last Tuesday [18 January] to collect information on the dispute 
between Ghana and Togo to enable President Soglo to see how best 
the problem can be solved.
