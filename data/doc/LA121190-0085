KUWAIT DENIES REPORTS OF DEAL WITH IRAQ 
Kuwait's government-in-exile said Monday it would not agree to give Iraq even 
one inch of Kuwaiti territory and branded as "totally untrue" reports that it 
is involved in secret negotiations with Iraq. 
Foreign Minister Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah, in remarks quoted by the Kuwaiti news 
agency, said a report in the British newspaper the Independent on Sunday was 
based "on fabricated rumors . . . and totally untrue."
