FT  22 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo
Stabilisation of global bond markets, appreciation of the yen, and
accommodative money market manoeuvrings by the Bank of Japan helped Japanese
bond prices last week.
Trading ahead of the September book closing - profit-taking and a switch
from listed bonds to unlisted euroyen paper and bank debentures - is
expected to weigh on bond prices this week. But expectations of economic
recovery, which have been keeping investors away, are showing signs of a
retreat.
Many analysts believe that since recovery will be slow, and deflationary
pressures will persist, the bond market sell-off has been overdone. Although
consumption has been boosted by the hot summer weather and income tax cuts,
the effects could soon wear off. The continued rise in the yen is also a
threat against corporate earnings.
Last week the July department store sales fell year-on-year in spite of
expectations of a rise. July supermarket sales due this week may reveal the
extent of continuing deflation, while August consumer price index figures
are likely to endorse expectations of low inflation over next few months.
The consumer price data is expected to fall from the previous year, for the
second consecutive month, with core inflation confirming a downward trend.
