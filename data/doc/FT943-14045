FT  16 JUL 94 / Standard Life to join PIA
Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, yesterday signed up to
the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private
investor, in spite of its earlier opposition to the regulator.
The insurer made it clear that it was the fact that the PIA had become
inevitable rather than any change in the company's views about regulation
which had led to its application to join.
