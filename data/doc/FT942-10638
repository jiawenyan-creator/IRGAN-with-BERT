FT  10 MAY 94 / Pennant-Rea urges Bank autonomy
An increase in Bank of England autonomy would be better for the long-term
health of the economy and a more effective way of avoiding the boom-bust
cycles of the past 20 years, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the
Bank, said last night.
Speaking in the City at a debate about Bank independence organised by the
banking union Bifu, he rejected the idea that unelected officials would
decide policy without reference to the government or the people.
