U.S. TRADE DEFICIT RISES ONLY SLIGHTLY IN QUARTER 
The deficit in the country's broadest measure of foreign trade rose slightly in 
the April-June quarter to $21.84 billion, still the second-best showing in six 
years, the government reported Tuesday. 
However, private economists forecast that the deficit will head sharply higher 
in the months ahead as the Persian Gulf crisis boosts America's foreign oil 
bill and cuts into Americans' overseas earnings.
