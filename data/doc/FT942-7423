FT  25 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
Stock index futures remained in the doldrums as dealers reflected on
weakness in bonds. Once again volumes in both futures and traded options
remained low, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was at 3,103 and initially
gave some hope of an improvement on Monday's poor session. But those soon
faded as active selling said to have been led by Goldman Sachs drove the
contract lower.
The weakness in both UK and German bonds followed the release of worse than
expected German M3 data and prompted further selling of the contract.
In the afternoon, the bounce on Wall Street failed to inspire a similar
response in London, and the June contract again traded at the lower levels
and continued leading the cash market down.
It finished at 3,077, down 8 on its previous finish but at at a 16 point
discount to its fair value premium to cash of about minus 3 points. A slight
recovery in after hours trading saw June end at 3,083. Volume at the close
of business stood at 11,732 contracts.
Turnover in traded options remained poor though it improved on Monday's
meagre levels. A total of 24,647 lots were traded of which 13,119 was in the
FT-SE 100 option and 1,714 in the Euro FT-SE. Stock
