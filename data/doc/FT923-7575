FT  17 AUG 92 / BCCI reopens in Bangladesh
Bangladeshi prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia reopened the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in Bangladesh yesterday under a new
name, assuring depositors their money would be safe, Reuter reports from
Dhaka.
'This financial institution is fully secured,' she said as she opened the
Eastern Bank, which incorporated all the assets and liabilities of the
former Bangladeshi branch of BCCI. 'We shall not let any bank in the country
fall in crisis,' she said.
Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank, approved the reopening of the
collapsed BCCI after the government had received clearance from the bank's
main shareholders in the United Arab Emirates.
