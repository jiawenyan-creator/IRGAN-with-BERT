FT  06 JUL 93 / Letter: Common recycling target
Sir, Your editorial 'Stop the EC waste war' (July 1) was an excellent review
of the problems created by the German approach to 'solving' the challenge of
what to do with used packaging.
Your proposed solution, setting different recycling targets for different
materials in different countries is, however, a political non-runner.
An alternative approach increasingly finding political, business and even
environmentalist favour is to set a challenging but common valorisation
target (which embraces re-use, recycling and energy recovery).
Each member state would then choose its own route to meeting successfully
the broad target, rather than being forced into the environmentally
unsustainable strait-jacket of recycling alone.
