Evaluation factors.

the broad discretion of agency acquisition officials except that_
 
(i) Price or cost to the Government shall be included as an evaluation factor in every source selection.
 
(ii) Past performance shall be evaluated in all competitively negotiated acquisitions expected to exceed $100,000,

discretion of the contracting officer.

(a)*** 
 
(3) 

Past performance evaluation. 

(i) Past performance information should be used in assessing performance risk. The assessment of performance risk
should consider the relative merits of the offeror's prior experience and performance as compared to that of other
competing offerors. The number and severity of an offeror's problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken,
the offeror's overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information should be considered
at the time it is used.
 
(ii) Past performance information may be obtained from a variety of sources, including private firms. The source
and type of past performance information to be included in the evaluation is within the broad discretion of agency
acquisition officials and should be tailored to the circumstances of each procurement. Evaluations of contractor
performance prepared in accordance with subpart 42.15 are one source of performance information which may be used.
 
(iii) firms shall be allowed to compete for contracts even though they lack a history of relevant past performance.
