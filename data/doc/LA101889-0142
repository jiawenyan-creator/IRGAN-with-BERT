JAZZ REVIEW; 
BOHANON LEADS GROUP AT WEBSTER'S 
George Bohanon, a spirited and inventive trombonist, is leading the regular 
Thursday night group at Webster's, a restaurant at Grand Avenue and 9th Street 
that is becoming known as a new gathering place for jazz aficionados. The room 
offers jazz from 6 to 9 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays as well as Sunday sessions 
from 5 to 9 p.m. 
Bohanon was supported last week by Bennie Maupin, a powerful tenor saxophonist 
known for his work with McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock. Together they formed an 
impelling front line on such familiar standards as "Walkin'," "Blue Bossa" and 
that seemingly ubiquitous jam session standard, "Softly As in a Morning 
Sunrise." 
Impressive though the two were with their hard-bop excursions, and despite 
admirable support by Richard Reid on bass and Harold Mason on drums, the 
scene-stealer was Eric Reed, an amazing pianist who recently graduated from Cal 
State Northridge. 
Nineteen-year-old Reed not only has formidable techniques but also the 
knowledge and bop-rooted sensitivity to back it up. At times he almost 
suggested a reincarnation of Bud Powell, the seminal bopper who died four years 
before Reed was born. At other points his two-fisted chordal approach indicated 
a personality that transcends imitation. 
Reed will be back at Webster's Sunday leading his own quartet, under the aegis 
of the International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation. His is a name that is bound to 
reach prominence very early in the 1990s. LEONARD FEATHER
