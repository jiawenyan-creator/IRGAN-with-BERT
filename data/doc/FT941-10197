FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Norwegian savings bank back in
black
Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, yesterday reported a sharp
reversal in its fortunes, with a net profit of NKr1.52bn (Dollars 200m) in
1993 against a loss of NKr154m a year earlier.
The savings bank, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, said
although loan losses continue to be unusually high and growth in volume was
modest, the improvement was far above expectations.
The near-50 per cent decline in domestic interest rates, which contributed
to a sharp rise in bond prices, made a strong contribution to the turnround.
Sparebanken Nor will pay a dividend of NKr18 per primary capital certificate
 -a hybrid security listed on the Oslo bourse - and will allocate NKr599m to
a dividend adjustment reserve fund.
Group net interest income rose by NKr604m to NKr3.21bn, as net operating
income shot up to NKr5.35bn from NKr3.73bn. Operating expenses rose
slightly, to NKr2.46bn from NKr2.43bn. Losses on loans and guarantees dipped
to NKr1.31bn from NKr1.5bn, but the bank still achieved an operating profit
of NKr1.56bn against an operating loss of NKr271m.
The bank said the volume of defaulted loans developed 'in the right
direction'. Norgeskreditt, the Norwegian mortgage lending institution which
converted to a bank last year, reported a rise in 1993 pre-tax profit, to
NKr272.5m from NKr133m in 1992, helped by an increase in net interest income
and a fall in loan losses.
Nevertheless, the bank's shares closed down NKr1.50 at NKr150.50 yesterday
on the Oslo bourse in active trading. Norgeskreditt will pay a dividend of
NKr8.50 per preference share, with the total payout reaching NKr96.4m.
