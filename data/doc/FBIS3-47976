  [Text] Hanoi, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Hundreds of Vietnamese gold 
miners armed with knives, sickles and sticks badly wounded 42 
soldiers when they attacked 80 troops guarding a gold mine near 
Hoa Hai village, according to reports Thursday. 
  The Saigon Newsreader quoted an official newspaper as saying 
the miners attacked the soldiers when they came to a river bank 
to receive a boat shipment of rice for a border patrol post on 
January 11. 
  Sixteen of the beaten soldiers were rushed to hospital, it 
said. The day before, armed miners attacked a truck carrying 
rice for soldiers. 
  The area in the Huong Khe district in the centre of Vietnam 
has been inundated with hundreds of people illegally seeking 
gold, it said, adding that authorities had been unable to 
restore order despite troop reinforcements.
