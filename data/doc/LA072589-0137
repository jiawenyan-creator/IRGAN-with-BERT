PAY PACKAGES FOR O.C. ARTS CENTER ADMINISTRATORS AMONG HIGHEST IN U.S 
Thomas R. Kendrick, president of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and 
his wife, Judith O'Dea Morr, the Center's general manager, are among the 
highest-paid administrators of multipurpose arts facilities in the nation, with 
combined compensation and benefits of more than $300,000. 
Individually as well as collectively, Kendrick's and Morr's paychecks and other 
compensations rank just behind those of the two highest-paid administrators at 
New York's Lincoln Center and ahead of those at the Music Center in Los Angeles 
and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, according 
to a survey by The Times Orange County Edition. 
This is despite the fact that, of the seven facilities surveyed, the Orange 
County center has the fewest stages and ranks sixth on the list in the number 
of paid, ticketed performances per season and the number of full-time 
employees. 
Also, Kendrick and Morr are, by far, the highest-paid arts administrators in 
Orange County, according to information provided to the Internal Revenue 
Service: David Emmes and Martin Benson, the founders and artistic directors of 
the South Coast Repertory Theatre, earn $65,000 each; Louis Spisto, executive 
director of the Pacific Symphony, earns $67,000; and Kevin Consey of Newport 
Harbor Art Museum earns $85,000. 
Kendrick and Morr say they are fairly compensated. And Center board members say 
that at the amount Kendrick and Morr are paid they are a bargain. 
Information filed with the IRS and the California Registry of Charitable 
Trusts, required for all tax-exempt organizations, indicates that Kendrick was 
paid $184,246 in 1988 and received a benefits package worth an additional 
$6,543, primarily for an annuity plan. This represents an increase of about 9% 
from his reported compensation for 1987. 
Morr, who came to Orange County with Kendrick from Washington, where both 
worked as top administrators at the Kennedy Center for nearly a decade, is the 
second highest-paid staff member at the Orange County center, reporting 
earnings of $108,678 and a benefits package of $3,749 for 1988. This is an 
increase of about 6% from her reported compensation for the year before. 
At the centers surveyed, none of the job descriptions for the top two 
administrative slots precisely mirrored Kendrick's and Morr's. In principle, 
all chief executives are responsible for everything that goes on in their 
institutions. But according to Kendrick, this is almost literally true for 
himself and Morr in Orange County. 
Unlike most of the other executives surveyed, Kendrick said, the couple are 
responsible for day-to-day programming, administration, coordination with such 
regional groups as the Pacific Symphony and Opera Pacific, finance and budget 
controls, construction planning and supervision, marketing and media relations. 
(This despite a staff that includes a director of marketing, a director of 
development and a controller.) 
Also on the couple's list of responsibilities is fund raising, which now means 
presiding over a greatly expanded development department and an ambitious 
capital campaign to construct new theaters. 
At Lincoln Center, although the operating budget is more than twice that of 
Orange County's Center, President Nathan Leventhal is primarily responsible for 
day-to-day operations of the six theater-complex. Financing is handled by the 
highest paid of six vice presidents. 
Leventhal's duties do include overseeing relations with more than half a dozen 
constituent organizations, such as the Metropolitan Opera and the New York 
Philharmonic, some of whose budgets exceed that of Lincoln Center itself, 
according to a center spokeswoman. But unlike Kendrick and Morr, Leventhal and 
his financial vice president have very little involvement with the details of 
marketing or with programming, most of which are handled by the constituent 
organizations themselves or by a lower-ranking center administrator. 
Ralph Davidson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, oversees programming, fund 
raising and administration. But much of the actual programming is done by Marta 
Istomin, the center's artistic director, according to a center spokeswoman. Top 
administrators at the San Francisco War Memorial and the Wortham Center in 
Houston -- all of whom are city employees and paid much less than Kendrick and 
Morr -- do no programming and very little in the way of budgeting and 
independent marketing. 
The two administrators who come closest to Kendrick and Morr in the range of 
day-to-day responsibilities are Lawrence J. Wilker and Art Falco at Playhouse 
Square Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Their combined compensation for 1988 was 
$213,230 -- $89,986 less than Kendrick and Morr's combined total. 
But the size of the compensation packages is misleading, Kendrick and Morr said 
in separate interviews, because the figures encompass such things as prorated 
moving and housing compensation and "significant" out-of-pocket contributions 
to disability, health and retirement plans to maintain the generous level of 
coverage they were provided at the Kennedy Center (but which is no longer 
provided to administrators there). The figures also include lease payments for 
the cars provided to the couple by the Center. 
When all of these factors are taken into account, Kendrick maintained, his 
effective salary is $166,000; Morr said hers is about $94,000. None of the 
other administrators surveyed would reveal the composition of their 
compensation packages. 
"I think we're fairly paid," Kendrick said. 
Morr said that she, too, is "quite comfortable with my level of compensation." 
"We didn't move here for pay," but for the challenge of building and shaping a 
new institution, Kendrick added. He also said he prefers to be judged "on the 
basis of the jobs we were brought here to do, and the jobs we have done." 
On that basis, Center board members agree that the couple's compensation is not 
out of line. 
By many standards used to judge such facilities, Center officials and board 
members said, the Center is a success. It has reached what they consider to be 
"full bookings" three years ahead of schedule. (Center officials say that 
virtually every day not taken up by one of 266 events this year is needed for 
load-in/load-out time.) More than 640,000 people attended performances in 1988, 
compared to 607,000 in 1987. Paid attendance for events programmed by Kendrick 
and Morr (as opposed to booked into the Center by others) was 85%, 20 points 
above the national average. And paid attendance for all performances since the 
Center's opening has been 80%, also well above the national average. 
Kendrick and Morr are "a great, great bargain for Orange County on the basis of 
what they've produced for us," said Henry Segerstrom, chairman of the Center's 
board. "That's the most significant yardstick for measuring their worth. 
"In the area of programming, they have done better than any other executive 
combination in the country," he said, citing the Center's international ballet 
series, which he said is one of the finest in the country. 
"At almost any price, they're a bargain," agreed Roger Johnson, head of Western 
Digital Corp. in Irvine and the Center's vice chairman for the corporate 
campaign. "They came to a brand-new area with a brand-new facility. I don't 
think anything speaks better than the end result," in terms of paid attendance 
and the quality of the presentations. 
Segerstrom, whose fortune was based in part on agriculture, said that comparing 
Kendrick and Morr's compensation to those of other arts center heads is like 
comparing "apples to apricots." For one thing, lower salaries in Cleveland may 
go a lot farther than higher ones in Orange County. 
Differences are especially pronounced, Segerstrom said, between a facility such 
as the Orange County center, which depends entirely on private funding, and 
those that receive a large segment of financial support from government. 
Tax support for the arts carries with it considerable accountability and public 
debate, he explained, and salaries generally have to coincide with those of 
other public officials. 
Segerstrom further maintained that the size, experience and range of expertise 
of management teams and support staffs vary considerably from center to center, 
affecting the manner in which responsibilities are shouldered and paid for. 
In order to judge the cost-effectiveness of Kendrick and Morr's compensation, 
"you have to look at the total executive payroll," Johnson agreed. "We are not 
terribly heavy on staff at the Center." 
However, in addition to Kendrick and Morr, the Center reported that 27 other 
employees earned more than $30,000 in 1988. The Los Angeles Music Center listed 
only 11 in that pay range. The corresponding figures at other centers ranged 
from two at the Wortham Center in Houston to 106 at Lincoln Center. 
It is difficult to find an exact comparison for the $73-million Center, which 
has one stage -- Segerstrom Hall -- and 65 full-time employees. The current 
annual budget is $15.4 million, 83% of which comes from earned income -- ticket 
sales and rentals -- with the remaining 17%, or about $2.6 million, coming from 
private support. Apart from its tax-exempt status, the Center has no 
governmental support. 
Other institutions surveyed have multiple stages. All but the Wortham in 
Houston have bigger overall staffs and all but the Playhouse Center in 
Cleveland receive some form of governmental support, either funds or services. 
The yearly expenditures vary widely, from $1.67 million at Houston's Wortham 
Center to $75 million at the Los Angeles Music Center. 
The Orange County Performing Arts Center presents about 60% of the performances 
at Segerstrom Hall. Similar figures vary widely at centers around the country, 
from Lincoln Center, which presents, sometimes with a co-sponsor, nearly 90% of 
its performances, to the San Francisco War Memorial, which does no presenting 
but instead rents itself out to various organizations. 
The number of paid, ticketed performances per year also varies greatly, from 
2,200 at Lincoln Center to 231 at the Wortham. There were 266 such performances 
in 1988 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.
