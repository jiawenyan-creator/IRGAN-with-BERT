  [Text] On 2 February Kazuo Aichi, director general of the 
Defense Agency, objected to opposition voiced by Tomiichi 
Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], against a plan to appropriate funds in the draft budget 
for the next fiscal year for the procurement of Airborne Warning 
and Control System (AWACS) aircraft. 
  He was speaking at a news conference held the same day at 
Hyakuri Air Self-Defense Force Base. Aichi stated: "The 
coalition government started off after confirming it would 
inherit the basic policies of the previous administration 
regarding national security and diplomacy. It is my 
understanding that the plan to purchase AWACS aircraft is a part 
of these policies."
