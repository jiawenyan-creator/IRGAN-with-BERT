FT  21 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Openness in US airline industry
Sir, It is amazing to observe the way that American industry conducts its
trade policies. On the one hand, it accuses the Japanese of shutting down
their domestic market to foreign competitors. On that point, the Americans
are certainly right. However, on the other hand, it would be logical if they
behaved themselves the same way they demand from other countries. For
example, the latest row over the BA-USAir code-sharing agreements ('US
stalls over BA-USAir code-sharing', March 17) proves that contradictory
attitude clearly.
Just as the Japanese companies enjoy their competition-protected home
market, so the American airline industry still does on its domestic routes.
The strategy, which is especially being pursued by American and Delta
Airlines, to refuse foreign carriers access to the US 'core' market does not
correspond to the trade policy of market liberalisation, often lectured on
by the Clinton administration.
It is time to bring the everlasting quarrel in the American airline business
to an end. Good sense demands it.
