The recipient must comply with the document entitled 

Content of AIDS-Related Written Materials, Pictorials, Audiovisuals, Questionnaires, Survey Instruments, and

encouraged to use an existing program review panel, such as the one created by the District of Columbia health department's
HIV/AIDS prevention program. If the recipient forms its own program review panel, at least one member must be an employee
(or a designated representative) of a State or local health department. The names of the review panel members must
be listed on the Assurance of Compliance form CDC 0.1113, which is also included in the application kit. The recipient

available at the CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse.
