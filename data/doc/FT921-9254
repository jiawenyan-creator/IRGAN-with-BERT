FT  13 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Redenomination
WHEN JAPAN'S foreign minister, Mr Michio Watanabe, says that redenominating
the yen would take Japan out of recession, he is talking through his hat.
But Mr Watanabe's idea still deserves more than the brush-off it received
from the Bank of Japan.
Why should the Japanese, excellently educated though they are, have to
employ advanced mental arithmetic to buy a house for several hundred million
yen? Meanwhile, in Italy even a newspaper costs L1,200. The individual
measures of a useful unit of account should have meaningful purchasing
power. Yet an individual lira or yen buys nothing. Things are worse for
policy-makers. At an annualised Y455,600,000,000,000 in late 1991, Japan's
gross national product looks still more overwhelming than it is. And what of
Italian public debt, now at some L1,400,000,000,000,000? The number is too
big to comprehend. No wonder Italian politicians are paralysed.
If the lira were divided by a thousand, it would overtop the D-Mark. If the
yen were divided by a thousand, it would be worth Dollars 8, making it a
suitable symbol for Japan's dynamic economy. So, altogether now: two, four,
six, eight: it's time to redenominate.
