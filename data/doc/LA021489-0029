AQMD ENFORCEMENT ACTION 
After one week, three days and 40 hours on the phone, we still do not know what 
chemicals could have been released from Coastcast in Van Nuys. 
We still have at least 25 residents living in close proximity to the plant who 
are suffering similar symptoms initiated during the same time period. 
Medical care? Be aware, fellow Valley residents, that after any exposure, you 
are responsible for tests (not counting any ongoing treatment) that could begin 
at the very least $1,000 per person. No insurance? Pay up front for a family of 
four: $4,000. 
Do we need changes? You bet. How many other similar situations are out there 
that have never been answered because these agencies and public services could 
not respond to a citizen's critical health complaints? 
As we are forced to live closer and closer to industry, the public should be 
made aware that bloated bureaucracy, inadequate education, lax follow-up and 
wrist-slapping penalties are dangerously affecting our health and well-being. 
So, here we are. No agency, no governing body, no company will take 
responsibility to provide any answers for these trailer park residents. Aren't 
you glad it hasn't happened to you? Yet.
