  [Text] Washington -- Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping has presented a very positive 
review of his talks in Washington. "This is an important and 
successful visit," the SPD candidate for chancellor and minister 
president of Rhineland-Palatinate told journalists on Wednesday 
[13 April]. He met with "a lot of friendliness and attention" 
not only during his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
but also in all the talks with leading government and Congress 
politicians. Former occasional distrust of positions held by 
the German Social Democrats has been replaced by an atmosphere 
of partnership and trust. 
  To conclude his talks in the capital, Scharping wants to 
meet 
with Defense Secretary William Perry and Chief of Staff John 
Shalikashvili on Wednesday. Problems in connection with German 
participation in UN missions is thought to be one of the focal 
issues to be discussed with them. 
  Scharping said that during the talks he has had so far he 
got 
the impression that the question of Bundeswehr participation in 
UN combat missions that is so controversial in Germany is of no 
special urgency to the Americans. Following their experience in 
Somalia, they are hardly thinking of putting combat forces under 
UN command themselves at the moment. It is wrong to create the 
impression that the Americans are pressuring the Germans in this 
matter, the SPD chairman said, hinting at the coalition parties 
in Bonn. Presenting such a view of the matter is not conducive 
to German-U.S. relations. 
  Scharping is going on to New York on Thursday, where he will 
meet, among others, with General Motors chief Jack Smith, former 
secretary of state Henry Kissinger, and representatives of 
Jewish organizations in the United States.
