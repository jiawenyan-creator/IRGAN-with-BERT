  [Text] Australia is stepping up efforts to strengthen 
commercial links with India -- the key focus on a meeting in 
Sydney tomorrow of the Australia-India Joint Ministerial 
Commission. It is the third meeting of the commission since its 
inception in 1989 and will be proceeded by talks today between 
the visiting Indian state minister for commerce, Kamaluddin 
Ahmed, and Australia's new trade minister, Bob McMullan. 
  A business delegation is accompanying Minister Ahmed in 
Australia. The commission meeting will be the first bilateral 
talks between Australia and India since the conclusion of the 
Uraguay Round of the GATT and comes as India continues economic 
reforms. 
  Radio Australia's Canberra's office said Australia's foreign 
minister, Gareth Evans, is wanting to increase the focus on 
India with a major report due soon from Minister Evans' 
department.
