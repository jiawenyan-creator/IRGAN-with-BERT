FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Schroder Japan oversubscribed
Schroders has raised Pounds 125m with its new Japanese investment trust.
Late applications for larger numbers of shares in the public offer are to be
scaled back, as the offer was oversubscribed by Pounds 2.8m, writes Bethan
Hutton.
Of the total, Pounds 88m was raised from an institutional placing, while
applications for Pounds 39.8m were received in the public offer.
Mr Philip Middleton of Smith New Court, sponsors of the issue, said that the
bulk of applications in the public offer were for small lots of shares.
Investors who applied for up to 5,000 shares at 100p will receive the full
amount. Only applications for more than 5,000 shares received after June 17
will be scaled back, by between 10 per cent and 26 per cent.
Mr Jeremy Hill, chairman, said: 'We are delighted with the level of interest
shown in the Schroder Japan Growth Fund, particularly given recent market
turbulence.'
Separate dealings in the shares and warrants, which were attached on a
1-for-5 basis, are due to start on July 11.
