<F P=106> [Report by Luiz Augusto Mendonca in Belem, Para State] </F>
  [Excerpts] Today, here, President Itamar Franco opened the 
24th OAS General Assembly. He advocated strengthening the OAS 
as a political and diplomatic forum dedicated to finding 
peaceful, negotiated settlements to the issues affecting the 34 
OAS member countries. [passage omitted] 
  This afternoon, Franco held a private meeting with ousted 
Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who came to Belem to 
ask the Brazilian Government to support his reinstatement as 
Haitian president. Franco reaffirmed his support for Aristide, 
and once again condemned all totalitarian regimes. 
  Later tonight, Franco will host a dinner at the Para State 
Assembly club for the foreign delegates who are attending the 
OAS meeting.
