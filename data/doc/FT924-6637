FT  20 NOV 92 / Schools point out exam-list mistakes
COMPLAINTS about the accuracy of the government's exam results league tables
came from individual schools and local authorities yesterday.
The first and loudest cry came from the independent sector. Manchester High
School for Girls' had its 100 per cent record for top GCSE grades tabulated
as 16 per cent.
Headteacher Miss Mary Moon 'repeatedly' made the error clear to the
Education Department. She said: 'It was quite clear in the information that
they sent to us to check in October that they had omitted all our entries in
the Northern Examining Board.'
Miss Moon, who as head of an independent school entered the league table
scheme voluntarily, said she was anxious that the bungle might put parents
off sending their children to the school, and was considering taking legal
action.
Another independent school, Rugby, in Warwickshire, also suffered, with all
eight statistics incorrect. The tables gave only 71 per cent of pupils
scoring five or more GCSEs at top grades. The true figure was 96 per cent,
putting Rugby near the top of the league.
Somerset headteacher Mr Roland Chant condemned the 'grossly distorted'
figures published for GCSE exam passes at Holyrood School at Chard. The
tables gave only 6 per cent of pupils achieving five or more A-C passes
instead of the true figure of 46.9 per cent.
Parliament Hill School, a comprehensive girls' school in Camden, north
London, had no A-level passes recorded, instead of an average points score
of 11.3 per pupil.
Ms Judy Box, its headmistress, said: 'I'm totally fed up. I don't know how
much damage this will do us. I'm very concerned for staff, parents and
pupils. I think the department has just mucked this up.'
Local education authorities also produced lists of errors. How many are
valid, and how many the result of inadequate checking by schools and
councils, will be a rich source of dispute.

                        ERRORS AND COMPLAINTS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cambridgeshire claims the tables contain more than 53 errors. At least
30 schools in the area are affected by inaccurate Department of
Education data and five village colleges are listed without name, said
Bill Goodwin, assistant director of education.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Manchester High School for Girls achieved a 100% record for pupils
scoring five or more top GCSE grades. But the league tables give the
figure as just 16 percent
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rugby School, Warwickshire, claims all eight statistics given for it
are incorrect, significantly underplaying its exam success. The tables
say only 71 percent of pupils scored five or more GCSEs at top grades
when the true figure was 94 percent.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Parliament Hill School, a comprehensive girls' school in Camden, north
London, is shown as recording no A-level passes. In fact it achieved an
average points score of 11.3 percent per pupil - the equivalent of two
C grades.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Holyrood School in Chard, Somerset, was listed as having only 6 percent
of pupils with five or more A-C passes at GCSE instead of the true
figure of 46.9 percent.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Results of tertiary and further-education colleges are excluded,
distorting the A-level results for some local education authorities.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Schools which pool their sixth forms are in some cases given no credit
at all for their A-level results.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The tables exclude all pupils achieving GCSE grades who fell outside
the traditional age group for taking GCSEs and A-levels. Independent
schools, in particular, say this discriminates against them.
