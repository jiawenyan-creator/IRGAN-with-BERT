FT  20 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: An empty nest egg
MY PARTNER and I jointly own a house which has been empty for two years. I
wish to sell it but my partner does not. Can I ask the partner to pay me my
share of the value.
You can insist on a sale pursuant to the provisions of Section 30 of the Law
and Property Act 1925, and can insist on being paid your share.
