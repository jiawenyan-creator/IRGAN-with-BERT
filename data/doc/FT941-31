FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Glass write-off
Owens-Corning, the US glass company, said it will report one-off charges of
Dollars 122m after tax in the first quarter of 1994, balanced exactly by a
Dollars 122m after-tax gain from a change in accounting treatment.
Some Dollars 83m of the charges stem from restructuring initiatives which
the company said would improve its earnings per share by between 35 and 40
cents from next year.
The remaining charges reflect accounting changes, while the one-off gain,
equivalent to Dollars 2.74 a share, stems from a switch to the capital
method of accounting for rebuilding facilities.
This method is standard practice in the industry and involves capitalising
costs when incurred and spreading them over the useful life of the
equipment.
