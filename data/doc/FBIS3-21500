  [Text] To hide them from the eyes of international 
inspectors, the regime of tyrant Saddam Husayn has been 
transferring its remaining chemical and biological weapons from 
one place to another. According to people who recently arrived 
in Amman, the dictatorial regime began using the oil 
pipelines--out of operation because of the international 
embargo--in one last attempt to hide its banned weapons.
