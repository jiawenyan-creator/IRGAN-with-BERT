FT  29 MAR 94 / Latin Americans miss Group of 15 summit
A meeting intended as a summit to discuss the uncertain future of the Group
of 15 developing countries got off to a bad start yesterday, when only six
heads of government turned up, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
The G15 opened three-day talks aimed at reviving dialogue on economic and
political co-operation, without leaders from several Latin American nations
there, officials said.
The conference had been billed as a summit of the five-year-old grouping,
which needed 10 heads of government to make a quorum. But only five leaders,
from Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Malaysia and Indonesia arrived to join
India's Premier PV Narasimha Rao.
Absent were heads of state from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Mexico,
Peru, Venezuela, Algeria and Egypt. Those countries not represented by
leaders will have their foreign ministers present for what one official
called 'a crucial meeting in the sense that G15 must decide its own future'.
