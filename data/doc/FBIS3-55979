  [Text] Baku (January 12) TURAN -- The intensity of assault 
abated at all the sectors of the front, a military source 
reports. Therefore, the fightings at the northern, southern and 
central sectors of the front are qualified as trench fightings. 
  Together with this, the villages of Matagiz and Lulasaz 
[Hakop-Kamari] in the northern Karabakh are under the control of 
Azerbaijani army. A high-ranking official at the Azerbaijani 
Defense Ministry rejected all the yesterday's reports of 
Armenian sources about the tremendous losses of Azerbaijani army 
there. He also said, that the fightings for the hills in the 
vicinity of the town of Agdere (Mardakert) go on at this 
direction. 
  The situation at the central (Agdam) and southern (Fizuli) 
sectors of the front are characterised by artillery duels and 
local fightings.
