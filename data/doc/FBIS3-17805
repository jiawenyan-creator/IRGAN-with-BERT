  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin denied US media claims that Russian-US relations are 
"cooling down" and told US Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown on 
Wednesday that the relations are steadily developing along the 
course of partnership, cooperation and friendship. 
  The Russian leader noted that an important role in the issue 
is played by President Bill Clinton and personal contacts 
between the leaders of the two countries. 
  Yeltsin stressed that Russia and the United States have 
reached "good results" at the initial stage of trade and 
economic cooperation and called to further boost relations. 
  The Russian leader said Russia will actively participate in 
international labour division on a mutually beneficial basis.
