U.S. SCIENTISTS STUDY KAMCHATKA VOLCANOES 
Scientists representing two U.S. agencies are studying volcanoes in Soviet 
Kamchatka this month, the first time Westerners have been allowed into the 
region in decades, according to NASA. 
"The Kamchatka Peninsula is both remote and home to sensitive Soviet military 
installations, factors that have discouraged study of the area's volcanoes by 
Soviet scientists and, until now, has kept the area off-limits to Western 
researchers," the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a news release. 
Kamchatka is in the eastern Soviet Union, along the Bering Sea and Pacific 
Ocean. It is part of the Pacific "Ring of Fire," an area of frequent volcanic 
and earthquake activity that includes New Zealand, Japan, Alaska's Aleutian 
Peninsula and the west coasts of North America and South America. 
The five scientists from NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey arrived in 
Kamchatka earlier this month and will conduct joint field studies with Soviet 
researchers until Friday.
