FT  19 FEB 92 / IoD urges more help for small businesses
A RADICAL rethink of the role of small businesses in the economy is needed
if they are to play a full part in improving its performance, the Institute
of Directors said yesterday.
In a document on small companies, published yesterday, the IoD argued that
companies employing fewer than 200 people - which made up 99.5 per cent of
the 2.5m companies in the UK in 1986 - were overburdened by taxation and red
tape.
'Despite a successful move towards the enterprise culture, Britain is still
far from a totally unregulated free market,' said the report.
According to the IoD small businesses spend a bigger proportion of their
time and turnover than bigger companies collecting taxes and paying
benefits.
'Companies collect five sixths of the tax revenue and pay for the
collection,' said Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the IoD. 'We want to
see this burden on business reduced, and we believe firms should be
compensated by the Inland Revenue for administering PAYE, National Insurance
Contributions and statutory sick pay.'
The report said the Treasury should ease the burden of taxation by:
Raising the limits of corporation tax.
Abolishing inheritance tax on business assets.
Raising the threshold for VAT.
Linking the uniform business rate to business benefits.
Giving discounts for prompt and early payment of taxes.
Big firms received a disproportionate amount of attention in the framing of
policy thanks to their ability to make the headlines through lobbying, said
the IoD. This over-representation led to the development of tax and
regulatory systems which imposed excessive burdens on smaller enterprises.
A great many regulations could be abolished, said the report, including many
licensing requirements, and the ban on Sunday trading.
