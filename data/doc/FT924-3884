FT  04 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons deal expected
STRONG rumours that Fisons will shortly announce the sale of its remaining
consumer health and horticulture businesses, lifted the shares. A price tag
of Pounds 300m was suggested by the market. Last week, the group sold the US
divisions of the same businesses for Dollars 140m to Ciba-Geigy, at the same
time inviting bids for the remainder of its operations in these areas
worldwide.
The proposed disposals would transform Fisons balance sheet. Mr Robin
Gilbert at James Capel: 'This would put the company into cash surplus and is
further evidence of determined management action.' German group E Merck is
said to be interested in Fisons vitamin business, which includes the popular
Sanatogen line. Other names being suggested include Boots, whose shares rose
5 to 530p yesterday.
More good news on Fisons came from the US where an industry newsletter
reported that the group was in discussions with third parties in the US over
the production of its Imferon and Opticrom drugs, according to analysts in
London. Both drugs have failed to meet US production regulations. The shares
rose 10 to 223p.
Hanson active
Despite recording a full-year profit fall for the first time, Hanson saw its
shares climb towards their peak at one time after reporting figures above
most analysts' expectations. Later, however, the gain melted away and the
shares closed unchanged on the day at 236p in London on heavy turnover of
13m.
Profits came in at Pounds 1.286bn against Pounds 1.316bn last time but the
group increased the dividend by four per cent. The industrial and consumer
divisions performed well but the building arm was hit by a slump in the
company's UK aggregates business. After the figures, Hanson held an
international conference call with US analysts for the first time. Following
a tightly controlled analysts meeting, UK researchers came away concerned by
what they saw as a veiled warning on UK profits for the current year, a
higher tax charge, and the acquisition accounting employed by the company.
It was those worries that led to the retreat in the shares just ahead of the
market close.
However Mr Jack L. Kelly, Goldman Sachs US-based Hanson analyst said; 'I was
quite pleased with the results. They came in above my estimate of Pounds
1.05bn.' He said he was keeping the stock on his select list in the US and
Goldman Sachs top European stocks.
Figures from Grand Metropolitan received a mixed response, although the
post-results meeting with analysts produced more positive comments. Mr
Graeme Eadie at County NatWest said that while the increase in marketing
expenditure would be rewarded, worries remained over earnings growth
particularly in the short-term. He downgraded his figures 5 per cent to
Pounds 972m for the current year and remains a hold. Others were more
positive. Kleinwort Benson upgraded 10 per cent to Pounds 991m and said that
the 12 per cent discount to the market make the shares a buy. Strauss
Turnbull, citing the positive current trading news, also upgraded,
forecasting Pounds 1bn for 1993 and remaining a buyer. The shares retreated
12 to 428p.
Bass recovered from Wednesday's results mauling, Nikko and Strauss
recommending the stock. The shares rose 15 to 600p. Guinness shed 9 to 534p
after Grand Met suggested weak spirit price inflation.
Shares in international conglomerate BTR gave up an early gain of 5 1/2
after broker Smith New Court placed a block of 7m shares at 516p. Several
dealers talked of initial problems in finding a home for the total amount.
The stock had however been cleared by the close of business which helped the
shares firm a  1/2 to 518p, on total turnover of 17m.
Shares in Royal Insurance fell early in the day after the company announced
a Pounds 70m convertible bond issue. The issue was however later reported to
have been oversubscribed, though sentiment remained depressed by fears of
large claims for flood damage. By the close the shares had fallen 12 to
253p, in heavy trade of 7.4m with some dealers saying some investors were
selling stock to take up the issue.
Shares in Abbey National fell 5 to 373p, after it was reported that Moody's,
the US credit rating agency, had downgraded some of the banks.
HSBC had a volatile session. Early in the day the shares fell 25 to 455p,
following heavy falls in Honk Kong Bargain hunters however came in later in
a big way which and helped the shares close 5 up at 485p, after heavy trade
of 23m shares.
Also busy was Royal Bank of Scotland. The shares jumped 8 to 189p, following
a positive meeting after the release of full year figures in line with
market forecasts. Turnover rose to 13m.
Turnover in BP rose to 10m as the shares fell 4 to 230p, on the back of the
weakened oil price. Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull said: 'Investors
realise falling oil prices will play havoc with BP's cash flow and balance
sheet.'
Alexon fell heavily after issuing a trading warning. The shares retreated 27
to 98p.
