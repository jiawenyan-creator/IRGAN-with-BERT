  [Text] Moscow, June 8, RIA -- About half a million Russians 
live now in Azerbaijan and not more than 50,000 people have left 
the republic over the years of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. RIA 
has learnt these figures from Irshad Aliyev, chairman of the 
State Committee of Azerbaijan on Refugees and Forced 
Re-settlers, who is now attending the Moscow international 
conference on refugees on the territory of the former USSR. 
"There have never been calls in Baku to drive away Russians 
from our republic," stressed Irshad Aliyev. 
  He referred to the problem of refugees and forced resettlers 
as "the most tragic consequence" of the 6-year-long war between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan. At the beginning of 1994, Azerbaijan 
registered over a million migrants, including more than 200,000 
Azeris and Muslim Kurds evicted from Armenia. 
  Refugees in Azerbaijan receive help not only from the Azeri 
Government but also from other countries, including Russia, as 
well as the UN, noted Irshad Aliyev.
