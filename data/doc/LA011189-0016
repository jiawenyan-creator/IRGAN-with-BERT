MIRACLE BEAN 
Your story about Jean-Pierre Hallet, winner of the 1987 Presidential End Hunger 
Award and his "miracle" winged bean seeds (Metro, Dec. 18) reminds me of a 
cartoon called "The Shmoo" created by Al Capp of Dogpatch fame. One day Li'l 
Abner wandered into a hidden canyon (the Valley of the Shmoon) and discovered 
these amazing and prolific little animals who, with the slightest urging, could 
lay dairy-fresh eggs, give the finest creamy butter and Grade A milk, make 
yummy steaks and, when fried, they taste just like chicken -- and all white 
meat. Their skins even make excellent leather or cloth, depending how thick you 
slice it. Nothing is wasted: even their eyes make splendid suspender buttons. 
Hallet's end-hunger campaign, based on his fast-growing, drought-resistant 
soybean-like legume, has not met with much success despite the fact that the 
U.S. Academy of Sciences called it a "supermarket on a stalk." Its leaves are 
like Vitamin A-enriched spinach, the shoots like asparagus, the flowers like 
mushrooms, the young pods like snow peas and the tubers like potatoes. The 
protein-rich brown seeds can be roasted like peanuts, processed into milk or 
ground into flour. 
Al Capp's Shmoo was eventually done in by misguided opponents. Hallet, however, 
should not be discouraged and must keep up the good fight. His product has 
deeper roots.
