NO CHANGE IN AILING MARCOS' CONDITION 
Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, clinging to life after 
suffering kidney, cardiac and pulmonary failure, continued to rally Sunday in a 
Honolulu hospital but was still listed in extremely critical condition, 
hospital officials said. 
Marcos, 71 -- exiled here with his family since February, 1986 -- is more alert 
and communicative, said a hospital spokesman, but the prognosis is still poor 
because of his weakened condition. 
Marcos, hospitalized since January, remains attached to a respirator, a 
hemodialysis blood-cleansing machine and monitors.
