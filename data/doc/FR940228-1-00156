 

&bull;An institution should not be obligated to enter into an 
agreement with a student who wants to study abroad. 
[New York] 

3. How should the term ``approved for credit'' be defined? 

&bull;The term ``approved for credit'' should mean that credits 
are fully transferable (accepted for credit) into an 
eligible program offered by the home institution. 
[Kansas City] 

&bull;``Approved for credit'' should mean used toward a degree 
as defined by the institution. [San Francisco] 

&bull;``Approved for credit'' should mean that it is determined 
in advance that the credit is accepted at the home 
institution. [Atlanta] 

4. Should a standard format be developed for institutions to 
report study abroad programs? 

&bull;A standard format for institutions to report study 
abroad programs is not needed. It does not appear that 
any reporting is required. [Kansas City, New York, 
San Francisco, Atlanta] 

D. Section 487(a)(14)(A) requires a new institution or an 
institution that undergoes a change of ownership or changes its 
status as a parent or subordinate institution to develop a 
Default Management Plan to participate in the FFEL program. The 
Secretary must approve the plan and the plan must be implemented 
for two years after the institution is initially certified as an 
eligible institution or for two years after its change of 
ownership or status. 

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 

1. Should the criteria in Appendix D of current regulations be 
used as the basis for the Secretary's approval of default plans? 

&bull;Unless otherwise required, an institution should use 
Appendix D or submit any other approved default 
management plan. [Kansas City, Atlanta] 

&bull;If a new institution uses Appendix D, it is subject to 
things it can't do as a new institution. What is in 
Appendix D that isn't in the new regulations already? 
New institutions will certify that they will adopt the 
stipulated plan they have in place (that has approval 
from the appropriate State and or accrediting body.) 
[New York] 

2. Should there be other criteria? 

&bull;Other criteria should include: a) more follow up once 
the student leaves the institution; and b) additional 
cooperation with all partners in the program, i.e., 
lenders, institutions, and secondary markets. The 
Department should reassess the method for determining 
cohort default rate. It is not fair for most 
institutions. [San Francisco] 

&bull;No other criteria is needed. [Atlanta] 

E. Section 487(a)(18)(A) requires an institution that offers 
athletically-related student aid to compile annually data on 
expenses and revenues of athletic activities and expenses and 
revenues of the institution. 

1. How should the terms ``revenues'' and ``expenses'' be defined? 

&bull;There should be coordination with NCAA regulations and 
audit guides. [San Francisco] 

&bull;Institutions should be allowed to use the accounting 
principles and terms they are currently using to define 
``revenues'' and ``expenses.'' [Kansas City] 

F. Section 487(a)(19) provides that if a student is unable to 
meet his or her financial obligation to the institution because 
of a delay in the disbursement of proceeds of a Title IV, HEA 
program loan (due to compliance with Title IV requirements or 
delays attributable to the institution), the institution may not 
penalize the student in any way, including assessing a late fee; 
denying the student access to class, the library, or other 
facilities; or requiring that the student borrow additional 
funds. 

1. How should the term ``denial of access to classes'' be 
interpreted? 

&bull;``Denial of access'' should mean the student is not given 
access to equipment or supplies. [San Francisco] 

2. What should be considered as a condition to meet the 
definition of a ``delay in the delivery of proceeds?''
