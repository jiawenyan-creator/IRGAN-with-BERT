WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL 
The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues 
at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from 
today's and Sunday's program follow. 
TODAY 
'Ginger Ale Afternoon' 
United States, 1988, 94 minutes 
4:30 p.m. 
 Sassy and sensual, this adaptation of Gina Wendkos' play about a California 
trailer court couple -- a very pregnant wife, an unemployed philandering 
husband -- becomes a deeply touching affair. It's partly because of Dana 
Anderson as the nagging, loving wife and John M. Jackson as the exasperated 
husband, as well as bubble-gum-voiced Yeardly Smith as his baby-doll mistress. 
The film's other pluses come from director Rafal Zielinski, cinematographer 
Yuri Neyman ("Liquid Sky"), and the great blues score by Willie Dixon. 
RECOMMENDED. SHEILA BENSON
