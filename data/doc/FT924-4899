FT  30 NOV 92 / Observer: Cutting back
It sounds as if chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont is not the only
member of the government who may be living beyond his means. Observer hears
that Alastair Burt, a junior minister in the department of social security,
has requested a copy of Bernadine Lawrence's useful new book, 'How to feed
your family on Pounds 5 a day'.
Given that the National Consumer Council estimates that the average family
spends at least Pounds 60 a week on food, Burt should have recouped his
Pounds 3.99 outlay in a couple of days if he sticks to the diet.
