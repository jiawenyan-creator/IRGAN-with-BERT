  [Excerpt] Members of the Human Rights sub-committee of the 
Swaziland Law Society have described the Non-Bailable Offences 
(Amendment) Bill, 1994, as a double edged sword which must be 
removed. 
  The law is to be amended to strengthen its force, according 
to the Minister for Justice Chief Maweni Simelane. 
  The lawyers said this legislation is contrary to every 
civilised notion of justice. 
  This is contained in a series of documents prepared by the 
organisation and which have been made available to THE TIMES. 
  The lawyers said the law is likely to cause more harm than 
the good that is presumably intended. They said the proposed 
amendment to the non-bailable offence legislation seeks to 
deprive the courts of the last vestiges of discretion left to 
them. "The likelihood of injustice is increased," they said. 
They said it is essential that the Courts be left with a 
discretion to enable each case to be dealt with on its merits.
