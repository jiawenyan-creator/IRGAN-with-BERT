FT  26 FEB 92 / World News in Brief: US Democrat Kerrey ahead in S Dakota
primary
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska won the South Dakota Democratic presidential
primary early today, ahead of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and national
front-runner Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, according to exit polls.
President George Bush won the Republican primary without opposition, the
exit polls showed, as Pat Buchanan, his rightwing opponent in New Hampshire,
was too late to get his name on the ballot. Nevertheless, as many as 30 per
cent of Republican voters chose uncommitted delegates rather than back the
president.
