FT  25 JAN 92 / Bill on access to records fails
A FURTHER attempt to prevent the government cloaking its activities in
unnecessary secrecy failed in the Commons yesterday.
The Freedom of Information Bill, sponsored by Mr Archie Kirkwood, Liberal
Democrat MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, was denied a second reading after
being strongly criticised by Mr Tim Renton, minister responsible for the
Civil Service.
The Bill sought to establish a broad right of access to official records for
the public.
