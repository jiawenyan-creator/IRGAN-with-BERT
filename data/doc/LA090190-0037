VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA; 
LEGISLATURE APPROVES TRAFFIC SIGNAL FUNDS 
A state law aimed at improving traffic signal efficiency in Ventura has been 
passed by the Legislature and sent to the governor for approval, state 
officials said. 
The legislation gives Ventura $200,000 to help it connect 40 of 95 traffic 
signals to a central Traffic Signal Surveillance System computer within the 
city. 
The connection synchronizes the signals, allows them to adjust to traffic flow, 
detects malfunctions, reduces vehicle delay and improves air quality, said 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria). 
The governor has until Sept. 30 to approve the legislation. SCOTT LAWRENCE
