FT  11 JAN 93 / Rao misses summit as unrest continues
MR PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, cancelled a visit to
Bangladesh as Bombay and parts of Gujarat state in western India continued
to burn for the sixth consecutive day yesterday.
Mr Rao was due to attend a meeting of the South Asian Association for
Regional Co-operation scheduled for Thursday and Friday. The summit was
postponed indefinitely after India made clear at the weekend that the
'atmosphere was not conducive' to holding the conference.
Bombay has been tense since last month's nationwide riots, triggered by the
razing of a mosque in Ayodhya, northern India, by supporters of the radical
Hindu Bharatiya Janata party. More than 1,200 people died in the ensuing
violence.
Political sources said the new flare-ups appeared to have been fanned by
Hindu political groups trying to push Mr Rao into an early general election.
The latest phase of violence between Hindus and Moslems has claimed at least
168 lives. Bombay, India's business capital, came to a standstill as 80 more
people died yesterday. Arson and looting continued unabated in several parts
of the city, despite the deployment of the army.
Police patrols, which had been accused of siding with the Hindu community
during the violence that swept the city in December, were shot at and had
acid, petrol bombs and stones thrown at them.
In Ahmadabad and Baroda in Gujarat, more than 30 people were killed and 150
left homeless at the weekend before the authorities restored order. Six
leaders of the BJP, including Mr Lal Krishan Advani and Mr Murli Manohar
Joshi, are expected to be released unconditionally today, under orders from
the Uttar Pradesh chief judicial magistrate. The men were arrested for
inciting communal violence by encouraging the destruction of the Ayodhya
mosque.
