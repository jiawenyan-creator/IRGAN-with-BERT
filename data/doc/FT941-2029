FT  23 MAR 94 / Print union may re-run election
The GPMU print union may have to re-run its presidential election as a
result of allegations of unfair campaigning for candidates by some branches.
Eight candidates are contesting the election to succeed Mr Bryn Griffiths
who is retiring.
One of the candidates, Mr Doug Douglas, alleges that left-wing branches have
been campaigning beyond the rules on behalf of the Liverpool printworker Mr
Ray Williams.
Under the union's strict rules on campaigning, candidates are allowed only
400 words in the union journal and 400 words on the ballot paper.
