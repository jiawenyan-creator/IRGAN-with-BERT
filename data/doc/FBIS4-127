  [Text] A new snap poll commissioned by the SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] reveals little support among 
whites for the right-wing and a volkstaat [homeland]. The poll 
shows that 60 percent of whites are opposed to the idea of a 
volkstaat, and that 68 percent of right-wing supporters are 
opposed to withdrawing from the election. The poll shows that 
the Freedom Front leader, General Constand Viljoen, is far more 
popular among right-wingers than the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[Afrikaner National Front] leader, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, and 
AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche. 
However, State President F.W. de Klerk, remains the most 
popular leader among whites with 72 percent support.
