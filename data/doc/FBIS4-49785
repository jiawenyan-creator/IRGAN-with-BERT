  [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman today in Beijing answered a reporter's question and 
said that all Chinese in Yemen are safe and they will be 
evacuated from that country as quickly as possible. 
  A reporter asked: Serious armed conflicts have broken out in 
Yemen recently, and various countries have evacuated their 
people from Yemen. Has China evacuated Chinese personnel from 
Yemen? 
  The spokesman answered: On 5 May, armed conflict took place 
between south and north Yemen. The battles mainly took place in 
south Yemen. The Chinese Government is very much concerned 
about the safety of the Chinese diplomats, engineers, and 
workers there and has instructed our country's departments 
concerned to make arrangements for the evacuation of Chinese. 
As of this time, all personnel from our country in Yemen are 
safe and sound. Most Chinese people working in south Yemen have 
been evacuated safely to Djibouti by sea. The remaining people 
will also be evacuated as quickly as possible. The evacuation 
work is being carried out smoothly.
