FT  04 DEC 92 / Societies at odds on house price rises
BRITAIN'S two largest building societies disagreed yesterday on whether
house prices were still falling or had started to rise, Andrew Taylor
writes.
Halifax, the country's largest society, with about a fifth of the mortgage
market, reported that house prices had risen by 0.1 per cent last month, the
first monthly increase recorded by the society since June.
Nationwide, its nearest rival, said prices had fallen on average by 2 per
cent in November, the second-largest monthly fall reported by the society
since October last year.
The difference between the figures illustrates uncertainty in the housing
market after sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism in
September.
