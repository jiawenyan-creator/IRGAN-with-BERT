FT  18 OCT 93 / US stands by to intervene in Haiti
THE US has not ruled out military intervention in Haiti to protect American
lives and restore democracy there, President Bill Clinton's ambassador to
the United Nations said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Ms Madeleine Albright said Washington was monitoring the situation closely
and was standing by to evacuate some 1,000 Americans if necessary.
'The protection of American lives is foremost in our minds,' she said. 'We
don't rule anything in or anything out. This is a very tense situation, but
one in which we have to maintain calmness about our response.'
Reports from Port-au-Prince said hundreds of foreigners fled Haiti yesterday
after a night of heavy gunfire in some of the capital's neighbourhoods.
The country's international airport was jammed with American and Canadian
citizens who were urged to leave Haiti or take security precautions ahead of
stringent UN trade sanctions which come into effect at midnight tonight New
York time.
On Saturday the US embassy flew in 30 additional Marine guards and set up a
telephone network to alert American citizens about potential violence.
The Canadian embassy has urged all 2,300 of its citizens to leave the
country immediately.
US warships and three Canadian vessels, some visible from the capital city,
will make sure that no fuel or arms are allowed to enter Haiti. The UN
sanctions also include freezing the foreign bank accounts of army chief
General Raoul Cedras and other military leaders.
Ms Albright said the US was still hoping that Gen Cedras would step aside
and allow democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return
to power on October 30. Gen Cedras led the 1991 coup that ousted Mr
Aristide.
Gen Cedras refused to relinquish power on Friday, as had been scheduled
under a UN plan to return Mr Aristide to power.
