CITY 4-A BASEBALL PLAYOFFS CANCELED BECAUSE OF BOYCOTT BY COACHES 
City Section officials Tuesday canceled their 4-A Division high school baseball 
playoffs, scheduled to start today, because of a coaches' boycott stemming from 
the teachers' strike against the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
The 3-A Division playoffs will start today as scheduled, Commissioner Hal 
Harkness said. 
Harkness announced the cancellation after a poll of the 16 schools whose teams 
had qualified revealed that only six were willing to field teams without the 
coach of record. Harkness declined to name the schools. District rules dictate 
that the school official coaching a team must be a credentialed employee. 
Despite a recommendation by the Los Angeles City Coaches Assn. that teachers 
honoring picket lines continue to coach their teams, a group of 18 4-A coaches 
voted last week to boycott the season until the strike ends. 
Playoffs have continued in all other spring sports -- golf, gymnastics, 
softball, swimming, track and volleyball. JOHN LYNCH
