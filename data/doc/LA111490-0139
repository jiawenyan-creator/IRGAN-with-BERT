TITAN POINT GUARD MIGHT NEED SURGERY 
Cal State Fullerton point guard Wayne Williams, the Titans' only returning 
full-time starter, might have to have surgery to remove a bone chip in his 
ankle, Coach John Sneed said Tuesday. 
Williams, who averaged 9.8 points and 7.2 assists per game last season, will 
undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test on the ankle today to determine the 
severity of the problem. 
Titan trainer Jerry Lloyd said the size and location of the bone chip would 
determine whether surgery was required. There's also a chance that Williams, 
who has experienced nagging pain in the ankle for several weeks and missed 
practice Monday and Tuesday, suffered a stress fracture. 
Lloyd said that if surgery isn't necessary, Williams would receive cortisone 
shots and could play when the pain subsides. That would put the junior on a 
day-to-day status. 
Dwayne Bradbury, a 6-foot-4 guard from Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, 
has made an oral commitment to play basketball at Fullerton. Bradbury, who 
plays point guard and shooting guard, said he will sign a national letter of 
intent today or Thursday. MIKE DiGIOVANNA
