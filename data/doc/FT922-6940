FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price to sell paper
distribution units
ABITIBI-Price, 80 per cent owned by the Reichmann brothers through Olympia &amp;
York developments, is selling its printing and industrial paper products
distribution business in Canada and the US to Alco Standard for CDollars
340m (USDollars 285.7m) cash.
The deal includes four Abitibi units: Inter City Papers, Barber Ellis Fine
Papers and Price Daxion in Canada and Whitaker Carpenter in the US.
Mr Ron Oberlander, president of Abitibi, said the proceeds will be used to
reduce Abitibi's debt. He stressed that Abitibi had no intention of paying a
special dividend.
'We are carrying out our strategy to sell non-core businesses,' he said.
'The four businesses now being sold have annual sales of CDollars 850m, are
profitable and represent most of our diversified products group.' Last year
Abitibi, one of North America's largest newsprint producers, had sales of
just over CDollars 3bn.
Mr Oberlander said Abitibi wants to sell its building products business,
several paper converting units and an office products distributor when the
timing is right.
