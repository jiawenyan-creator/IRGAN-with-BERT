FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Record life business lifts
Liberty 27.1%
South African life assurer Liberty Life, which recently successfully floated
a Dollars 300m international bond issue, has boosted attributable earnings
27.1 per cent to R225m (Dollars 61.1m) for the six months to June, up from
R177m a year ago.
The good results were due largely to record levels of new business from life
operations, as total new business written by Liberty and its wholly owned
subsidiary, Charter Life, reached R1.69bn, up from R1.04bn a year ago.
Single premiums rose 81 per cent to R1.25bn from R692m while net annualised
recurring premiums increased by 28 per cent to R441m from R344m. The interim
cash dividend was increased 20 per cent to 96 cents from 80 cents.
Management reported that the Liberty group had raised around R5bn in capital
over the past year through the bond issue, the flotation of UK-based Capital
Shopping Centres and 80 per cent of subsidiary Libsil and through
TransAtlantic Holdings. However, the company said it no immediate plans for
an American acquisition.
Liberty's parent company, Liberty Holdings, reported a 21.3 per cent
increase in attributable profits for the six-month period to R137.9m, up
from R113.7m. After-tax profit rose 21.6 per cent to R370.1m from R304.3m
while the dividend was raised to 264 cents, 20 per cent up from last year's
220 cents.
