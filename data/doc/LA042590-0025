U.S. TUNA CANNERS PLEDGE MORE PROTECTION FOR DOLPHINS 
The H.J. Heinz Co. is to be congratulated for assuming a leadership role in the 
fight to preserve dolphins and the myriad hundreds of thousands of other marine 
creatures which incidentally and yearly die in deep sea drift nets and purse 
seine nets (Part A, April 13). And Bumble Bee Seafoods and the Van Camp Seafood 
Co. are likewise to be congratulated for joining in the effort to preserve 
marine life. 
Most of all, however, people must understand that Star-Kist's move to save 
dolphins is the direct result of a well-organized grass-roots lobby to ban the 
killing of dolphins by the tuna industry, and that the voluntary cooperation of 
Star-Kist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea is only a first step in the 
struggle to preserve the bio-diversity of our oceans. 
Saving marine species from extinction, and keeping our oceans from becoming 
aquatic deserts is an international task. The Japanese have already responded, 
saying they will not follow the lead of American companies. If we are to 
succeed in preserving ocean life, the U.S. must act quickly to assume a 
leadership role. Congress must pass the Boxer-Biden bill (the Dolphin 
Protection Act) which would make dolphin-safe labeling law; and pressure must 
be directed at President Bush to fulfill his pledge to be an environmental 
president. The White House must adopt a leadership role in promoting 
international treaties and agreements which would ban, worldwide, the use of 
fishing technologies which incidentally kill dolphins and other marine life.
