VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SOMIS; 
DISTRICT TO EXPAND ANTI-DRUG EFFORT 
The Somis Union School District's Board of Trustees is moving to bolster its 
alcohol- and drug-education programs to help obtain more federal and state 
funding for fighting substance abuse. 
Board members, representing a Ventura County district with one kindergarten 
through eighth-grade school of 321 students, said the decision was solely based 
on the need for Somis to be in compliance with new federal and state 
regulations. 
"There's money available through the county and down to the school districts, 
but you have to create certain policies," said Dale Forgey, Somis principal and 
district superintendent. 
"Certain kinds of conditions need to exist in order to get money, which 
includes things like a community involvement from law enforcement and staff. 
What we're going to do is expand our old program and infuse more money into 
staff development and student training." 
Somis received $500 in federal and state aid last year, Forgey said. He added 
that by enhancing the drug-education programs, the district will receive as 
much as $5,000. 
"We're not doing this because we think we have a drug problem. We're doing this 
because we don't want to get a drug problem," Board President Alda Perry said. 
In other business, the board voted to eliminate health benefits as an option 
for future Somis board members. SCOTT LAWRENCE
