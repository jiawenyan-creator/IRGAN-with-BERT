FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: CIBC hit by CDollars 1bn loan
losses provision
A SPECIAL CDollars 1bn provision for property loan losses taken in the
second quarter reduced Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's total fiscal
1992 earnings to CDollars 12m (USDollars 9.4m), compared with CDollars 811m
a year earlier.
After preferred dividends, the bank suffered a net loss of 59 cents a share
for the year to October 31, against net profit equal to CDollars 3.93 a
share a year earlier. The quarterly dividend rate is capped at 33 cents a
share.
Fourth-quarter earnings were CDollars 45m, or 9 cents a share, against
CDollars 225m, or CDollars 1.09 a share, a year earlier. An additional
special provision of CDollars 150m was made.
CIBC's CDollars 1bn write-off was announced on April 27. The bank had
CDollars 860m in loans to the Olympia &amp; York group, about half for Canary
Wharf in London and the rest for Canadian and US operations. CIBC and Royal
Bank are the most exposed of the big six Canadian banks to O&amp;Y.
The second-quarter and fourth-quarter special provisions also cover
corporate bad loans in Canada and Australia.
CIBC said net non-performing loans at October 31 were CDollars 3.1bn, or 3.1
per cent of total loans, against CDollars 1.9bn or 2 per cent, a year
earlier.
Non-interest income was up 11 per cent on the year, with strong investment
banking performance, and gains in personal deposits, residential mortgages
and credit card business.
Total assets at year end were CDollars 132bn, up 9 per cent.
Magna International, Canada's biggest independent car parts producer,
sharply improved profits for the first quarter of fiscal 1993 and is raising
the quarterly dividend from 10 cents to 15 cents.
Earnings rose to CDollars 31.7m, or 76 cents a share, up 24 per cent from
CDollars 25.5m, or 92 cents, on sales of CDollars 615m, against CDollars
617m.
