  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- Japan will grant a total of 
18.4 million yen in aid to three nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) operating in Myanmar [Burma], a senior Foreign Ministry 
official said Thursday [3 March]. 
  The assistance includes 8.4 million yen to the Myanmar Red 
Cross Society to strengthen emergency services and 4.2 million 
yen to the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association to 
promote health of mothers and children, the official said. 
  It also includes 5.8 million yen to a French NGO, the 
Medicine San Frontier, to support its fight against malaria in 
Rakhine, Myanmar's western state bordering Bangladesh, he said. 
  Japan suspended official development assistance to Myanmar 
after the 1988 military coup. But it has been offering 
emergency and humanitarian aid on a case-by-case basis.
