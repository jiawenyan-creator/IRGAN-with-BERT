FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: ICI in talks over sale of US arm
Imperial Chemical Industries is in talks to sell its Arizona-based Fiberite
Composites Business, the last significant legacy of the UK chemical giant's
unsuccessful venture into advanced materials.
ICI said market rumours had forced it to announce the possible disposal. If
and when a deal was concluded, it would involve the writedown of about
Pounds 100m, including Pounds 77m of purchased goodwill. However, ICI
refused to identify the prospective buyer or the price. The shares closed 7p
lower at 761p.
Fiberite, which employs about 800 people in the US and several dozen in
Germany, produces thermo-set materials in their unfinished state, or
pre-pregs.
Fiberite was bought in 1984 as part of ICI's Dollars 750m acquisition of
Beatrice Chemical of the US. Pre-pregs, made of woven carbon fibres and
resin, are used to make aeroplane parts such as tail fins and wing flaps.
ICI decided to get out of advanced materials before the restructuring
process which saw the hiving off of its pharmaceuticals arm earlier this
year to create Zeneca. ICI said yesterday: 'Advanced materials have not
fulfilled the growth potential we saw in them in the 1980s.'
Analysts said ICI was at a competitive disadvantage in the manufacture of
pre-pregs because it had to buy most of the feedstocks from rival chemical
groups.
One said ICI produced a insignificant proportion of the added value in
thermo-set, so the intrinsic profitability was small.
Fiberite last year made an operating loss of Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds
94m.
