FT  22 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's of London
The drop in capacity at Lloyd's of London from Pounds 10.9bn to Pounds 10bn
for next year is not as big as could have been hoped for. The market is now
operating at excess capacity, increasing the temptation for Lloyd's
underwriters to take on poor quality business. But Lloyd's faces bigger
problems. Litigation hangs over the market and plans to hive off pre-1985
risks to Equitas, a company due to be formed to take over such long-tail
business, are fraught with difficulty. The exodus of individual names, which
are down 16 per cent for next year, is set to continue: the suspicion is
that many are waiting for Equitas to be established before quitting the
market. Lloyd's will be obliged to attract capital from corporate investors
in order to survive. Whether it can do this remains an open question. That
the years 1993 to 1995 are set to be profitable will make things easier, but
profits for 1993 will not be reported until 1996.
