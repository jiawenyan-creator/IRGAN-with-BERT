FT  22 JAN 94 / GP drugs budgets to rise by 12%
The government has increased its allocations for general practitioner
prescribing by 12.3 per cent for 1994-95, compared with the current year, in
spite of ministerial claims last year that the National Health Service drugs
bill was already too high.
The health department said the rise meant it expected GPs in England to
spend Pounds 3.2bn on drugs. GPs prescribe about 80 per cent of drugs by
value, with the rest from hospitals.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said the increase was partly the result
of 'the continuing rise in the number of elderly patients and medical and
pharmaceutical advances'.
New drugs such as Glaxo's Imigran, the first mass-market migraine treatment,
launched last year, may have played a role in the higher bill.
But the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries responded to the
DoH statement by arguing that prices of drugs had actually fallen in real
terms. It said: 'Drug prices were subject to a 2.5 per cent decrease in 1993
and have been effectively frozen for the next three years.'
