STATISTICS 
The statistically accurate and factually descriptive report by David G. Savage 
in "1 in 4 Young Blacks in Jail or in Court, Study Says" (Part A, Feb. 27), 
nevertheless needs careful interpretation and a closer analysis. 
Otherwise unhealthy social stereotypes and prejudices will receive additional 
credence in our population. 
It is absolutely essential when comparing samples from different racial and 
ethnic groups that the samples are of similar groups, in addition to the bare 
fact of color or ethnic background. 
In studies of crime, it is important that socioeconomic factors are similar in 
the samples used in the study. For example, I believe it would be essential to 
compare crime rates for samples on the basis of several levels of income, or 
lack of it. In that way we could have a better look at the causes of crime, and 
aim for partial solutions. 
May I give an example of the need for interpretation: I believe we cannot 
compare teen-age pregnancies between black and white youngsters, unless the two 
groups compared are equivalent samples with regard to socioeconomic 
circumstances. 
Statistics in themselves may be accurate but misleading!
