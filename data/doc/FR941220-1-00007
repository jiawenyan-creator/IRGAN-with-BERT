ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
(AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. This proposal would 
require installation of modified engine de-ice timers, modification of the electrical wiring 
for the duct heat of the engine air intake, and installation of a time delay for the de-ice 
system in the air intake duct of the right engine. This proposal would also require 
associated revisions to the Airplane Flight Manual. This proposal is prompted by reports 
of ice that accreted in the engine air intake ducts and was ingested into the engine; this 
resulted in engine power rollback (loss of engine power). The actions specified by the 
proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of multiple engine power during flight in icing 
conditions.
