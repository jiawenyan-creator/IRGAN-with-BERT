SCHOOL GUNS: Guns are becoming more common in Orange County schools, according 
to Presiding Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson. Jameson says he is hearing 
about one firearms case a day now, compared to one a week five years ago. . . . 
Principals in South County high schools have also noted the increase; students 
say they carry the weapons for protection. . . . "Now it's happening in 
community schools in economic and racial areas where it may not have been 
happening before," Jameson said. Mark I. Pinsky and David Reyes
