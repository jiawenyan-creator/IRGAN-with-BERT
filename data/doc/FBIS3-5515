  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's cabinet approved Tuesday bills to cut local taxes, as 
part of a planned one-year 6-trillion yen reduction in income 
taxes for 1994. The bills, still subject to Diet approval, call 
for a 1.7 trillion yen reduction in residential tax, while also 
allowing local governments to issue debt-financing bonds to pay 
for the local tax cut. 
  Leaders of the ruling coalition agreed last month to cut 
income taxes for one year as part of the latest 
recession-fighting package designed to stimulate the sluggish 
economy.
