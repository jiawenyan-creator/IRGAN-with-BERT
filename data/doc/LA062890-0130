SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE; 
HILLSIDE MORATORIUM OKD 
The moratorium on hillside development was extended for 10 months and 15 days 
in a special City Council meeting last week to allow the Hillside Task Force to 
complete its work on a new ordinance. 
The special meeting was called after city officials realized that a 45-day, 
urgency moratorium adopted May 8 was due to expire last Friday. 
The moratorium originally was put in place to allow time for the task force to 
finish work on the new ordinance. The council in January hastily adopted a 
temporary, strict hillside development ordinance after learning that a previous 
two-year moratorium had expired.
