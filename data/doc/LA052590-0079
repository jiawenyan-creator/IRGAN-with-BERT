'DAY WITHOUT CARS' IGNORED IN MADRID 
Motorists in traffic-congested Madrid ignored calls for a "day without cars" 
Thursday, snarling the Spanish capital with traffic jams as usual. 
Police said traffic decreased by only 3%. 
Mayor Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun promised to leave his car at home and use 
public transit as an example to commuters to keep cars for weekends.
