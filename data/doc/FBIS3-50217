  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 21 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar said on Slovak radio today he did not expect 
that the questions concerning the disputed stretches of the 
Czech-Slovak border could be resolved this year. He was 
reacting to statements made by Czech and Slovak Interior 
Ministers Jan Ruml and Jozef Tuchynna last week that they would 
recommend that, in the process of solving open questions 
surrounding the Czech-Slovak border, the Sidonie village be 
joined to the Czech Republic while the part of the Moravian 
village Javornik, called U Sabotu, be joined to the Slovak 
village Vrbovce. 
  "The ministers have only a consultative function," Meciar 
said, adding that the border questions lie in the jurisdiction 
of parliaments. Meciar confirmed his commitment that "not a 
square centimeter of Slovak land will be given to the Czech part 
without compensation and without the act being confirmed by 
agreement of the legislative bodies." 
  Regarding another problem concerning the Czech holiday 
cottage resort of Kasarna near the Slovak village of Makov, 
Meciar said that the Slovak side considers any discussion with 
the Czechs on the problem to be out of the question.
