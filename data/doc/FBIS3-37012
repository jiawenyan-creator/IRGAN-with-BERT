  [Text] Moscow, 11 Feb -- "We have discussed the most 
topical issues of political life in the republic and those 
problems that exist around Tajikistan, with the aim of 
stabilizing political activity and attracting all forces 
interested in Tajikistan's prosperity, or at least in Tajikistan 
overcoming the political and economic crisis," Abduzhalil 
Samadov, chairman of Tajikistan Council of Ministers, told 
journalists today after a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, the 
Tajikistan Council of Ministers chairman said that significant 
progress was reached in the development of bilateral ties 
between the republic and its Central Asian neighbors. Working 
groups have been set up at an intergovernment level. They will 
deal with developing trade and economic cooperation between the 
states and we believe that this will inevitably lead to positive 
results. 
  In Andrey Kozyrev's view, it is necessary to work together 
in 
order not to miss currently available opportunities in the 
settlement of the crisis in Tajikistan. "The prospects for such 
settlement," the Russian minister stressed, "will depend totally 
on the purposefulness and coordination of our actions." He said 
that he had discussed these issues during his recent tours of 
the countries of the region and with other Commonwealth states. 
  In the opinion of the Russian minister, by joining efforts 
and "by relying on the realistic and business-like approach of 
Tajikistan's leadership," it is possible to make these prospects 
both real and peaceful and find a way out of the crisis. "It is 
possible to resolve this complex problem by joining efforts," 
the minister stressed. "There was great confidence in this 
respect."
