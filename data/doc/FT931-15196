FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister hints at access to
documents
SENSITIVE government documents kept secret for more than 30 years under the
present rules on disclosure could be published under an initiative from Mr
William Waldegrave, the public-service minister, Alison Smith writes.
Mr Waldegrave has asked departments to consider releasing papers identified
by historians as being of particular value.
Answering questions from the cross-party Treasury and Civil Service
committee he said that there were 'too many' documents still held beyond 30
years, but insisted that bringing forward the date at which papers could
generally be published would diminish the 'necessary frankness' in
government documents.
He also expressed regret that, in writing their memoirs, former cabinet
ministers had disregarded conventions about revealing cabinet and
departmental discussions, saying that the practice was extremely unfair to
officials.
