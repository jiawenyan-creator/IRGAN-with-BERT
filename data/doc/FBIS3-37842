<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Our Man in the CIA Was Stopped From </F>
Carrying Out a Second Five-Year Mission"] 
  [Text] A few days ago CIA and FBI officers arrested the 
Ames couple on charges of spying for Russia. 
  Prior to his arrest Aldrich Hazen Ames was chief of a CIA 
group for covert operations against the USSR (later on the CIS). 
Russian special services believe that the failure of an agent 
at such a level on one hand is certainly a disappointment, but 
on the other is an indicator of the intelligence service's 
performance: After all, the agent had worked for nearly nine 
years. Especially given that according to informal statistics 
kept by many intelligence services in the world, there are five 
unexposed agents for each one that has had his cover blown. 
  The U.S. President thanked all CIA and FBI officers who took 
part in the operation and said that the United States will 
necessarily make a protest to Russia. According to the U.S. 
Justice Department, the Ames couple received payments of $1.5 
million. 
  Judging by the way they were arrested, sources in the 
Russian 
special services suppose that the agents were "burned" while 
using a communication channel (setting or picking up "dead 
drops," and so forth). They also believe that during his visit 
to Moscow, Clinton knew about the pending arrest of a couple of 
Russian agents.
