BUSH PROCLAIMS 'NEW ERA OF HOPE' IN SOUTH AMERICA 
President Bush today proclaimed "a new era of hope" in newly democratic South 
America as he opened a five-nation tour. He promptly blamed Iraq for making 
poor countries pay expensive oil bills. 
Bush arrived in Brasilia at dawn after an overnight flight from Washington, 
accompanied by a mostly junior staff. He was greeted by a 21-gun salute and 
military pageantry at the pillared Plantalto Palace, the workplace of President 
Fernando Collor de Mello. 
While celebrating the rebirth of democracy in South America, Bush put a strong 
emphasis on the Persian Gulf crisis and Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. 
Bush said Czechoslovakia, where he visited last month, is paying $1.5 billion 
in additional fuel costs because of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's refusal to 
retreat. 
Collor, during a picture-taking session with Bush, said Brazil is paying $5 
billion more for oil. 
Bush responded, "That's why, (when) people say to me, 'Well, this can go on and 
on and on,' I say, 'No.' " 
Bush raised the gulf crisis again during a speech to the Brazilian Congress. "I 
realize the sacrifices that Saddam (Hussein's) brutality has caused this nation 
and its people, has caused many nations around the world." 
Bush said he will not abandon plans to stop Wednesday in Buenos Aires, where 
President Carlos Saul Menem declared a state of siege after the fourth military 
uprising in four years. 
"I have great confidence in the security there," Bush said.
