BFN 

  [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- President Clinton 
should use his decision on renewal of most-favored-nation [MFN] 
status to unlink it from human rights conditionality and define 
a new policy toward China, a policy report suggests. 
  The report, entitled "Starting Over: From MFN to a China 
Policy for the Future," was released here today by the 
Progressive Policy Institute, a major think-tank of the 
Democratic Party. It outlines a strategy that "calls for 
engagement, not isolation; patience, not instant gratification; 
subtlety, not confrontation." 
  The premise of his report is, as its author Robert Manning, 
a 
senior fellow of the policy institute, put it, that "linking 
China's MFN status to human rights is counterproductive to our 
national goals." "President Clinton has a rare opportunity to 
re-establish a bipartisan consensus for a sensible post-cold war 
China policy by unlinking MFN renewal from particular human 
rights issues," the report says. 
  The report regards MFN as being "simply too blunt an 
instrument to define U.S. relations with China." "We must find 
ways to engage China across a broader spectrum,... strategic and 
economic issues top priorities [as received] and should dictate 
how trade-offs occur," it says. 
  The report points out that denial of MFN status to China 
would have seriously negative effects for the United States as 
well as China, such as undermining Sino-American cooperation on 
vital security issues, severely damaging U.S.-China trade 
relationship, endangering U.S. competitiveness in a rapidly 
growing economy and isolating the United States itself. 
  The policy recommendations offered by the report include: 
severing MFN renewal from human rights conditions, negotiating 
an arrangement with Congress to repeal the Jackson-Vanik 
Amendment and creating a U.S.-China bilateral human rights 
commission.
