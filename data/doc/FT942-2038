FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Smart card standards agreed
Three leading international payment card organisations yesterday agreed the
first of three sets of common technical specifications for 'chip' or 'smart'
cards.
The payments groups - Europay international, Mastercard International and
Visa International - plan to agree full specifications before the end of the
year.
The move marks a further step towards the introduction of chip cards that
operate across borders and systems. It enables manufacturers to begin work
on microprocessor chips in payment cards.
Yesterday's agreement covers the electrical and mechanical specifications
for making chip cards and for point-of-sale terminals. The second part will
define how the chip card and terminal will together deliver the services to
the card-holder, while the last phase should deal with how a transaction
would be completed.
The initiative stems from the organisations' decision in December to work on
developing global standards for chip cards.
Separately, Visa has agreed with a number of bank-led groups to try to
devise international standards for 'electronic purse' cards.
