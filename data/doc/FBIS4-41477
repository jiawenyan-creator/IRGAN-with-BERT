BFN 

  [Text] The future of the Black Sea Fleet [BSF] is under 
control by the Russian president, government, defence ministry 
and the Russian Navy's chief command and will be resolved on the 
basis of bilateral agreements signed with Ukraine. This follows 
a cable from Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral 
Felix Gromov to BSF Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin. 
  Baltin is asked to let the BSF officers and men know that no 
statements from some Ukrainian military officials will be able 
to hinder a solution to the problem in exactly that way. 
  In a speech in Sevastopol on Tuesday, Commander of the 
Ukrainian Navy Vice Admiral Vladimir Beskorovainy said that 
Sevastopol was a Ukrainian naval stronghold while the Russian 
Navy could be deployed there as one of a foreign state under a 
leasing agreement spread over a period of 15 to 25 years. 
  For its part, the press service of the Russian Navy in a 
statement on Thursday said that "in the emerging situation, such 
statements by the chief of the Ukrainian navy department are 
aimed at unsettling the situation over the BSF". These address 
those forces in Ukraine which assume extremely nationalist 
positions in resolving a highly complicated problem in relations 
between two fraternal Slav nations, says the statement.
