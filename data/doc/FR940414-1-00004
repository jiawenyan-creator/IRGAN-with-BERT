 

U.S. production of watermelons is estimated through the use of U.S. shipment statistics. Shipments of U.S.-produced
watermelons totaled about 1,895.6 million pounds in 1993, 7 percent less than in 1992. Imports of watermelons in 1993
totalled 343.5 million pounds, an increase of 12 percent. Therefore, domestic production is about six times as great
as the volume of imports. 
This proposed rule invites comments on changes to the Plan, the rules and regulations issued thereunder, the rules
of practice for petitions, and the procedures for the conduct of referenda. The changes are proposed in accordance
with amendments to the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act [7 U.S.C. 49014916] as made in the Watermelon
Research and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993. 
The amendments to the Act authorize an assessment on watermelons imported into the United States by importers, and
the addition of importer members to the Board if approved by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers in a referendum.
Watermelon imports enter the country primarily during the winter season. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled
343.5 million pounds. The assessment rate for imports would be the combined total assessment rate paid by producers
and handlers of domestic watermelons. The current assessment rate for producers is 2 cents per hundredweight and
for handlers is 2 cents per hundredweight. The combined assessment rate for importers, therefore, would be 4 cents
per hundredweight. Assessments would be paid at the time the watermelons enter the country. The collection of assessments
on imported watermelons would be expected to generate an additional $137,400 per year in revenue to the Board. In order
to make these changes, this rule would amend 1210.200, 1210.201, 1210.202, and 1210.204 of the referendum
procedures; 1210.305, 1210.320, 1210.321, 1210.328, 1210.341, 1210.350, 1210.351, 1210.352, 1210.363,
and 1210.364 of the Plan; 1210.402 and 1210.405 of the nomination procedures; and 1210.515,
1210.518, 1210.519, 1210.521, 1210.530, 1210.531, and 1210.532 of the rules and regulations. In addition, a new
1210.314 would be added to the Plan. 
To facilitate the collection of assessments on imported watermelons, the Secretary proposes that the United States
Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury be designated as the collecting agency for assessments levied on
such imports. Other commodity research and promotion programs utilize the Customs Service as a means of collecting
assessments on imported products, and the Customs Service is agreeable to collecting these watermelon assessments.
An agreement between the USDA and the Customs Service would be entered into to implement this action. In order to make
this change, this rule would amend section 1210.518 of the Rules and Regulations. 
The importer representation on the Board would be proportionate to the percentage of assessments paid by importers
to the Board, except that at least one representative of importers would serve on the Board if importers are subject
to the Plan. This representation would enable importers to participate in developing the Board's programs, plans,
and projects, and express their views and concerns on how Board funds are used if imports are assessed under the Plan.
Importers would nominate individuals to serve as importer members on the Board, and as required for other members
of the Board, two nominees would be submitted to the Secretary for each vacancy. The Act requires the number of importers
members to be proportionate to the assessments paid by importers. However, it is necessary to calculate the number
of initial importer members on the volume of imports because imports are not currently being assessed. There are currently
14 producers and 14 handlers on the Board. This is the equivalent of one domestic industry member for every 67.7 million
pounds of domestic production. Based on the average annual volume of imports during the last 3-year period (323.1
hundredweight), four importers would be added to the current Board. In order to make this change, this rule would amend
1210.202, 1210.203, 1210.320, 1210.321, and 1210.401. 
The Act provides for the elimination of refunds of assessments if the producers, handlers, and importers vote to eliminate
refunds. The refund provision has been in effect since the beginning of the program. Refunds have been increasing
every year from 9 percent in 1990 to almost 29 percent in 1993. If the refund provision is eliminated, it would provide
the Board with an estimated additional $250,000 per year for research and promotion activities. In order to make this
change, this rule would amend 1210.343 and 1210.520. 
If the refund provision remains in the Plan, and importers are subject to the Plan, then importers would be entitled
to a refund of all assessments paid on watermelons imported into the United States. 
The Act increases the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons.
Importers of less than 150,000 pounds of watermelons per year would be entitled to apply for a refund which would be
the producer equivalent of the import assessments. The 150,000-pound exemption level for importers is the level
determined to be equivalent to 10 acres of watermelons for domestic producers. In addition, the Act provides that
the Board has the authority to establish rules for producers to certify whether they are exempt from the assessments.
In order to make these changes, this rule would amend 1210.201, 1210.341, 1210.342, 1210.518, and 1210.521.

The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia.
This amendment would expand the Plan to cover producers, handlers, and importers in Hawaii, Alaska, and the District
of Columbia. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend 1210.201 and 1210.305 and would add
a new 1210.315.
