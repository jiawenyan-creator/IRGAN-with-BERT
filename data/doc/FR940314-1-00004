 

The FAA recognizes that the proposed inspections would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However,
the compliance times specified in paragraph (a) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for the inspections to
be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby
minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it
may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES

PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 



39.13 

[Amended] 



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 






Boeing: 

Docket 93NM204AD. 






Applicability:

 Model 747 series airplanes having line positions 1 through 200 inclusive; certificated in any category. 



Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 

To prevent separation of fuselage skin and rapid loss of pressure in the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Perform
an external high frequency eddy current inspection to detect cracks in the upper row of fasteners in the modified lap
joints in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 74753A2267, Revision 3, dated March 26, 1992, at the time
specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this AD, as applicable. 

(1) For airplanes on which the full modification required by AD 900606, Amendment 396490, has
been accomplished in accordance with Revision 2 of Boeing Service Bulletin 74753A2267, dated March 29, 1990,
or Revision 3, dated March 26, 1992: Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 flight cycles after accomplishment of the
full modification. 

(2) For airplanes on which the full modification required by AD 900606, 
Amendment 396490, has been accomplished in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 74753A2267, dated
March 8, 1986, or Revision 1, dated September 25, 1986: Prior to the accumulation of 7,000 flight cycles after accomplishment
of the full modification. 

(3) For airplanes on which the optional modification has been accomplished in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin
74753A2267, dated March 28, 1986; or Revision 1, dated September 25, 1986; or Revision 2, dated March 29, 1990;
or Revision 3, dated March 26, 1992: Prior to the accumulation of 7,000 flight cycles after accomplishment of the optional
modification. 

(b) If no cracking is detected, repeat these inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles.


(c) If any cracking is detected, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with the Section 533003
of the 747 Structural Repair Manual, and repeat these inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight
cycles. 

(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. 






Note:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Seattle ACO. 





(e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199
to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 




Issued in Renton, Washington, on March 8, 1994.
