FT  19 APR 91 / Brittan takes aim at energy monopolies
SIR LEON BRITTAN, the EC competition commissioner, warned yesterday of
further moves to break up monopolies in the electricity and gas market.
In a speech to the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, he said Brussels
was increasingly sceptical of government arguments that energy monopolies
were necessary to maintain security of supply.
The Commission's new yardstick, he said, was that governments should be
allowed to reserve no more than 20 per cent of their electricity production
for domestic primary energy producers on the grounds of security of supply.
In time this proportion should come down to 15 per cent.
Brussels has recently moved to break up cross-border trading monopolies in
electricity and gas, and the European Court of Justice has backed Commission
legal action against state monopolies.
Sir Leon suggested that next in the firing line might be organisations which
had concluded long-term exclusive energy supply accords that foreclosed
markets to other companies, or which abused their dominant market position
by denying others access to their networks or grids, or by setting
uncompetitive prices.
