  [Text] There were demonstrations from Qiryat Shemona in 
the north to Elat in the south last night, protesting the recent 
terror attacks and calling on the government to stop peace 
negotiations with the Palestinians. In 'Afula, three policemen 
were lightly injured during a violent protest at the site of 
Wednesday's car-bomb attack. In Jerusalem, two demonstrators 
were arrested, one for throwing a lit torch at a policeman and 
the other for trying to break through police barriers. 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 8 April carries a related 
report on page A3 by Nadav Shragay, adding that "the 
demonstrations were organized by 70 local headquarters set up 
last year by the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza, together with the right-wing parties, under 
the slogan 'This is not peace; this is terrorism'."]
