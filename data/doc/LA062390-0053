KID BEAT: 'DINOSAUR': CLUMSY BUT LIKABLE 
"Kid Dinosaur," at the Rose Theatre in Venice, is a high-spirited musical 
fantasy that plays like a rough draft. 
Director/writer Jim Houle uses three comic dinosaur characters to get young 
audiences to tune in to two messages -- believe in yourself and protect the 
environment. 
Queen Tyranna (Pat Loeb) is under the spell of evil pterodactyl Tyrell (Earl 
Groom Jr.), who has polluted the dinosaur kingdom for the sake of industrial 
progress. Enter Kid Dinosaur (Monica McMurtry) and Max (R.J. Wagner), a 
supposed member of the audience, to thwart Tyrell's schemes and clean up the 
kingdom. 
The music, by Amy Wooley and Adam Wilner, is often catchy, and the clever 
costumes, with foam construction by Cleve Hall, are impressive. The cast 
provides engaging moments: Groom does a vivid comic turn as the meanie and 
delivers rap lyrics with panache, while McMurtry bounces around with appealing, 
youthful zest. 
But neither Houle's plot nor his direction plays smoothly. He requires the 
somewhat unpolished cast to address the audience throughout, and that's tricky 
business. Nothing is more awkward in children's theater than actors who are 
uncomfortable talking to children and lose their timing doing so. 
Some judicious rethinking could turn "Kid Dinosaur's" likable moments into a 
likable play.
