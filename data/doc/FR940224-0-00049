For a ``CE'' that performs multiple operations of a specific type in a single cycle (e.g., two additions per cycle or
two identical logic operations per cycle), the execution time t is given by:

``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that perform different types of arithmetic or logic operations in a single machine
cycle are to be treated as multiple separate ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') performing simultaneously (e.g.,
a ``CE'' performing an addition and a multiplication in one cycle is to be treated as two ``CEs'', the first performing
an addition in one cycle and the second performing a multiplication in one cycle). 
If a single ``computing element'' (``CE'') has both scalar function and vector function, use the shorter execution
time value.
