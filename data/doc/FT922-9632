FT  07 MAY 92 / Angola poll timetable in jeopardy
ANGOLA'S transition to multi-party elections at the end of September is in
jeopardy, the country's opposition Unita movement warned yesterday.
In a strongly worded statement which reflects increasing tension between the
two parties, Unita accused the MPLA government of 'deliberate delay' in
implementing a programme scheduled to culminate in Angola's first democratic
poll since independence in 1975.
It cited the government's failure to establish a National Electoral
Commission, or to appoint an election commissioner. The government had also
failed to provide guidelines for voter registration, due to begin this
month.
This criticism is echoed by western diplomats and UN officials who are
monitoring the transition programme. Government inaction is attributed to a
weak bureaucracy rather than a lack of political will, but there are growing
doubts about the country's ability to meet the election timetable.
Western officials also fear that the monitoring exercise is under-staffed
and inadequately financed. The Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m) budget and
600-strong UN force is well short of what the exercise requires, they say,
pointing out that Angola's 10m population is scattered across a country five
times larger than the UK.
