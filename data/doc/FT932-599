FT  28 JUN 93 / That manufacturing fallacy again
Towards the end of Gustav Mahler's monumental Resurrection Symphony, the
chorus and mezzo soprano intone words that mean: 'Cease to tremble; prepare
yourself to live.'
The Austrian composer was thinking of profound and personal matters.
Nevertheless the sentiments apply diminuendo to the ingrained tendency of
the British economic and business establishments to look for signs of gloom
and doom at the start of what could be the most promising period of
non-inflationary growth that Britain has had for years.
As usual, many of these doom-laden worries relate to the UK manufacturing
trade deficit. Such worries reflect the cultural lag of people who 'still
characterise the UK as a country which exports manufactured goods in order
to import food to eat and raw materials to keep the wheels of industry
turning'. This summary comes from a paper by Sir James Ball and Donald
Robertson in the new June issue of the London Business School Review.
The authors start from the historical transformation that has occurred in
British overseas trade. If you compare 1960 with 1990 one change has been
that invisible receipts rose from 37 per cent to 53 per cent of the total.
This makes the view that contributions from services can never substitute
for manufacturing earnings difficult to understand.
But an even bigger change has taken place on the import side. Manufactured
goods rose from 34 per cent of total overseas payments in 1960 to 79 per
cent in 1990. Imports of goods were, however, only half of total overseas
payments. Invisibles, including interest profits and dividends, accounted
for the other half.
The UK does not need to export manufactured goods 'to pay its way in the
world', as Crippsian rhetoric suggested, but to import other manufactured
goods. Increased specialisation and exchange within industrial sectors is
the way in which trade has developed among advanced countries.
Of course, overseas earnings have still to balance overseas expenditure
after allowing for investment inflows. Straight-forward economics would
suggest that, if a country avoided excessive home demand and allowed the
terms of trade to adjust, then any required correction would occur without a
lot of fussy intervention.
Is there really some horrendous difficulty about achieving such an
adjustment which affects the UK - or on some formulations, also the US and
other English-speaking countries - but not other parts of the world?
There is now ample evidence that the UK's share of world trade in
manufacturing stopped falling in the early 1980s and may even have been
rising slightly. Any structural difficulty must therefore be on the import
side.
A highly useful LBS table suggests, however, that the UK was far from unique
in experiencing a rapid rise in imports, either in the 1980s or over a
longer period. Only France among big industrial countries failed to show
bigger import penetration over the last decade. The pace of expansion varied
over the years. In the US imports grew more rapidly in the first half of the
1980s. In Japan, Germany and the UK the expansionary burst was in the second
half of the decade.
The authors make a great deal of the excess demand that developed in the UK
following the credit explosion, which they believe was the main reason for
the shock-horror Pounds 21.7bn payments deficit of 1989. The question then
arises: why has the deficit fallen only moderately in the subsequent years
of severe recession? (This question takes the official estimates at their
face value, even though UK overseas receipts buried in the black hole of the
'balancing item' are now once again larger than the deficit itself.)
The first reason for the continued deficit may simply be the lag between the
cooling of the UK home market and its working through to imports. Second, as
the Bundesbank always argued, sterling was overvalued in the early 1990s -
not so much against the D-Mark, but against the currency basket. Third, once
devaluation made the pound highly competitive, the European recession began
to take its toll.
A current payments deficit is to be expected in a growing country in a
recessionary world. So long as overseas investors are willing to finance
this at non-usurious interest rates, it is both in the UK and international
interest to run it. When both the world and the UK recovery have proceeded
further, it will be important to tackle that part of the payments deficit
that reflects the red ink in the public sector. Kenneth Clarke's threat to
increase taxes 'if growth shows signs of faltering ' gets the logic
precisely the wrong way round.
