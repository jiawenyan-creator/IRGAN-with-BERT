SMITH CLEARS HURDLES, HAWTHORNE STUMBLES; 
TRACK: SOPHOMORE QUALIFIES FOR STATE IN TWO EVENTS, BUT TEAMMATES FAIL TO 
FOLLOW HIS FOOTSTEPS. 
Thanks to sophomore hurdler Demond Smith, the three-time defending state 
champion Hawthorne High boys' track and field team won't be forgotten at the 
1990 state meet. 
Although the injury-decimated Cougars have no chance to win a fourth 
consecutive title, Smith suddenly rates as a statewide force after taking 
second place in both the 110-meter high hurdles and 300-meter intermediate 
hurdles at Friday night's Southern Section Masters' meet at Cerritos College. 
Smith will be the only Hawthorne boy in the state meet, Friday and Saturday at 
Cerritos College. 
Smith, a transfer from South Bay Lutheran, established personal bests by 
running the 110 in 14.51 seconds and the 300 in 37.84. Entering the Masters' 
meet, Smith had the third-best qualifying mark in the 110 and the fourth-best 
in the 300. 
But Cougar Coach Kye Courtney said Smith's showing was somewhat surprising 
because of the hurdler's lack of experience. 
"We've never had a sophomore get a second in a Masters' meet before," said 
Courtney, who has coached Hawthorne to six boys' state championships in seven 
years. "But we knew he had the talent. 
"It was a question of whether he could mentally make the move as a sophomore 
against guys who are 18 years old." 
The Hawthorne boys' 400-meter relay team was originally entered in the Masters' 
meet but was scratched due to lead-off man Robert Blackburn's blood-pressure 
problems, leaving Smith as the Cougars' only entrant. But Smith, who didn't run 
track at South Bay Lutheran, said he didn't feel any extra pressure. 
"There's been a lot of pressure on me all year (because) I was really the only 
healthy guy," Smith said. 
Actually, Smith has had to overcome a nagging thigh injury, which kept him out 
of the Arcadia Invitational. 
"He's very coachable and does what he's told," Courtney said. "The thing about 
Demond Smith is that he never missed a practice. He ran when he was hurt. He 
did all the therapy that we gave him." 
Muir's Andre Derezin (14.47) won the 110 and Cajon's Charles (37.67) won the 
300. Courtney said Smith's close finishes in each race means he will be a 
factor at the state meet. "If he can run with these guys, he can run with 
anybody," he said. 
The Morningside girls' 1,600-meter relay team was the only victorious South Bay 
entrant, upsetting favored Pasadena Muir. The Monarchs ran 3:44.79. Sophomore 
Sanoma Nickson, the lead-off runner, said Morningside wasn't intimidated going 
up against Muir, the 1989 state champion. 
"Every time we run against them, we have to have the attitude that we're going 
to win, no matter what place they are in the state or the nation or whatever," 
Nickson said. "We were pumped up for them, and we had no bad handoffs." 
Nickson also qualified for the state meet in the 100-meter low hurdles (14.81) 
and as a member of the Monarchs' 400-meter relay team (46.73). 
Hawthorne also qualified both of its girls' relay teams. Senior Kee-sha Adams 
anchored the Cougars' 1,600 relay (3:46.61) and ran the second leg of the 400 
(47.27) despite missing much of the season. 
"I've only been practicing a month and a week," Adams said. "It's hard because 
everybody is at their peak, but I'm still trying to get in shape." 
Other state qualifiers: the St. Bernard girls (400 relay, 47.42), Morningside's 
Santeshia Arnold (100, 12.12; 400, 24.60), Morningside's LaShawn Stringer (400, 
55.63) and Torrance's Jennifer Tully (long jump, 17-7 1/4).
