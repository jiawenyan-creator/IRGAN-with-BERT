File wrapper continuing procedure.



(a) A continuation, continuation-in-part, or divisional application, which uses the specification, drawings
and oath or declaration from a prior complete application [(1.51(a))]> as defined by 1.51(a)(1) (not
a prior complete provisional application as defined by 1.51(a)(2)), and&lt; which is to be abandoned, may
be filed >under this section&lt; before the payment of the issue fee, abandonment of, or termination of proceedings
on the prior application. The file date of an application filed under this section is the date on which a request is filed
for an application under this section including identification of the [Serial Number, filing date,]>application
number&lt; and applicant's name of the prior complete application. If the continuation, continuation-in-part,
or divisional application is filed by less than all the inventors named in the prior application a statement must accompany
the application when filed requesting deletion of the names of the person or persons who are not inventors of the invention
being claimed in the continuation, continuation-in-part, or divisional application.

(e) An application filed under this section will utilize the file wrapper and contents of the prior application to
constitute the new continuation, continuation-in-part, or divisional application but will be assigned a new application
[serial] number. Changes to the prior application must be made in the form of an amendment to the prior application
as it exists at the time of filing the application under this section. No copy of the prior application or new specification
is required. The filing of such a copy or specification will be considered improper, and a filing date as of the date
of deposit of the request for an application under this section will not be granted to the application unless a petition
with the fee set forth in 1.17(i) [(1)] is filed with instructions to cancel the copy or specification.
