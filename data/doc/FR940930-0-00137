 

CAA section 242(c) lists the useful life and in-use testing limitations for purposes of determining 
in-use compliance with the standards in section 243. The useful life for CFVs is the same as adopted 
in EPA's regulations for 1994 and later model year LDVs and LDTs, commonly called Tier 1 standards 
(56 FR 25724, June 5, 1991). For LDVs and LDTs, the standards in section 243 are established at the 
intermediate useful life of five years or 50,000 miles (5/50,000), whichever occurs first, and a full useful 
life of 10 years or 100,000 miles (10/100,000), whichever occurs first (see Table 2). With respect to in-use testing,
however, section 242(c) provides that such testing for these vehicle classes would not be 
done beyond seven years or 75,000 miles, whichever occurs first. The analogous intermediate and full 
useful life levels for heavy LDTs are 5/50,000 and 11/120,000, respectively (see Table 2). Similarly, 
section 242(c) provides that the in-use testing for these vehicles would not be done beyond seven 
years or 90,000 miles, whichever occurs first. 
While the standards described above apply to single fuel CFVs, subsection 243(d) also establishes different CFV
NMOG standards for dual and flexible fuel LDVs and LDTs.

 These vehicles are to be certified to two sets of NMOG standards (Table 3). One set contains the same NMOG levels 
that apply to single fuel CFVs; dual and flexible fuel vehicles must meet this standard when operating on the clean
alternative fuel on which they are certified (section 243(d)(2)). The second set of NMOG standards applies to flexible
and dual fuel vehicles when operated on conventional fuel for which they are certified (section 243(d)(3)).
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 This second set of standards is, in effect, equivalent to the next less stringent set of standards for the applicable
vehicle category and model year. For example, the Phase I NMOG standard for flexible or dual fuel CFVs using conventional
fuel is equivalent to the Tier I non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions standard.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The Phase II NMOG standard for flexible or dual fuel CFVs using conventional fuel is equivalent to the Phase I standard
for single fuel CFVs. The NMOG standards for flexible and dual fuel vehicles are listed in Table 3. Flexible or dual
fuel vehicles must comply with all other CFV exhaust standards shown in Table 2 and with all other applicable requirements
of Title II.

Dual fuel vehicle is defined as any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine engineered and designed to be operated on
two different fuels, but not on a mixture of the fuels. The term ``bi-fuel'' is often used for this type of design. Flexible
fuel vehicle is defined as any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine engineered and designed to be operated on any mixture
of two or more different fuels. The term ``variable-fuel'' is often used for this type of design. These definitions
are contained in section 88.10294 of the regulatory text.

CAA section 241 requires that dual and flexible fuel vehicles are to operate on the fuels on which they are certified.
As discussed in the CFF credit program and TCM exemptions rulemaking (58 FR 11888, March 1, 1993), dual and flexible
fuel vehicles shall operate only on the clean alternative fuel on which they are certified to the CFV standards when
operating in a covered area, as provided in section 246(a)(2).

NMOG and NMHC emissions are essentially equivalent when the fuel combusted is conventional gasoline.
