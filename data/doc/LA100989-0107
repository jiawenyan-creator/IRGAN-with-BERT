BILLS' KELLY TO BE OUT 3 WEEKS; BACKUP TO START AGAINST RAMS 
The Hand of fate -- Indianapolis Colts defensive end Jon Hand -- finally caught 
up with Jim Kelly. 
Never seriously injured during his four-year NFL career, the Buffalo Bills' 
quarterback was smashed to the Hoosier Dome's artificial turf by the 300-pound 
Hand on Sunday, suffering a separated left shoulder that is expected to 
sideline him for at least three weeks. 
"They don't know how long it's going to be (before it heals)," Kelly said 
today. "It could be four weeks, maybe six, maybe three." 
The loss of Kelly, who was on the way to having his best NFL season, capped an 
abysmal day for the Bills, who were drubbed by the Colts 37-14. 
Frank Reich, Kelly's backup for the past three seasons, finished Sunday's game 
and he will start next Monday night against the unbeaten Rams. 
"I have a lot of confidence in Frank Reich," Kelly said. "He's going to do a 
good job." 
In four years as a pro before Sunday, Reich completed 10 of 20 passes for 123 
yards, with no touchdowns and two interceptions.
