FT  06 JUN 92 / Germany to act on refugees
The German parliament is to speed the processing of asylum seekers and the
expulsion of non-political refugees, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn.
Asylum hearings will be limited to six weeks, rights of appeal reduced and
'collection camps' set up for asylum-seekers. Almost 160,000 have arrived
this year.
The Bundestag also passed new rules on the taxation of unearned income,
which will face stern opposition in the upper house, the Bundesrat.
