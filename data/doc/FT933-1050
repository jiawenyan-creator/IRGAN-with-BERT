FT  25 SEP 93 / GrandMet names Bull as chief executive
GRAND Metropolitan yesterday appointed Mr George Bull, driving force behind
the growth of its IDV drinks operation, as chief executive, instead of the
long-time heir-apparent, Mr Ian Martin, who led the Dollars 5.8bn
acquisition of the US Pillsbury group.
The surprise reshuffle of top management followed the decision of Sir Allen
Sheppard to split the combined post of chairman and chief executive, which
he has held since 1987.
GrandMet's shares fell 15p to close at 393p - a reflection not of market
dissatisfaction with the changes but of some fears that there may be bad
news to come.
Mr Martin, 58, who spent five years in the US restructuring the Pillsbury
group after the takeover, returned to the UK in January last year as group
managing director and chief operating officer.
He will give up his executive duties to become a non-executive deputy
chairman, with special responsibility for North American affairs. He will
continue to receive his current salary.
Mr Martin said yesterday: 'The other guy won the race - and I have the
greatest respect and admiration for him.
'I think the great thing now is to look forward. I am delighted to continue
to be associated with the group, and I should have time to reduce my golf
handicap,' he said.
Sir Allen, whose decision to end his dual role was welcomed by institutional
shareholders, said the GrandMet board had been faced with a choice between
'two world-class executives'.
The votes went unanimously to Mr Bull because of his marketing background,
wider experience of international markets, and business development record.
Mr Bull said: 'I see it as my role to lead GrandMet closer to its markets.'
Mr David Nash, finance director, will take over in December as head of the
food and international retailing operations.
