FT  03 MAR 94 / Austrians praise their negotiators
In Vienna, news that agreement on joining the European Union had been struck
brought a sense of relief. Austria's negotiators, especially Mr Alois Mock,
the foreign minister, were afforded hero status in media coverage.
Nevertheless, the outcome of a referendum to approve membership, scheduled
for June, is far from certain. Until then, opponents - nationalists,
traditionalists, special interest groups, and most of the Greens - will look
for ammunition in the small print. They may yet be joined by the right-wing
Freedom party led by Mr Jorg Haider, who said he would not advise a Yes or
No vote until he had studied the deal.
The most sensitive issues remain lorry transit and agriculture, and the
government may feel it has won a better deal on both than it might have
expected.
