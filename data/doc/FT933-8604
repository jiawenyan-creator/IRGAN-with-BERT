FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Berlusconi in share-swap deal
SILVIO Berlusconi Editore, the publishing house owned by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest group, has launched its expected share exchange offer
for Mondadori, Italy's biggest publisher.
The deal - effectively a reverse takeover of Mondadori by SBE - will allow
Mr Berlusconi to gain an immediate quotation for his hitherto-unlisted
publishing interests.
Once completed, Fininvest, which already owns most of Mondadori, is expected
to float a minority of the capital in SBE-Mondadori to raise about L550bn
(Dollars 340m) in order to lower its debts.
Separately, it is expected that Fininvest, which had total net debts of
L3,333bn at the end of last year, will later this month issue its first
comprehensive balance sheet.
The figures may provide additional ammunition in the battle between Mr
Berlusconi and his critics over the size of the group's borrowings.
Mondadori raised group sales by 9.8 per cent to L919bn in the first half of
this year, from L837bn, while net profits amounted to L25.4bn. SBE's
first-half sales were L184.8bn, while profits were L15.8bn. Aggregate 1992
figures for the two companies show sales of L1,851bn and net profits of
L50.9bn.
Shareholders in Mondadori will be offered one SBE ordinary share for every
ordinary share held, while holders of Mondadori savings stock will receive
three SBE ordinary shares for every four shares they own.
If all Mondadori shareholders accept the deal, Fininvest will own about 87.5
per cent of SBE, which will in turn wholly own Mondadori.
How much Fininvest will be able to raise by floating shares in SBE-Mondadori
will depend on market conditions and the timing of the deal. Mr Berlusconi
has indicated that the placing will occur before the end of this year and a
substantial proportion of the shares are expected to be offered abroad.
Banca Commerciale Italiana and Goldman Sachs are advising on the
transaction.
