FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Trident dockyard decision delayed
THE PROSPECT of an early decision on the contract for refitting Trident
submarines - for which the Rosyth and Devonport naval dockyards are rivals -
receded yesterday. Downing Street emphasised that there would be a period of
consultation when the government published its view and that the
announcement would not come until some time next month.
Previous postponement of the decision, originally expected last year, has
already highlighted its sensitivity. That was intensified by complaints from
Rosyth about unfair treatment of its bid for the contract. The work is
crucial to the long-term survival of both yards.
Officials denied recent reports of a cabinet sub-committee meeting due today
to determine the dockyards' future, and insisted that Mr John Major had not
yet taken a decision.
Babcock Thorn, the consortium which runs Rosyth, believes that Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, is recommending awarding the contract to
Devonport, with Rosyth being given some surface fleet work as a consolation
prize.
With fresh government emphasis on consultation, pressure on behalf of both
dockyards will continue after ministers have announced their preferred
course.
The Rosyth campaign will lobby parliament on Thursday, and has asked two
cross-party committees of MPs - on defence and Scottish affairs - to
investigate whether Rosyth was treated evenhandedly.
