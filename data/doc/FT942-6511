FT  30 MAY 94 / Observer: Summer break
Pack up your sunglasses and beach towels. Bill Foggitt, the 81-year-old
Thirsk weather sage, says the spring bank holiday is going to herald a warm
spell that should last all summer long.
May was colder than usual with the odd ground frost, he said. The frogs felt
confident enough this year to lay their eggs at the edge of his neighbour's
pond. Dry springs are ensured when the spawn appears out in the middle.
The swallows arrived early, always a good sign, and the oak was out before
the ash, an essential for a fine summer.
