FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Maddox placing and offer
SHARES IN Maddox Group were suspended at 8 3/4 p yesterday in advance of a
placing and open offer to raise almost Pounds 18m to buy a private company
for Pounds 13.1m.
Maddox is headed by Mr Hugo Biermann who built up Thomson T-Line, the
industrial distribution group which was bought for Pounds 186m in February
1989 by Ladbroke, the leisure group. It has two main businesses - Cables &amp;
Flexibles, a distributor bought back from Ladbroke last year, and Seacoast
Electrical Corporation in the US, which Thomson had previously planned to
acquire.
Mr Biermann said that the company to be acquired was in the 'same cabling
and network services field', but would move Maddox 'up the chain away from
distribution and into installation and service and maintenance' for personal
computers for the corporate market.
There were 'some' synergies with C&amp;F and more with Cablelink and ECS, other
subsidiaries. He could not reveal the name of the company for legal reasons.
The consideration is Pounds 10m. Of this Pounds 1.3m is to be issued to the
vendors in new ordinary shares; the balance will be in cash.
