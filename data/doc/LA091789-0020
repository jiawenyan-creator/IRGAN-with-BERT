CRITIC'S VIEW OF KFAC 
The word that stands out in Bernheimer's article is embarrassment, which he 
uses to describe the fact that "there will be no commercial (classical-music) 
radio station in Los Angeles." Let's face it, L.A. is not a sophisticated city. 
It's a beach town with all the name entails. Angelenos' idea of culture is 
eating designer pizza and getting tickets for "Les Miz" or "Phantom."
