KHOMEINI SUES 3 YUGOSLAVS UNDER 'PUBLIC HUMILIATION' LAW 
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has filed a criminal complaint against three 
Yugoslavs for criticizing his order that author Salman Rushdie be killed for 
writing "The Satanic Verses," a newspaper reported. 
The complaint was filed with the Belgrade district attorney's office under a 
section of the Yugoslav criminal code that forbids "public humiliation" of 
foreign countries or their leaders, the daily Borba reported Friday. The 
penalty for violating the law is up to three years imprisonment. 
The newspaper said the complaint was filed against Stanislav Marinkovic, editor 
of Borba; Vesna Roganovic, a journalist for the paper, and Slobodan Selenic, a 
popular Yugoslav author. 
Selenic, head of the Yugoslav Writers' Union, was sued because of a statement 
to Borba last month about "Khomeini's frightening threat" against Rushdie, the 
newspaper said. Marinkovic and Roganovic were cited for allowing the novel to 
be published, the newspaper said. 
Borba said several Yugoslav lawyers are representing Khomeini.
