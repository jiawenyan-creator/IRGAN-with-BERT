FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (5): Epitome of la gauche
caviare - Jack Lang is a powerful politician who towers over the Paris arts
world
ONE MAN has dominated the artistic life of Paris for the past decade and his
name is Jack Lang. Liberation, the arterati's favourite daily paper, has
even dubbed the 1980s 'l'epoque Lang.'
Jack Lang not only towers over the Paris arts world, he is also one of
France's most powerful politicians. He is the longest serving member in the
Mitterrand cabinet having held his post as arts minister for the nine years
the socialists have been in power. He has also built on that base, by adding
first media, then education to his portfolio, to become the second most
important member of the cabinet after Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister.
His record is all the more impressive because he appears to have achieved
all this without compromising his own political or personal style.
Jack Lang, with his taste for Thierry Mugler suits, his groovy Place des
Vosges apartment and his love of the avant garde, is the epitome of la
gauche caviare, the sybaritic strain of socialism that has flourished in
Mitterrand's France.
Night after night he and his entourage sweep into receptions at the city's
museums and art galleries. His own receptions in the sumptuous salons of his
ministry in the Palais Royal are legendary for their opulence.
The apparently endless stream of literary revivals, architectural
restoration schemes, new museums and musical fetes are greeted with glee by
the fashionable left, and fury from the conservative right.
Mr Lang is such a shameless self-publicist that when an international poll
cited him as the second most famous French politician, his own publicity
team circulated copies to the press. It does not seem to have done him much
harm. Whenever the French public is polled on France's most popular
politicians, Jack Lang almost always near the top.
