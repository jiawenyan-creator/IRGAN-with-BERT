FT  13 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subsides in spite ff good
inflation data
Wall Street
US STOCK markets moved in an opposite direction to bond prices yesterday,
falling sharply in the morning as bonds rallied, then recovering some of
their losses later as bonds reversed course, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.26 at 3,569.09,
well off its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended 1.50 lower at 448.96, while the Amex composite finished down 1.29 at
437.58, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.65 at 717.12. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 279m shares.
Although prices opened higher, stocks were unable to sustain the upward
momentum in spite of a bond market rally which pushed the yield on the
benchmark 30-year issue down to a record 6.389 per cent. The bond market was
reacting to surprisingly good inflation data in the form of the July
producer prices index, which fell 0.2 per cent.
The failure of stocks to follow bonds higher unsettled dealers and
investors. This triggered some profit-taking, and in turn, heavy selling in
the futures markets. The decline in futures set off computerised sell
programs in the underlying cash markets, depressing stocks further.
Equities may have been troubled, too, by news of the meagre 0.1 per cent
rise in July retail sales. Later in the day, bond prices dropped sharply
after a disappointing auction of new 30-year bonds. The bond market's
retreat coincided with a modest recovery in stocks, which bounced back in
the final half-hour.
Healthcare companies rebounded from Wednesday's big losses after the White
House said that a document circulating around Wall Street, which was
reportedly a draft of the Clinton administration's healthcare reform
initiative, was a fake. The pronouncement lifted HMO America Dollars 3 to
Dollars 36, United Healthcare Dollars 4 to Dollars 56 3/4 , and US
Healthcare, which is quoted on the Nasdaq market, Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars
45 1/2 .
Johnson &amp; Johnson rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 as the stock rallied
from losses incurred earlier in the week when the company said it was
eliminating 3,000 jobs as part of a cost-cutting programme. Other drug
stocks, however, succumbed to selling.
T2 Medical plunged Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 8 1/2 in volume of 2.3m shares
after the company said that it would restate earnings for the first and
second quarters after irregularities were discovered in the company's
accounts.

ACCORDING to preliminary data, the Toronto TSE-300 index fell 6.92 points,
or 0.17 per cent, to close at 4,008.97. Declines outnumbered advances 362 to
332. Volume was 52.130m shares, down from 66.431m, and trading value fell to
CDollars 587.5m.
