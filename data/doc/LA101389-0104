Art Schlichter, whose image was tarnished by gambling after he made it to the 
National Football League, is in a Las Vegas hospital that specializes in 
treating chronic gamblers,. 
The former Ohio State quarterback admitted himself for 30 days Monday, his 
lawyer, Charles F. Freiburger, wrote in a letter to Circleville (Ohio) 
Municipal Judge O. Charles Hosterman. 
It is at least the third time he has been hospitalized for gambling. 
Schlichter, suspended twice from the NFL for gambling, had been ordered to 
appear in court today on a $150 bad-check charge. 
Schlichter, who lives in the Columbus, Ohio, suburb of Worthington, is charged 
by the Pickaway County Sheriff's Department with cashing the bad check at a 
South Bloomfield service station.
