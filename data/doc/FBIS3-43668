  [Text] The government of Tanzania says it will not allow 
the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] movement to use its territory 
as a base for hostilities against South Africa. The secretary 
general of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi Party, Mr. Horace 
Kolimba, said Tanzania will not be used as a base for hostile 
actions and will not allow military training camps in that 
country any more. 
  Mr. Kolimba told a news conference in Harare today that 
Tanzania does not want to be seen as complicating things in 
South Africa. His comments follow reports that the Tanzanian 
government handed a strongly worded letter to the PAC's 
representative in Tanzania, condemning recent violence by the 
PAC in South Africa.
