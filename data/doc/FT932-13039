FT  26 APR 93 / Current Account Problems in E Europe
The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania experienced a
large deterioration in their current account balance of payments towards the
end of last year, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, Peter Norman writes.
The deterioration, which has clearly concerned officials at the bank,
reflects a sharp and unexpected decline in export growth and higher imports
of consumer rather than investment goods.
In its latest quarterly review, the EBRD says the fall in exports may
reflect temporary factors, including a drought, but warns that more lasting
factors, such as structural difficulties in agriculture, increased budget
deficits, EC import quotas and lower personal savings, could also be
involved.
