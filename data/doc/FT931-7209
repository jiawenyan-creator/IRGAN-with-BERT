FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: French food retailer falls 10%
to FFr438m
CASINO, one of France's largest food retailing groups, yesterday announced a
10 per cent fall in net profits to FFr438m (Dollars 80m) in 1992 from
FFr484m in 1991.
The group, which last year acquired the supermarket interests of Rallye,
another large French retailer, attributed the decline in net profits (which
have been restated for 1991 to allow for the Rallye deal) to a reduction in
exceptional gains. It registered an exceptional loss of FFr113m last year,
against an exceptional profit of FFr145m in 1991.
Sales increased to FFr61.6bn from FFr40.63bn in 1991, largely due to the
inclusion of the Rallye units. Operating profits rose to FFr1.32bn from
FFr775m last time with pre-tax profits increasing to FFr845m from FFr464m.
Casino, like other French retailers, has also been affected by weak economic
conditions. Consumer spending was static in France last year.
