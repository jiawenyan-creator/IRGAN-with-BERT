FT  08 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Fish industry in US wary of Paris deal
The US fish industry reacted warily to a preliminary agreement reached last
Friday between Washington and Paris over French government inspection delays
of US fish exports.
'If you look at the history of French actions over the past few weeks there
is reason to be concerned,' said Mr Dick Gutting, a vice-president of the
National Fisheries Institute.
In response to angry protests by French fisherman, France placed an embargo
on US fish early last month. Bowing to US pressure, it lifted the embargo,
but instituted an inspection system which had the same effect and left fish
rotting in storehouses near French airports.
A US food inspection team arrived in France yesterday to ensure that the
delays are at an end.
Washington is prepared to retaliate immediately if the hold-ups continue.
'They said product will be detained and subject to inspection if you are on
a list of exporters who have had problems,' said Mr Gutting. 'We don't
understand how you get on that list or how one gets off the list.'
Meanwhile, a number of French importers of US fish have hired a lawyer to
file a suit for damages, and the US industry has begun to estimate its own
losses for legal action.
