  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG)--The Bosnian Croat army 
command in Vitez, central Bosnia, on Monday protested with the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) against the local Moslems' 
violations of the February 25 ceasefire agreement. 
  Moslem forces have disregarded the Monday noon deadline for 
withdrawal and have not placed their heavy weapons under 
control, Zagreb-based Croatian radio quotes a statement released 
by the Croat command as saying. 
  The radio said that Moslem troops had torched six Croat 
houses in the vicinity of Vitez on Monday. Fierce fighting 
between Moslems and Croats, erstwhile allies against Bosnian 
Serbs, has been raging since early 1993 in the central and 
southern parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Representatives of Bosnian Croats and Moslems and of 
neighbouring Croatia, acting under strong U.S. pressure, signed 
a framework agreement in Washington on March 1 undertaking to 
form a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, 
the agreement has failed to curb the Moslem-Croat war.
