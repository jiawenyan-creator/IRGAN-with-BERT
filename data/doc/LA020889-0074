President Bush's nomination of Clayton K. Yeutter as secretary of agriculture 
sailed through the Senate Agriculture Committee and the chairman predicted 
quick floor action. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the panel, said 
a floor vote to confirm Yeutter to the post could come as early as today. 
Approval of the former U.S. trade representative to head the Agriculture 
Department came on a voice vote at a three-minute meeting. Yeutter is a former 
USDA official who once operated a Nebraska cattle feedlot and was president of 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
