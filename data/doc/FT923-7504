FT  18 AUG 92 / Call to halt loss of Pounds 1bn in VAT
AN EXTRA Pounds 1bn of value added tax could be collected and the potential
for fraud arising from the single European market could be tackled if 2,000
more VAT inspectors were recruited, two civil service unions say.
The unions argue that the government's plan to cut 300 inspectors this year
and the decision not to deploy an extra 400 inspectors to deal with the
single market is a false economy.
Mr Mike King of the National Union of Civil and Public Servants said: 'It
seems madness that, at a time of massive fiscal deficit and when the single
market is putting millions of pounds of VAT at risk, the government has been
cutting the number of inspectors.'
The NUCPS is joining with the Civil and Public Services Association to lobby
the chancellor. The unions say Customs and Excise has calculated that each
VAT inspector last year discovered Pounds 270,000 of additional tax on
average, compared with an average cost of Pounds 25,000 for employing each
inspector. The level of 'productivity' had increased consistently over the
years.
The unions also say that the current level of VAT arrears is Pounds 1.6bn
and estimate the loss through evasion to be Pounds 1bn.
The unions say that an extra 2,000 staff would cost Pounds 48m a year but
the direct benefit in extra revenue would be Pounds 452m and the benefit
from preventing fraud or non-payment through ignorance would be an extra
Pounds 556m - making an annual overall gain of Pounds 1bn.
The CPSA and NUCPS will ballot members next month on industrial action over
government plans to move staff from Westminster to Canary Wharf in London's
troubled Docklands. Members will vote on whether to withdraw goodwill or
work to rule.
Staff at the environment and transport departments oppose the planned move
because they say it would mean extra travelling and disruption for a
workforce already under pressure from staff cuts.
