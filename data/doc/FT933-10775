FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Spring Ram receives approach
from Masco
SPRING RAM, the troubled bathrooms and kitchens group, will today announce a
bid approach from Masco Corporation, one of the largest building products
groups in the US.
The US company is one of half a dozen to have shown an interest in Spring
Ram since it issued the first of three profits warnings eight months ago and
its shareholder value began to plunge.
Talks between the two companies have not been followed up by any concrete
offer and Spring Ram is not expecting one until after interim figures are
released in late September.
Masco's interest has received added weight because of its choice of adviser.
The Michigan-based group has picked Mr George Magan of the small merchant
bank Hambro Magan and it was Mr Magan who has been advising British
Aerospace over its recent merger talks with GEC.
Spring Ram's chief executive, Mr Bill Rooney, has resisted intense pressure
from institutional shareholders, led by Prudential Corporation, to resign,
as the company's share price has fallen from 181p over a year ago to 54p by
the close on Friday. This has taken the market capitalisation down from
Pounds 672m to Pounds 200m.
At last week's annual meeting, the company split the executive role and
appointed Mr Roger Regan, a building industry veteran who had been
approached by the rebel shareholders, as executive chairman. It retained Mr
Rooney as chief executive.
