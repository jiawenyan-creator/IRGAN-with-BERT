FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better environment not costly
exercise
Sir, Dr David Slater's call for volunteers to help prove that tighter
environmental controls need not be as expensive as critics believe
('Pollution cost plea to industry', November 2) is most welcome and timely.
All my experience of working with companies which have invested in upgrading
their environmental performance has persuaded me that it is often possible
both to do this and to improve profitability at the same time.
The experience of AEA Technology as a leading environmental consultancy
confirms that the key to success lies in integrated environmental solutions
which embrace the entire plant or process, rather than in spending money on
'end-of-pipe' add ons.
Wider adoption of the integrated approach will deliver significant
competitive advantages for UK industry and a cleaner environment for us all.
As well as volunteering for Dr Slater's experiment, interested companies
would be well advised to participate in the Environmental Technology Best
Practice programme. This is being managed by AEA Technology and aims to
promote better environmental practice at the same time as increasing
competitiveness.
