LOCAL; 
COUNTY AGENCY WEIGHS GO-AHEAD ON S.F. VALLEY RAIL ROUTE STUDIES 
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is meeting today to decide 
which San Fernando Valley rail routes to study amid warnings that changes in 
the options under consideration could force postponement of a Valley line until 
the next century. 
The 11-member commission is scheduled to vote whether to authorize the final 
phase of a state-mandated $2.1-million engineering and environmental study of 
cross-Valley route options. 
The study results, expected no sooner than January, are to serve as the basis 
for designating a route and determining whether the system should be light rail 
or an extension of the Metro Rail subway system. The commission has about $800 
million available to build one more rail system over the next 11 years. 
However, environmental studies on two competing light-rail projects -- 
downtown-to-Pasadena and Marina del Rey to the western terminus of the Century 
Freeway -- are nearly completed and commissioners predict that officials from 
those areas will soon begin lobbying for the available funds. 
Valley routes under consideration are the Ventura Freeway right-of-way from the 
planned Universal City Metro Rail station to Warner Center and a Southern 
Pacific railroad freight right-of-way that parallels Chandler and Victory 
boulevards between Metro Rail's northern terminus on Lankershim Boulevard in 
North Hollywood and Warner Center.
