FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mobil may sue over drilling
bans
MOBIL, the second largest US oil company, is threatening to sue the US
government for preventing it from drilling for oil on tracts of land in
Florida and North Carolina for environmental reasons, writes Deborah
Hargreaves.
The company said it could lead a whole pack of lawsuits by the US oil
industry where companies have paid over Dollars 1bn for drilling acreage,
only to have any activity blocked by the administration.
'The basis of our suit would be that we paid good money for this land and at
the very least, the government owes us that money back, plus interest,' said
Mr Allen Murray, Mobil Corporation's chairman. He said the company could
also push for compensation for the value it could have gained from oil
drilling on the land.
The US government is refusing to open up many sensitive environmental areas
for oil exploration under pressure from a strong green lobby. The policy has
pushed all the US majors to expand exploration overseas.
