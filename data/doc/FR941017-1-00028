The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A310 and A300600 series
airplanes. The French DGAC advises that a Model A300600 series airplane was recently involved in an accident
during which the flight crew may have attempted a go-around while the airplane was in an out-of-trim condition. Investigation
into the cause of this out-of-trim condition revealed that the flight crew may have attempted to override the autopilot
while it was engaged in the COMMAND mode. If the airplane is in pitch axis, and the autopilot is overridden for prolonged
periods by the flight crew via manual input from the control column, and if the autopilot is subsequently disengaged,
the resultant out-of-trim condition between the trimmable horizontal stabilizer and the elevator could reduce
controllability of the airplane. 

Further investigation indicates that the design of Model A300600 series airplanes does not provide for disengagement
of the autopilot in a manner that would allow for manual input from the control column without adversely affecting
controllability of the airplane. The design of Model A310 series airplanes is identical in this respect to Model A300600
series airplanes. 

The French DGAC issued French Airworthiness Directive 94185165(B), dated August 17, 1994, in order
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. The French AD requires modification of FCC's
having part numbers (P/N) B216ABM6, B350AAM1, B350AAM2, B350AAM3, and B470ABM1 (for Model A310 series airplanes);
and P/N's B297AAM3, B297AAM4, B297AAM5, and B470AAM1 (for Model A300600 series airplanes). 

The French AD references Airbus Service Bulletins A310222036, dated December 14, 1993 (for Model A310
series airplanes), and A300226021, Revision 1, dated December 24, 1993 (for Model A300600 series
airplanes), as the appropriate sources of service information to accomplish the modification of the FCC's. However,
Airbus Service Bulletin A310222036, dated December 14, 1993, describes procedures for modification
of only one of the FCC's, P/N B470ABM1, which is installed on Model A310 series airplanes; while Airbus Service Bulletin
A300226021, Revision 1, dated December 24, 1993, describes procedures for modification of only one
of the FCC's, P/N B470AAM1, which is installed on Model A300600 series airplanes. Upon accomplishment of this
software modification, the autopilot will disengage whenever the airplane is in the ``go-around'' mode above 400
feet radio altitude and whenever the pilot attempts to override the autopilot by exerting a certain amount of manual
force on the control column. 

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the French DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the French DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of FCC's having P/N's B216ABM6,
B350AAM1, B350AAM2, and B350AAM3 (for Model A310 series airplanes); and P/N's B297AAM3, B297AAM4, and B297AAM5
(for Model A300600 series airplanes). Since the manufacturer has not yet developed a modification for these
FCC's, these modifications are to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by the FAA.
