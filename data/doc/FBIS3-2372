at the Expense of a Great Loss -- Written on the Eve of 
Christopher's Visit to China"] 
  [Text] Washington, 7 Mar -- From an economic point of 
view, as well, the United States cannot now revoke China's MFN 
status over human rights issues. The United States may gain a 
little but will suffer greatly by revoking China's MFN status, 
for it will pay a heavy price. If China and the United States 
can work together to overcome the difficulty this year, the 
United States can avoid putting its relations with China on a 
narrow human rights basis. Only then can Sino-U.S. relations 
break free of this ludicrous circle and return to the normal 
path. 
<H5>  Target for American Companies' Overseas Expansion </H5>
  The United States currently has a fairly good share of the 
Chinese market, and the situation is getting better. Here is a 
breakdown of U.S. exports to China last year: $2 billion worth 
of aircraft and parts and components; $1 billion worth of 
computers and electric power generators; and $272 million worth 
of wheat. Agreed U.S. investment in China in the past year 
alone amounted to $7 billion, and actual investment to more than 
$3 billion. Five hundred and fifty U.S. companies have set up 
branches or offices in China. Most of the FORTUNE 500 firms are 
viewing China as their strategic target for overseas expansion. 
U.S Deputy Commerce Secretary Garten also visited China 
recently to lobby vigorously for $6 billion worth of contracts 
for U.S. companies. If the United States revokes China's MFN 
status over human rights issues, it will be tantamount to 
announcing that it is surrendering China -- a market with 
enormous commercial potential for U.S. companies -- to Japan and 
Europe. 
  As long as Sino-U.S. bilateral ties remain healthy and 
stable, the future China market will become only more attractive 
to U.S. companies. The National Commission of U.S.-China Trade, 
a nongovernment organization comprised of some 200 large and 
medium-sized firms trading with China, forecast that China will 
require $40-$100 billion worth of electric power generating 
facilities in the next 25 years, $30 billion worth of 
communications facilities in the next five years, and $29 
billion worth of demand for automobiles in the next three years. 
<H5>  200,000 More People Unemployed </H5>
  If the United States revokes China's MFN status over human 
rights issues and if China responds with trade retaliations by 
doubling import duties on imported U.S. goods, U.S. goods will 
lose their competitiveness in the Chinese market, which in turn 
will cost 170,000 to 200,000 jobs in the United States. The 
U.S. market will be deprived of cheap but good China-made goods, 
and each of the 94 million U.S. families will pay an average of 
$170 more annually in consumer goods purchases. If Sino-U.S. 
relations are destabilized, it will be difficult for U.S. 
businessmen to invest and do business in China. Manufacturers 
of other countries will have gained a secure footing in the 
Chinese market by the time the United States wakes up and renews 
China's MFN status three or five years later. 
  The Clinton administration will not solve any problems by 
revoking China's MFN status over human rights issues. On the 
contrary, it will create new problems and troubles. Will U.S. 
industrial and commercial sectors sit back and watch the Chinese 
market being taken over by other Western countries? Will the 
Republican Party, which represents the interests of industrial 
and commercial sectors, allow the Clinton administration to 
isolate the United States in the Asia-Pacific region? 
<H5>  The Need To Cooperate With China on International Issues </H5>
  For the sake of U.S. security in the Asia-Pacific region, 
the 
United States cannot revoke China's MFN status. Revoking 
China's MFN status will cause Sino-U.S. relations to deteriorate 
and will obstruct Sino-U.S. cooperation in various areas. From 
the late 1980's to the early 1990's, a considerable number of 
Americans thought that with the end of the Cold War, China had 
ceased to have any strategic value for the United States. Now, 
however, it seems that China still has strategic value for the 
United States; moreover, there are needs and bases for 
cooperation between the two sides on many international issues. 
The United States may have to double its efforts, though with 
fewer results, if China's cooperation is not available on some 
important international issues. 
  If it is seeking China's cooperation on international 
issues, 
the United States should not isolate and undermine China. It 
may be necessary for the United States to maintain some suitably 
reasonable pressure on China over human rights [dui mei guo lai

4104], but the United States cannot victimize 1.2 billion 
Chinese for the human rights of a few. An isolated and enraged 
China is not good for anyone -- the Asian countries, the United 
States, or China itself. If the United States is wise, it will 
not revoke China's MFN status over the issue of human rights 
without finding out the truth.
