 

USEPA has provided guidance on processing redesignation requests in a September 4, 1992, memorandum from John Calcagni,
Director, Air Quality Management Division, Subject: Procedures for Processing Requests to Redesignate Areas to
Attainment (Redesignation Memorandum). This guidance memorandum was used in the evaluation of the submittal. The
State of Minnesota has met all of the CAA requirements for redesignation pursuant to section 107(d)(3)(E). The State
has included a copy of the base year 1990 emissions inventory as the attainment inventory. The attainment emissions
inventory contained point, area, and mobile source carbon monoxide emissions in tons per year and for a typical winter
day in Duluth.
