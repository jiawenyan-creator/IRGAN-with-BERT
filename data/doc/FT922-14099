FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Poll predicts Forsyth defeat
AN OPINION poll last night suggested that Mr Michael Forsyth, the
controversial Scottish Office minister, is likely to lose his seat in
Stirling, where he had a majority of 548 in 1987.
According to a System 3 survey for The Herald newspaper and Scottish
Television, Labour candidate Ms Kate Phillips is on 40 per cent (against 36
per cent in 1987), Conservatives 33 (38), Scottish National party 20 (11)
and Liberal Democrats 7 (15).
Pollsters interviewed 1,058 people on April 4, of whom a high 23 per cent
were undecided or would not say how they would vote.
