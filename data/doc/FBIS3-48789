  [Text] On 20 January, Kong No-myong, South Korean 
ambassador to Japan, visited Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata at 
the Foreign Ministry and officially informed him that President 
Kim Yong-sam wants to visit Japan this spring. 
  In response, Foreign Minister Hata explained his intention 
to 
welcome the president, saying: "Since Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa also wants to talk with President Kim soon, I will talk 
to him about the schedule for the visit." Regarding President 
Kim's visit to Japan, the leaders of both countries reached 
agreement at the Japan-ROK summit talks held in Kyongju last 
November. 
  It seems that President Kim's trip to Japan will be realized 
in March, at the earliest. 
  Moreover, Foreign Minister Hata touched on the issue of 
North 
Korean nuclear development and said: "We should not isolate 
North Korea. We need to do our best to make them open the 
door." In this way, he explained his willingness to resume 
negotiations for normalization of Japan-DPRK diplomatic ties. 
At the same time the foreign minister also said: "We will keep 
an eye on how (North Korea) buckles down to the task of economic 
reform."
