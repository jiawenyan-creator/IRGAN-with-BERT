 



The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(4) Rigid Polyurethane Slabstock and other Foams





(a) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(5) Polystyrene Extruded Boardstock and Billet





(a) HFC143a.

_

HFC143a is acceptable as an alternative to CFC12 in polystyrene boardstock and billet foams.

 HFC143a has a higher global warming potential (GWP) than other acceptable substitutes for this end-use.



(b) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(6) Phenolic Insulation Boardstock and Bunstock Foam





(a) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(7) Polyurethane Flexible





(a) Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3C6.

_

Saturated light hydrocarbons C3C6 (and blends thereof) are acceptable as substitutes for CFC11 and
methyl chloroform in polyurethane flexible foam.

 Saturated light hydrocarbons C3C6 offer the potential of a non-ozone-depleting flexible foam. Saturated
light hydrocarbons C3C6 offer the potential of a non-ozone-depleting alternative to the use of CFC11
blowing agents in polyurethane flexible foams. Plant modifications, however, may be necessary to accommodate the
flammability of hydrocarbons. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3C6 are VOCs and are subject to control as such
under Title I of the Clean Air Act.



(b) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(8) Polyurethane Integral Skin 





(a) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(9) Polystyrene Extruded Sheet





(a) Electroset Technology.

_

The Electroset Manufacturing Technology is an acceptable substitute for CFC11 blown rigid polyurethane
and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock foams.

 See discussion above.



(10) Polyolefin Foam





(a) Methylene Chloride.

_

Methylene chloride is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12 and CFC14 in polyolefin foams.

 Methylene chloride is a non-ozone-depleting and non-global warming alternative blowing agent. Nevertheless,
it does pose potential health and safety concerns. In addition to occupational and worker safety standards, some
local and regional restrictions apply to the use of methylene chloride. To assess risks in the Polyolefin foam sector,
EPA used data collected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for the proposed revision of
the permissible exposure level (PEL) for methylene chloride. The Agency's estimate for total population risk for
methylene chloride was based on average plant emissions derived from OSHA's analysis, and while not negligible,
was within the range of existing Agency decisions on acceptable risk. For further detail, refer to the SNAP background
document entitled, ``Risk Screen on the Use of Methylene Chloride in Polyolefin Foams for Class I Ozone-Depleting
Substances: Foams, June, 1994.'' Users of this substitute should note that methylene chloride will be subject to
future controls for hazardous air pollutants under Title III section 112 of the Clean Air Act.
