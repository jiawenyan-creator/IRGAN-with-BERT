  [Text] Simferopol, 21 May -- Serhiy Tsekov, chairman of the 
Supreme Council of Crimea, has held a news conference at which 
he pointed out that the Republic of Crimea is not going to 
secede from Ukraine, and its decision is dictated not only by 
political but, first and foremost, by economic reasons. Mr. 
Tsekov pointed out that there is an agreement to hold 
negotiations on this issue between the parliaments of Ukraine 
and Crimea; according to him, a Ukrainian delegation, headed by 
Boris Oliynyk, will probably arrive in Simferopol. Otherwise, 
the Crimean delegation, headed by Serhiy Tsekov, would go to 
Kiev. 
  Concerning the signing of certain documents by the executive 
authorities of Crimea with the leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh, 
the chairman of the Crimean parliament pointed out that he sees 
nothing wrong in the fact that some friendly documents have been 
signed between the two states. Besides, the documents between 
the regions, according to Mr. Tsekov, are to be ratified by the 
Supreme Council of Crimea.
