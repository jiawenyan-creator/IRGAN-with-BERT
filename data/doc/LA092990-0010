VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA; 
WOMEN TO SHARE CULTURAL TRADITIONS 
Women of the world will bring their cultural traditions to Ventura next month, 
sharing everything from Mexican and Jewish foods to Indian hand painting and 
African dance. 
In three-hour classes offered Thursdays beginning this week, area women will 
explore new customs at the Barranca Vista Center. 
"I think when you are with someone from another culture, it opens up a whole 
new world," said Gienne Gabriels, an Ojai resident who organized the class. 
"Our culture is so rich in Southern California. We live with people from 
everywhere." 
Gabriels said she developed the idea for her class after meeting women of other 
cultures. The city of Ventura is co-sponsoring the event and will receive half 
the proceeds. 
"We need to just learn about each other, and this is my way of doing it," 
Gabriels said. 
Most of the classes will be from 7 to 10 p.m. Thursdays at 7050 E. Ralston St. 
until Nov. 8. One will be 7 to 10 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 2. The fee is $40. 
Classes include: 
Thursday -- A Chumash Indian woman will share the history of her tribe, her 
language and songs. 
Oct. 11 -- A woman of Mexican descent will share a Death Day celebration to 
honor ancestors. 
Oct. 18 -- A professor at Ventura College who traveled to Africa will speak 
about her ancestors and share African dancing and costumes. 
Oct. 25 -- An Indian woman will demonstrate traditional hand painting. 
Nov. 2 -- Women will share a Shabbat meal, a Hebrew tradition, through song, 
food and candle lighting. This will be the only class held on a Friday. 
Nov. 8 -- Gabriels will lead a celebration of friendship. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ
