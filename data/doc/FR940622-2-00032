<DOCTITLE>Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America; Amendment</DOCTITLE>



June 16, 1994.



Take notice that on June 13, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard
Illinois, 60148, filed in Docket No. CP93745001 an amendment to its application filed in Docket No.
CP93745000 pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, for authorization to increase Natural's
maximum daily deliverability at three of Natural's storage fields, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which
is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Natural indicates that in its original application, it proposed to construct and operate 16 injection/withdrawal
wells, and associated piping and meters. Natural further states that it proposed to replace one compressor and two
segments of storage field lines, in its original application. Natural states that the proposed construction, operation
and/or replacement of facilities at two of its storage fields in Iowa, and one of its storage fields in Texas was designed
to increase the maximum daily deliverability from its storage operations by an additional 250 MMcf per day, at an estimated
construction cost of $14,650,000 for the jurisdictional facilities and approximately $6,137,000 for the non-jurisdictional
facilities.

Natural is amending its application, by deleting its proposal to construct and operate all jurisdictional facilities
proposed in Docket No. CP93745000. Natural further proposes to amend its original filing to this proceeding
by increasing its maximum daily deliverability at three of Natural's existing storage fields by 175 MMcf per day original
proposed in Docket No. CP93745000.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said amendment should on or before July 1, 1994,
file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance
with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be
considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein
must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have heretofore filed need
not file again.
