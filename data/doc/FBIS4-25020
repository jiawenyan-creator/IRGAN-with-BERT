  [Text] Hong Kong, June 3 KYODO -- China's paramount leader 
Deng Xiaoping has said the sky will not fall when he dies, a 
pro-China magazine reported Friday [3 June]. 
  The Chinese-language MIRROR said the 89-year-old Deng 
recently told members of his family "don't consider my 
individual contributions so important." 
  "Even when Chairman Mao died, the sky didn't 
fall...Outsiders 
say every day that I have died...That I am very ill. But the 
important thing is that the work must go on, that the economy 
must continue to develop," said Deng. 
  Deng recently advocated three principles, according to the 
MIRROR. "Firstly," Deng said, "economic construction should be 
the center of China's policy. Secondly, I advocate reform and 
the open door policy, and thirdly, development is the correct 
road." Deng added that it had already been proven that these 
three principles were correct and had the support of the people. 
  "This generation of leaders is now too old to solve them," 
the paramount leader reportedly said, adding "it is up to the 
third generation of leaders to address these issues."
