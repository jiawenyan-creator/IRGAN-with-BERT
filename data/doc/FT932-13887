FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Oki adjusts production
OKI Electric, the Japanese telecommunications and data processing company,
is to close two manufacturing plants for three days, in a move which
underlines the downturn in the country's electronics industry.
The plants, which manufacture information and telecommunications equipment,
were being closed to adjust production levels, Oki said.
Oki said production in the first half of the current year to March 1994 was
expected to be particularly low as Japanese companies, including financial
institutions, had frozen investment plans.
