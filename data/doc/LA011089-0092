AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONFERENCE OPENS 
President Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia opened the 19th African-American 
Conference here Monday by calling on the international community to reflect on 
the African debt crisis and the problem of apartheid. 
Kaunda told the conference, attended by several black leaders from the United 
States -- including civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and former U.S. 
Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young -- that the two problems are the 
fundamental cause of suffering on the continent. 
He said that even though the U.N. economic program for the continent dates to 
1969, no action has been taken to implement it because of inadequate 
international support. 
The Zambian president welcomed the signing of the tripartite agreement between 
South Africa, Cuba and Angola but expressed surprise at how the international 
community was supporting apartheid.
