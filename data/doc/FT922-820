FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Competition hits Hoskyns
Pre-tax profits at Hoskyns, the UK-based computing services company owned by
Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, nosedived in the first half as the recession
and fierce price competition squeezed margins relentlessly, writes Alan
Cane.
Profits before tax in the six months to April 30 fell 35 per cent to Pounds
5.6m (Pounds 8.6m) pushing earnings per share 39 per cent lower at 3.9p
(6.4p).
Turnover fell to Pounds 95.7m (Pounds 102.8m) suggesting that the company's
reputation for unbroken growth may not be restored quickly.
The interim dividend of 0.75p is being maintained, however, in the
expectation of improved trading in the second half.
