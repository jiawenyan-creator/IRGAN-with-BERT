  [Text] Informed Palestinian sources have told our 
correspondent Yoni Ben-Menahem that Hamas is on the verge of 
announcing a new political program that, for the first time, 
will accept international resolutions. The program is considered 
a new peace initiative. This, out of concern that after 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, public support for 
the PLO will increase considerably at the expense of Hamas. 
  These sources said that the shift in the position of Hamas 
is 
only in the movement's political level, which was epitomized by 
the statements of Musa Abu-Marzuq, one of Hamas' leaders abroad, 
to the Jordanian weekly AL-SABIL. These sources stressed that 
Hamas' military wing opposes this initiative and considers it to 
be recognition of the State of Israel.
