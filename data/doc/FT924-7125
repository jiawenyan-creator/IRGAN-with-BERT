FT  18 NOV 92 / Management: Bridging the huge east-west divide
Managers in the formerly communist countries of eastern Europe accuse
westerners imported to teach them how to be capitalists of being aggressive
and insensitive to local culture.
This emerges from a study of 300 local and western managers working in
Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, published today by GKR/Neumann, the
executive search company.
The study concludes that while the joint ventures have created opportunities
for western and eastern managers to work together, 'culture gaps' between
executives are delaying the transfer of expertise. While local managers have
a theoretical grasp of, for example, pricing policy, practical
implementation is slow and shot with temporary setbacks.
The two groups blame each other for the stumbling progress. Local managers
want greater freedom to operate the new market mechanisms. Westerners say
their eastern colleagues are averse to risk, responsibility and
decision-making.
Local managers admire the professionalism, qualifications and confidence of
their western colleagues. One said: 'My western colleagues do not know the
meaning of the word impossible.'
However, in Hungary, almost 50 per cent objected to western managers and in
Czechoslovakia and Poland, about 75 per cent said westerners were at best
'accepted rather than rejected'.
Western managers who initially dismissed cultural differences as part of a
discredited communist past are now incorporating some into business
strategy. Local managers are less likely to emphasise local limitations.
Westerners have some advice for those expecting transfers to eastern Europe:
'In Hungary it is very difficult to keep anything secret. In Poland it is
important to become an insider quickly while in Czechoslovakia managers must
give and ask for feedback.'
