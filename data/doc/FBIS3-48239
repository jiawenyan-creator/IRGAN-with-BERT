  [Text] The two-headed government has recently promulgated a 
law saying foreigners can stay without a passport in Cambodia 
for one or two weeks. The so-called new law made the Vietnamese 
cheer loudly since this is what they long for. The significance 
of the law is exactly the same as the content of the nonborder 
treaty previously concluded between the Vietnamese communists 
and their puppets. Are the puppets so stupid? No, they are 
not. The Vietnamese communists have ordered them to act like 
this since they exert 100 percent control over military, 
civilian, and other affairs in the rural areas and 99 percent in 
Phnom Penh. As for other people, they are waiting only to 
repeat clamorously what the Vietnamese communists and their 
puppets have said. 
  Another concrete example is that when the people support and 
demand that the five-point initiative offered by the king be 
implemented to achieve national reconciliation and restore 
peace, the Vietnamese communists and their puppets talk about 
only three points; those in the Vietnamese communists' cage also 
repeat the three points. 
  This action will destroy the nation and people and make the 
Cambodian race and territory disappear as was the case of 
Kampuchea Kraom. 
  The people say they do not want the two-headed government 
because it is under the total control of the Vietnamese 
communists and their puppets. Only by supporting the five 
points of the king can the Cambodian nation, people, and race be 
safeguarded forever.
