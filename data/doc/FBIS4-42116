  [Text] The Central Bank yesterday refuted new allegations 
that Cyprus offshore enterprises are being used for money 
laundering. 
  In a statement issued yesterday the Bank called the latest 
reports, published in yesterday's Greek press, "untrue and 
completely incompatible with evidence and information the 
Central Bank has in its hand." 
  It stressed that contrary to the reports, the Central Bank 
has no knowledge of "mystery payments" which are allegedly in 
the hands of the government for investigation. 
  The Central Bank recognises the international problem of 
money laundering and countries must take preventative measures 
to stop it spreading, the statement said. 
  In Cyprus the Central Bank has its own measures aimed at 
helping the banking system recognise in advance possible suspect 
cases. 
  These measures are the same as those taken worldwide by 
other 
central banks and the result of international directives and 
recommendations. 
  The Bank criticised yesterday's reports saying the Cypriot 
newspapers portray Cyprus as a country for laundering dirty 
money tarnishing its reputation and prestige abroad. 
  "Similar accusations have been made in the past aimed at 
harming Cyprus as a competitive offshore centre," the Bank said.
