FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Philips, Motorola in R&amp;D venture
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is forming a joint venture
semiconductor design facility with Motorola, the US semiconductor and
communications group. The deal is aimed at supporting the manufacture of
chips for CDI, its interactive multi-media consumer electronics product.
Philips said it was investing tens of millions of guilders in the facility,
which will become operational in about three weeks.
The decision to invest so much in a semiconductor facility at a time when it
has huge financial costs due to a heavy debt burden signifies a commitment
by Philips to its semiconductor activities.
The group has always said it needed semiconductor capability to support its
consumer electronics activities. Nevertheless, there has been concern about
its ability to support its loss-making semiconductor operations.
Doubts about the group's commitment to semiconductors followed its
withdrawal from costly research and development projects under Jessi, the
joint European semi-conductor R&amp;D initiative.
Philips's semiconductor division, which made a loss in the financial year to
December, 1990, was also thought at one point to be a candidate for
divestment in the group's plan, under president Mr Jan Timmer, to
concentrate on returning to profitability.
CDI, however, is positioned as an important consumer product which, Philips
hopes, will be one of the next hits it needs to reverse its stagnating
fortunes. It has been pumping huge sums into CDI development, particularly
in software.
Mr Gaston Bastiaens, director of interactive media systems, said the group
expected the price of CDI to fall substantially over the next few years.
