TENSION HEADACHES 
Question: I know from my own experience that psychological factors, such as 
anxiety, can cause tension headaches. Is this possible? 
Answer: Poor posture can trigger tension headaches. 
Slouching, for example, may force the body out of alignment so the head and 
neck muscles contract. When you are sitting, try to keep your shoulders back 
with your head erect and your feet flat on the floor. If you have to remain 
seated for an extended period of time, try changing your position. Stretch your 
arms above your head or rotate your shoulders in a circular fashion. Also, 
lower your head slowly to one side, then do the same to the other side. 
Rotating your head slowly, both clockwise and then counterclockwise, may also 
be helpful. 
Even sleeping in an unusual position can trigger a headache by stiffening the 
head and neck muscles, causing them to contract. Whether you sleep on your back 
or on your side, your head, neck and spine should be aligned.
