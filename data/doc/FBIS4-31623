  [Excerpts] A time bomb exploded during the night in 
Budapest at the National Assembly building. It blew to pieces 
gate number 19 -- the gate faces the Danube river -- and it 
broke several of the building's windows. Experts have found 
among the debris components that were part of the bomb.

  In order not to jeopardize the investigation, the police 
have 
not revealed any further information for the time being. 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz acquainted himself with the 
situation at the scene. Prime Minister Peter Boross was still 
in the building a few minutes ago. 
  Leading representatives of Hungarian political parties 
unequivocally condemned this act of terrorism and expressed 
their conviction that it was probably an act of madness by an 
individual and not linked to the results of the elections. 
Nonetheless, they urged the tightening of security regulations 
regarding the protection of the parliament.
