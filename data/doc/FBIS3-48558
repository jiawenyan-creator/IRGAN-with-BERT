  [Text] Shusei Tanaka, special assistant to the prime 
minister, hinted last night at the possibility that if a package 
of political reform bills is not enacted in the Diet during its 
current session, the Hosokawa cabinet would resign en masse. 
Asked by reporters to comment on Mr. Tanaka's remark this 
morning at the prime minister's official residence, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa said there is no such possibility. 
  Commenting on Mr. Tanaka's remark at a news conference this 
morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said: As the clearest 
way for the prime minister to take political responsibility, he 
could dissolve the House of Representatives, call general 
elections and announce the resignation of his cabinet en masse. 
Mr. Tanaka probably anticipated the resignation of the Hosokawa 
cabinet en masse. I do not want to make any comment on his 
remark either way.
