  [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Israel and the 
PLO have cleared away virtually all obstacles to a final 
agreement on Palestinian autonomy and will sign an accord in 10 
days, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said here Sunday [30 
January]. 
  "This is really the final stage," said Musa, who took part 
in 
two days of intensive talks here between PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat 
and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  "Next time they meet will be in Cairo to sign the 
agreement," 
he said. Asked when this would be, he replied: "Within the next 
10 days." 
  Musa said discussions would continue in this Alpine resort 
town on the final details of arrangements for the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip. 
  "It is just a question of finessing some points. The way is 
clear for an agreement. There is no major issue between them 
anymore," he said. 
  Musa said the sticky question of who would man international 
border control points had been resolved with agreement that 
Israeli border guards would be deployed, but out of sight of 
travelers. 
  'Arafat told the World Economic Forum that an agreement 
would 
be signed "very soon" in Cairo. But there was no confirmation 
from the Israeli side, and Peres said only he was "hopeful" of 
an agreement.
