Background


The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31CFR part
550 (the ``LSR''), to revoke 550.516, which unblocked, by general license, deposits in currencies other than
U.S. dollars held by U.S. persons abroad, if otherwise blocked under the LSR. FAC's amendment is consistent with action
by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 883 of November 11, 1993. The Security Council determined in
that resolution that the continued failure of the Government of Libya (``GOL'') to demonstrate by concrete actions
its renunciation of terrorism, and in particular the GOL's continued failure to respond fully and effectively to
the requests and decisions of the Security Council in Resolutions 731 and 748, concerning the bombing of the Pan Am
103 and UTA 772 flights, constituted a threat to international peace and security. Accordingly, Resolution 883 called
upon member states, 

inter alia

, to freeze certain GOL financial assets in their territories, and to ensure that their nationals did not make such
funds or any other funds or financial resources available to the GOL or any entity owned or controlled by the GOL. In
light of this resolution, FAC is revoking 550.516 to eliminate an exception that had existed to the comprehensive
blocking of GOL property required by Executive Order 12544 of January 8, 1986 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 183) and by the LSR.
Because the LSR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601612, does not apply.
