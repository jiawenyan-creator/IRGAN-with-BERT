FT  14 JAN 92 / Appointments: Milne quits ScotMet
Gordon Milne, 55, has resigned as managing director and from the board of
Scottish Metropolitan, the Glasgow-based property company. He has paid the
price for a mistimed stepping up of the company's property development
activity, particularly in the south of England. Milne is replaced by Scott
Cairns who joined ScotMet two years ago after being property director of
Martin Retail, the stores group.
Cairns says he intends to return ScotMet to its original vocation of being a
property investment company rather than undertaking speculative
developments. He also wants to reduce ScotMet's heavy borrowing which had
reached Pounds 201m (a gearing ratio of 140 per cent) at September 1991.
In October ScotMet angered the market by announcing an unexpected pre-tax
loss of Pounds 8.3m (compared with 1990 profit of Pounds 10.4m) including
writing off Pounds 9.4m on a site in Bournemouth and incurring Pounds 2.2m
costs on renegotiating bank covenants.
Milne took enormous pride in Saltire Court, an architecturally distinguished
office development in Edinburgh to which he lured many distinguished
tenants. It is now 70 per cent let but has not produced the expected
profits.
Paul Birch, director in charge of development, has also left the company.
