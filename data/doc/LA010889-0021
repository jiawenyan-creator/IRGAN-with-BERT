MAKING TASTE 
Calendar's generally excellent cover story on "Taste Makers," one matter 
puzzled me. In Bill Steigerwald's article on Spy magazine editor E. Graydon 
Carter piece, he cites Spy magazine's influence on the realms of humor and 
satire. 
Well, the truth is that for millions of people across the country (especially 
those like myself, usually defined as yuppies), there is only one definitive 
humor magazine on the market, the one that has been out there the longest and 
remained the funniest: National Lampoon. 
More than just wildly inventive and deliciously irreverent (it was a favorite 
when I went to college and it seems to be more popular than ever today), 
National Lampoon has been a trend-setter and taste-maker in the American 
culture for some 20 years. 
After all, this is the magazine that launched the careers of people like John 
Hughes, Harold Ramis, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Jeff Greenfield, P. J. O'Rourke 
and Gilbert Gottfried, among others. Many (myself proudly included) consider 
all other humor publications merely pale imitations. 
Certainly, there are other quality humor magazines available, but none which 
has made as strong of an impact on the way we look and laugh at ourselves. 
If all that doesn't make them "taste-makers" of the highest caliber, I really 
don't know what does.
