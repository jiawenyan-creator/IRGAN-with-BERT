VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
STATE DEADLINE JAN. 1 FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS 
Owners of assault weapons such as AKs and Uzis must register them with the 
California Department of Justice before Jan. 1, according to the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. 
The three sheriff's stations in the county -- Ventura, Camarillo and Thousand 
Oaks -- have registration cards and instructions. 
The state registration fee is $20 per weapon. Also required is a thumbprint, 
which the Sheriff's Department will take for a $3 fee. 
"People must take this responsibility seriously or they run the risk of 
imprisonment, a fine and the loss of the weapon," Assistant Sheriff Oscar 
Fuller said. 
Fuller said there are no statistics available on how many assault weapons are 
in the county, "but there are over 300,000 in the state, and I would expect 
that we have a share of those." 
Anyone who wants to turn in an assault weapon rather than register it may 
transfer it to a licensed gun dealer or contact a local law enforcement agency 
for instructions. 
"We would appreciate no unexpected arrivals at police headquarters. We prefer 
they would call ahead," Fuller said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER
