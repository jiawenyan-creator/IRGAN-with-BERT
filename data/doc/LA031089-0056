THE NATION 
A survey of eighth- and 10th-graders shows that a vast majority have tried 
drinking, most don't wear seat belts and about one in three has seriously 
contemplated suicide, researchers reported. The Centers for Disease Control 
reported the results of the National Adolescent Student Health Survey, the 
first such national questionnaire since the 1960s. The 1987 sampling of 11,000 
students in 20 states answered questions about alcohol, drugs, violence, 
suicide and sex, and the results showed unhealthful habits. Thirty-four percent 
of the students -- 25% of the boys and 42% of the girls -- reported that they 
had thought seriously about ending their lives, and 15% had gone so far as to 
attempt potentially fatal injuries. In the eighth grade, 51% said they had 
tried cigarettes and 77% had tried alcohol; by 10th grade, the numbers rose to 
63% for smoking and 89% for booze.
