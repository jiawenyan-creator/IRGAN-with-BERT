POP CAPSULES: TEPID GO-BETWEENS DON'T WORK UP PALACE 
On LP, the Go-Betweens traffic in a spritely, folkish, poppy sort of rock 
that's only occasionally marginally interesting -- mostly to aficionados of the 
form. On stage at the Palace on Friday, the Australian male-female quintet was 
substantially more mediocre than that. If it weren't for the absolute stupidity 
of co-lead vocalist-guitarist Robert Forster's performing in a house dress (an 
ugly house dress, mind you) or the almost merciful use of a slide show, the 
band would have had all the stage presence of the proverbial hole in the 
doughnut. 
The unfailingly tepid level of energy more than matched the uncanny lack of 
vocal character -- regardless of whether the spotlight was on Forster or 
singer-guitarist Grant McLannan -- and the material was as tuneful and pleasant 
as it was largely unmemorable. 
Reporting objectively, the band played an hour-plus, the room was mostly full, 
and the crowd neither threw bottles at the stage nor stormed the exits. After 
all, what was there to get worked up about? DON WALLER
