Linebacker Hugh Green of the Miami Dolphins missed the first day of training 
camp after he was arrested and charged with spouse battery. 
Green was released on $10,000 bond Sunday morning, about 12 hours after his 
wife Monica, 22, was struck in the head and chest at the couple's home, 
Hillsborough (Fla.) sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa said. 
The alleged incident took place during a birthday party for Green. The Greens 
became involved in an argument and the linebacker admitted hitting his wife, a 
sheriff's office report said.
