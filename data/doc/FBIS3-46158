  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin reiterated this afternoon 
in a reference to the problem of Hong Kong that China is willing 
to cooperate with Britain, saying that the door of negotiations 
remains open and hoping that Britain changes its course and 
withdraws the part of the political reform package that has been 
tabled to the Legislative Council. 
  On the Hong Kong airport problem, Wu Jianmin said in reply 
to 
a reporter's question that on the one hand, Britain stated its 
willingness to call the next Airport Committee meeting with 
China, and on the other hand it unilaterally made appropriations 
to airport-related projects without an agreement on the 
financial arrangements for the new airport in an attempt to 
achieve a fait accompli, showing that it is not sincere about 
reopening the New Airport Committee meeting. 
  Wu Jianmin said that countries all around the world are 
actively developing relations, especially trade and economic 
ties, with China, which has become an established trend. The 
noncooperative attitude adopted by Britain on the problem of 
Hong Kong seems a little out of fashion. 
  At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' routine weekly press 
conference, Wu Jianmin also said in reply to a reporter's 
question that in their talks this morning, Chinese and Russian 
foreign ministers did not discuss specifically military 
cooperation.
