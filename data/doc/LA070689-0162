BRIEFLY 
GATT Meeting Postponed: A GATT meeting to consider a bid by China to join the 
96-nation trade forum has been postponed "because of difficulties in having 
meaningful discussions in present circumstances," a GATT spokesman said. A 
special working party that has been studying China's application since its 
submission three years ago was scheduled to meet next week to discuss the terms 
of a draft document for China's possible accession to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. The meeting was put off with China's agreement, and a date 
for the meeting will be announced later.
