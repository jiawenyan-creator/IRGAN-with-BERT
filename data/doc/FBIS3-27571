  [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- China's top 
legislator Qiao Shi said here today that China is willing to 
develop friendly cooperative relations with all Latin American 
nations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Co-existence. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's Congress 
(NPC) Standing Committee, made the remark in meeting with a 
delegation from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate of 
Paraguay, which is headed by Committee Chairman Carlos Alberto 
Gonzalez, here at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. 
  Paraguay is the only country in South America that has not 
established diplomatic relations with China, and the delegation 
is the first one to visit China at the invitation of the NPC 
Foreign Affairs Committee since the founding of the People's 
Republic of China. 
  According to an NPC official, the two sides, in a "cordial 
and friendly atmosphere", exchanged views on further developing 
relations between the two countries, especially on the 
strengthening of bilateral economic and trade ties. 
  During the meeting, Qiao briefed the guests on the situation 
of China's current reforms, opening up and economic development, 
as well as China's policies concerning foreign affairs. 
  Gonzalez expressed his appreciation over China's reforms and 
policy of opening to the outside, adding that though Paraguay 
and China have big differences in terms of population and 
territory, both are developing countries with agriculture as 
their foundation. Therefore, he added, China's experiences are 
useful to Paraguay. 
  Both Qiao and Gonzalez expressed the hope that the 
parliaments of the two countries will keep long-term exchanges. 
  Gonzalez and his party arrived here last Friday [18 
February]. Besides Beijing, they are also scheduled to visit the 
cities of Xian, Shenzhen and Shanghai.
