An investment group that includes two Ronald Reagan Administration officials 
has entered the bidding for troubled Eastern Airlines, according to a newspaper 
report. Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci would temporarily be in 
charge of Eastern and Joseph Wright Jr., a former director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, would be involved, the New York Times said. Options 
trader Joseph Ritchie, who now heads the bidding group, declined to reveal the 
size of the offer but said it would give the troubled carrier's unions a bigger 
stake in the airline than did a bid led by former baseball commissioner Peter 
V. Ueberroth, the newspaper said. Eastern has been virtually grounded since its 
machinists union went on strike in March.
