SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
STUDY OF RENEWAL NEEDS OKD 
The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to spend $100,000 to conduct a study 
of renewal needs in Wilmington. 
The study, proposed by harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, will look 
into economic conditions, population trends and other factors that affect 
industrial, commercial and residential development in Wilmington. 
"It will . . . determine future development opportunities, providing the city 
with valuable planning information, possibly leading to expanding 
revitalization efforts in Wilmington," Flores said in a press release. 
The study, to be conducted by the Community Redevelopment Agency and the 
Community Development Department, will focus on potential commercial growth on 
portions of Avalon Boulevard and Anaheim Street. It also will look into 
potential industrial development on the north side of Anaheim between Lakme 
Avenue and Alameda Street.
