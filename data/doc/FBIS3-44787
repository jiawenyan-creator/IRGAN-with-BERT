  [Text] Fuzhou, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Fujian in southeast 
China is now top of the league of China's provinces in forest 
cover. 
  According to the fourth national survey of forest resources, 
trees cover 6.148 million hectares in Fujian, an increase of 
1.145 million hectares over 1988, and its timber reserves total 
395 million cubic meters, up 15.77 million cubic meters. 
  The forest cover in the province is 52.4 percent, giving it 
the lead among provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions 
on the mainland, and 9.2 percentage points more than in 1988. 
  Fujian's territory includes 80 percent of hilly areas 
suitable for tree planting. It has become one of China's key 
timber producers. 
  A provincial official in charge of forestry disclosed that 
the province has formed a complete forest industrial set-up over 
the past four decades. 
  At present, the province has afforestation areas totalling 
1.81 million hectares, 500,000 hectares more than five years ago 
and an increase of 6.4 percent annually. 
  The official noted that the success resulted from scientific 
planting and administrative measures to ban indiscriminate 
felling of trees.
