FT  26 MAY 94 / Mortgage benefit may be scrapped
Social security ministers are considering abolishing mortgage relief for
low-income families as a way of containing the long-term growth of their
department's budget.
It is understood that Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary,
believes the principle of providing mortgage payments through income support
is fundamentally flawed.
He has told officials to examine the consequences of abolishing it if the
Conservatives were to win the next general election, and to outline the role
private insurance might play in replacing it.
Officials say abolition of the benefit - which would save about Pounds 1.2bn
a year - is emerging as one of the main possibilities for cutting the
department's Pounds 85bn annual expenditure. Many other areas of the
department's spending are far more politically sensitive and would be more
damaging to touch.
The cost of mortgage benefits has already been cut. Last year ministers
lowered the ceiling for mortgages on which payments can be made from Pounds
150,000 to around Pounds 125,000.
Senior figures in the industry believe they have not been vigorous enough in
supporting mortgage benefit, having concentrated instead on opposing
reductions in mortgage interest tax relief (Miras).
Recently Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
building society and chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, wrote to
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, arguing against
further cuts in mortgage benefit.
