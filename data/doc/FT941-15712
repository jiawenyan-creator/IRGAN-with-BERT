FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Int'l Paper turns in 15% advance
International Paper, the diversified US paper, packaging and wood products
company, reported fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 100m, or 81 cents a
share, up 15 per cent from Dollars 87m, or 71 cents, before extraordinary
charges in the fourth quarter a year ago, writes Laurie Morse.
The earnings advance came on strong performances by the company's forest
products and specialty products businesses. However, sales for the quarter
were flat, at Dollars 3.4bn.
Mr John Georges, chairman, said the results continued to be deflated by weak
worldwide price levels in most paper and packaging products.
Excluding special items, International Paper had earnings of Dollars 314m,
or Dollars 2.54 a share, for the full fiscal year 1993, down from Dollars
405m, or Dollars 3.34, in 1992.
The company recorded sales of Dollars 13.7bn in 1993, little changed from
1992.
