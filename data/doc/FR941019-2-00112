In accordance with the policy of the Department of Justice, 28 CFR 50.7 and Section 122 of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9622, notice is hereby given that a proposed
consent decree in 

United States v. Environmental Conservation and Chemical Corporation, et al

., Civil Action No. 831419C (S.D. Ind.)., was lodged with the United States District Court for the District
of Indiana, on September 29, 1994. That action was brought against approximately 283 defendants pursuant to Sections
106 and 107 of CERCLA for the cleanup of, and for recovery of costs the United States incurred in performing response
actions at, the Envirochem Site. The eight settlors to this decree as 

de minimis

 contributors of hazardous substances to the Site, as defined in Section 122(g) of CERCLA, and under the terms of this
decree are paying a certain charge per gallon of wastes that they sent to the Site. This money will be used to reimburse
the Superfund for costs the United States incurred in carrying out certain response actions at the Site. The terms
of this decree are substantially similar to the terms of two other 

de minimis

 settlements entered in this case in 1990 and 1991, which involved other 

de minimis

 defendants. The Site is currently being remediated by other defendants pursuant to a consent decree entered in 1991.
The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed consent decree for a period of 30 days from
the date of this publication. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Environmental
and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530. All comments should refer to
