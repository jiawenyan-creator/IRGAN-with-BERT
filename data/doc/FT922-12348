FT  18 APR 92 / Boost for mortgage rescues
MORTGAGE rescue schemes have been given a fresh boost by a decision of the
Building Societies Commission, the industry watchdog, to allow societies to
take part in syndicated loans on property.
The move allows societies to lend jointly to housing associations which want
to buy flats and houses from the public sector. That will enable risk to be
spread between several societies.
The new power comes into force on June 1, but only societies with assets of
more than Pounds 100m - about 60 of the total 90 societies - will be allowed
to use it. Approval from their annual general meetings will be required, but
that is not expected to prove a cause of delay as most such meetings are to
be held in the next two months.
