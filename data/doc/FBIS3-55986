  [Text] Estonia's Riigikogu [parliament] on Wednesday 
adopted amendments to law on compensating illegally expropriated 
property which will enable people who owned property at the 
other side of Estonian-Russian administrative border receive 
compensation for Soviet-time nationalisation. 
  Votes in the parliament split 35:4 with 12 abstentions. 
  Until now, Estonia did not pay compensation for property 
that 
was illegally expropriated at territories that under 1920 Tartu 
Peace Treaty between Estonia and Russia belong to Estonia, but 
are now under Russian jurisdiction, Liia Hanni, the Minister of 
Reform, said. 
  Under Estonian ownership reform law, properties that lie in 
Petserimaa and across Narva river will be assessed by land 
commissions of Viru and Ida-Viru counties respectively.
