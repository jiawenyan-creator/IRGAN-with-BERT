HEY, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE FAMOUS FOR REAL REASONS TOO 
In the article, "Famous for Being Famous" (View, Sept. 12, by Nikki Finke), 
there was passing reference to Charles Nelson Reilly as being a PFBFer (People 
Famous for Being Famous). 
Let me, for the record, say that, besides his occasional appearances on 
"Hollywood Squares," Reilly is a talented and accomplished director. His 
credits include: "The Belle of Amherst," which won Julie Harris her fifth and 
record-breaking Tony Award for Best Actress in a Broadway play; several other 
plays starring Harris; and the recent critically acclaimed "At Wit's End" by 
Joel Kimmel and starring Stan Freeman. In addition, Reilly teaches and directs 
at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre in Jupiter, Fla. 
Perhaps Reilly is famous for reasons other than these, but surely his talents 
far surpass getting into the tabloids weekly or having annual face-lifts. I 
think his fame justifiably comes from his raucous and genuine ability to make 
people laugh.
