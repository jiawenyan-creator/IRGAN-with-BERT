FT  21 JAN 92 / Ratners suspends dividends on its preference shares
RATNERS GROUP, the struggling jewellery company, has suspended payments of
all its preference dividends prompting a share price fall in London and a
further credit downgrading in New York.
The move was foreshadowed nine days ago when Ratners said it was keeping
preference dividend payments 'under review' after it announced that it was
likely to incur annual losses of Pounds 72m.
Ratners will conserve more than Pounds 25m by not paying the preference
dividends but will have to roll up the payments and satisfy them before it
can pay out any dividends on its ordinary shares.
Mr Quintin Price, retailing analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, said: 'It
is a defensive move to demonstrate that they are limiting the cash outflow
and is inevitable in the context.'
After recovering last week, Ratners shares fell back 2 1/2 p yesterday to
close in London at 24 1/2 p.
In the US, both the Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit agencies
reacted to the news by slicing their credit ratings. Moody's cut its rating
on Ratners' Dollars 250m (Pounds 139.6m) Auction Market Preferred Stock
(Amps) from BA3 to CAA - one of its lowest grades, which indicates that the
issue may be in danger of default. Standard &amp; Poor's gave the preferred
stock a C rating, 'almost our lowest rating on preferred stock'.
