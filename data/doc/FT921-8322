FT  18 FEB 92 / Growth in personal computer sales slows
GROWTH in sales of personal computers in the UK slowed sharply between 1989
and 1990 and reached a five-year low last year, according to figures to be
published later this week, Alan Cane writes.
New statistics from Context, a London-based marketing consultancy, show how
the personal computer market has been depressed by the recession and
tumbling hardware prices.
The price of personal computers has fallen by between 25 per cent and 40 per
cent for the past two years and further price cuts seem certain.
Context's figures show the market grew 39.5 per cent by volume between 1988
and 1989 and 59.7 per cent by value. Between 1990 and last year, however,
the increase by volume was 2.3 per cent while the value of personal
computers sold declined by 8.4 per cent.
The total value of personal computers sold through dealers and other
indirect channels totalled Pounds 1.7bn last year, representing about
775,000 machines. Both figures would be about 15 per cent higher if all
distribution channels were included. Amstrad's PCW word processors were
excluded from the statistics.
Context says International Business Machines, the world's largest computer
manufacturer, and Compaq, the leader in high-performance personal computers,
continue to dominate the UK market with 42 per cent of sales by volume.
