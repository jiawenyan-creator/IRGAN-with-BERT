P.M. BRIEFING; 
U.S. ACCUSED OF OIL SPILL COVER-UP 
Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine today accused the federal government of 
hiding from the nation the possibility of a major oil spill and the 
ineffectiveness of clean-up technology. 
The California Democrats blamed the Reagan Administration for what they called 
a cover-up and asked President Bush to cancel further oil leasing off the 
California coast pending a complete review of the program. 
Levine released internal memoranda from the Reagan Administration on the 
proposed lease sale in Northern California that he said revealed the likelihood 
of a major spill, other adverse effects on the environment and an attempt to 
whitewash the information.
