 

The PBGC certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Accordingly, as provided in section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

), sections 603 and 604 do not apply. As indicated above, this rule is limited to procedures required by the Federal
Claims Collections Standards for use of administrative offset to collect certain debts owed to the United States.
Thus, a small entity can avoid the application of this rule by paying such debts when due. Further, insofar as provisions
of this rule do apply, their primary effect will be to provide procedural protection to persons whose debts are otherwise
subject to collection by administrative offset.
