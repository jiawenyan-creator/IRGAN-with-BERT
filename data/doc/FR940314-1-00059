 

(B) Between May 8, 1996, and May 7, 1997, if, for the period between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996, the person claiming the
exemption employed fewer than an average of 200 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 200,000 units of that
product were sold in the United States.

(ii) For all other food products that are dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, the supplement shall be eligible
for an exemption for any 12-month period if, for the preceding 12 months, the person claiming the exemption employed
fewer than an average of 100 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 100,000 units of that product were sold
in the United States, or in the case of a dietary supplement that was not sold in the 12-month period preceding the period
for which exemption is claimed, fewer than 100,000 units of such product are reasonably anticipated to be sold in the
United States during the period for which exemption is claimed.

(iii) If a person claims an exemption under paragraphs (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section for a dietary supplement
food product and then, during the period of such exemption, the number of full-time equivalent employees of such person
exceeds the appropriate number, or the number of units of the dietary supplement sold in the United States exceeds
the appropriate number, or, if at the end of the period of such exemption, the dietary supplement no longer qualifies
for an exemption under the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section, such person shall have
18 months from the date that the supplement no longer qualified as a low-volume food product of a small business to comply
with this section.

(iv) A notice shall be filed with the Office of Food Labeling (HFS150), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,
Food and Drug Administration, 200 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20204 and contain the following information, except
that if the person is not an importer and has fewer than 10 full-time equivalent employees, that person does not have
to file a notice for any dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals with annual sales of fewer than 10,000 total units:

(A) Name and address of firm requesting exemption;

(B) Names of the food products (including the various brand names) for which exemption is claimed;

(C) Name and address of the manufacturer of the food products for which an exemption is claimed, if different than the
firm that is claiming the exemption;

(D) The number of full-time equivalent employees. Provide the average number of full-time equivalent individuals
employed by the person and its affiliates for the 12 months preceding the period for which a small business exemption
is claimed for a product. The number of full-time equivalent employees is to be determined by dividing the total number
of hours of salary or wages paid to individuals that render services to the company by the number of hours of work in a
year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours x 52 weeks);

(E) Approximate total number of units of the food product that is a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals sold
in the United States in the 12-month period preceding that for which a small business exemption is claimed. Provide
the approximate total number of units sold, or expected to be sold, in a 12-month period for each product for which an
exemption is claimed. For products that have been in production for more than 1 year before the period for which exemption
is claimed, the 12-month period should be the period preceding the period for which an exemption is claimed. For other
products, the 12-month period should be the period for which an exemption is claimed; and

(F) The notice shall be signed by a responsible individual for the person who can certify the accuracy of the information
presented in the notice. The individual shall certify that the information contained in the notice is a complete and
accurate statement of the number of full-time equivalent employees of the firm and its affiliates and of the number
of units of the product for which an exemption is claimed sold by the firm. The individual shall also state that should
the average number of full-time equivalent employees or the number of units of the food product sold in the United States
by the firm exceed the applicable numbers for the time period for which exemption is claimed, the firm will notify FDA
of that fact and of the date on which the number of employees or number of products sold exceeded the standards.

(v) FDA may by regulation lower the employee or units of a food product that is a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals
requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section for any product first introduced into interstate commerce
after May 8, 2002, if the agency determines that the cost of compliance with such lower requirement will not place an
undue burden on persons subject to it.

(vi) For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions apply:
