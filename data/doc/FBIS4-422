  [Text] Latest reports from Rwanda say fighting has 
continued in the capital, Kigali, where thousands of people have 
been killed since President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and 
Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi were killed in a plane crash last 
Wednesday [6 April]. Fighting is reported to be going on in the 
city center and around the airport. 
  The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front based in the north of the 
country is reported to have confirmed that its fighters have 
reached the outskirts of Kigali. It said that the main 
objective is to fight the Presidential Guard, who are reported 
to be killing civilians, especially Tutsis. 
  Meanwhile, efforts to evacuate foreigners are continuing. 
Among those who have left Kigali are Asians, who have gone to 
Burundi and Kenya.
