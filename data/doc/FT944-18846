FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Swiss Re sells non-core
businesses
Swiss Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurer after Munich
Reinsurance, is selling all its interests in primary insurance companies to
concentrate on expanding its core business.
In the most important transaction, Allianz of Germany, Europe's largest
insurer, has agreed to pay SFr1.5bn for Swiss Re's 60 per cent stake in
Elvia, Switzerland's fifth largest insurance company with annual premium
volume of SFr2.6bn (Dollars 2bn). It will also make an offer to public
shareholders for the balance at SFr3,915 per share. The planned purchases
will increase the Allianz group's premium income - DM65.5bn (Dollars 43.6m)
last year - by almost 20 per cent.
This marks the first big advance of a non-Swiss company into the lucrative
and recently-liberalised Swiss insurance market.
Allianz has also agreed to buy Vereinte/Magdeburger of Munich from Swiss Re,
which would substantially strengthen its already solid position in the
German market.
It is also purchasing Swiss Re's 62.7 per cent stake in Lloyd Adriatico of
Trieste for SFr600m, and making an offer to minority shareholders at L20,342
per ordinary share and L14,335 per savings share.
Meanwhile, Switzerland's Winterthur Insurance will take over the troubled
Schweiz Seguros of Barcelona and Schweiz Italia of Milan, as well as Swiss
Re's majority stake in La Equitativa of Madrid. Terms were not disclosed.
Swiss Re also published its 1993 financial results yesterday, showing a 15.7
per cent rise in net income to SFr325m on gross premium income of SFr23.7bn,
up 8.3 per cent. The directors are proposing a 9.4 per cent dividend rise to
SFr10.50 per share.
The profit gain was achieved in spite of SFr360m in losses on its primary
insurance businesses, mainly due to a 'misguided business policy' at Schweiz
Seguros. Swiss Re has provided SFr480m to put Seguros in order before
Winterthur takes it over.
Mr Lukas Muhlemann, who joined Swiss Re as chief executive a month ago, said
a strategic review by the group had concluded that the primary insurance
market would polarise around big companies and niche players as deregulation
in Europe proceeded.
Swiss Re's companies fitted into neither of these categories, 'so we were
not good owners for them', Mr Muhlemann, former managing director of
McKinsey &amp; Co in Switzerland, said. On the other hand, there was a 'great
future' in the reinsurance business, in which Swiss Re was well-placed
globally.
