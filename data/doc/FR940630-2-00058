Application for authority to lease and operate facilities for the provision of direct packet data service between
the United States and Cuba



Order and Authorization



Adopted: June 6, 1994; Released: June 22, 1994

By the Chief, International Facilities Division:




1. The Commission has under consideration the above-captioned application filed by Sprint Communications Company
L.P. (``Sprint'') requesting authority pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to
establish channels of communication between the United States and Cuba for the provision of direct packet data service.
The application was placed on the Commission's public notice and no comments were received.

2. Sprint proposes to provide international packet data service between the U.S. and Cuba via the INTELSAT satellite
located at 335
&cir; E.L. using appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities. Specifically, Sprint requests authority
to lease from Comsat and operate one 2-Mbps digital satellite circuit between the Orion international Standard A
earth station located at Shenandoah, Virginia and the theoretical midpoint of the INTELSAT AOR satellite connecting
with matching facilities provided by INTERTEL S.A. (``INTERTEL'') of Cuba. Sprint proposes to connect its operating
center in New York, New York, to the Orion earth station using Sprint's own facilities. Sprint states that it has already
entered into an operating agreement with INTERTEL for the establishment of direct packet data service between the
United States and Cuba. Under the terms of its agreement, INTERTEL and Sprint have agreed to a 50/50 split of a $5.50
per kilosegment and $5.50 per hour accounting rate for packet data traffic. Sprint states this rate is consistent
with U.S. policy guidelines.

 Sprint states that it will initiate service within one year.

Sprint explains that packet data traffic is measured based on a unit known as a ``kilosegment.'' Sprint states that
on a typical dial packet data transmission, two kilosegments are transferred per hour. On a typical dedicated packet
data transmission, four kilosegments are transferred per hour. Therefore, for a typical dial packet data transmission,
the total accounting rate would be approximately $16.50 per hour (27.5&cent; per minute), including $5.50 for the
hour of time and $11.00 for the two kilosegments of transmitted packet data. For a typical dedicated packet data transmission,
the total accounting rate would be approximately $27.50 per hour (46&cent; per minute), including $5.50 for the hour
of time and $22.00 for the four kilosegments of transmitted packet data.

</FOOTNOTE>


3. Sprint states that the public interest would be served by a grant of its application because it will result in the
rapid introduction of new lines of telecommunications between the United States and Cuba. Sprint states that an immediate
and large demand exists for direct telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba, and Sprint's
proposed service will help meet that demand within the regulatory framework established by the Cuban Democracy Act.

4. In a letter dated July 22, 1993, the U.S. Department of State informed the Commission of the Executive Branch's general
policy guidelines for implementation of the telecommunications provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act, which provides
that ``telecommunication services between the United States and Cuba shall be permitted.''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Among the policy guidelines are the following requirements: (1) the proposals must have the potential to be operational
within a year; (2) settlements must not be more favorable to Cuba than the current 50/50 split of the $1.20 per minute
accounting rate; (3) proposals must be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba; (4)
proposals must utilize modes of communications already in place between the U.S. and Cuba; and (5) carriers shall
report the number of circuits activated by facility on June 30 and December 31 of each year and on the one-year anniversary
of the notification by the FCC in the 

Federal Register

.
