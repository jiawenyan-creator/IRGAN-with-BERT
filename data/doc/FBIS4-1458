  [Text] In Lusaka, Zambia, the government and the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continues the 
search for peace for Angola. Our correspondent Manuel da 
Conceicao reports. 
  [Begin Conceicao recording] The negotiating teams from the 
government and UNITA continued to work today without the 
presence of the mediator. It seems as if the government and 
UNITA want to end differences on the point under discussion. 
Thus, an agreement on whether or not to review electoral law is 
expected to be reached in the next few days. Tomorrow, the 
negotiating teams from the government and UNITA will continue to 
discuss the revision of the electoral law. Mediator Alioune 
Blondin Beye will be present at the meeting. [end recording]
