  [Text] Peruvian Air Force [FAP] spokesmen have asserted 
that there is no express ban on U.S. Air Force `Awacs' and 
`Orion' planes overflying Peruvian territory, as was stated in 
U.S. press reports. 
  The reports state that the alleged measure is a Peruvian 
`reprisal' to the U.S. decision to suspend the supply of 
information collected by these aircraft which is very necessary 
for the FAP to intercept the traffickers' planes. 
  The consulted sources stated that the problem is simply that 
the U.S. South Command has not requested permission to enter 
Peruvian airspace. 
  Under international laws, no country can prohibit air 
traffic 
over its territory. All that is necessary is to request a 
permit and to state the route that will be followed. 
  The sources stated that the antinarcotic agreement, the part 
concerning the FAP, is still in force and this is why the radar 
sent by the Panama-based U.S. South Command is still in 
Yurimaguas. Although this radar is obsolete, whenever it is not 
out of order it helps somewhat the Tucano aircraft to intercept 
traffickers planes. 
  FAP spokesmen admitted that the `electronic intelligence' 
supplied by U.S. `Awacs' and `Orion' is of vital importance for 
the interdiction operations against traffickers planes and 
without their participation the Air Force's operations would not 
be as effective.
