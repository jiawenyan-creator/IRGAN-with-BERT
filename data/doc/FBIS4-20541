Manufacturers Investing Outside of Europe"] 
  [Text] Peugeot and Citroen are deploying in Egypt, 
India, and China, where Renault will join them. Renault also has 
its sights set on Turkey and Argentina. But the Japanese are 
watching. 
  A few cable lengths distant from the Pyramids, Peugeot 
opened 
the doors of its Cairo plant to the press on 26 January, for the 
launching of its "made in Egypt" 405. More that 1,000 405's are 
to be assembled there this year, and 10,000 a year at full 
capacity, by an Egyptian-American joint venture that also 
assembles Jeeps. By 1995, Peugeot aims to capture some 25 
percent of the Egyptian market for personal automobiles. Running 
close behind, Citroen will begin assembling its AX compacts in 
February, with their replacement, the ZX's, slated to follow 
shortly thereafter. Anticipated production: 20,000 units by 
1998. Citroen's share of the local market is expected to match 
Peugeot's, at around 30 percent. Despite the fundamentalist 
threat, PSA [Peugeot SA] is banking on this small, growing 
market, still free of strong Japanese competition.

  The French automobile industry has also chosen to break new 
ground in China and India. Citroen plans to manufacture 150,000 
ZX's a year beginning around mid-1995 in two new plants in the 
center of China. The AX's replacement could be produced there. 
Meanwhile, a few ZX's are being assembled in temporary plant 
facilities. Some ten or so French suppliers are in the process 
of setting up installations there. Some 40 or more are expected 
to follow. 
  Peugeot is increasing the capacity of its Canton plant, with 
plans calling for a capacity of 50,000 vehicles by 1995. A basic 
agreement has been signed for the building of a second 
ultramodern plant capable of manufacturing 100,000 Peugeot 405 
sedans annually by the year 2000. Renault, for its part, plans 
to start production of its Trafic minibus at Xiaogan, not far 
from the Citroen plant, around the end of this year. In India, 
Peugeot plans to produce 60,000 Peugeot 309 sedans annually, 
near Bombay, beginning around the end of 1994. Citroen is 
negotiating to assemble its C 15 commercial vehicles there. 
  Although the French manufacturers are exploring the 
promising 
new markets still being neglected by the Japanese, they are by 
no means forsaking their traditional bases. In Turkey, 
Oyak-Renault, a subsidiary 57-percent owned by Renault, has 
invested 2 billion francs[Fr] to modernize its Bursa plant and 
manufacture its R19. Another strategic region for the French is 
Argentina, and specifically from the standpoint of penetrating 
the Brazilian market. Renault plans to increase its non-European 
production by 16 to 17 percent in 1994. And Citroen is planning 
to double its non-European production. Nevertheless, the French 
automobile makers manufacture only a small proportion of their 
vehicles outside of the Old Continent: Renault 15 percent, 
versus 30 percent for Nissan outside of Japan. "We do not have 
funds of our own to spend several billions in risky operations," 
says Renault, "and we lack engineers and available marketers."

1993. Sales volume is expected to increase significantly in the future, 
thanks to China, Egypt, Turkey, and Argentina.
