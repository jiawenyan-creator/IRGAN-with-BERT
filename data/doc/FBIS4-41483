  [Text] Moscow June 25 TASS -- "Russia's geopolitical 
position, the ineffective legislation and customs and border 
control contribute to the increase in drug trafficking and 
strengthening of ties with international drug business," Russian 
Interior Ministry top officials said on Saturday. 
  They stressed that in the Moscow, St. Petersburg, 
Kaliningrad, Omsk and other Russian regions the share of 
illegally imported drugs has exceeded 80 per cent lately. As a 
result of one of the operations last year law enforcement bodies 
seized 42,000 ampoules of the drug buprenorphin shipped to St. 
Petersburg from India. 
  Other drugs include pure heroin, Colombian cocaine and 
crack. 
  Russian law enforcement bodies have set up special units to 
fight illegal drug business. The Interior Ministry alone keeps 
over 3,000 specialists. 
  In 1993 law enforcement bodies handled 53,000 drug-related 
cases (16,000 in 1990), over 8,000 drug dealers were exposed 
(threefold increase since 1992 and sevenfold since 1989). A 
total of 4,500 gangs involved in drug trafficking were arrested, 
over 40 tonnes of drugs confiscated. 
  Two new draft laws have been worked out -- on fighting 
illegal drug trafficking and on control of drug trafficking. 
The government plans to allocate 18 billion roubles in 1994 to 
finance the implementation of the anti-drug programme. 
  On October 22, 1992 in Kiev 13 republics of the former 
Soviet 
Union signed an agreement on cooperation in fighting illegal 
drug trafficking. Since then Russia has signed similar 
agreements with 30 countries and maintains close contacts with 
Interpol and U.N. agencies.
