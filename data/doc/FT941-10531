FT  09 FEB 94 / People: MD retiring from self-managed investment trust group
Lyndon Bolton, 57, managing director of the Dundee-based Alliance and Second
Alliance investment trusts, has signalled his retirement after 31 years with
one of Britain's biggest self-managed investment trust groups.
The Alliance trusts, which are over 100 years old, have always kept a low
profile. Management expenses are the lowest in the industry and a
single-minded concentration on investment performance resulted in the
winning of The Sunday Telegraph investment trust group of the year award for
three years in a row.
The change-over is not being hurried. Gavin Suggett, 49, who joined in 1973
and is Bolton's deputy, has been appointed joint managing director and will
take over sole responsibility in April 1995. Bolton, a non-executive
director of TSB and General Accident, will not remain on the board when he
retires. William Berry, senior partner of Edinburgh solicitors Murray Beith
&amp; Murray WS, has been appointed a non-executive director of the two trusts,
replacing Sir Douglas Hardie.
