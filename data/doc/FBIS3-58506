<F P=106> [Report on interview with Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris </F>
Buwayz by Margaretha Kopeinig; place and date not given: "Key 
Talks in Geneva"] 
  [Text] Lebanon is Syria's closest ally. Margaretha 
Kopeinig conducted an interview with Lebanon's Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz on the following topics: 
  -- The meeting between U.S. President Clinton and Syrian 
President Hafiz Al-Asad: "They are holding key talks. Clinton 
and Al-Asad are holding the major trumps in the Middle East 
peace process. Syria has always been a military and political 
bulwark in the Arab region. Lebanon's biggest problem is that 
10 percent of its territory in the south is occupied by Israel. 
We only want a global settlement." 
  -- Chances for peace between Israel and Syria: "This is not 
a question of time, but a basic question. So far, Israel has 
not made any promises that it will withdraw from southern 
Lebanon or the Golan Heights. Moreover, Israel is still 
quarreling with the PLO over the specific implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, which is only a minimum solution. The 
success of negotiations will depend on whether the Israeli 
Government is ready to fulfill our basic demands." 
  -- Lebanon's future: "Geographically, Lebanon is situated at 
the center of the Middle East conflict and forms the bridge 
between the Orient and the Occident. If our country is paying 
for the costs of regional and global conflicts, it will 
naturally also profit from peace."
