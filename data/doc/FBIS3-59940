  [Excerpt] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has stated 
he was unsatisfied with the parliament's decision on the 
ratification of the START I treaty. In November, the Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet ratified the treaty with numerous reservations. 
  "Taking into account our capabilities, positions and 
obligations, we must return to the issue and make an adequate 
decision," he stressed. "I cannot see why we cannot join the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty." "We cannot be a state 
everyone would point at with his finger," he added. 
  Speaking at a scientific and research institute in Kiev 
today, Kravchuk pointed out that if the world community gave up 
its practice of applying pressure upon Ukraine on nuclear 
disarmament, the issue might be solved even faster. "Experience 
shows us that threats and sanctions are apparently not the best 
way to solve such complex issues," he pointed out. 
  The president supposed Kiev will manage to agree on the 
technical maintenance of its nuclear missiles with Moscow next 
year. [passage omitted]
