  [Text] Durban March 25 SAPA -- African National Congress 
[ANC] marshalls lost control of thousands of ANC supporters soon 
after they began marching from Durban's Curries Fountain to the 
city centre on Friday [25 March] afternoon. Near-chaos reigned 
as crowds broke free from the body of the march and marshalls 
struggled to maintain order in Grey Street. 
  The crowd was estimated at more than 30,000, with hundreds 
more joining from buses and sidewalks. At least 20,000 African 
National Congress supporters had massed at Durban's Curries 
Fountain by 1 PM on Friday. South African Police [SAP] 
spokesman Col Johan Stoltz said between 700 and 800 policemen 
had been deployed in central Durban in preparation for the march. 
  South African Communist Party spokesman Dennis Nkosi told 
SAPA at Curries Fountain: "Let (Inkatha Freedom Party President 
Mangosuthu) Buthelezi know we have majority support in the 
region." He claimed IFP supporters were "war weary" and were 
"joining the democratic movement in their thousands". 
  Central Durban was virtually deserted except for police 
patrols and security forces ready to erect razor wire cordons. 
  SAP spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said townships around Durban 
were quiet except for two shooting incidents in kwaMashu.
