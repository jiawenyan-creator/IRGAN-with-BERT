WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY; 
INTERIM CITY HALL SITE 
The City Council reached a preliminary decision to move City Hall offices to a 
site at Culver Boulevard and Overland Avenue while demolition and construction 
proceeds at the current City Hall site. 
A final decision on the interim site will not be made until next month's 
council meeting, after owners of property next to the Culver-Overland and other 
possible downtown sites have been notified of the move. 
The city plans to raze its 71-year-old City Hall and a build a new 
3,000-square-foot L-shape building on the grounds of the present building at 
Duquesne Street and Culver Boulevard.
