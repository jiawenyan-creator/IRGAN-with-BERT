Those deprived folk who wonder why people get so excited about cars might
catch a whiff of what it is all about on Top Gear (BBC2, 8.30), in which the
ever-opinionated Jeremy Clarkson gets to play with some USDollars 4m worth
of some of the most beautiful cars ever made - the three Bat cars created
for Alfa Romeo by Franco Scaglione in the 1950s. On a less exalted level,
Quentin Willson looks at the market for second-hand Mazda MX-5s.
A riveting plot-within-a-plot unravels in the course of Critical Eye:
Angleterre Underground (Channel 4, 9.00), a documentary following a group of
New Age travellers. Relations between the French-Polish film director Edward
Porembny and his crew became so strained that they, rather than the original
subject, become the film's chief point of interest. Post-modern or what?
Poets will be popping up throughout the day on BBC2 as part of that
channel's celebration of National Poetry Day, which makes a change from the
charmless banter of smarmy announcers; Roger McGough hosts the climax to the
festivities in Poets Win Prizes (BBC2, 7.20).
