ARREOLA RETAINS 3 CCAA TITLES BUT CSUN WOMEN SETTLE FOR 2ND 
Many athletes would have been elated after winning two individual titles at the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. track and field championships. 
Darcy Arreola of Cal State Northridge, however, was disappointed with the form 
that had gained her a pair of victories. 
So she entered -- and won -- the 3,000 meters Saturday and emerged with a third 
title to go with victories in the 1,500 and 800. 
"I didn't plan on running the three," Arreola said. "But I ran so crappy in the 
other races that I wanted to. I felt like I had to punish myself." 
Arreola, however, vented the brunt of her frustration on her opponents. She 
broke away from Tina Colebrook of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with 1,000 meters 
left to win the 3,000 in 9 minutes, 28.82 seconds. 
The Northridge junior ran 4:19.47 in the 1,500 and 2:07.32 in the 800 and won 
female athlete of the meet honors for the second consecutive year. 
Arreola, the defending NCAA Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000, has 
won eight CCAA track titles in her career. She won the 800 and 1,500 as a 
freshman in 1987 and has won the 800, 1,500 and 3,000 in each of the past two 
CCAA championships. 
Her performances led Northridge to a second-place finish in the team standings 
behind host San Luis Obispo, which won its ninth consecutive CCAA title with 
229 points. 
The Lady Matadors scored 170 points and were followed by Cal Poly Pomona (92), 
Cal State Bakersfield (58), Chapman (10) and UC Riverside (8). 
Tyrone Jeffries of Northridge won the 100 (10.64) and 200 (21.21) and placed 
third in the 110-meter high hurdles (14.23) in the men's meet. His individual 
efforts, however, did not prevent Cal State Los Angeles from winning its fourth 
consecutive conference title. 
The Golden Eagles, buoyed by Jesus Gutierrez's victories in the 5,000 and 
10,000, totaled 166 points. San Luis Obispo was second with 142, followed by 
Northridge (125), Pomona (114), Bakersfield (86) and Riverside (13). Chapman 
did not score in the meet. 
Arreola's victory in the 3,000 -- she won by almost six seconds -- may have 
been the least impressive of her three wins. 
In the 1,500, she broke away with 600 meters remaining to win by more than 11 
seconds, and in the 800, she took command with 300 meters remaining and won by 
more than four seconds. 
Her successful triple further inspired Northridge Coach Don Strametz, who 
intends to enter her in the 1,500, 3,000 and 5,000 at the NCAA Division II 
championships in Hampton, Va., May 24-27. 
Arreola, who was vehemently opposed to an NCAA triple three weeks ago, has 
softened her stance. 
"He's going to enter me in all three events," she said. "But I'm still not 
convinced that I'll run all three." 
Although Arreola was the standout of the women's meet, she had plenty of 
support from teammates. 
Laural Isles won the 100 in 12.00 seconds, placed second in the 200 (wind-aided 
24.7) and ran the opening legs on the Lady Matadors' victorious 400 (47.62) and 
1,600 (3:49.81) relay teams. 
Mary Coleman won the 400 in 55.29, placed fourth in the 200 (25.07) and ran 
legs on the 400 and 1,600 relays. 
Lolita Pile defended her title in the triple jump (wind-aided 40-11 1/2), 
placed third in the 200 (24.86) and ran the third leg on the 400 relay team, 
which was anchored by Saeida Washington. Pile won the long jump Friday. 
Northridge, which had an outside chance to win the men's title, had its hopes 
dashed early when Shannon Haas and Jeffries dropped the baton on the first 
exchange of the 400 relay, the first men's running event of the day. 
Walt Stewart, a junior from Notre Dame High, won the men's high jump at 7-1 
3/4.
