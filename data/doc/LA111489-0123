CZECH PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST IMPRISONED 
An activist has been sentenced to one year in prison for distributing leaflets 
urging a pro-democracy protest in May, a human rights leader said Monday. 
Jiri Jelinek, 22, was jailed Thursday by a court in Tabor, south of Prague, for 
his part in the demonstration on May Day in the nearby city of Ceske 
Budejovice, activist Anna Sabatova said. 
In a separate case, a court in Bratislava on Monday began the trial of four 
dissidents charged with calling on citizens to commemorate the 21st anniversary 
of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion in August. The defendants face between six 
months and five years in prison.
