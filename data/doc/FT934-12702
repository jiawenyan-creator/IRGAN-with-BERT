FT  26 OCT 93 / Spanish doubt on further cut in interest rates soon
SPAIN'S economy and finance minister, Mr Pedro Solbes, has warned that
benchmark interest rates in Spain, now at a historic low of 9.25 per cent
following cuts last week, are unlikely to fall further in the immediate
future.
In an interview with the Madrid business newspaper Expansion to be published
today, Mr Solbes said: 'In the present conditions we have pretty well
reached the limit on interest rate reductions. It is difficult to determine
the absolute limit but we are pretty close to it.'
He added, however, that external factors such as a further cut in French
interest rates and a fall in German inflation could give Spain's monetary
authorities 'a certain room for manoeuvre'.
The only domestic factor that would allow a lowering of Spanish rates, Mr
Solbes said, would be an agreement on wages restraint and on reform of the
rigidities of the labour market.
Discussions between the government, employers and unions on an incomes
policy and on the labour laws are due to begin tomorrow.
None of the three parties in the talks holds much hope for an agreement but
Mr Solbes issued a clear warning that the government was determined to bring
about wage restraint as well as labour market changes aimed principally at
reducing the cost of dismissing employees.
Mr Solbes said that although the government preferred to negotiate these
issues it would act unilaterally if necessary and bring the required
legislation before parliament by the end of next month. The government would
'not renounce' its plans to peg salaries to below the inflation index over
the next three years. Overhaul of labour legislation was also 'an essential
point' of the government's policy.
