FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Market operations help rise at
Kuwait bank
United Bank of Kuwait, the London-based bank owned by Kuwaiti financial
institutions, has reported a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to Pounds
14.5m (Dollars 21.6m), for 1993. The figure was struck on operating income
of Pounds 50.6m, a rise of 9.5 per cent.
UBK, 24 per cent of which is held by the Kuwait national pension fund,
reported profits after tax of Pounds 10.3m, up from Pounds 7.5m in 1992. Its
capital base rose 17 per cent to Pounds 235m. Shareholders will receive an
overall dividend of Pounds 7.7m.
Mr Chris Keen, general manager, said the results showed progress on all
fronts, particularly in market-based operations, notably its fixed-income
products. The bank, the bulk of whose clients are Kuwait or Gulf-based, saw
its funds under management rise 22 per cent to almost Dollars 2.64bn.
The 1993 figures mark a substantial improvement on the bank's recent
earnings, after showing only an operating profit in 1990, when it was hurt
by the the Gulf war. UBK showed modest improvements in 1991 and 1992.
Mr Keen said UK commercial property funds opened in 1992 and 1993 were
performing well, as were newly-introduced private banking and Islamic
banking products. 'We feel well-placed. The markets we're operating in are
more difficult than they were last year, but we will continue to do well,'
he said.
In May last year, UBK bought Portman Asset Management as a wholly-owned
subsidiary. The unit is launching property investment trusts with guaranteed
minimum returns, medium-term Islamic leasing funds and a high-yield retail
fund.
UBK last year also sold down Dollars 30m of UBK-originated aircraft
financing loans and Pounds 38m of real estate loans. In July, the bank sold
a Pounds 70m slice of its UK residential mortgage portfolio to Birmingham
Midshires. However, it retained Pounds 50m of home loans, representing
special-case loans or those to Gulf clients.
