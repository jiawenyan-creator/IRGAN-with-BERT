FT  12 JUL 94 / Balladur denies Rwanda agenda
Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, yesterday sought to allay
developing countries' misgivings that France had a hidden agenda in its
intervention in Rwanda, in an appearance before the United Nations Security
Council.
He insisted that the motivation was entirely humanitarian and that France
acted only after the international community failed to respond adequately to
an 'unacceptable tragedy'.
Mr Balladur told a press conference later that although France was committed
to withdrawing its troops at the end of July, he would reassess the
situation if the UN was still unable to fill the gap. The Security Council
has approved the dispatch of 5,500 troops to Rwanda but equipment and
training problems have delayed their arrival, which could still take some
weeks.
In his remarks during a New York visit lasting just a few hours, Mr Balladur
emphasised that only France, Senegal and Ghana had supplied troops -
implying some criticism that other states had not provided the support
sought by both Paris and the UN.
'The time has now come for others to take over the task begun by France and
Senegal,' he said.
He hotly denied an Amnesty International charge that French troops had
previously trained Rwandan death squads blamed for massacres. If the
allegations were true, the French intervention in the past few days would
not have been welcomed, 'as it has been by the populations concerned'.
In his Security Council address, Mr Balladur said UN credibility was at
stake in Rwanda. The world body's limits were exposed when it had been in a
position to save threatened civilians in the civil war. 'The UN cannot take
the place of states or parties to a conflict when they themselves lack
political resolve,' he said.
Referring to the French-sponsored commission that will investigate the
massacres, he said the perpetrators must be brought to account before the
international community.
