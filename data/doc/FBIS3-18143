  [Text] [Announcer] Let us now see what Occhetto [Democratic 
Party of the Left, PDS, secretary] thinks about the next 
government. Attilio Romita reports: 
  [Romita] Occhetto gave no formula for a postelection 
government. On the other hand, he put forward the idea of a 
national democratic government of reconstruction. 
  This is one of the PDS's three goals. Beating the right is 
the first and main goal. The right, according to Occhetto, is 
becoming aggressive again. There is a risk that the worst 
fascist culture may reemerge. The first goal comes in the form 
of an appeal made by Occhetto to the progressives: to fight for 
security, stability, and national solidarity. This is why the 
PDS leader warned everyone against the climate of fighting, 
division, and hatred which may become prevalent among Italians. 
These were the main things Occhetto said at the opening of the 
election campaign. He could not speak loudly: he had very 
little voice left after his trip to London.
