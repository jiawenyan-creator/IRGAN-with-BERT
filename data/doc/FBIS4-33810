  [Text] The Interior and National Defense Ministry has 
issued a protest note. Joseph Willio Noailles, interior and 
national defense minister, has formally deplored the media's 
malicious exploitation of his statements. The protest is in 
response to reports that Minister Noailles called the government 
illegitimate. He vehemently denies saying the infamous words, 
which he said were put in his mouth while he was in the 
Republic's Senate. Noailles asks the public to remain calm and 
to avoid the disinformation trap set for the government.
