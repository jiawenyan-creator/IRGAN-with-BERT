ACTION:

 Final notice of intent. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) requested comments regarding the appropriateness of the requirements it imposes
on the Farm Credit System. The action was taken to improve the regulatory environment in which the Farm Credit System
operates by targeting areas for more focused study and by revising rules where comments present strong evidence that
an FCA requirement is unjustified. This notice announces that the comment period has closed for the Statement on Regulatory
Burden. In addition, the notice describes the FCA's plans for addressing the comments received.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 10, 1993, the FCA Board approved a notice of intent for a Statement on Regulatory Burden seeking public comment
on the appropriateness of the requirements imposed on the Farm Credit System. Comments were sought on the requirements
that duplicate other Governmental requirements, are not effective, or impose a burden that is greater than the benefit
derived. The document appeared in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 34003) on June 23, 1993, for a 90-day comment period. The comment period was originally scheduled to end on September
21, 1993. However, several comments were received subsequent to that date and will also be considered. 



The FCA received 28 comments (12 comments from 11 associations or groups of associations; 11 comments from 6 Farm Credit
Banks; 3 comments from 3 work groups established by the Farm Credit System President's Planning Committee; 1 comment
from a Bank of Cooperatives; and 1 comment letter from The Farm Credit Council on behalf of its membership). The FCA
is pleased to note that the comments received address a wide variety of issues and contained a number of useful ideas.


A majority of the comments involve regulatory projects that the FCA Board previously identified in the Unified Agenda
of Regulations published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 57276). These ongoing projects are Standards of Conduct, Eligibility and Scope of Financing,
Collateral Evaluation, Borrower Rights, Capitalization, and Financially Related Services, and Disposition of
Records; Federal Records. The FCA work groups already organized to review these issues will consider the comments
received within the scope of these existing regulatory projects. An analysis and appropriate response to these comments
will be included as part of the regulatory action published in the 

Federal Register

. The remaining issues resulting from the Statement on Regulatory Burden that were not included in the Unified Agenda
of Regulations include the following: Organization; Loan Policies and Operations; Bank for Cooperatives Financing
International Trade; Funding; Disclosure; Accounting and Reporting; Examination Issues; and Miscellaneous Issues
such as releasing information. Additional work groups have been established to analyze the comments and make recommendations
to the FCA Board regarding action on the suggestions. The public will be notified of the FCA Board's decisions in an
appropriate manner.
