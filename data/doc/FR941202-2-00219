 

(2) Document proven and exemplary transition practices and approaches for students with disabilities by collecting,
analyzing, and reporting a variety of descriptive and outcome data, including (a) specific information on the educational
settings, the students targeted by the practices and approaches (e.g., age, disability, level of functioning and
membership in a special population, if appropriate), (b) outcome data for the students who are the focus of these practices
and approaches; and (c) outcome data for the teachers, administrators, and other service providers involved in the
effort; 

(3) Prepare, field-test, revise, and publicize user-friendly documentation of model practices; 

(4) Disseminate information on effective practices to all relevant audiences, including project directors, policy
makers, administrators, personnel from educational agencies, community leaders, parents, service providers,
grantees under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act, and other interested parties; 

(5) Coordinate a network among relevant OSERS transitional efforts, specifically research and model demonstration
projects, technical assistance entities, and clearinghouses. Coordination activities must include (a) the analysis
of research and model demonstration project designs through progress and final reports describing the interventions
and the synthesis of findings across competitions to identify effective practices, (b) the provision of logistical
support for an annual project directors' meeting for all OSERS-sponsored transition and postsecondary projects,
and (c) the development of an annual directory of these projects; 

(6) Maintain a comprehensive library on transition/school-to-work best practices for students with disabilities,
including those with severe disabilities, and integrate this information into an on-line electronic bulletin board/data
base. Users must be able to locally access this bulletin board/data base and download selected information free of
charge; 

(7) Provide technical assistance, upon request, to States receiving School-to-Work Opportunities Development
Grants. If requests for assistance exceed the project's ability to respond, project staff and the Federal project
officer will develop a priority list of those in need of assistance. 

(8) Enter into agreements with States receiving School-to-Work Opportunities Implementation Grants to develop
technical assistance plans that address the needs of students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities.
These plans must be based on the grantees' identified needs for the purposes of establishing School-to-Work Opportunities
systems in collaboration with activities initiated by the State Systems for Transition Services projects. This
assistance must include, but need not be limited to, providing information on successful practices in training,
teacher instruction, adaptation of materials, curriculum development, recruitment, and evaluation; 

(9) Provide technical assistance, training, and on-going consultation based on agreements developed in paragraph
(8) to personnel involved with or supported under the technical assistance efforts of the Federal School-to-Work
Opportunities Initiative. These efforts may take on many different forms, such as the participation in national
meetings, one-on-one State visits, regional sessions, and visits to successful School-to-Work Opportunities
systems. The training and consultation must include the use of materials and strategies for accessing, recruiting,
accommodating, and supporting students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, in the State
School-to-Work Opportunities systems developed under the Act; 

(10) Assist the Departments of Education and Labor in evaluating the extent to which students with disabilities have
access to, participate in, and benefit from the range of School-to-Work Opportunities Systems through the analysis
of data from State and local implementation. This effort must be coordinated with the evaluation activities carried
out under the Act; 

(11) In years 2 and 4 of the grant, conduct a national forum in Washington, DC that identifies persistent problems,
proposes solutions, and responds to emerging issues and trends in providing students with disabilities with access
to School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Invited participants must include, but not be limited to, Development
and Implementation grantees under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act; and
