FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: FDA approves sale of new Alza
heart drug
Alza, the California biotechnology company chaired by former Glaxo chief
executive Mr Ernest Mario, has won approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration to sell the heart drug Dynacirc CR.
Alza specialises in drug delivery systems, such as slow release capsules and
skin patches.
Dynacirc CR is a controlled-release version of Dynacirc, a heart drug
developed by Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer Sandoz.
Analysts at stockbroker Lehman Brothers estimate potential sales of Dynacirc
CR at up to Dollars 100m a year.
Dynacirc belongs to a class of drugs known as calcium antagonists. This
market is dominated by US company Pfizer, whose Procardia is one of the
world's top three drugs with sales of more than Dollars 2bn a year.
Dynacirc CR is the result of a joint effort between Alza and Sandoz. It uses
Alza's Oros controlled-release technology based on the principle of osmosis
 -the movement of a fluid through a membrane - to allow the slow dispersion
of the contents of a capsule.
Sandoz, which will be marketing the drug, said it planned to introduce
Dynacirc CR in the US in early 1995. The medication will be manufactured by
Alza.
Alza made an after-tax profit of Dollars 45.6m in 1993.
