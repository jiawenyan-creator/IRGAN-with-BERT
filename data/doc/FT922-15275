FT  02 APR 92 / The Lex Column: LWT
A 22 per cent jump in 1991 pre-tax profits at LWT (Holdings) was more than
the market was expecting, and offers a brighter picture than other ITV
companies which have reported of late. LWT's strong franchise is well
reflected in its 0.5 per cent increase in advertising revenue - against a
1.6 per cent drop for the industry as a whole - while a Pounds 15m fall in
programming sales to the domestic network and overseas customers was offset
by a reduction of Pounds 17m in transmission, sales and administrative
expenses.
Yesterday's results help edge the company's 50 or so golden-handcuffed
executives closer to their much publicised Pounds 43m jackpot, payable if
the company's shares reach 279p by November next year. The price last night
closed at 263p, up 5p. To many, the rewards will still seem absurd relative
to the risks, but as an example of identity of management and shareholder
interest the incentive scheme has proved hard to fault. It prevented
overbidding for the franchise and encouraged early and effective cost
cutting, leaving LWT among the best placed to face the early rigours of the
new licence system and the chill wind of satellite and cable competition.
The shares would seem to be worth staying with, at least until the handcuffs
are unlocked.
