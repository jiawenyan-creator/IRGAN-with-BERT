  [Text] Beijing, Feburary 3 ( XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, visited Qian Xuesen, China's 
greatest aerospace scientist, at his home in a Beijing suburb 
today. 
  Li, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, gave 
Lunar New Year greetings to the 82-year-old scientist on behalf 
of top Chinese leaders. 
  Li praised the scientist for his outstanding contributions 
to 
the development of China's scientific research, especially to 
foundation of the country's space technology. Li also praised 
Qian's achievement in social science studies. 
  Qian enjoys international fame as a key figure in the 
development of rockets and missiles. 
  Li said that China's decision-making system is expected to 
be 
more scientific and democratic, because social progress can 
neither be separated from natural science development nor can it 
be independent of the scientific decision-making system. 
  He hoped that Qian will make more proposals to help improve 
the system. 
  The scientist felt happy to see a new generation of 
scientific workers growing up and surpassing their senior 
co-workers in research work.
