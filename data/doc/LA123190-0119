GREECE, ISRAEL HIT BY EXODUS FROM ALBANIA 
Surprised Greek officials struggled to put up hundreds of newly arrived 
Albanian refugees in makeshift shelters today, and Albanian Jews were arriving 
in Israel under relaxed travel restrictions. 
Hundreds more Albanians trekked across frozen mountains and rivers today in the 
biggest exodus from their country since its Communist government promised 
reforms last summer. 
Military sources in the northwestern Greek border town of Filiates said today 
that 632 Albanians, most of them ethnic Greeks, had crossed the frontier since 
daybreak. 
On Sunday, at least 500 Albanians arrived in northern Greece seeking political 
asylum. In addition, 37 Jews flew to Rome from the Albanian capital of Tirana 
en route to Israel. 
So far this month, more than 1,600 people from the tiny Balkan nation of 3.3 
million have fled into Greece across the once tightly sealed 100-mile frontier.
