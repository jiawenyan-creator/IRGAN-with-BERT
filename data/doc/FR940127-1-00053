Background 


Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533) (Act), requires that the Service
make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding
is to be made within 90 days of receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act further requires the Service to make a finding as to whether or not the petitioned action
is warranted within 1 year of receipt of a petition that presents substantial information. 
On February 18, 1993, the Service received a petition from Mr. Randall Morgan to list the Ohlone tiger beetle as an endangered
species under the Act. The petition was dated February 12, 1993. A letter acknowledging receipt of the petition was
mailed to the petitioner on March 30, 1993. 
The finding is based on the species' description (Freitag 

et al. 

1993), other published literature, agency documents and reports, and field sightings. Interviews were conducted
with entomologists familiar with the biology of tiger beetles, with planners, and with others who are knowledgeable
about proposed projects that may negatively affect the Ohlone tiger beetle. All documents and records of telephone
conversations upon which this finding is based are on file at the Ventura Field Office (see 

ADDRESSES 

section).
