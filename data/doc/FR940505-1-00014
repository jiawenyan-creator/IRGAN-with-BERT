 

4. Section 402.9 would be revised to read as follows:


402.9 

Incentive tolls.


(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Tariff, the portion of the composite toll related to charges per metric
ton of cargo charged on new business shall be reduced by fifty percent for a Seaway transit beginning and ending during
the 1994 navigation year.
(b) The discount mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section shall be granted for the remainder of the navigation season
if:
(1) A vessel carries, for each transit, 1,000 metric tons or more of new business or a minimum of 1,000 cubic meters of
new business project cargo; and
(2) A complete and accurate application for a new business discount is submitted to the Authority or the Corporation,
on the form provided by the Authority or the Corporation, for evaluation and audit by the Authority or the Corporation
prior to the beginning of a Seaway transit.
(c) For the purposes of this section, ``new business'' means cargo that has not moved through a Seaway lock between
an origin and a destination as defined in this paragraph (c) during the navigation seasons of 1991, 1992, and 1993 or
cargo that has moved through a Seaway lock in quantities representing less than five percent of the average of Seaway
traffic between an origin and a destination during the navigation seasons of 1991, 1992, and 1993. For the purposes
of this paragraph (c), ``origin'' and ``destination'' mean the country in which the cargo is loaded or unloaded, but
if the cargo is unloaded in North America, ``origin'' and ``destination'' mean the geographic region in which the
cargo is unloaded, those geographic regions being as follows:
(1) The Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lambert Lock;
(2) St. Lambert Lock to Cape Vincent on the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario and the Welland Canal;
(3) Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and connecting waters;
(4) Lake Michigan;
(5) Lake Superior and St. Mary's River; and
(6) Ports elsewhere in North America in regions not specifically described in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this
section.
5. Section 402.11 would be revised to read as follows:


402.11 

Volume discount.


(a) A volume rebate shall be granted to a shipper of downbound cargo or to a receiver of upbound cargo at the end of the
1994 navigation season after payment of the full toll specified in the schedule under the tariff in section 402.8 if
shipments of a particular commodity during 1994 exceed by a minimum of 25,000 tons the shipper's or receiver's highest
tonnage for that particular commodity during 1991, 1992, or 1993 in the Seaway. Shippers will be qualified based upon
the particular commodity loaded at their port of origin and receivers will be qualified based on the particular commodity
unloaded at their port of destination. Shippers and receivers located within the Seaway will be qualified based on
the total of their upbound and downbound shipments or receipts of the particular commodity. Should a shipper or receiver
of the same commodity qualify for a volume rebate, the rebate will be divided equally between the shipper and receiver.
(b) Volume rebates shall be granted only with respect to commodities whose shipper and receiver have shipped or received
the subject commodity in the years 1991, 1992, and 1993 and have not been subject of a merger or take-over during 1991,
1992, 1993, or 1994.
(c) The volume rebate shall be equal to a 50 percent reduction of the portion of the composite toll related to charges
per metric ton of cargo paid for the shipments that surpass the shippers or receiver's highest tonnage for that commodity
during 1991, 1992, or 1993. Payment of rebates will be made directly to the qualified shipper or receiver.
(d) The Seaway traffic history describing the shipper's or receiver's tonnage shall be submitted by the shipper or
receiver prior to the end of 1994 and shall be subject to audit by the Authority.
(e) Cargoes having been the subject of a new business discount or an alternate use of bulker discount described in section
402.13 of this Part shall be excluded from the statistics used for calculation of volume rebates.
6. Section 402.13 would be revised to read as follows:


402.13 

Vessels engaged primarily in the bulk trade.


Notwithstanding anything contained in this Tariff, the toll for steel slab, general, or containerized cargo for
any vessel documented under the laws of the United States or registered in Canada in accordance with the laws of Canada
that has been engaged primarily in the bulk trade within the St. Lawrence Seaway/Great Lakes system during the three
navigation seasons immediately preceding the applicable season shall, upon written application to the Authority
or the Corporation prior to the beginning of a Seaway transit, be the toll charged for food grains specified in the schedule
under the Tariff in 402.8 of this part.
7. A new 402.15 would be added to read as follows:


402.15 

Single season discounts or rebate for same shipment.


Notwithstanding anything in the Tariff, a carrier, shipper, or receiver shall obtain during a single navigation
season, with respect to the same shipment, only one of the following three: A new business discount, as described in
402.9; a bulk trade discount, as described in 402.13; or a volume rebate, as described in 402.11.



Issued at Washington, DC on April 25, 1994.
