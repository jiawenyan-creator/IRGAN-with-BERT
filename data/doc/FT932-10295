FT  10 MAY 93 / Output forecast to rise by 3%
MANUFACTURING is poised for a relatively strong recovery with output growth
of about 3 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent next year, Lloyds Bank says
in a report today.
Mr Patrick Foley, the bank's chief economic adviser, says that the surge in
manufacturing growth will be prompted by the boost to competitiveness that
resulted from sterling leaving the European exchange rate mechanism last
year. This cut the price of UK manufactured goods by about 15 per cent
compared with international competitors.
Manufacturing growth has been helped by a reduction in unit labour costs to
very low levels. Mr Foley believes that labour costs in the sector will have
been cut by 21 per cent relative to overseas competitors in the first year
following sterling's exit from the ERM.
Mr Foley says: 'The change restores our price competitiveness to late 1980s
levels when UK industry was gaining share in world markets, partly through
improvements in non-price competitiveness.'
He also believes that substantial spare capacity exists in manufacturing and
that output could grow by an average of 10 per cent across manufacturing
sectors without meeting capacity limits. 'This has important implications
for inflation because it suggests there is considerable scope for output
growth without pressure on prices.'
