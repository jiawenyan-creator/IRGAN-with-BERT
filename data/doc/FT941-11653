FT  03 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No train to Normandy
Sir, Re Michael Thompson-Noel's Hawks &amp; Handsaws column ('Tunnel of sighs',
January 29/30), polar bears might well have strolled from Normandy to Kent
during the last ice age. However, it is highly unlikely that the TGV, en
route to the Channel tunnel, and at any given speed, will ever reach the
Normandy coast.
The French tunnel terminal is at Sangatte, which is in the 'region' of
Nord-Pas de Calais. Readers wishing to stroll or drive directly from Kent to
Normandy should be advised to wait for the next ice age.
