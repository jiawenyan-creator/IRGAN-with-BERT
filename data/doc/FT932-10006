FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Schering may form link with
Hoechst
SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and agro-chemical group,
yesterday confirmed it was holding talks with Hoechst aimed at merging the
two companies' agro-chemicals operations.
A link with Hoechst, one of Germany's big three chemical groups, would give
Schering access to a bigger market and help insulate its agro-chemical
division from further losses.
The company, already in a rationalisation programme, said Hoechst had
'priority' in the negotiations, adding that it had been seeking a partner
for its agro-chemical division for some time.
However, Schering could not yet confirm the nature of the merger. 'Maybe it
might be in the form a joint venture. But it is too early to say. We have
not yet signed a letter of intent. We don't know when the talks will end,' a
spokesman said.
Schering is keen to stem the overall decline in its sales. In the first
quarter of this year, turnover in the agro-chemical division fell by 22 per
cent. Total sales declined by 8 per cent over the same period a year ago.
Hoechst also recorded an overall decline in sales for the first quarter.
Turnover fell by 5 per cent to DM11bn, and pre-tax earnings for the same
period fell by 28 per cent to DM243m.
