A West German track and field coach, who according to West German news reports 
told sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko that his athletes were using drugs, 
denied he had ever discussed the topic with the Canadian athlete. 
Coach Heinz-Jochen Spilker's name was mentioned by Issajenko during her 
testimony in Toronto before a government inquiry into drug use among athletes. 
Issajenko reportedly testified that Spilker had told her in 1984 that West 
German athletes were using testosterone. 
"This is nonsense," Spilker said. "I never discussed this with Angella. My 
conversations with Angella were limited to, 'How are you doing,' and 'Good luck 
in today's race.' "
