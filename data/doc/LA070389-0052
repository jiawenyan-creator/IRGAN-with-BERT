FIREWORKS NOT A DOG'S BEST FRIEND, AUTHORITIES WARN 
Dog owners should be prepared on the Fourth of July for strange or wild 
behavior in their canines, which may panic and try to flee the sounds of 
fireworks, animal control authorities say. 
Dogs have acute hearing and may respond to the sounds in unusual ways, said 
animal control officers, who have reported incidents of spooked dogs jumping 
through screened doors and windows and over walls, or running away and becoming 
lost, according to Sally Hazzard, director of the county's animal control 
department. 
To minimize such responses, pet owners should give their dogs food, water and 
extra attention and confine them to a safe place, officials say. 
They should also make sure their pets are wearing identification tags, 
including a license. If a dog runs away, its owner should contact the animal 
control department, which can use a computer to track the animals, Hazzard 
said. 
The computerized system will be especially valuable to people who find animals 
and report them, she said. 
"We're going to be so busy on Tuesday that we won't be able to pick up all the 
dogs that are found and called in," Hazzard said. "What we hope to do is do the 
reuniting over the phone, by giving the finder the owner's address and phone 
number. That's why a license is your dog's call home." 
Authorities say they expect an additional 100 dogs a day to be brought to the 
county's three shelters Tuesday through Thursday. Some 525 dogs a day normally 
stay at the shelters, Hazzard said. 
On Tuesday, pet owners can call the county's emergency line at 278-9760. After 
that they can call the South Bay shelter at 263-7741, the central shelter in 
San Diego at 236-4250 or the Carlsbad shelter at 438-2312.
