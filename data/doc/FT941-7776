FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Cap &amp; Regional seeks Pounds 25m for
purchase
Capital and Regional Properties, the USM-quoted property investment company,
yesterday announced a rights issue to fund the bulk of a Pounds 33.4m
property acquisition from Throgmorton Trust.
The acquisition was accompanied by the announcement of pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 422,000) for the year to December 25.
The company is buying R Green Properties, which comprises six large mainly
commercial properties in the south of England.
Mr Martin Barber, chairman, said the acquisition 'will bring a substantial
portfolio of properties which provide a range of opportunities to be
exploited'.
The portfolio has a current rental yield of Pounds 2.9m, or 8.7 per cent,
but there is a high vacancy rate in several buildings.
The acquisition is being partly funded by a 1-for-2 rights issue at 173p,
compared with yesterday's closing price of 210p, up 6p. It will raise a net
Pounds 25.3m. The balance will be covered by a new Pounds 10m bank facility.
Capital and Regional's gearing will fall from 72 per cent to 59 per cent,
following the rights issue and acquisition. Mr Barber said he would be happy
to see gearing rise to 100 per cent, given his current confidence in the UK
property market.
During 1993, the company's net assets per share rose from 157.8p to 163.8pm,
as a result of a 16 per cent increase in the value of its UK property
portfolio, and property purchases funded by new equity.
The company also succeeded in floating its joint venture US property
interests on the American Stock Exchange, as CenterPoint. It retains a 22.6
per cent stake.
Net rental and fee income rose 24 per cent to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 6.03m),
reflecting the enlarged portfolio. Earnings per share rose sixfold to 3.04p
(0.41p), and the company is recommending a final dividend of 1p, making a
full year payout of 1.5p (1.1p).
