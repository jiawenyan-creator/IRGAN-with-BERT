Background



This investigation is being instituted as a result of an affirmative preliminary determination by the Department
of Commerce that imports of silicon carbide from the People's Republic of China are being sold in the United States
at less than fair value within the meaning of section 733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The investigation was requested
in a petition filed on June 21, 1993, by counsel for the Ad Hoc Silicon Carbide Coalition.
