FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Arthur Shaw board battle goes to
court
The battle for control of Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands
building materials group quoted on the USM, has moved into the courts.
Mr Gordon Pearson, chairman, told his board that he obtained a High Court
injunction in Birmingham preventing two former directors, Mr Donald Crammond
and Mr Ian Tickler, the ex-chairman, from being re-appointed.
Rebel shareholders have called for an extraordinary meeting to remove Mr
Pearson and replace him with Mr Tickler. They also want Mr Crammond, who was
ousted last August, re-appointed. Shareholders representing 49 per cent of
the equity are said to be supporting the move.
Mr Tickler and his family, which founded Shaw, own 13.4 per cent of the
equity while Mr Pearson holds 15 per cent.
