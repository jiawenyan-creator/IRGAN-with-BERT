ACTION:

 Final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for 12 species of Hawaiian plants: 

Adenophorus periens 

(pendant kihi fern), 

Bonamia menziesii 

(no common name (NCN)), 

Diellia erecta 

(NCN), 

Flueggea neowawraea 

(mehamehame), 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

(ma`o hau hele), 

Mariscus pennatiformis 

(NCN), 

Neraudia sericea 

(ma`aloa), 

Plantago princeps 

(ale), 

Sesbania tomentosa 

(`ohai), 

Solanum incompletum 

(thorny popolo), 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis 

(NCN), and 

Vigna o-wahuensis 

(Oahu vigna). These 12 species are found on 1 or more of the following Hawaiian Islands: Laysan, Necker, Nihoa, Niihau,
Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii. The 12 species and their habitats have been variously affected
or are currently threatened by one or more of the following: habitat degradation and/or predation by wild, feral,
or domestic animals (pigs, goats, deer, cattle); competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by naturalized,
introduced vegetation; habitat loss from fires; human impacts from recreational activities; and insect infestations.
Due to the small number of existing individuals and/or their very narrow distributions, these species and most of
their populations are subject to an increased likelihood of extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic
events. This rule implements the protection provisions provided by the Act for these plant taxa.
