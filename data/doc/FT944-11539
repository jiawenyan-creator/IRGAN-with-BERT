FT  05 NOV 94 / International Company News: Institutions rush for Renault
equity
Institutional investors applied for 15.5 times the number of shares that
have been allocated to them in the partial privatisation of Renault, the
French motor group, the government said yesterday, writes Andrew Jack in
Paris.
Applications closed on Thursday night for the 25m shares earmarked for
institutions at FFr176 a share, and the over-subscription will trigger a
complex system of distribution.
Meanwhile, an intensive advertising campaign aimed at attracting individual
investors has been launched. Private investors have been allocated 60 per
cent of the 62m shares in the group that are being floated, and can buy them
at FFr165 each.
The offer to individuals is open until November 10, after which allocation
will take place in the middle of the month before trading begins.
