FT  11 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Early warning on Alzheimer's
More than a quarter of cases of Alzheimer's disease are thought to be
incorrectly diagnosed. This disease, which inflicts progressive memory loss
on almost one in 10 people aged over 65, can only be definitively identified
by an examination of brain tissue.
US scientists, writing in today's Science, believe they have found a simple
test for Alzheimer's which would allow it to be detected at an early stage.
They found that patients suspected of having the disease were hypersensitive
to the pupil-dilating effects of tropicamide.
The scientists, who work at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, Beth Israel Hospital in Boston and Northwestern
University Medical School in Chicago, found that the tropicamide eye-drops,
which were tested on 58 individuals, were 95 per cent accurate in
identifying the diseased patients.
The scientists believe that the tests could identify sufferers before the
onset of symptoms, when they could benefit the most from potential
treatments.
