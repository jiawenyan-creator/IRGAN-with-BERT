Plunges. Some Public Poll Results"] 
  [Text] According to the results of a poll conducted in 
Armenia by the Center for the Study of Public Opinion of the 
"Association of National Self-Determination" party, as little as 
18.9 percent of the respondents support the policy of President 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Of those polled, 71.8 percent replied in 
the negative. 
  All in all, 17.5 percent would once again vote for Mr. 
Ter-Petrosyan. Incidentally, 52.7 percent of those polled at 
the time of the 1991 presidential elections voted for the 
current president. Hence, his rating has plunged in the past two 
years nearly three-fold. 
  The performance of the government and parliament is approved 
correspondingly by 7.7 and 6.9 percent of those polled. 
  Of interest is the attitude to the Constitution: those for a 
Constitutional Assembly comprised 8.1 percent, those for a 
referendum 21.5 percent, 9.7 percent of those polled are ready 
to entrust this job to the Supreme Soviet, and 20.7 percent were 
undecided on the matter.
