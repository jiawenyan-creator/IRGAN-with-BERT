FT  19 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Golden beaches on computer
FOR travel agents, there can be few quicker ways of persuading clients to
indulge in that special holiday than by showing photographic images of blue
skies and golden beaches on the computer screen in the office. But the
problem for travel agents - and businesses such as art dealers and estate
agents - is being able to get the photograph into the computer.
Canon, the Japanese camera and copier company, has come up with the idea of
using its still video camera for creating and inputting full colour images
into PCs.
With the Ion-PC kit the user takes a series of photos which are stored on a
floppy disc. The camera is then connected to the PC via an interface cable,
and each picture is displayed on the screen, enabling the selection of the
best one. Using the Ion-PC digitiser the image is captured digitally and
stored. Each image has over 400,000 pixels (picture elements).
Canon is working with several software companies, including Aldus, SPC and
Lotus, to allow users to incorporate captured images in their desktop
publishing and other graphics software.
