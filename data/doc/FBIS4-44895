  [Text] The material is a perhydro-polysilazane-based, 
inorganic polymer that, when sintered, becomes silicon nitride 
and silicon oxide ceramics. It is easy to mold and machine the 
ceramics, which can be made into fibers, composites, and coating 
materials. 
<H5>  Properties </H5>
  The product is an inorganic material whose main component is 
perhydro-polysilazane, and it is made in microfine powder and 
liquid. Like organic polymers and resins, the product can be 
molded by itself, coated over, impregnated in and mixed with 
another material. When sintered in an inert atmosphere, the 
product becomes silicon nitride ceramics after pyrolysis at 
200-600C. When sintered in air, it is pyrolyzed at 
400C to form amorphous silicon oxide ceramics. The product 
also forms a transparent, high-quality ceramic thin-film when 
coated over glass or metal, dried and sintered. Also, strong, 
elastic, and heat- and acid-resistant silicon nitride fibers can 
be produced by sintering the product made into fibers. The 
product can be impregnated in carbon fibers, which are sintered 
to form fiber-reinforced ceramics with excellent composite 
effect. The ceramics can be used for heat-resistant structural, 
corrosion-resistant, and friction-resistant materials. By 
sintering a mixture of the product with another ceramic 
material, films 10-100 m thick are produced, with 
drastically 
improved strength and corrosion, heat and heat-shock resistance.
