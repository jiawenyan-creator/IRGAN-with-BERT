FT  23 APR 91 / Brazilian steel group plunges into red
USIMINAS, the steel group due to be one of the first companies to be
privatised in Brazil this year, announced an inflation-adjusted net loss for
last year of NCrz1.5bn, or about Dollars 5.3m at today's unofficial rates.
In 1989, the group registered an inflation-adjusted net profit of NCrz36bn.
Using another accounting method, the group claimed a net profit of
NCrz1.9bn, a result which led Usiminas to claim it was the only steel group
in Brazil last year to record a positive result.
The group blamed recession at home and an overvalued cruzeiro for the feeble
figures. Demand for steel dropped 30 per cent in Brazil last year, dipping
to its lowest level in 13 years. These factors, however, did not exact a
heavy toll on gross receipts, which rose in real terms from NCrz129bn in
1989 to NCrz139bn last year.
A bigger problem seemed to be mounting expenditures on debt service. In
1989, Usiminas earned large amounts of interest on its resources but in
1990, the situation had turned around, and led the group to declare a loss
on operations of NCrz2.1bn.
This loss was despite what the group referred to as a 'rigorous programme to
reduce costs'.
