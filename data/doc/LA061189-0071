RECORD RACK 
NATALIE COLE "Good to Be Back." Capitol *** 1/2: POP STARS ***** Great Balls of 
Fire **** Knockin' On Heaven's Door *** Good Vibrations ** Maybe Baby * Ain't 
That a Shame 
Cole's follow-up to her gold comeback album "Everlasting" incorporates a 
dazzling variety of styles. The songs range from the elegant, theatrical single 
"Miss You Like Crazy" to the spicy, Latin-tinged title song to a jazzy remake 
of the Ink Spots' standard "Someone's Rockin' My Dreamboat." Often when an 
artist tackles such a wide array of styles on an album, the results are 
self-consciously showy. But Cole makes it all seem natural and effortless. She 
can be hot and intense, but is equally convincing when she's cool and 
sophisticated. Her purity and control bring out all of the beauty of the two 
Michael Masser ballads, but she can turn right around and be sassy and playful, 
as on the relaxed, finger-popping "As a Matter of Fact." In the credits, Cole 
thanks her "rainbow coalition" of seven producers, each of whom specializes in 
a different style of music. The ultimate credit, however, belongs to Cole for 
holding it together. PAUL GREIN
