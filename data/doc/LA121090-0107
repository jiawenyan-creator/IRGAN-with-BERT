ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; 
YOUTH, MAN HELD IN HOLDUP, THEFT 
A teen-ager accused of holding up a Cypress woman at gunpoint outside a local 
supermarket was being held Sunday after a countywide bulletin for the woman's 
stolen car turned up the vehicle and led to the arrest of the youth and a man, 
police said. 
The woman, a 56-year-old Cypress resident, was held up in the parking lot of 
the Albertson's supermarket at Ball Road and Valley View Street. 
"The suspect produced a handgun and demanded the keys to her car," said Cypress 
police dispatcher Terry Berecochea. "He also demanded her purse, which she 
surrendered after a brief struggle. The suspect then fled the area in the 
victim's car." 
After interviewing the woman, Cypress police broadcast a bulletin describing 
her vehicle. Fullerton police spotted the car about an hour later on Harbor 
Boulevard near the Riverside Freeway. Two people were inside, and both were 
arrested. 
One, a 15-year-old Compton boy, was booked on suspicion of robbery for 
allegedly holding up the woman in the parking lot. The other, identified as 
Manjit Singh, 25, of Anaheim, was arrested on suspicion of possessing stolen 
property -- the victim's car.
