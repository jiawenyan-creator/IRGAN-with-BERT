CLIPPERS, SCHULER MEET FOR 7 HOURS, BUT NO DECISION 
No decisions were made after Clipper officials met with Mike Schuler for 
approximately seven hours Wednesday about the team's vacant coaching position, 
but General Manager Elgin Baylor said he expected the matter to be resolved 
soon. 
"I had a long conversation with Mike and the owner (Donald T. Sterling)," 
Baylor said. "It went very well, but nothing was decided. 
"But I will tell you this. A decision will be made no later than next week." 
Don Casey, the interim coach since Jan. 19, and Schuler, who spent 2 1/2 
seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers before being fired Feb. 18, are the 
only candidates to be interviewed. No further meetings with Schuler have been 
planned. 
Schuler, who finished the 1988-89 season as a scout with the Golden State 
Warriors, returned to his Bay Area home Wednesday night and could not be 
reached for comment. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER
