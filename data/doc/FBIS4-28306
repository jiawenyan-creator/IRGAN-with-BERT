<F P=106> ["Questions of Enhancing Position and Role of Non-Aligned </F>
Movement Discussed" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- A series of questions of 
enhancing the position and role of the Non-Aligned Movement 
(NAM) to cope with the changed world situation were discussed at 
the non- aligned foreign ministers' conference held in Cairo, 
according to a report. 
  Speaking at the conference, Vice-premier and Foreign 
Minister 
Kim Yong-nam who was heading the DPRK delegation said that a 
great change took place in the world situation but the 
principles of independence, right to self-determination, 
non-alignment, preservation of world peace, disarmament and an 
establishment of a new international economic order which have 
been maintained by the nam, an important rostrum representing 
the interests of the developing countries, still have viability. 
  As long as there remain domination and interference, 
aggression and plunder on the globe, this movement must not only 
exist but also be strengthened as the leading force for the 
building of an independent, peaceful new world, he stressed. 
  Rejecting any attempt to change or weaken the fundamental 
idea and principles of NAM and its political character, he said 
what is important in strengthening this movement at present is 
to achieve unity and solidarity, while maintaining its basic 
idea and principles. 
  The final document adopted at the conference expressed 
concern over the fact that the Korean peninsula remains divided 
in spite of the desire and aspiration of the Korean people, and 
reaffirmed support to the Korean people's struggle to achieve 
the reunification of the country on the basis of the principles 
laid down in the North-South joint statement of July 4, 1972 and 
the agreement effectuated in February 1992. 
  Noting that to guarantee a durable peace and security on the 
Korean peninsula is not only a common desire of the Korean 
people but also an important matter related to the peace and 
security in Asia and the rest of the world, the document 
expressed the hope that the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula assuming political and military nature would be 
settled in a peaceful way through dialogue and negotiation 
between the parties concerned, DPRK-U.S. talks in particular. 
It took notice of the need of continuous cooperation with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.
