  [Text] Vladivostok June 2 TASS -- "Only outright 
ill-wishers, who have no sense of patriotism, can relish the 
current temporary setbacks of the Russian Navy," First Assistant 
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral Igor Kasatonov, 
who is currently visiting the maritime territory of the Russian 
Far East, told ITAR-TASS. 
  The admiral has spent two weeks visiting Navy garrisons, 
ammunition depots and storages. "Yes," the admiral said, "there 
are some shortcomings and blunders, but order is being restored 
with an iron hand. Many problems could be resolved if our 
efforts were backed by normal financing." 
  Touching on the efforts to do away with the consequences of 
the latest explosion of a naval aviation depot, the admiral 
noted that seven sapper teams, an obstacle clearing team, six 
military vehicles, including engineering machinery, are now 
working in the state of emergency zone. As many as 32.4 square 
kilometres of territory have already been checked. More than 
900 shells and bombs were discovered. About 200 of them were 
blown up. 
  "In spite of all the bitter setbacks," Kasatonov believes, 
"the Russian Pacific Fleet is still a solid and strong 
organisational entity and it will surely remain a guarantor of 
the safety of Russian sea borders in the Pacific Ocean."
