  [Text] Kiev April 19 TASS -- The safety system switched on 
in the third power unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, 
Ukraine, during Monday's increase of the unit capacity after the 
planned repairs. 
  A reason for this was the lowered water level in 
hydroballoons of the reactor's emergency cooling system. The 
accident is estimated as the first level (the international 
scale) and does not endanger the plant's personnel or safe 
operation of the facility.
