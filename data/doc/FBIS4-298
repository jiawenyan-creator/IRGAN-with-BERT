  [Excerpts] A new tragic event has united two countries at 
the heart of Africa: Rwanda and Burundi. [passage omitted] 
  In the minutes following the attack, the UN Security Council 
appealed for calm. Politicians in Rwanda and Burundi did the 
same. It appears that people are keeping quiet in the capital 
of Burundi. However, gunfire was heard last night in Rwanda. 
Clashes apparently broke out this morning near the presidential 
palace. But one must be careful. There is conflicting news: 
some sources mention fighting, some others just sporadic 
incidents. Colonel (Marchal) is the head of the UN force in the 
Rwandan capital. We talked to him this morning. 
  [Begin (Marchal) recording] Last night everything was quiet 
until dawn. In the last 30 minutes or so, tension has been 
quite clearly growing. There is no fighting in town, but people 
are shooting in many places, mainly from military camps and from 
the barracks of the gendarmerie. There are no clashes between 
different parties or factions. As for ordinary people, there is 
nothing much to say. There are no demonstrations. There is 
nobody in the streets. (?We) are trying to keep the situation 
under control with the help of gendarmerie units. [end recording] 
  This interview with Colonel (Marchal) was recorded at about 
0700 hours [local time] this morning. Things might have changed 
since then.
