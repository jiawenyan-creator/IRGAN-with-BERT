  [Text] Fukuoka, May 18 KYODO -- Police arrested 75 out of 
the 139 people who were found at a warehouse in southern Japan 
on Wednesday [18 May] on suspicion of illegally entering Japan. 
The group included one Japanese and the rest appear to be all 
Chinese, police said. 
  Police found the group of 139 people, including 15 women, 
when about 100 officers raided the warehouse at Hakata port in 
Fukuoka after receiving a report from a citizen who suspected 
there was a group of foreigners in the building. 
  Two simple toilets had been built in the warehouse, which 
was 
leased to a man who reportedly described himself as an 
"importer." Answering a reporter's question in Chinese, one of 
the group said, "We have come to find jobs in Japan. We are 
victims." 
  Earlier in the day, police arrested a 20-year-old Chinese 
woman in the city on suspicion of having illegally entered 
Japan. Police searched around Hakata port after the woman said 
she has come to Japan with some 150 Chinese nationals. The 
woman, who did not carry a passport, said she left China at the 
end of April in a group of 150 Chinese. 
  A Chinese broker has told her that she could earn 300,000 
yen 
a month in Japan, she said. They twice changed ships at sea and 
were put on a Japanese fishing boat before arriving in Japan on 
Wednesday, according to her account. She said they missed the 
cars that were supposed to meet them, and did not know where 
they were.
