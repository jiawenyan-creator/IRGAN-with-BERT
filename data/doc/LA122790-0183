ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 
GIRL SCOUT COUNCIL TO GET NEW CENTER 
A spacious new program center for the Girl Scout Council of Orange County will 
be built on the site of a structure that was burned beyond use in a fire a year 
and a half ago. 
Last week, city and scouting officials joined in the groundbreaking for the new 
structure, which will provide meeting and event space for area troops. 
"We are finding it more and more difficult to find a place to meet," said Diane 
Smith, publicity director for the Girl Scout Council. "As sorry as we are that 
the building burned down, it gives us an opportunity to redo it with conference 
rooms and space we really need." 
Smith estimates there are about 22,000 Girl Scouts in the county, and about 
seven troops -- or just more than 100 girls -- will be able to use the new 
facility and remaining swimming pool for meetings and programs. 
Since the building was destroyed in June, 1989, there has been no North County 
facility for the organization. Construction of the new 4,000-square-foot 
building on Broadway in Anaheim is under way, and is expected to take six 
months to complete. LISA MASCARO
