FT  23 SEP 94 / Opposition wins Mexican city
Mexico's centre-right opposition is set to govern the industrial city of
Monterrey after an electoral court annulled votes from over 40 of the city's
polling stations in last August's election. The reversal of the
Institutional Revolutionary party's initial victory in Monterrey follows the
opposition's claims that the ruling party's vote in parts of the city had
been boosted by ballot-rigging. The capital of the northern state of Nuevo
Leon and home to many of the country's best known companies, Monterrey will
become the largest city ever in Mexico to be run by the National Action
party (PAN) opposition.
Federal electoral tribunals also annulled votes in a few polling stations in
other parts of the country, but the move is not expected to affect the
result of last August's election, in which the ruling party won a
comfortable victory in the presidential and congressional races. The
tribunal's move should improve relations between the government and the
centre-right opposition, and may increase the chances of a successful
outcome to imminent talks between the main political parties on political
reform. The centre-right PAN had made the election in Monterrey a test case
of the PRI's commitment to run free elections.
