FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Harmony announces Pounds 2m rights and
property move
THE NEW board at Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurant group,
yesterday announced a 'radical change in strategy' and a refinancing
involving a Pounds 1.8m rights issue and acquisition of two property
companies.
The acquisitions create a property investment and dealing division, which
Harmony intends to expand through further acquisitions.
Meanwhile, it will act to bring the leisure division back into profit.
Harmony is buying Hoe Properties from Mr Lewis Davis, a Harmony director,
for Pounds 439,000, and Kewbrook Investments from Mr John Main, the current
chairman, for Pounds 204,000. The deals involve the issue of 12.9m shares.
Yesterday Harmony said it was likely to incur significant pre-tax losses for
the full year to March 31. Last time Harmony lost Pounds 3.68m before tax.
The 3-for-2 rights issue at 5p is fully underwritten by Guiness Mahon.
