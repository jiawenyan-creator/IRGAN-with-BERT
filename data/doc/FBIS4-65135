  [Text] The House of Representatives interparty delegation 
led by House President Alexis Galanos returned to Cyprus late 
last night from an official visit to Israel. Galanos described 
the visit as positive, and added that Cyprus' relations with 
Israel have strengthened. He noted, however, that Israel 
considers Turkey to be a good friend and ally with which it also 
maintains good relations. 
  Galanos said: The delegation established that the Israeli 
side is not well informed about the Cyprus issue, and that there 
is almost a complete lack of awareness on many levels. He 
added: This is because there was no Cyprus Embassy in Israel for 
many years.
