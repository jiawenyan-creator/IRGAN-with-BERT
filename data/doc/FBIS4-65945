  [Text] "The rise in extraparliamentary right- and left-wing 
extremism is not alarming, but is giving cause for concern." 
These were the words of Chief of Police Vincenzo Parisi, 
speaking during a news conference given by Interior Minister 
Roberto Maroni. 
  "The largest grouping," he stressed, "comes from the fringes 
of the extreme left, particularly from the autonomous workers as 
well as other organizations. These groupings have 12,114 
members (included in census returns) who are spread throughout 
570 offices. The extreme right wing has a few hundred members, 
divided into three main branches, some of whom are quarrelsome 
and violent."
