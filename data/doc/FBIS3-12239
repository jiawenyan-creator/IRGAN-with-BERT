  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat has expressed his sadness on France-2 
TV. He does not wish to express himself categorically on the 
continuation of negotiations. The interview was carried out 
exclusively by our special envoy to Tunis, Michel Montponte: 
  [Begin recording] [Montponte] It was in the middle of the 
night, as he usually does, that the PLO chairman received us in 
one of his several and discrete residences of Tunis. Looking 
clearly very hurt by the events of Hebron, his tone was grave 
and categorical; he looked more tired than usual: 
  ['Arafat] This is not one man. I am speaking as an expert. 
No man can single-handedly kill 65 people and injure 256. No 
one can do that. There is no Rambo. There were more than 10. 
  [Montponte] Mr. Chairman, do you think that today's 
incidents 
signal the breakdown of the peace process with the Israelis? 
  ['Arafat] The whole process has already lost credibility and 
even more following this massacre. This massacre is a 
conspiracy by the settlers and the Army. 
  [Montponte] Do you think violence will resume? 
  ['Arafat] Definitely. This will backfire and nobody can 
imagine the extent. 
  [Montponte] Do you personally trust Israeli justice to 
understand and find out what really happened? 
  ['Arafat] I prefer to wait and see. [end recording]
