FT  20 DEC 93 / Latin American cash flows slow
Capital inflows into Latin America slowed slightly this year but remain
significantly higher than at the beginning of the decade, the United Nations
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said yesterday.
According to the Santiago-based organisation, net capital inflows fell to
Dollars 54.6bn (Pounds 36.6bn) this year from Dollars 62.0bn in 1992, but
compared with Dollars 39.3bn in 1991. The net transfer of capital to the
region - which also takes account of interest and dividend payments abroad -
slipped below Dollars 26bn this year from Dollars 33bn last year.
The main beneficiaries were Mexico, where net inflows rose slightly to
Dollars 25.1bn from Dollars 24.7bn, and Argentina, where inflows dropped to
Dollars 10bn from Dollars 12.9bn. Inflows into Brazil dropped sharply to
Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 8.8bn and into Venezuela to Dollars 1.32bn from
Dollars 2.33bn. Capital inflows fell slightly into Chile to Dollars 2.89bn
and into Peru to Dollars 2.86bn. Flows into Colombia rose from Dollars 167m
to Dollars 1.52bn.
The commission said capital continued to come from non-bank private sources,
noting that bond issues from the region reached Dollars 19.3bn this year.
Foreign direct investment was maintained at 'very high levels'. However, the
difference between interest rates in the US and in Latin America remained an
important factor in encouraging capital.
The capital inflows - along with fiscal balance, more stable prices and
growth - offered a virtuous circle which would generate confidence in the
permanence of economic policy, said Mr Gert Rosenthal, the head of the
commission. But he said worries remained about the size of the region's
current account deficit, up to Dollars 42.6bn this year from Dollars 36.9bn
in 1992.
Its preliminary assessment of the state of the Latin American economy showed
a continuation for the third successive year of moderate economic expansion:
3.2 per cent, implying per capita growth of 1.3 per cent. However, if Brazil
is excluded, regional growth dropped to 2.6 per cent from about 5 per cent
in 1992.
