FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Improved OGC helps Fairhaven to Dollars
7.1m
The continuing success of its Aberdeen oil services activities helped OGC
International, the main asset of Fairhaven International, to increase
pre-tax profits by 9.5 per cent from Pounds 5.33m to Pounds 5.83m in the
first half of 1994.
Its Bermuda-registered parent, in which Fred Olsen has a 37.28 per cent
holding, reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 7.1m (Pounds 4.58m). The
previous interim profit of Dollars 37.4m was inflated by the Dollars 30m
proceeds from the flotation of 40 per cent of OGC.
Mr Richard Wilson, OGC chairman, said yesterday that the joint venture of
AOC International, its main operating subsidiary, Brown &amp; Root had added a
further two contracts.
Sales rose 18 per cent to Pounds 114.1m (Pounds 97.1m) at OGC. The
Australian subsidiary, full ownership of which was acquired in December,
contributed Pounds 10.8m of the growth. An interim dividend of 1.8375p has
been declared, from earnings per share of 6.10p (5.69p).
Fairhaven said the impact of the improved performance by OGC was offset by a
less favourable result at Belmont Constructors Inc. Group turnover of
Dollars 237.2m (Dollars 207m)included Dollars 66m (Dollars 60.5m) from
Belmont, reflecting increased activity in the industrial sectors which the
subsidiary serves, as well as a new marketing team.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.5 cents on earnings of 0.88 cents
(13.85 cents).
