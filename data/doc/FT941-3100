FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Klockner sees return to the
black
Klockner-Werke, once the weakest link in the German steel industry, expects
to be back in the black this year, having disposed of most of its steel
interests, and written off much of its steel-related debt burden.
The company has been transformed into an internationally-diversified
plastics and engineering group, with a residual interest in the Bremen-based
Klockner Steel integrated plant, Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, the chief
executive, said yesterday.
In spite of a drastic restructuring programme, launched last year as part of
the 'composition proceedings' - the last step before bankruptcy under German
financial law - Klockner Werke still suffered a loss of DM376m in its
1992/93 financial year, of which DM361m (Dollars 213m) was directly
attributable to the steel operations.
The company is awaiting a final decision in early April by Sidmar, the
Belgian steel-making subsidiary of the Arbed group, on whether it will take
a 25 per cent stake in the Bremen steel plant. If the deal goes ahead,
Klockner's own stake will drop to 25 per cent and management of the plant
will be transferred to Sidmar.
Mr von Rohr said that the Bremen plant would be making a profit in 1994,
thanks to the restructuring measures.
