  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen said that enactment of a law by the 
National People's Congress (NPC) is to better protect investment 
in the mainland by Taiwan compatriots and promote economic 
cooperation between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. 
  In response to a question at a news conference here today, 
Qian said the "Investment Protection Law for Taiwan Compatriots" 
to be enacted by the NPC is "more comprehensive and 
authoritative" than what he called "the 22 regulations" 
previously formulated by mainland authorities concerning 
investment in the mainland by Taiwan compatriots. 
  On the possibility of the signing of an agreement on 
investment protection by non-governmental organizations from 
both sides of the Taiwan Straits, Qian said he cannot rule out 
such a possibility from a long-term of view. 
  "But, at present," he said, "conditions are not ripe since 
there aren't two-way exchanges between the two sides."
