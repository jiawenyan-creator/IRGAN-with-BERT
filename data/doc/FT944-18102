One of the most intriguing of all historical mysteries concerns the violent
fall of the Romanov dynasty. Tsar Nicholas II, his wife and their five
children were all allegedly shot to death by Bolsheviks in 1918; yet rumours
that the Tsar's youngest daughter, Anastasia, survived the massacre have
continued to circulate. Equinox (9.00, Channel 4) investigates the riddle,
and unearths new evidence on the claim of an American woman, Anna Anderson,
to be the last of the Romanovs.
The Chinese film director Zhang Yimou has acquired a sizeable following in
the West; now that no-one worries about the cult of the personality any
more, it is fitting that he should be the focus of a documentary profile.
Big Fish in China, (11.00, Channel 4 ) concentrates on his remarkable work
and his relationship with his leading lady and real-life partner Gong Li.
Aficionados of the dreadful comedy follow-up movie will find appalling jokes
and contrived resolutions aplenty in tonight's main films: Any Which Way You
Can (7.00, BBC1) and Cannonball Run II (Carlton, 8.00).
