ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
RESIDENTS PLAGUED BY POWER FAILURES 
A four-day series of power failures affecting more than 4,000 area households 
continued early Tuesday with a six-hour outage caused by faulty cables in one 
of the city's main electrical circuits, a power company spokesman said. 
An outage from 2:30 to 8:30 a.m. Tuesday was not related to strong winds that 
hit the county and blew down overhead power lines Tuesday afternoon in San Juan 
Capistrano, said Fred Vaughn, spokesman for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
The morning incident was caused by ongoing cable failures that also triggered 
outages Sunday and Monday, Vaughn said. 
On Sunday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2,400 customers in south and central San Juan 
Capistrano lost power because of a combination of a cable failure and a bird 
flying into a power line. An electrical short in the same circuit at 7:30 p.m. 
Sunday left some homes without power until 11 a.m. Monday, Vaughn said. 
A Saturday power failure from 8:30 to 11 a.m., affecting 1,800 homes in east 
San Juan Capistrano, was caused by a bird tangled in a wire, Vaughn said.
