FT  19 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies
The Bundesbank duly delivered a discount rate cut, but in a grudging way
that leaves the French franc exposed. Although the Lombard rate is merely
symbolic when the trend in rates is down, the bank's reluctance to cut it
suggests a gradual approach to relaxation. That will limit France's room for
manoeuvre just as its need for lower interest rates is becoming urgent.
By contrast, sterling is a beneficiary. The interest rate differential
between the UK and Germany has narrowed at a time when the prospect for a
base rate cut is receding. Yesterday's fall in unemployment was too good to
signal a trend. But after the positive data on retail sales and
manufacturing output, there are fewer excuses for cutting base rates. The
equity market may be mildly disappointed: the resulting strength of sterling
looks helpful to gilts.
