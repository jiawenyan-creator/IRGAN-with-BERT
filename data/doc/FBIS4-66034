  [Text] Turkey recently launched a defamatory campaign 
against Greece, accusing it of training persons who carry out 
terrorist attacks in its territory. 
  This was stated by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos 
Bikas today in response to a question on the recent charges by 
Turkey against our country. It is obvious, the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman added, that these charges are totally unfounded 
because they do not contribute to the normalization of relations 
between the two countries. Bikas concluded that Greece desires 
the normalization of relations between the two countries, which 
depends on Turkey's stance on the Cyprus issue, the respect of 
our sovereign rights in the Aegean and, of course, no more 
unfounded charges against our country. 
  An ASSOCIATED PRESS dispatch relayed today from Ismir said 
that police arrested 17 Kurdish rebels who, it said, were 
trained in Greece. In addition, the Turkish Coast Guard 
confiscated three boats with explosives and ammunition.
