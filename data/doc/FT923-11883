FT  22 JUL 92 / Doubts over two Yorkshire pits
THE future of two Yorkshire coal mines employing a total of about 1,800 men
is uncertain, British Coal said yesterday.
Kellingley, once known as 'the big K', will have to make substantial
manpower cuts if it is to survive, British Coal said.
Sharlston, a smaller pit also in the Selby group of mines in North
Yorkshire, is in a 'very serious' situation and must be closely monitored.
The news came at a quarterly meeting to review British Coal's Selby group.
Mr Alan Houghton, the group's director, said the group's other six pits were
performing well.
The Kellingley cuts are part of a strategy to turn the pit round. It lost
Pounds 2.6m in the first quarter, placing it among the 10 costliest pits in
Britain.
Kellingley, which employs 1,080 miners and is one of British Coal's largest
pits, has an output per man-shift of just under 6 tonnes, compared with an
average 10.21 for the Selby group as a whole.
Poor performance resulted mainly from new coal faces not being developed
quickly enough to maintain output, according to British Coal. The company
did not disclose its new strategy for the mines, or state how many job cuts
it might involve.
British Coal said, however, that there was no suggestion at this stage that
Kellingley would face the company's review procedure, which normally
precedes closure.
Mr Houghton said Sharlston colliery had turned in a disappointing
performance. Its main difficulty had been selling its poor-quality coal to
the electricity generators, British Coal's main customer. Instead, coal is
being stockpiled on site.
British Coal said that Sharlston, which employs nearly 700 men, was still
breaking even, but it would become a loss-maker if it could not sell its
coal.
Union representatives are relieved that the pits are not threatened with
immediate closure. But Mr Ken Capstick, vice-chairman of the Yorkshire
branch of the NUM, the miners' union, said the job losses would be
disastrous.
