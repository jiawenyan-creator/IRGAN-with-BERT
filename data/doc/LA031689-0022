OVERPOPULATION 
Newspapers give us history in small daily doses nearly as ephemeral as the 
spoken news on radio and TV, but it is printed news and can be assembled into a 
kind of graph showing trends in the fears and interests of readers over time. 
News stories change as we change. 
The news we read today is filled with new things; the many kinds of 
environmental pollution, mass starvation, and the formation of a permanent 
world population of refugees and homeless people. Even if you and I escape 
industrial poisoning for the moment and don't have to step around bloated 
bellies, we are beginning to realize that no place on Earth is safe forever in 
our highly interconnected modern world. 
This is not the kind of news we used to read, for today there is a missing 
ingredient, the sense of hope for improvement that went with bad news even 
during the Great Depression. 
Something else is missing from the hail of disaster stories that now pelt 
readers; a recognition of the underlying, basic cause of shattered societies 
and poisoned air: overpopulation. 
We are twice as numerous in the world today as when I was 60 years younger and 
it is this fact, numbers alone, that we must talk about, read about in 
newspapers, and finally do something about. Survival and population control and 
international action will fill tomorrow's newspapers.
