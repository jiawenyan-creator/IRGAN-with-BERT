  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Environment Minister 
Frantisek Benda rejected the possibility that the Temelin 
nuclear power station could be brought into operation before an 
"atomic law" is adopted. 
  "I still consider the preparation of an atomic law to be a 
condition for the licensing process for the Temelin power plant 
to be initiated," he said on the Nova television station. 
  Nova claimed information given by the State Office for 
Atomic 
Safety (SUJB) in a government hearing cast doubt on the date the 
south Bohemian plant is due to be brought into operation. That 
report "confirms the caution I have been trying to push for with 
regard to the total nuclear energy programme," Benda said. 
  If no atomic law existed he would oppose the operation of 
Temelin, he said. 
  The process of loading fuel into Temelin's reactors is 
scheduled to begin at the end of 1994 and by mid 1995 the first 
reactor should be working at full performance. The second 
reactor should be brought on line in 1996. The completed plant 
is expected to produce 2,000 MW.
