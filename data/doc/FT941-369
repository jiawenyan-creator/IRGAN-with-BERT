FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson rises 17%
Tough trading conditions in the London insurance market held back profits
growth at Lloyd Thompson, the highly rated insurance broker.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 amounted to Pounds 9.6m,
an increase of 17 per cent over the corresponding period of 1992. The
interim dividend was increased by 20 per cent to 2.4p.
Brokerage income rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 20.2m. But all the increase
was due to the strength of the US dollar - Lloyd Thompson achieved an
average exchange rate of Dollars 1.57 against Dollars 1.71 last year - and
on an underlying basis brokerage volume was down by 5 per cent.
Reinsurance income fell by 14 per cent to Pounds 5.8m, compared with Pounds
6.8m last year. The decline was partially offset by increases in marine (up
by 11 per cent) and non-marine business (up 12 per cent).
Investment income increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 3.5m. Expenses were
reduced by 4 per cent to Pounds 14.1m 'by means of a continuing review of
costs and the search for more efficient methods of working.'
Staff numbers were reduced by 4 per cent over the corresponding period last
year.
