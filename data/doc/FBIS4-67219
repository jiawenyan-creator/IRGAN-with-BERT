  [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- The Cologne drug squad has busted 
a ring of Kurdish heroin dealers. As the police reported on 
Tuesday, 20 members of three extended Kurdish families who had 
carried out nationwide heroin deals in the area of Cologne, 
Bruehl, and Erftkreis were arrested. Now and then, profits from 
the drug deals were paid to the meanwhile banned Workers Party 
of Kurdistan, PKK, it was stated. Several kilograms of heroin 
were seized during the arrests. Investigations against another 
25 family members are still being conducted. 
  A family that, as the police assume, has lived exclusively 
on 
drug deals, is said to have sold about 40 kg of heroin since 
last summer. 
  According to the police, many young people, including 
13-year-old boys, were among the arrested persons of all age 
groups. It had been the strategy of the gang to send 
adolescents from eastern Turkey to Germany and to use them as 
couriers there, since they would have expected more lenient 
sentences in the event of their arrest.
