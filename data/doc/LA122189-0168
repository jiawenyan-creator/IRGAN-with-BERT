METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN HURT, PET PYTHON KILLED IN APARTMENT 
FIRE 
Fire that possibly started in a Christmas tree swept through a Long Beach 
apartment, critically injuring a sleeping resident and killing one of her two 
pet pythons, authorities said Wednesday. 
Lorraine Lee, 24, was in critical but stable condition at Long Beach Memorial 
Hospital with second- and third-degree burns over 30% of her arms and torso, 
Fire Department spokesman Bob Caldon said. 
Lee, who was asleep when the fire broke out about 11:25 p.m. Tuesday, also 
suffered a deep cut on her left arm when she jumped out a window to escape the 
flames, Caldon said. 
Caldon said the fire probably started accidentally, possibly in the Christmas 
tree. Firefighters rescued one of the two pet pythons, taking it to a local 
animal shelter for treatment of injuries. A second snake died.
