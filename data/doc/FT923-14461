FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (7) - Thriving bit of living
history / Historic creek / Wooden dhows still moor seven or eight abreast
along the quay but modern development has radically changed the landscape.
And a new facelift is under way
The best bit of living history in Dubai is its creek, where neither the
shape of the wooden dhows, nor their profitable trade, have changed much
since 800 settlers, led by the the Maktoum family, deserted Abu Dhabi to set
up shop on its shores more than 160 years ago.
Only the contents of the galleon-hulled boats, and the replacement of sails
by diesel engines, mark the tides of time. Stacked boxes of Sony TVs,
Zanussi fridges or plastic-wrapped Japanese car tyres along the quay are
recent additions to hand-written cargo manifests which still include the
bags of rice and spices which have always found their way from Dubai's port
to Iran, Pakistan, India and beyond.
While locals are keen to point out that little arrives illicitly in Dubai -
customs officials say illegal drug imports are minor and hotly pursued by
the police - it is still a thriving source of smuggling into Iran, India and
Pakistan. 'We pay no taxes to work here,' says one Indian shipper. 'But we
use the money we save to pay the Iranian police.'
The creek was also once among the world's biggest gold trading centres,
mostly supplying gold to India. At its peak in the late 1960s, Dubai was
importing 280 tons of gold for re-export, a figure down to just over 100
tons these days.
Dubai's creek curls further inland than any other in the emirates, and has
traditionally been the coast's busiest and most cosmopolitan. The earliest
settlers lived on the western spit of Shindaghah, now essentially part of
Port Rashid, Dubai's man-made port, but by the late nineteenth century, a
large Indian community had settled on the western Dubai side of the creek,
with Arabs and Persians principally on the eastern Deira shore.
By the late 1800s Dubai was already the busiest trading port among the
Trucial States, named after their treaty agreement with colonial Britain,
and among the busiest pearling centres, a trade worth around Pounds 1.5m a
year to the region at the turn of the century, before the advent of the
Japanese cultured pearl killed the industry in the late 1920s.
But trade, notably dhow trade smuggling sugar, tea, cloth and gold into
Persian and Indian ports, flourished. By 1951, Gray &amp; Mackenzie, the British
shippers, built Dubai's first port crane, which still stands near the
ruler's office, where all cargo was unloaded.
The first road bridge over the creek, the Maktoum Bridge which is soon to be
replaced with a newer eight-lane cousin, was opened in only 1963, before
which passengers between Dubai and Deira had either to drive around the
creek to the north, or cross on the small wooden abra vessels (water taxis)
which still dissect the dhows' paths today.
By the mid 1960s Dubai's creek was full to bursting with dhows and steamers,
and the arrival of pioneering oil construction companies such as McDermott
to Dubai, so clogged the emirate's main artery that Sheikh Rashid, the
father of the present ruler, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al Maktoum, decreed
the building of Port Rashid, adjacent to the creek and still Dubai's busiest
port.
With the later addition of Jebel Ali port in 1979, the creek's contribution
to Dubai's trade has diminished considerably to around half a per cent of
the total tonnage landed yearly in Dubai. But it thrives about its own
business as ever, with dhows lining the length of the eastern shore moored
three, four, or even seven or eight abreast - congestion which a new marina
to be built over the next year or so is designed to clear.
The quay is busiest at dusk, as steel-shouldered crew load the wooden dhows,
bhoums and launches - which, old as they appear, have for the most part been
built recently - with bundles, boxes and, in some cases, and with the
minimum of mechanical assistance, small cars, ready for the two-day journey
to Kish Island or Bandar Abbas in Iran, or on to Karachi in Pakistan.
Most of the boats are chartered by local shippers. One, typically, was
loaded with 700 Sony TVs bound for Kish Island in Iran, a trip for which a
local electronics distributor had paid Dh7,000, having unloaded the Sonys
from Port Rashid for re-export.
Most of the Iranian, Indian, Pakistani or Sri Lankan crewmen live very
simply on board their boats, beneath the flat sunshade canopies at the rear,
housing a few basic mattresses and perhaps a small barbecue or the
occasional hubble-bubble pipe.
Today, the creek where Wilfred Thesiger, the great British Arabist explorer
of the 1940s, watched as 'naked children romped in the shallows, and rowing
boats patrolled the creek to pick up passengers from the mouths of alleys,
between high coral houses, surmounted with square wind-turrets' is lined on
the east by a motley collection of bold and modernistic high-rises and
retains its romance only at quay side.
Gone too is the British Bank of the Middle East's 'very special lavatory'
remembered by Edward Henderson, the Iraq Petroleum Company's representative
in Dubai in the late 1940s.
This, he recalls, 'was really no more than a platform sticking out over the
water, with the essential slit in its middle, tastefully boxed in and
screened from view with palm branches'.
But changed as it is, the creek is in for a further facelift. A grassy
18-hole golf course on the north-eastern side of the creek, Dubai's second,
is already almost complete, and a further illuminated nine hole course and
yacht club will follow.
On the west bank, earth is already being moved to create what will become
Dubai's biggest and greenest park while at the end of the creek, near where
a shallow lagoon has become a temporary home to hundreds of flamingos, the
occasional osprey, reef herons and countless plovers and shanks, is planned
a theme park.
'The old creek is coming under a lot of developmental pressure,' remarks Mr
Lawrence Mills of the Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotions Board.
Thesiger, contemplating the creek more than 50 years ago, reflected that
'here life moved in time with the past', adding, regretful of his
distinguishing European garb, that 'I myself felt that I was little better
than a tourist'.
How times have changed.
