  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has ordered the 
implementation of a special mechanism to give aid to Mexican 
community victims of the earthquake in Los Angeles, California. 
The Foreign Relations Secretariat -- through the Mexican 
Consulates in Los Angeles, San Diego, Oxnard, Santa Ana, and San 
Bernardino -- is assessing aid needs. Contacts have also been 
made with Mexican-American leaders to study how greater support 
can be given to Mexican victims of the earthquake; that is, 
those who reside in that part of the United States.
