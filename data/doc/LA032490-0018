TV'S 'FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS': IS IT DISGUISED CHILD ABUSE? 
My, but isn't Mr. Rosenberg righteously upset over children being "injured" on 
"Funniest Home Videos." 
Never mind that there are thousands of incidents of murder and other violent 
crimes, child abuse and abandonment, portrayed on television each year. 
Now along comes genuine slices of life in "Funniest Videos," and Rosenberg 
rises up to censure it on humanitarian grounds. 
"Normal" TV and movies are far more destructive in their indoctrination than a 
few home videos.
