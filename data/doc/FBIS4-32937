  [Text] On 31 May, Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of Science, 
Technology, and the Environment, arrived in Colombia to attend a 
scientific conference preceding the Ibero-American Summit in 
Cartagena de Indias. The scientific conference is on sustainable 
financing for research and technological development of 
Ibero-America. 
  [Begin recording] [Simeon] In this scientific conference, 
other Latin American nations have asked us to report on the 
Cuban experience in science and technology development, which is 
a reality today. Our Latin American colleagues have asked us to 
report on how Cuba attained this scientific development in such 
a short period. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are all the science and technology 
ministers of Ibero-America going to participate in this 
conference? 
  [Simeon] Yes, although not every Latin American country has 
such ministries per se, but the presidents of the Science and 
Technology Councils of the Ibero-American countries will be in 
attendance. 
  [Reporter] Will any document be signed at the closing? 
  [Simeon] The conference usually closes with a list of 
science 
and technology recommendations, which is presented at the 
heads-of-state summit by the conference president. [end
