FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: AMP stake in copper project
expanded
AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial services group, has taken its
shareholding in Equatorial Mining to 19.9 per cent, the maximum permitted
level before a bid is automatically triggered.
Equatorial's main asset is the Leonor copper deposit in Chile, midway
between Chuquicamata, the biggest copper mine in the world, and Escondida,
the third largest. It is expected to produce about 30,000 tonnes of copper
annually for ten years when it goes into production.
Analysts suggest that AMP might provide debt finance for the project.
AMP bought its first 12.5m shares in Equatorial last summer at 37 cents
each, a placement which raised ADollars 4.625m (USDollars 3.05m) for the
mining company.
Yesterday Equatorial's other big shareholder, Niugini Mining, said it had
sold 13.9m shares (about 12 per cent of issued capital) at a net 32 cents
each, a total of ADollars 4.3m, and most of the shares had gone to AMP.
Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of both Equatorial and Niugini, said the latter
was selling non-core assets to help finance its share of development of the
huge Lihir Island gold project in Papua New Guinea. He said: 'It is a great
sorrow to see it go but it is for a good purpose.'
