WORLD IN BRIEF; 
FAR EAST; 
LAWMAKERS OK CUTS IN ASIAN BASE FUNDS 
House and Senate negotiators agreed on an $8.5-billion military construction 
bill that would slash President Bush's requests for bases in South Korea and 
the Philippines. Concerned that the United States carries too big a share of 
the defense burden, the lawmakers approved cutting all but $800,000 from Bush's 
requested $85.5 million for bases in those countries. The full House is 
expected to act in a few days on the legislation.
