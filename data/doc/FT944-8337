FT  21 NOV 94 / Lottery winners still being sought
Camelot, the consortium organising the National Lottery, was last night
waiting for two of the seven jackpot winners in the first contest to claim
their share of the Pounds 5.8m jackpot, Michael Smith writes.
The seven were being pursued by tabloid newspapers which have offered
rewards to readers to supply information on identities.
Camelot hopes to be able to announce jackpot winners' names in the next two
days, although it can only do so with their consent.
In all 1.15m people won prizes, ranging from Pounds 10 to the Pounds 839,254
which each of the jackpot winners will receive. The total payout was more
than of Pounds 22m.
