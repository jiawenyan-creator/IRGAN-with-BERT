FT  04 AUG 94 / German jobless total surges
German unemployment surged by 100,000 to around 3.7m last month, after
easing slightly in June, according to Ms Ursula Engelen-Kefer, chairman of
the federal labour office board. She pre-empted today's release of official
figures with a claim that numbers out of work in the west had risen almost
19 per cent this year. The total in the east was 8 per cent higher. Ms
Engelen-Kefer, also a board member at the DGB union federation, was
apparently attempting to overshadow more optimistic statements from the
office's president, Mr Bernhard Jagoda. He said earlier that the annual
average jobless rate in the west this year could turn out to be less than
2.6m, compared with the office's official forecast of 2.67m. German jobless
figures usually increase at the start of the holiday period. Last July the
recession and the seasonal downturn combined to increase unemployment by
160,000.
