GOVERNMENT WARNS BRITISH TABLOIDS TO 'CLEAN UP THEIR ACT' 
The government warned Britain's tabloid newspapers Friday to "clean up their 
act" or face laws to curb sensationalist journalism which has led to huge libel 
awards. 
Home Office minister Timothy Renton, responding to public anger over the way 
tabloid newspapers fight their circulation wars, announced the setting up of an 
independent review of press behavior. 
He told Parliament that the investigation will be completed within a year and 
will be followed by legislation if press behavior did not improve. 
"Editors and publishers of the national press are on probation in this 
country," Renton said. "They have a year or two to clean up their act." 
The review was disclosed as government supporters ensured the defeat of an 
attempt by opposition Labor Party legislator Tony Worthington to provide 
victims of unfair newspaper reports with a legal right of reply. 
The government, which has had its own quarrels with the press, torpedoed 
Worthington's proposals only because it considered them unworkable. 
The exchanges in Parliament coincided with a meeting in London of the 
International Press Institute to discuss accusations by some journalists that 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has eroded press and broadcasting freedom in 
Britain. 
Pressure for reform of the press has resulted from what critics say is its 
growing intrusions into the private lives of the famous, sexual smears and 
blatant invention of headline stories. 
The Sun paid a record $1.7 million in libel damages to rock star Elton John 
last December after admitting that stories about him were untrue.
