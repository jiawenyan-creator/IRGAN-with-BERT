FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: New net lending by building
societies falls - At a Glance
New net lending by building societies fell in August to Pounds 3.02bn from
Pounds 3.24bn in July, underlining fears of a halt in the recovery of the
housing market. Net new commitments are loans agreed but not yet undertaken
and the figure is an important forward-looking indicator, since commitments
made in one month tend to translate into loans in the following few weeks.
Building society savings levels also fell in August compared to the previous
month with net receipts down to Pounds 91m compared to Pounds 286m in July.
