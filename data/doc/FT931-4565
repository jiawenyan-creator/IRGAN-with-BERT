FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuban sugar situation 'tense'
THE SITUATION of Cuba's 1992 - 1993 sugar crop is 'tense' and harvesting and
milling are being carried out with less than 20 per cent of the resources
used in past harvests, according to official newspaper Granma, reports
Reuter from Havana.
Granma, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said there were
accumulated delays in harvesting and milling more than three months after
the start of the current campaign.
'A clear example of the harsh reality being faced is that there are still
some mills which have not yet started milling,' the newspaper added.
