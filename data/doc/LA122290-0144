PR FIRM WILL ASSIST L.A. CURBSIDE RECYCLING PLAN 
A 3-year-old public relations agency known for its socially conscious campaigns 
will take the lead in publicizing the city of Los Angeles' new curbside 
recycling program, which will be the world's largest. 
Westwood-based Laufer Associates has been awarded $1.6 million by the City 
Council to explain the system to residents using direct-mail brochures, a 
user's manual, print advertising, billboards, TV and radio spots, and such 
reminders as refrigerator magnets, all of which will be phased-in neighborhood 
by neighborhood by late next year or in early 1992. 
Laufer will direct three other agencies to tailor its message for specific 
groups: Foote, Cone &amp; Belding/Los Angeles, for advertising and direct mail; 
Coronado Communications, which specializes in the Latino and Asian-Pacific 
communities, and Lois Hill Hale &amp; Associates, which has experience in black 
neighborhoods. 
Most materials will be multilingual, said Jessica Laufer, president of Laufer 
Associates. Toll-free messages to explain the recycling and waste-reduction 
effort will also be available in about 10 languages.
