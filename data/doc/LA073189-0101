THE SIDELINES; 
COLISEUM, RAIDERS PURSUE TALKS 
A representative of the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission said today that, 
despite repeated reports of an impending move to Oakland or Sacramento by the 
Los Angeles Raiders, private talks continue over a plan that would reconstruct 
the Coliseum and keep the Raiders playing in Los Angeles. 
"I can confirm that there have been ongoing conversations between MCA/Spectacor 
on behalf of the commission with the Raiders and that the exact nature of these 
talks will be made public during a Coliseum Commission meeting Wednesday," said 
Irving Azoff, president of MCA Inc.'s Music Entertainment Group and a member of 
an MCA/Spectacor Coliseum private management team authorized by the Coliseum 
Commission to conduct talks with Raiders owner Al Davis. 
Azoff said the private management team has been told by the Raiders that they 
are talking with representatives of Oakland and Sacramento at the same time.
