 

This final rule revises the shipping schedules for the avocado varieties specified in Table I of paragraph (a)(2)
of 915.322 (7 CFR part 915.322) to synchronize those schedules with any calendar year. The previous schedules
needed to be adjusted to each new year to ensure that dates and weekdays conformed to each new year. The schedules in
Table I are similar to previous calendars, except that the maturity schedules have fixed dates, which become effective
on the Monday nearest the date specified in Table I. The new schedules are expected to conform more closely to the needs
of the industry. This final rule also exempts from maturity requirements the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties
of avocados, since these varieties of avocados are not commercially grown in the production area in Florida. 

A minimum grade requirement of U.S. No. 2 currently in effect on a continuous basis for avocados grown in Florida under
915.306 (7 CFR part 915.306), and for avocados imported into the United States under 944.28 (7 CFR part
944.28) remains in effect unchanged by this action. 

Florida avocado handlers may ship, exempt from the minimum grade, size, and maturity requirements effective under
the order, up to 55 pounds of avocados during any one day under a minimum quantity provision, and up to 20 pounds of avocados
as gift packs in individually addressed containers. Also, avocados grown in Florida utilized for commercial processing
are not subject to the grade, size, and maturity requirements under the order. 

Paragraph (d) of 915.150 (7 CFR part 915.150), currently requires that each handler, at the end of the day's
operation, report to the committee the number of containers (1/4 Bushel, 1/2 Bushel, and 4/5 Bushel) of avocados sold
and delivered within the State of Florida. This final action suspends paragraph (d) of 915.150 for the next
two seasons, through March 31, 1996. This temporarily suspends the requirement that handlers file the ``Avocado
Handler Daily Size Report Form'' which takes about 0.083 hours to complete for each report. The committee has determined
that information needed for operations, marketing policies, and compliance, could sufficiently be obtained from
inspection certificates collected on a daily basis by program staff, and that information collected on the ``Avocado
Handler Daily Size Report Form'' will not be needed for the next two seasons. Further, Hurricane Andrew reduced avocado
production by almost half, and this has reduced assessment collections, resulting in a need to reduce staff and administration
costs. 

This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities imported into the United States, including avocados,
that are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities under Federal marketing orders.


Minimum size (weight and diameter) and skin color maturity requirements for imported avocados in 944.31 (7
CFR 944.31) were continuously in effect for several years prior to their suspension by a final rule issued May 15, 1991
(56 FR 23009, May 20, 1991). The avocado import maturity requirements were temporarily suspended to provide the United
States Trade Representative (USTR) adequate time to review contemplated changes in those requirements, as required
by section 8e of the Act. Suspension of the avocado import maturity requirements became necessary when the Florida
avocado maturity requirements in 915.332 (7 CFR 915.332), upon which the avocado import maturity requirements
were based, were revised on May 15, 1991 (56 FR 23005, May 20, 1991). This revision was finalized on September 4, 1991
(56 FR 46224, September 11, 1991). Section 915.332 was most recently amended to make calendar date adjustments in
the shipping schedule for several varieties of Florida avocados on June 29, 1993 (58 FR 34684, June 29, 1993), and that
rule was finalized on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 46759, September 3, 1993). 

Prior to suspension, the avocado import maturity requirements were based on minimum weights and diameters applied
to avocados grown in all foreign countries, except for those grown in southern hemisphere countries. Such requirements
were applied to each variety for a specific time period during the first part of the shipping period. The minimum weights
or diameters were not applied to avocados grown in southern hemisphere countries, such as Chile, where practically
all imported southern hemisphere avocados have originated in recent years, because the southern hemisphere's avocado
growing season and various shipping periods differ from those in Florida. The import maturity requirements based
on minimum weights or diameters were applied to avocados grown in northern hemisphere countries, such as those in
the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, where practically all northern hemisphere imported avocados have originated
in recent years, because their growing season and various shipping periods are similar to those in Florida. 

The avocado import maturity requirements based on skin color for certain varieties of avocados which turn red, purple
or black when mature were applied to avocados imported from all foreign countries in both the southern and northern
hemispheres. Such requirements applied to all avocados grown in both hemispheres, because all such avocados turn
color when mature regardless of where they are grown.
