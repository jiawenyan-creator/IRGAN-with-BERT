Eight county high school students will travel to the Soviet Union for 26 days 
this summer to study alongside teen-agers from throughout the Soviet Union and 
the United States. 
The trip was arranged in conjunction with the American and Soviet academies of 
science. 
People to People, which has arranged university-level student exchanges since 
the 1950s, is sponsoring the trip.

arrangements, selected 13 students from 69 applicants. 
Ventura High students chosen for the trip are Bert Dannenberg, Aarron Jue, 
Denise Martinez, Christopher Pincetich, David Grainger, Matt Eckman and Todd 
Murray. Geof Reglos is from Oxnard High. Five other students from Southern 
California and nearby states will join the group.
