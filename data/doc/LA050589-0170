BRITAIN OUSTS 3 S. AFRICANS OVER IRISH ARMS SALES PLOT 
Britain expelled three South African diplomats today because of their country's 
reputed role in a plot to sell arms to Northern Ireland extremists in exchange 
for British-made missile parts. 
The Foreign Office said Undersecretary Patrick Wright summoned South African 
Ambassador Rae Killen and told him the three must leave the country within a 
week. 
"We noted their expression of regret," a statement quoted Wright as telling 
Killen. "However, the South African government should be under no illusions 
about the grave concern with which Her Majesty's government viewed the 
involvement by South African officials in this affair." 
The move came two weeks after authorities in Paris arrested a South African 
diplomat, an American arms dealer and three members of an extreme Protestant 
organization in Northern Ireland. The Northern Irish allegedly were handing 
over parts of a Blowpipe, a sophisticated shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missile 
manufactured in Belfast. 
The British government expressed grave concern over allegations that the South 
Africans were supplying weapons to the Protestants in exchange for the missile 
parts. 
The South African, identified by French sources as Daniel Storm, was released 
after he claimed diplomatic immunity.
