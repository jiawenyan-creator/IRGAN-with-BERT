FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Price Waterhouse rise pegged at 2%
PRICE Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, reported fee income rising 2 per
cent to Pounds 395m in the year to June 30.
Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner, said: 'The full impact of the recession is
now reflected in our fee income. Business has been strongly impacted by the
low levels of corporate activity.'
Audit and business advisory services, comprising one third of total income,
fell 2 per cent to Pounds 137m.
The most significant rise came in the corporate recovery division, which
rose by nearly one third to Pounds 40m, reflecting the firm's work on
companies in financial difficulty.
Management consultancy fell 5 per cent to Pounds 97m. The firm said this was
the result of clients postponing discretionary spending in efforts to
weather the recession.
Corporate finance and privatisation rose 19 per cent to Pounds 16m, while
tax consultancy grew 3 per cent to Pounds 105m.
