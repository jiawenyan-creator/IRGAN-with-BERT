  [Abstract] A radiation safety plan must include 
computerized monitoring of all phases of atomic energy plant 
use, including foreseen and unforseen situations. Emergency 
measures must be developed to protect personnel and the 
population and coordinate the efforts of organizations at 
various levels. A radiation safety system has been proposed 
which includes an automated system to process information on the 
environment and predict environmental changes in a timely 
manner. The system consists of: ecological monitoring of Ukraine 
as a whole; atomic energy plant monitoring and monitoring of the 
plant region; a control center to counter the effect of 
accidents and to develop recommendations; a crisis center to 
organize special help in the event of an accident; and an 
automated system to monitor the radiation situation. A schematic 
shows the hierarchy of organizations involved in the proposed 
radiation safety system. Figure 1.
