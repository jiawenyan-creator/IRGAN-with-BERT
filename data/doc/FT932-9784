FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Unigate postpones public offering of US
businesses
UNIGATE, the food and distribution group, has postponed the planned public
offering of its US restaurant businesses after the two chains involved
reported poor sales in March and April.
The company announced last month it was preparing an IPO to dispose of up to
100 per cent of the businesses, which trade as Black-eyed Pea and Taco
Bueno. The sale was expected to raise Dollars 220m to Dollars 250m (Pounds
145m to Pounds 164m), or Dollars 15-Dollars 17 a share.
However, trading was affected by bad weather in March and did not fully
recover last month. The March figures were also weak in comparison to a
strong month a year earlier, due to different promotional campaigns.
Goldman Sachs, the company's US adviser, had hoped to price the shares at
the top end of the range. However, when the latest trading results became
available, the likely offer price is understood to have fallen below the
target range and Unigate decided to pull the issue.
The issue would be delayed 'at least several months'. Unigate would still
favour selling the businesses via an IPO although a private sale would not
be ruled out.
Unigate's shares fell 12p to 353p. Analysts said the delay was disappointing
but not seriously damaging. Unigate had hoped to use the proceeds of the
sale to reduce borrowings. Following a number of acquisitions earlier this
year, the company is expected to have pro forma gearing of about 60 per cent
at its March year end, but interest cover remains strong.
Black-eyed Pea, which offers home-style cooking, has 115 outlets in 16
states while Taco Bueno has 111 Mexican fast food restaurants. In the last
financial year, the businesses made operating profits of Pounds 13.3m.
Shares in Grand Metropolitan, which owns the Burger King chain, fell 2p to
430p on worries about its US restaurants.
