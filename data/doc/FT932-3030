FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: MEPC
Another week, another rights issue from a property company. MEPC is the last
of the big seven to take advantage of the sector's recent surge to raise
fresh funds. Its Pounds 222m cash call brings the total raised in the sector
to more than Pounds 1bn this year. But although MEPC has asked for the most
money, it arguably has the weakest story to tell and may also suffer from
being last in the queue. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that it is
raising too much, too late.
About half the cash will be used to spruce up MEPC's existing portfolio,
which was beginning to fray at the edges. The rest has been loosely
earmarked for property or corporate acquisitions. That is faintly unnerving,
given the company's proclivity for rearing white elephants in the 1980s.
Shareholders must hope it has learned from the recession.
The broader worry is that MEPC's attractions may pall as investors become
more discriminating after the first flush of property spring. The company
does not boast the cast-iron balance sheet of a Land Securities, or the
entrepreneurial spirit of a British Land, or even the international spread
of a Hammerson. MEPC may have crudely calculated that its greatest appeal
lies in its fat dividend yield. But securing the resources to pay a dividend
is the worst reason of all for launching a rights issue.
