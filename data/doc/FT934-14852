FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Higher taxes hit US paper group
INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, posted third-quarter net
income of Dollars 48m, or 39 cents a share, including charges of Dollars
28m, or 23 cents, reflecting a higher federal income tax rate.
Sales slid to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3.5bn.
Stripping out the tax adjustment, net income was Dollars 76m, or 62 cents,
in the quarter. In the same period of 1992, International Paper earned
Dollars 98m, or 81 cents.
Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, said depressed pricing levels
for paper and packaging products in the US and abroad had dampened the
cyclical rebound that the company had been expecting.
For the first nine months, net earnings were Dollars 189m, or Dollars 1.53,
on sales of Dollars 10.3bn, against income of Dollars 282m, or Dollars 2.17,
on sales of Dollars 10.2bn last year.
