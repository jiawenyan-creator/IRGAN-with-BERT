  [Text] Beirut's Publications Court, meeting under Judge 
'Afif Shams-al-Din, has issued its verdict in the case of 
AL-SAFIR's publication in May of the text of an Israeli proposal 
to the bilateral negotiations with Lebanon. 
  The court ruled that any pursuit of Faysal Salman [the 
newspaper's editing director] and Ibrahim al-Amin [staff writer] 
be stopped for lack of incriminating evidence in accordance with 
Articles 12 and 25 of Law 104/77. The court referred the papers 
to the public prosecutor to take the necessary action. The 
ruling can be appealed. 
  The judge did not announce the ruling during the session. He 
asked those involved in the case to read the ruling in the 
court's office and a court official read it out to the press.
