FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MS International rises to Pounds 251,000
Profits of MS International, the Doncaster-based engineer, rose from Pounds
59,000 to Pounds 251,000 pre-tax over the 53 weeks to May 2. An Pounds 8m
fall in turnover to Pounds 30.5m mainly reflected discontinued activities.
Profits were struck after taking account of a drop in interest charges to
Pounds 174,000 (Pounds 611,000) and exceptional costs of Pounds 220,000
relating to a factory closure.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.77m (income Pounds 1.89m) were principally
final settlement terms of the dispute relating to the sale of two Laurence
Scott companies in 1986.
Earnings worked through at 1p (0.4p) and a maintained final dividend of 1.5p
makes a same-again 2.5p total.
