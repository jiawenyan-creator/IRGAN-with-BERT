FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Platinum prices hit Rustenburg
LOWER platinum prices contributed to a 19 per cent fall in Rustenburg
Platinum's pre-tax profits to R498.8m (Dollars 179.4m) for the six months to
December.
Sales at the world's largest platinum producer, which is part of the
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, fell 15 per cent to R1.5bn
as values of platinum and rhodium, a by-product of mining platinum, slid by
12 per cent and 17 per cent respectively over the reporting period. Despite
a reduction in costs, profits on metal sales fell 15.2 per cent to R558.5m.
After taking account of renewals and replacements charges, and tax, lease
and tax normalisation, distributable profits fell 17.7 per cent to R219.7m.
This was better than market expectations of a 20 to 25 per cent fall in
earnings.
It is a measure of the difficulties the platinum industry is experiencing
that Rustenburg, which has a strong balance sheet, saw fit to cut its
interim dividend to 87.5 cents a share from 125 cents. Earnings dropped to
175.3 cents from 213.1 cents, so dividend cover was lifted from 1.7 to 2.
Lebowa Platinum, a smaller platinum producer also in the JCI group, made an
after-tax loss of R9.4m against a R1.2m profit previously.
