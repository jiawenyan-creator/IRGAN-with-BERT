FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Swiss group uses novel share
plan
EMS-CHEMIE, the Swiss speciality chemicals group, has found a novel way of
making a large distribution to shareholders without, it hopes, exposing them
to tax.
The group intends to pay back to shareholders part of the nominal value of
their shares. As this would represent neither a capital gain nor a dividend,
EMS is confident that it will be free of tax.
The move is part of a restructuring of capital that EMS, like many Swiss
companies, is proposing this year to take advantage of impending changes in
Swiss company law.
Under the EMS plan, holders of the SFr500 nominal bearer shares will receive
SFr200 per share. Then the shares will be split three-for-one, reducing
their nominal value to SFr100.
There is a similar scheme for the SFr100 registered shares.
The distributions would cost the group the equivalent of 57 per cent of its
SFr99m net income last year.
