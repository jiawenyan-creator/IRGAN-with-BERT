FT  13 MAY 92 / Observer: Earthly support
Leaving aside an over-powering belief in Britain's Conservative party, it
would seem that on certain key issues the Daily Mail's 66-year-old publisher
Viscount Rothermere is less in tune with his own paper than with its
gutter-press rival, The Sun.
He and it both support the Archbishop of Canterbury's attack on greedy
executive pay rises - which is more than can be said for the Daily Mail
itself.
'It is not surprising that the churches are so empty when the leadership of
its priesthood is intellectually so mediocre and so out of touch with the
mood of our times,' opined the Mail on Monday.
Yesterday, it was forced to publish a prominent letter from its proprietor -
who supplements his Pounds 359,000 salary with the earnings on his Pounds
200m-plus family fortune - distancing himself from the Mail's criticism of
the archbishop.
Meanwhile, the archbishop may be heartened by being told by a Sun editorial
that 'if we cannot have Savonarola or Billy Graham, you are the next best
thing'. Pretty profound stuff.
