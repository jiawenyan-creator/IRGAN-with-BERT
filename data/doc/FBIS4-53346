  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The government will hold a 
special meeting soon to discuss improving the attitude of public 
officials, with the emphasis on lifting morale rather than 
punishment, officials said Monday. Kim Yong-su, senior 
secretary for petition and information, is to chair the meeting, 
convened to point out problems caused by inefficient and 
overcautious government workers, officials said. 
  Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) Secretary-General Sin 
Tong- chin, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Song Chong-ui, National Tax 
Administrator Chief Chu Kyong-sok, National Police Chief Kim 
Hwa-nam and the chief assistant to the prime minister for 
administration coordination, Kim Si-hyong, are to attend. The 
meeting is expected to emphasize boosting the morale of public 
employees to get rid of "lameness" instead of imposing 
punishment, officials said.
