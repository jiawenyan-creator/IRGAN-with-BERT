FT  29 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Complicated backdrop as Dow
gains
Wall Street
US stocks surged yesterday even though an initial reading on third-quarter
economic growth was much higher than forecast, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 55.51 higher at 3,930.66, despite
the NYSE's 'downtick' restrictions on program-guided buying imposed around
midday.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 7.92, or 1.7 per cent,
at 473.77, as advancing issues on the Big Board outnumbered declines by
nearly a three-to-one margin.
Volume was heavy for the fourth session in a row, with some 383m shares
traded by the close.
In the other leading markets, the American SE composite was 3.07 better at
458.16, and the Nasdaq composite was up 8.68 at 776.48.
The powerful advance was staged against a complicated technical and
fundamental backdrop. It was triggered by a solid gain in bond prices, which
came in spite of the announcement that the economy had expanded by a bigger
than expected 3.4 per cent in the three months to the end of September.
The Treasury market had expected a 3 per cent gain but a sell-off failed to
materialise because of some surprisingly good inflation news contained in
the report, and suggestions that the economy might start to cool off rapidly
in the current quarter.
The upturn pushed the yield on the 30-year government bond below 8 per cent
for the first time all week. The rally gathered strength around midday on
rumours, later denied by Washington, that the G7 industrial nations would
meet in an emergency weekend session to consider ways to prop up the dollar.
Share prices paralleled the action in bonds, as the mood of relief allowed
equity investors to retrace some of the ground lost over the past fortnight.
The Dow industrials had backtracked in five out of the past six sessions,
even though the earnings news flooding the market over that time was
overwhelmingly positive.
Among the best performers Caterpillar climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 59 5/8 ,
United Technologies Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 3/4 , IBM Dollars 2 to Dollars
76 5/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 64 1/4 .
Airline stocks were up sharply for a second day running. UAL, parent of
United Airlines, jumped Dollars 6 to Dollars 95 1/2 , Delta climbed Dollars
2 1/8 to Dollars 51 3/8 and AMR, parent of American, put on Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 55 1/4 .
The technology sector showed impressive strength, too. Motorola was Dollars
2 1/4 ahead at Dollars 58 5/8 , Texas Instruments was Dollars 1 1/4 better
at Dollars 75 and Compaq Computer up Dollars 2 at Dollars 40 3/4 .
Halliburton, an oilfield services concern, was marked up Dollars 4 1/4 to
Dollars 36 3/8 . Canada
Toronto stocks posted solid gains on release of the US quarterly GDP report,
which calmed expectations of a build-up of inflationary pressures in the US
economy.
The TSE 300 composite index added 23.16 points to 4,288.62, with advances
leading declines 463 to 311. Volume of 54.8m shares, valued at CDollars
801m, were down from yesterday's 78.8m shares at CDollars 1.12bn. The TSE
composite gained 3.5 points on the week. Potash shares, on the slide in
recent sessions, jumped 2 3/8 to 47.
Cott shares hit a new 52-week low, down 1 to 13 3/4 in active trading, while
Nova shares ended unchanged at 13 3/4 after heavy trading and good third
quarter figures.
Brazil
Sao Paulo continued its recovery as a return of foreign investors helped
improve the mood on the markets.
The Bovespa index rose 2,208 to 49,275, up from Thursday's 47,067.
