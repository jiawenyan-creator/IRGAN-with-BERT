FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sumit net asset value down to 108p
A further decline in net assets was sustained by Sumit in the second half of
1991.
The company reported a fall to 108p in net asset value per share at that
date against 115p at the interim stage and 151p at the previous year end.
Mr Simon Sharp, chairman, said that profits of most of the trust's investee
companies had virtually disappeared, leaving little capacity for paying
dividends.
With regard to this the recommended distribution for the year is reduced to
1.25p (5.8p), payable from earnings down from 7.3p to 1.4p.
