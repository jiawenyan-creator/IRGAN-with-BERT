FT  18 FEB 94 / Low exports hit car production
Car production fell 7.7 per cent in January to 100,711 from 109,127 in the
same month a year ago, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said
yesterday.
It said output was depressed by a sharp fall in production for export. Car
production rose by 6.5 per cent in the whole of last year to 1.38m, the
highest since 1974. Output has been lower than a year earlier in three of
the past four months.
Output for export markets has been hit by the weakness of new-car demand in
continental European markets, which has offset the rise in production for
the UK market.
Car production for export in January fell 27 per cent year-on-year to
36,724, while output for the domestic market rose 8.8 per cent to 63,987.
The overall level of production was also affected by the lower number of
working days in January than in the same month a year ago.
Vehicle output is still being affected by short-time working at several
plants. The Nissan car plant at Sunderland has been forced to abandon its
second shift for four months and will not resume night-shift working until
early March.
The steep fall in commercial vehicle output continued in January with a
year-on-year decline of 12.1 per cent to 16,531 from 18,813. This sector,
which suffered last year from the collapse of the former Daf group, fell
sharply in the whole of 1993 by 22.2 per cent to 193,414, the lowest level
since the 1940s.
