FT  27 FEB 93 / BA attacked over ticket system
THE three big US airlines, which are opposing plans by British Airways and
USAir to implement a code-sharing agreement, have argued that the UK-based
airline has 'no valid legal claim' to unconditional code-sharing rights.
Under 'code-sharing' agreements, airlines are permitted to use for internal
flights each others' designated flight numbers to facilitate sales of
tickets through the airline reservation system.
BA has claimed that it was given a right to code-sharing with a US carrier
under revisions to the bilateral aviation agreement between the US and the
UK which was negotiated in March 1991.
These revisions were agreed in return for concesssions on the UK side, which
allowed American Airlines and United Airlines to replace Pan Am and TWA as
the two US carriers permitted to use London's Heathrow Airport.
However, the US carriers now note that the provisions of the March 1991
Memorandum of Consultations become effective 'only upon an exchange of notes
between the US and UK governments - something that has not as yet happened.
'The MOC also states that pending such an exchange of notes, its provisions
will be governed by the principles of comity and reciprocity,' they add,
arguing that the proposed integration of services between BA and USAir would
run contrary to such principles.
