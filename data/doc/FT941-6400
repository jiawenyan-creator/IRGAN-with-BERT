FT  02 MAR 94 / Midlands economic forum announced
Sandwell borough in the West Midlands is setting up an economic forum to
develop and co-ordinate regeneration of the area. The forum is based on a
joint approach of the borough council and the local training and enterprise
council.
It is an early sign of the way in which permanent partnerships are being
created between the public and private sectors in response to the
government's unification of both its regeneration budget and its
departmental activities in the regions.
