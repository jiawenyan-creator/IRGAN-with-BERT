METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE OFFERS $50,000 REWARD IN GIRL'S DEATH 
Gov. George Deukmejian offered a $50,000 reward Monday for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the killer of a 14-year-old runaway girl whose 
body was found on a roadside in Lancaster last month. 
The governor's action -- providing the maximum reward allowable by law from the 
state's General Fund -- brings the total offered in the death of Angela 
Migliore to $60,000. Last week, county supervisors posted a $5,000 reward 
proposed by Supervisor Mike Antonovich. The Lancaster City Council matched 
that. 
Migliore's body was found near 70th Street East and Avenue N on Oct. 11. 
Investigators said she had been strangled elsewhere. 
Neighbors said Migliore had run away from home after arguing with an older 
brother.
