FT  04 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Consolidation pattern in
senior bourses
Senior bourses consolidated after Tuesday's excitement, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT subsided a little after hours, but stayed happy, the Dax index
closing 12.53 higher at 2,198.92, after 2,200.34, and ending the afternoon
2.80 lower over 24 hours at an Ibis-indicated 2,190.83.
There was some profit-taking in chemicals and weakness in banks. But the
broad market, again, was led higher on the session by strength in blue
chips, noted Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, and
turnover stayed high at DM8.8bn against DM8.5bn on Tuesday.
Daimler rose another DM17.80 on the session to DM834 ahead of a Kleinwort
Benson upgrade in New York. Preussag put on DM10 more at DM476, and Thyssen
DM7.50 at DM313 after hitting a new 1994 high in Tuesday's post-bourse.
Banks reflected the interim report from Bayernverein, a worse performance
than that from Bayernhypo earlier in the week. Over the full day, the
Bavarian banks fell by DM15 to DM418 and DM10.50 to DM422.50 respectively.
AMSTERDAM took profits in the chemicals groups DSM and Akzo Nobel as
second-quarter results came in at the top end of expectations. DSM eased Fl
1.70 to Fl 145.70, having risen by almost 20 per cent since the end of June,
while Akzo Nobel was steady at Fl 219.50 after a gain of 16.5 per cent over
the same period.
The AEX index, however, rose 1.64 to 420.88 as investors switched to other
stocks. Heineken, in particular, performed well with a rise of Fl 4.70 to Fl
238.50. Kleinwort Benson issued a buy note on the brewer ahead of, it
forecast, unexciting first-half results early next month: 'The summer
weather arrived very late in Europe, and while this will be compensated by
advances in the US and Asia/Pacific region, overall sales growth should be
modest.' The broker raised its 1995 forecast for the group, based on growth
in Asia.
PARIS took a breather after Tuesday's strong performance and the CAC-40
index softened 2.16 to 2,115.07.
St Gobain slipped FFr5 to FFr694 on news that it was to sell its paper
division to Jefferson Smurfit, while Docks de France was lifted FFr33, or
4.8 per cent, to FFr726 on rumours that J. Sainsbury, the UK supermarket
chain, could launch a takeover bid.
ZURICH was unable to maintain its upward momentum, and prices eased when
Wall Street opened lower. The SMI index gave up 9.0 to 2,620.7 in quiet
trade.
Pharmaceuticals found demand on the view that they were undervalued. Roche
certificates picked up SFr35 to SFr5,525. Banks were weak ahead of UBS's
first-half figures tomorrow. UBS dipped SFr9 to SFr1,187 and CS Holding lost
SFr6 to SFr576.
Holderbank moved forward SFr15 to SFr979 following several analysts'
recommendations. Bank Sal Oppenheim commented that the cement and aggregates
group's European markets were recovering more rapidly than expected and that
the US was performing well above budget.
MILAN was unconvinced by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's parliamentary performance on
Tuesday night, taking the view that the prime minister had not resolved the
conflicts between his parliamentary and political interests.
The Comit index finished 3.14 ahead at 718.47, reflecting some early
enthusiasm, but the real-time Mibtel index finished 110, or 1 per cent,
lower at 11,352 as the more negative view took hold later in the day.
However, Mr William Cowan at James Capel expected political worries to
subside in coming weeks after parliament broke for the summer next week.
'The main issue that the market will be focusing on is how tough the deficit
package will be in September,' he said.
Losses among telecommunications issues were contained amid continuing
interest ahead of the launch of Telecom Italia on August 18. Sip lost L19 to
L4,589 and Stet was L35 lower at L5,390.
MADRID saw profit-taking, arbitrage and some stronger buying after the Bank
of Spain had announced an interest rate cut of 15 basis points.
However, the positive trend did not last, and the general index eased 0.55
to 320.25, analysts blaming losses in the New York bond market.
DUBLIN enthused over the paper and board manufacturer Jefferson Smurfit's
acquisition of La Cellulose du Pin, the paper and packaging arm of the
French St Gobain giant. Smurfit rose a further 25 to 405p after a 20p
advance on Tuesday.
The ISEQ general index rose 21.90 to 1,866.93. Mr Robbie Kelleher of Davy
Stockbrokers in Dublin said that Tuesday's gain, after an Irish bank holiday
on Monday, followed a strong overnight performance by Smurfit's US
affiliate, JSC, in New York.
