FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: SKF upgrades profits forecast
for full year
SKF, the world's leading maker of roller bearings, sharply upgraded its 1994
profit forecast yesterday, citing stronger-than-expected growth in volumes
in its main European markets.
The group expects profits of SKr1.5bn (Dollars 190m) this year, compared
with an April forecast of SKr1bn. This would be its best result since 1990,
and follows a SKr1.8bn loss in 1992 and a SKr669m deficit last year.
SKF said a recovery was under way in all its European markets, particularly
in the automotive industry, its most important customer base. 'It is
probable that the favourable market trend will continue during the remainder
of the year,' it said.
Europe accounts for 60 per cent of group sales. 'There is a strong recovery
under way in Scandinavia, the UK and Italy. But we can also see that the
German market is levelling out and starting to improve,' the group said. It
said there was particularly strong growth in demand from truckmakers.
The company is also benefiting from a solid upturn in the US market, where
profits have increased every quarter for the past two years. The US is the
group's largest single market with 25 per cent of sales.
'We are taking market share,' the group said, although it declined to be
specific. Its share of the world market, excluding China and former Comecon
countries, is around 20 per cent, twice its nearest competitor.
SKF made a SKr306m profit in the first quarter of 1994, after losses of
SKr355m in the same 1993 period. Sales climbed 12 per cent to SKr8.05bn. The
recovery has been helped by extensive cost-cutting - which has led to the
loss of 15,000 jobs over four years - and currency factors.
The company's B shares yesterday rose SKr1 to SKr139, against a downward
market trend.
