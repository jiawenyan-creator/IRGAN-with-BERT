  [Text] Ashgabat, 6 May -- The joint protection of 
Turkmenistan's state border was discussed today during a meeting 
between Turkmenistan President Saparmurad Niyazov and Lieutenant 
General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy commander of the Russian 
Federation border troops. 
  Methods were defined for the implementation of the 
intergovernment treaty between Turkmenistan and Russia, signed 
at the end of 1993, on the joint protection of Turkmenistan's 
borders, and on the status of Russian Federation servicemen in 
the Republic. Aleksandr Bespalov said "the formation of an 
operational group of Russian border troops which is being set up 
in accordance with the intergovernment treaty, has been 
completed." 
  Issues related to insuring the functioning of the 
operational 
group in close cooperation with the Turkmenistan border troops 
were also examined at the meeting. This kind of cooperation 
meets the mutual interests of the two countries and insures 
their security at Turkmenistan's state border.
