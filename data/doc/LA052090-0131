PROPS. L AND M WOULD PROVIDE NEEDED CARLSBAD SCHOOL FACILITIES 
When it's time for the entire student body at Carlsbad's Valley Junior High 
School to assemble, a strange thing happens. Teachers and administrators herd 
the 950 students three blocks to Carlsbad High School, usually in two separate 
groups. 
That's the nearest place with a room big enough to hold even half the school's 
seventh- and eighth-graders. 
Proposition M, on the local ballot June 5, would put an end to this unfortunate 
and potentially dangerous situation. The measure would allow the Carlsbad 
Unified School District to borrow $2.5 million to build at the junior high a 
multipurpose center and expand a library that school administrators say is 
small and inadequate for their still-growing student population. It deserves 
voter support. 
Equally important Proposition L would raise $7.5 million to build and equip a 
new high school science building and a combination library and administration 
center. Built for 1,200 students in 1957, the high school now holds 1,750 
ninth- through 12th-graders and is being reconstructed to house as many as 
2,500 by the turn of the century. Library and lab space are scarce. 
The measures need only a simple majority for approval because they are based on 
bonds passed by voters in 1975 and 1977, before Proposition 13 imposed the 
two-thirds-vote requirement for authorization of new borrowing. The school 
district is asking for the right to use its previously granted bonding 
authority. 
Together, the two propositions would add just $22 annually in taxes per 
$100,000 assessed valuation on a home over the next 10 years. That seems a 
small price to pay to provide Carlsbad's children with up-to-date science labs, 
libraries and auditoriums.
