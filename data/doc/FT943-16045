FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Difficult trading for Budgens as profits
decline to Pounds 5.4m
Budgens, the small retailing chain which is being backed by Rewe's, one of
Germany's largest food chains, said trading conditions proved very
difficult, particularly in the first quarter of this year, writes Andrew
Bolger.
The group, which warned in April that opening discount stores had proved
more expensive than anticipated, said pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 6.2m
to Pounds 5.4m in the year to May 1.
Sales dipped to Pounds 298m (Pounds 301m).
Budgens said that in line with other food retailers it experienced
year-on-year price deflation and in its case this was about 3 per cent.
Budgens converted nine existing stores to Rewe's Penny Market discount store
format. The German group last year took a 29 per cent stake and has an
option to raise this to 47 per cent next September, which would require a
full bid.
Conversion costs and operating losses in the first year had an adverse
effect upon profits, although these costs were offset by the profit
generated from the sale and leaseback of a second warehouse adjacent to its
main operations in Wellingborough, Northants.
Budgens plans to open a further 30 discount stores in the south-east over
the next two years, although most of them are likely to open in 1995-96.
The retail format at the existing Budgens' stores has been re-focused to
concentrate on fresh food at competitive prices. The group said the Penny
Market stores were experiencing encouraging sales trends.
Earnings per share fell to 2.8p (3.4p). A final dividend of 0.7p maintains
the total at 1p.
