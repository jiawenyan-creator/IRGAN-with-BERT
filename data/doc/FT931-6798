FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: VAT on food best available option for government
Sir, Mr Geoff Rayner and Mr Tim Lang describe VAT on food as a banana skin
the government must avoid (Letters, February 20).
On the contrary, if and when the chancellor needs to raise more revenue,
this (with similar action on other zero-rated goods) is the best option
available.
Of course, if we look at VAT in isolation, it would be a 'tax on the poor'
but the poor can be relieved of the burden by raising income tax thresholds
and welfare benefits, leaving substantial net revenue to be raised from
those who can afford to pay.
Ending zero-rating would remove economic distortions, eliminate tiresome
administrative anomalies (reducing, rather than increasing, bureaucracy) and
bring the UK more closely into line with its European partners, where
Britain's regime has been a long-standing source of difficulty.
It would also help to shift the balance from taxing income to taxing
expenditure, which many regard as both fairer and less of a discouragement
to enterprise.
