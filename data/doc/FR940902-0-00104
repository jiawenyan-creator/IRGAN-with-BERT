 



State

 is defined at section 4(22) of the Act. For cash payment purposes, the definition of ``State'' contained in the Department
of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR 205.3 shall apply to JTPA programs. 
 

State council

 means the State Job Training Coordinating Council (SJTCC) or, in a State with a Human Resource Investment Council
(HRIC) pursuant to 628.215 of this chapter, the HRIC. 
 

Subgrant

 means an award of JTPA financial assistance in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a
recipient to an eligible subrecipient. It also means a subgrant award of JTPA financial assistance by a subrecipient
to a lower tier subrecipient. The term includes financial assistance when provided by any legal agreement, even if
the agreement is called a contract, but does not include procurement purchases from vendors nor does it include any
form of assistance received by program participants. 
 

Subgrantee

 means a subrecipient. 
 

Subrecipient

 means the legal entity to which a subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the recipient (or higher tier subrecipient)
for the use of the funds provided. For JTPA purposes, distinguishing characteristics of a subrecipient include items
such as determining eligibility of applicants, enrollment of participants, performance measured against meeting
the objectives of the program, responsibility for programmatic decisionmaking, responsibility for compliance
with program requirements, and use of the funds awarded to carry out a JTPA program or project, as compared to providing
goods or services for a JTPA program or project (vendor). Depending on local circumstances, the PIC, local elected
official, or administrative entity may be a subrecipient. SDA grant recipients and JTPA title III substate grantees
are particular types of subrecipients. 
 

Substate grantee (SSG)

 means that agency or organization selected to administer programs pursuant to section 312(b) of the Act. The substate
grantee is the entity that receives JTPA title III funds for a substate area directly from the Governor. 
 

Technical assistance

 is a facet of capacity building which may include but is not limited to information sharing, dissemination and training
on program models and job functions; peer-to-peer networking and problem solving; guides; and interactive communication
technologies. 
 

Title,

 as used in this chapter, means a title of the Act, unless the text of the regulation specifically indicates otherwise.

 

Vendor

 means an entity responsible for providing generally required goods or services to be used in the JTPA program. These
goods or services may be for the recipient's or subrecipient's own use or for the use of participants in the program.
Distinguishing characteristics of a vendor include items such as: Providing the goods and services within normal
business operations; providing similar goods or services to many different purchasers, including purchasers outside
the JTPA program; and operating in a competitive environment. A vendor is not a subrecipient and does not exhibit the
distinguishing characteristics attributable to a subrecipient, as defined above. Any entity directly involved
in the delivery of program services not available to the general public, with the exception of an employer providing
on-the-job training, shall be considered a subrecipient rather than a vendor. 
 

Wagner-Peyser Act

 means 29 U.S.C. 49, et seq.
