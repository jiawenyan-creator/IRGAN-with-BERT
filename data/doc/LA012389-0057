49ERS GET TAYLOR-MADE FINISH; 
BENGALS DEALT OUT ON SCORE IN LAST MINUTE 
In the most dramatic finish in Super Bowl history, Joe Montana hit receiver 
John Taylor on a 10-yard scoring pass with 34 seconds remaining Sunday to give 
the San Francisco 49ers a 20-16 over over the Cincinnati Bengals before a crowd 
of 75,179 at Joe Robbie Stadium. 
The 49ers, who started their last-gasp effort with 3:10 remaining in Super Bowl 
XXIII, drove 92 yards on 11 plays on the go-ahead drive, highlighted by catches 
of 17 and 27 yards by receiver Jerry Rice. 
It was the third Super Bowl victory of the decade for San Francisco and the 
fifth consecutive title for the National Football Conference. 
A 40-yard field goal by Cincinnati kicker Jim Breech with 3:20 remaining gave 
the Bengals a 16-13 lead, but they couldn't hold it. 
The Bengals drove 46 yards in 11 plays on their drive toward that go-ahead 
field goal, after the 49ers missed a 49-yard field goal attempt that would have 
given them the lead with 8:47 remaining. 
The key plays on the Bengals' field goal drive were a 17-yard pass from Boomer 
Esiason to Ira Hillary on third and 12 at the Cincinnati 29-yard line, and a 
13-yard pass from Esiason to James Brooks to the 49er 24, setting up Breech's 
kick. 
The first quarter was a costly one for both teams. The 49ers lost left tackle 
Steve Wallace with a broken left fibula on the game's third play. Wallace was 
injured when Bengal nose tackle David Grant knocked Montana backward after a 
pass, Montana rolling over onto Wallace's leg. 
Later in the quarter, Cincinnati's Pro Bowl nose tackle Tim Krumrie broke both 
the tibia and fibula bones in his left leg after he planted his foot awkwardly 
into the turf while chasing Roger Craig on an 8-yard run. Krumrie remained in 
the locker room after the injury, watching the game on television. 
The 49ers quickly took advantage of the injury to the Bengals' top defensive 
player, driving 73 yards in 13 plays for the game's first score, a 41-yard 
field goal by Mike Cofer with 3:14 left in the quarter. It came after an 
apparent 22-yard pass completion from Montana to receiver Mike Wilson -- down 
to the Cincinnati 2-yard line -- was ruled incomplete after an instant-replay 
review. San Francisco had to settle for the field goal after two Montana 
incompletions. 
The 49ers showed no signs of slowing as they headed into the second quarter. On 
the last play of the first quarter, Rice made a great left-handed catch of a 
Montana pass for a 16-yard gain. Rice's hands, and his ankle, seemed fine, 
despite a Super Bowl week's worth of worry. 
Later in the drive, Montana read a Bengal blitz by safety David Fulcher and 
found Rice wide open down the right sideline for a 30-yard gain and a first 
down just outside the Cincinnati 10. The 49ers made it as far as the 1 on 
fourth down, called time out, and then decided to send Cofer in for the easy 
19-yard field goal. 
If only it was that easy. Randy Cross' center snap skidded off line to holder 
Barry Helton, who didn't do much with the plant, and Cofer's kick hooked wide 
to the left with 12:59 left in the half. 
The 49ers were dominating the game, but not the scoreboard. Later in the 
quarter, Taylor had a 45-yard return after a 63-yard punt, setting his team up 
nicely at the San Francisco 46. 
But on third and 21, Craig fumbled after taking a short pass and heading up 
field into the Bengals' secondary. Fulcher's hit forced the fumble, and Jim 
Skow recovered with 9:52 left. The Bengals, again, did nothing with the 
opportunity. 
Cincinnati didn't get moving until late in the half, only after they held the 
49ers in check deep in San Francisco territory. 
The Bengals took over after a 49er punt on their own 44 with 4:04 left. They 
managed to drive 28 yards in 6 plays, the key play an 18-yard pass from Esiason 
to Tim McGee, and settled for a 34-yard Breech field goal to tie the game, 3-3, 
with 1:15 left in the half. 
The Bengals took the lead for first time in the third quarter, 6-3, on a 
43-yard field goal by Breech. Cincinnati did it the hard way, taking the 
second-half kickoff and driving 61 yards on 13 plays, using 9:21 on the clock. 
Esiason had key passes of 23 and 11 yards to Cris Collinsworth on the drive and 
another of 20 yards to Brooks. 
But the drive stalled inside the 49ers' 30. San Francisco Coach Bill Walsh, who 
would not say whether this game was his last as 49er coach, had a tough 
decision to make after the Bengals were called for illegal motion on an 
incomplete pass on third and 10 at the 25. The 49ers could have pushed the 
Bengals back 5 yards and given them another down. Instead, they decided to test 
Breech, who had made only 2 of 6 field goal attempts outside of 40 yards this 
season. Breech's longest field goal was 45 yards, but he made this one with 
ease. 
The first big play of the game came with 2:22 left in the third quarter when 
49er linebacker Bill Romanowski intercepted an Esiason pass at the Cincinnati 
23. San Francisco turned it into a 32-yard Cofer field goal to tie the game, 
6-6. 
The lead would last just 16 seconds, the time it took Stanford Jennings to 
return the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown. Jennings was untouched on 
the play until Terry Greer clipped Jennings' heels at the 3. The score and 
extra point put Cincinnati ahead, 13-6. 
It was only the second kickoff return for a touchdown in Super Bowl history. 
The first occurred in 1983, when Miami's Fulton Walker returned a kickoff 98 
yards for a score in a 27-17 loss to Washington. 
The Jennings play served to shock and inspire the 49ers, who drove with ease up 
the field on their next possession. 
On first down at the 15, Montana threw 31 yards to Rice, who had beaten corner 
Lewis Billups. Then it was Montana to Craig for 40 yards down to the 14. After 
an incomplete pass, which could have been intercepted by Billups in the end 
zone, Montana threw perfectly to Rice, who was fading toward the left corner. 
Rice made the catch inside the 5, and hooked the ball over the end-zone marker 
as he went out of bounds. It was a 14-yard touchdown pass play on a drive 
covering 85 yards on 4 plays, and it helped tie the score, 13-13, with 14:03 
left. 
The 49ers had a great chance to take the lead on their next possession, thanks 
to a spectacular 44-yard reception by Rice to the Bengals' 38. But the drive 
stalled there, and a 49-yard field goal try by Cofer was wide to the right.
