CRUISE CHEERS GIRL HEART PATIENT 
A 10-year-old Ft. Mill, S.C., girl waiting for a heart transplant was given 
permission to go home for Christmas, but not before she got a stellar sendoff 
from actor Tom Cruise. 
"When he came in the room, her heart monitor showed her heart rate went up to 
170 beats a minute," Ginger Mason said. "She was absolutely so excited she 
couldn't stand it." 
Cruise, who was filming Paramount Pictures' "Days of Thunder" at Charlotte 
Motor Speedway, brought Brandi Mason a hat and shirt, autographed her 
pillowcase and then visited some of the other children at Charlotte Memorial 
Hospital on Thursday. 
Doctors said they don't know when a heart will be available for Brandi, who was 
found to have myocarditis, a rare viral infection of the heart, in July.
