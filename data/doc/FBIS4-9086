  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Party program coordination talks 
have started between the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], 
Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats], the Agrarian Alliance, 
and the Party of Entrepreneurs to lay the foundation for a 
coalition after the elections. This was announced at the news 
conference of the Agrarian Alliance. Laszlo Gardai reports: 
  [Gardai] I am sincerely sorry that the election campaign is 
not what it ought to be, the campaign chief of the Agrarian 
Alliance said. He considered to be news only the information 
from the various parties about who concludes a coalition with 
whom, but party programs were not aired sufficiently. There is 
no forum for a true show of colors, because, for example, the 
three-and-a-half-minute speeches on television on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays [party political broadcasts] are meaningless and 
instead of these, debates should be staged. [passage omitted] 
  The spokesperson for the party, (Klara Spirak), announced 
that four-party coordination has begun with the participation of 
the SZDSZ, Fidesz, the Party of Entrepreneurs, and the Agrarian 
Alliance on the economic, agricultural, education, and public 
security programs. 
  The Agrarian Alliance also signed a cooperation agreement 
with the Green Alternative and the cochairperson [not further 
identified] voiced her criticism that during the past four years 
no sensible law was adopted on environment protection. If the 
Agrarian Alliance gets into parliament, it will ensure that 
environmental protection is given a much greater role.
