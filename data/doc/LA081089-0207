ON THE SIDELINES; 
OLYMPIANS TO LEAD SWIM TEAM 
Triple gold medal winner Janet Evans and world record holder Mike Barrowman 
will lead an American team competing in the Pan-Pacific swimming championships 
Aug. 17 to 20. 
Barrowman smashed Victor Davis' 5-year-old record in the 200-meter breast 
stroke last week at the U.S. Long Course National Championships, finishing in 2 
minutes, 12.90 seconds. 
Along with Evans, who won gold medals in the 400 and 800 freestyle and the 400 
individual medley at Seoul, Olympian Tracey McFarlane will swim for the U.S. 
team. With 52 members, the Americans are the largest group at the Pan-Pacific 
meet.
