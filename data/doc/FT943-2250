FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges ahead in mixed
trading
Wall Street
US share prices finished at mixed levels yesterday after solid gains struck
earlier in the session eroded in uncertain trading, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3.37 ahead at 3,936.72,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.34 at 470.85.
Volume on the Big Board was a moderate 272m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 1.27 at 461.13,
but the Nasdaq composite was down 1.19 at 776.72.
A dearth of fresh economic news allowed equity investors to put aside its
concerns over the pace of economic growth and concentrate on a few
favourable developments for key individual stocks.
The bond market was marginally supportive in that it managed to steady
itself after Friday's rout. Prices on the inflation-sensitive long end edged
higher but the advance lacked conviction. The market's overall tone remained
negative in view of last week's stronger-than-expected readings on
industrial production and capacity utilisation.
In equity trading, many stocks were showing surprising buoyancy during a
morning when only slim gains had been expected. But the lack of clear
direction eventually caught up with most stocks. By the end, declining
issues on the NYSE were leading advances by a four-to-three margin.
Coca-Cola was one of the companies fuelling the blue chip index's advance.
The stocks climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 48 7/8 on the company's
announcement that its third-quarter sales volume would exceed analysts'
projections, though its net income was expected to approximate earlier
forecasts.
Exxon gained Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59 1/2 after a jury ordered the energy
group to pay Dollars 5bn as punishment for its responsibility for the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill. The award, which had been announced late on Friday,
was not large enough to damage the company's long-term performance, analysts
said.
The court decision prompted Bear Stearns to lift its rating on Exxon. But
the securities house downgraded Atlantic Richfield, and its share price
back-tracked Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 101 1/2 as a result. Elsewhere,
Time-Warner was marked up Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 38 on a published report
which raised the possibility of the media group's merger with General
Electric. GE, which later denied such a move was under consideration,
slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 3/8 .
The NYSE's most active list was led by Digital Equipment. The stock jumped
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 26 1/8 after Cowen&amp;Company issued a 'strong buy'
recommendation, citing confidence that the computer company would soon
return to profitability.

Gains by gold stocks on the Toronto mGg Gg arket - as well as
utilities,paper and forestry shares - helped push the TSE-300 index higher

outnumbering losing issues 397 to 361. Volume of 60.77m and value of
