POP AND JAZZ CAPSULES : INNOCENCE MISSION: DREAMY DAY AT THE FAIR 
Poetry -- real poetry -- is a rarity in pop music lyrics. But Karen Peris, of 
the young Pennsylvania quartet the Innocence Mission, writes with economical 
grace and romance harking back sometimes to Elizabeth Barrett Browning. And 
Peris has a stunning voice (halfway between Kate Bush and Natalie Merchant) and 
melodies to match. 
Some of that was lost in an echoey mix at Cafe Largo, where the band opened a 
three-night engagement on Saturday, but the music, centering on Peris' gauzy 
keyboards and her husband Don's guitar, took on more dynamics than on the 
band's new debut album: a sound track for a dreamy day at the fair. The set was 
stingy (just 45 minutes) and perhaps a tad too low-key, but then it was just 
the band's first show of its first-ever tour. 
Peter Himmelman -- last seen doing "Hava Nagila" on the recent Chabad telethon 
with his father-in-law Bob Dylan and Harry Dean Stanton -- proved more seasoned 
as a solo acoustic opening act, reporting, in his best songs, on his search for 
eternal truths in a transitory world and imparting simple wisdoms between songs 
with an effectively offhand, jocular manner. 
The fine pairing concludes its Largo stint tonight, while the Innocence Mission 
is scheduled to perform live on KCRW-FM's "SNAP" program Wednesday evening.
