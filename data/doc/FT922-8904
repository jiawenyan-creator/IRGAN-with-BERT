FT  11 MAY 92 / Observer: Official dumping
Oh dear, has anyone else spotted that two identical versions of the
Maastricht Treaty are now on sale in Her Majesty's Stationery Office?
One is in the familiar A4-sized rough blue paper-covered format produced by
HMSO. It is priced at Pounds 13.30. The other is a smarter official EC
production, compete with glossy mediaeval map of Europe on its cover, and
priced at just Pounds 6.50.
This latest piece of unfair competition has already been spotted by Labour's
Lord Bruce of Donington. 'I have no doubt it is the result of a massive
subsidy from EC funds - they are never checked', he tells me. 'I think it's
horrific, but I'd bet not more three ministers, if that, have read this
document - at any price'.
