<DOCTITLE>Warm Creek Hydro, Inc. and Nooksack River Hydro, Inc.; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>



December 15, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has received the applications for the construction
and operation of (1) Warm Creek Project, and (2) Clearwater Creek Project. The Warm Creek Project would be located
on the Warm Creek, and the Clearwater Creek Project on the Clearwater Creek, both in Whatcom County, Washington. The
projects would have an installed capacity of 3,700 and 6,000 kilowatts, respectively.

Following scoping for the Warm Creek Project, the FERC staff has determined that licensing of the Warm Creek Project
could constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore,
the staff intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Warm Creek Project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Because the Clearwater Creek Project has the potential to affect some
of the same resources as the Warm Creek Project, we will analyze them together, and prepare a multiple project EIS for
the Warm Creek Project and the Clearwater Creek Project in accordance with NEPA.

The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the projects
and reasonable alternatives, and will include economic and engineering analyses.

A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in the final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be
presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.

This notice informs all interested individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and
concerns, that: (1) The Commission staff has decided to prepare an EIS; (2) the scoping conducted on the Warm Creek
Project for the Environmental Assessment_scoping meetings held April 6, 1994, at Hampton Inn, Bellingham, Washington,
and comments filed with the Commission by May 6, 1994_still apply; (3) additional comments for the Warm Creek Project
that may result from the change from an Environmental Assessment to an EIS may be filed with the Secretary, Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, within 30 days from the date of
this notice; and (4) a public scoping for the Clearwater Creek Project will be conducted early in 1995.
