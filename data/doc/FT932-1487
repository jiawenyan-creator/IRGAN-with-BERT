FT  23 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Fed says derivatives growth
understated
THE growth of the derivatives market may be exceeding estimates by trade
associations, according to Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve.
The Fed puts the total notional value of derivative instruments in the US
banking system at Dollars 7,000bn in the first quarter of the year, much
higher than estimates by the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, whose end-1991 figures, still widely cited, put the value of
derivatives globally at under Dollars 4,000bn. (Fed figures include foreign
exchange forward contracts and forward rate agreements.)
Mr Mullins added that notional value is not an accurate measure of exposure.
He said credit exposure for the same period, based on replacement value, was
just Dollars 140bn.
But increasing concern about creditworthiness and tougher competition has
concentrated that business among a much smaller group of players. Mr Mullins
says 90 per cent was conducted by just six US banks.
Although this concentration is of some concern, 'the institutions know who
they are and we should be able to supervise them,' he said. The US banks
most active in the derivatives market are Citibank, Chemical, JP Morgan,
Bankers Trust, BankAmerica, and Chase.
Meanwhile, the pace of research into derivatives shows no sign of abating.
The Group of 30 study on derivatives chaired by Sir Dennis Weatherstone is
expected to be published in July, while the technical committee of the
International Organisation of Securities Commissions will start a
derivatives working party in September.
