LAGUNA NIGUEL MAN PRESUMED DROWNED 
A Mormon missionary from Laguna Niguel is missing and presumed dead after the 
boat in which he was riding on Lake Atitlan last week capsized, church 
officials said Sunday. 
The family of Adam Leach, 19, traveled from Orange County to Guatemala last 
last week to aid in the search for the young missionary, but without success, 
according to Don Sedgwick, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints' local district. 
"They are obviously concerned as any family would be," Sedgwick said. "They're 
hopeful that he may still be alive, but that hope diminishes each day." 
Also presumed dead in the boating accident is Brian Bartholomew, 20, of 
Modesto, said Don LeFevre.
