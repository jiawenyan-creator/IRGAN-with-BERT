  [Text] Colombo, Feb. 10--The Indian High Commissioner in 
Sri Lanka, Mr. Nareshwar Dayal, has protested to the Sri Lankan 
Foreign Ministry against the activities of the Pakistan High 
Commission on the Kashmir issue. 
  Indian High Commission sources said "It is not in the 
diplomatic norms to announce public screening of films or 
propaganda material against a third country. And we have brought 
this to the notice of Colombo. The Government of India thinks it 
wise to ignore the rest of the routine propaganda that Islamabad 
has always whipped up. Let us see how things develop from here." 
  More than anything else, the concern of New Delhi seems to 
be 
to prevent Colombo from becoming another point for infiltration 
by Pakistani agents. India has expressed concern over the 
`infiltration' through Kathmandu and more recently from Dhaka, 
of persons suspected to be trained by Pakistan's Inter-Services 
Intelligence Agency. 
  High Commission sources say there are standing instructions 
that visas should not be given to third country nationals here 
for visiting India, without verifying the reasons and their 
antecedents from the mission in their country of origin. 
However, recently a group of Afghans landed in Madras with 
forged visas obtained through operators in Colombo. This was 
detected by the Immigration authorities. 
  The Foreign Ministry here has also been asked to step up the 
drive against these `agencies' which issue bogus passports and 
visas. It has come to notice that many Sri Lankans themselves 
have more than one passport obtained through these `operators' 
and they use a different one for each visit. 
  Recently, the U.S. Embassy too faced a problem, when 
advertisements appeared in the local press about a lottery for 
the issue of green cards. The Embassy promptly issued a counter 
advertisement appealing to the people not to be misled by any 
agency or operator. 
  Such agencies have become the order of the day and when 
travel has become so popular, they establish contacts with the 
embassies to obtain even a legal, visa through a short-cut. 
  The Indian High Commission in Colombo issues over 400 visas 
a 
day to all categories of travellers. A majority of Sri Lankans 
visiting India, are either pilgrims or patients, according to 
High Commission sources.
