FT  20 AUG 93 / Observer: Northern grit
The arrival of Martin Taylor at the top of Barclays Bank is good news for
Burnley. Apart from Charles Townley, the antique marble collector, James
Stevenson, the Hollywood actor, and General Scarlet of the Crimea war, the
Lancashire mill town has up to now been noted mainly for breeding
footballing talent, most of which was exported to keep Burnley Football Club
alive.
Despite Taylor's old Etonian education (he won a scholarship) and accent, he
is a Burnley lad at heart. His brother is a well-known local solicitor and
the local newspaper has dubbed him the 'Burnley-born genius'.
'He is so energetic it is tiring even to talk to him. He talks like he
lives. Fast]' says the Burnley Express, which also revealed the little known
fact that Taylor has been known to talk to himself. Who knows - the local
chamber of commerce might even name a park bench after him.
