FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (9): Many advantages,
except the cost factor - France, the high price of property deters potential
investors
THE OLIVE groves of Provence are not the most obvious location for one of
Europe's most successful business parks, yet nestling among the hills behind
Antibes on the Cote d'Azur is Sophia-Antipolis, a Silicon Valley-style
concentration of hundreds of production plants and offices.
Sophia-Antipolis is the sort of business park that governments tend to like
best.
It was founded as a science park in 1969 on a rocky patch of the Provencal
coast where the quality of the soil was so poor that even the lowliest local
farmers disdained it.
The patchy piece of Provence now houses 900 different companies spread
across 2,300 hectares.
Most of its occupants are subsidiaries of large multinational groups. Many
of the employees are senior executives or skilled technicians who have been
brought in from different regions. But the companies at the park have also
created thousands of jobs for local residents.
Sophia-Antipolis is an expensive place to operate. The rents are high and
each occupant is obliged to respect strict planning controls such as height
restrictions and tree replacement.
Yet, even at a time of widespread European recession, there is a waiting
list of would-be new occupants and Sophia-Antipolis is now regarded as a
role model for business and science parks throughout Europe.
The pros and cons of Sophia-Antipolis as a corporate location are, in many
ways, remarkably similar to those of France itself. Both offer the advantage
of good logistics and a high standard of living, but are burdened by the
disadvantage of comparatively high costs.
One of the main attractions of France to incoming businesses is its position
 -bang in the middle, between northern and southern Europe.
Only a few years ago it looked as though the expansion of eastern Europe
might make more central countries, such as Austria or Germany, more
attractive. But those fears have abated - partly because the challenge of
rebuilding eastern Europe has been so much more complicated than expected
and partly because the cost of operating in Austria and Germany can be even
higher than France itself.
Cordis, a US-owned medical products company, set up a production and
distribution centre at Sophia-Antipolis in 1984.
It has operated in Europe for 25 years from its original base in the
Netherlands, but decided in the early 1980s that it needed another base
which would be more accessible to southern Europe.
The company opted for Sophia-Antipolis, according to Mr Jacques Le Guillerm,
chief executive, mainly because it was in a pleasant environment and close
to an excellent airport.
Ease of access was also one of the main reasons that Disney, the US
entertainment group, chose France as the location for EuroDisneyland, its
extravagant theme park.
EuroDisneyland may have had more than its fair share of financial problems
since its launch in spring last year, but Disney has repeatedly defended its
choice of northern Paris as the park's location.
'The choice of France as the location is one thing that I'm sure we got
absolutely right,' said Mr Michael Eisner, Disney chairman.
The high quality of life in France is another factor that tends to tempt
companies to choose it as a business location.
Tepar, another occupant of Sophia-Antipolis, is the sort of company that
could be based anywhere in Europe.
It is a joint venture between five international oil groups, including
Texaco of the US and Elf Aquitaine of France, that operates a pan-European
payment card for truck drivers.
The only considerations for Tepar in choosing its location were good
communications - its executives need to travel regularly and it needs access
to a sophisticated computer system - the availability of multi-lingual staff
to staff its truckers' helpline and there is a pleasant environment for its
employees.
Mr Carl Clump, its British chief executive, says that southern France
satisfied all those criteria. He commutes to his Sophia-Antipolis office
from his home in rural Provence.
However, France has a significant disadvantage as a business location: cost.
One of the main areas of high expense is property, which is still costly
even after the recent fall in Paris property prices. Moreover, French local
government is so bureaucratic, particularly in areas such as planning, that
any company investing in France has to deal with a barrage of rules and
regulations.
THE employment system is also costly and complex. French workers generally
get a reasonable deal in terms of pay and employment protection. They have a
39-hour working week and guaranteed minimum wage, the Smic or salaire
minimum de croissance of FFr5,900 a month. Employers are obliged to make
substantial social security contributions for their workers and to observe a
relatively low retirement age of 60.
Further, the French trade unions are still comparatively strong -
particularly when it comes to defending members' interests. This scenario of
high costs and a potentially stroppy workforce undoubtedly deters some
companies from investing in the country.
This factor has even persuaded some businesses that are already there to
switch to less expensive locations. Earlier this year, Hoover, the US
household appliances company, cited the cost of operating in France as one
of the main reasons for its decision to switch part of the production at its
Dijon plant to a factory in Scotland. France's new centre-right government
has responded by trying to make the employment system more flexible.
Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister, recently unveiled a package of
proposals which included reducing employers' social security contributions
for low paid workers, replacing the 39-hour week with a more flexible annual
equivalent total and measures to encourage part-time working. It remains to
be seen whether Mr Giraud's measures will succeed.
In the meantime, Sophia-Antipolis shows no sign of suffering - it is now in
the throes of doubling in size to try to accommodate its prospective new
occupants.

EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS: DISMISSAL AND REDUNDANCY NOTICES
COMPARED
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
This listing shows the wide variations between European countries
concerning the length of notice required before an employer may
terminate an employment contract:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Austria: between six weeks and five months.
Belgium: three months for white collar staff; and between 28 and 56
  days for blue collar employees.
Finland: one month for all employees.
France: one to two months.
Germany: between six weeks and six months for white collar staff; and
  from two weeks to three months for blue collar employees.
Greece: between one month and two years.
Ireland: between one and eight weeks.
Italy: one to six months for white collar staff; and 15 days to four
  months for blue collar employees.
Luxembourg: between two to six months.
Netherlands: one to 26 weeks.
Norway: one to six months.
Portugal: none.
Spain: three months; the redundancy process is expensive and
  bureaucratic - large numbers of workers are employed on fixed-term
  contracts to get round these problems.
Sweden: one to six months.
Switzerland: one to three months.
United Kingdom: one to 12 weeks.

some parts of the UK, such as the East and West Midlands, Yorkshire and
Humberside.
