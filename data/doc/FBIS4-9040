  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/4/1994 -- Romanian Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu says in a message to the Crans Montana 
Forum meeting in Bucharest that in the political and economic 
context of transition toward market economy, toward integration 
in the European structures and openness to the world, economic 
flows experienced by South-Eastern Europe, Romania has a 
privileged position because of its human, industrial, and 
natural resources. 
  Premier Vacaroiu says also that Romania offers to the 
foreign 
investors a dynamic domestic market, swift access to neighboring 
external markets, a stimulating and continuously improving legal 
framework, well-trained and relatively cheap work force, 
numerous industrial capacities available for privatization, and 
many possibilities of cooperation with an industry in full 
process of restructuring, retooling, and privatization. All 
theses factors define an environment favorable to investments 
whose potential will be further increased by the new facilities 
granted to the foreign investors and the creation of a stock 
exchange, the first in the past 50 years, says the premier. 
  The Romanian prime minister says also that the fifth annual 
session of the Crans Montana Forum to be organized in Bucharest 
[over 21-24 April] is expressing the external dimension of the 
deep economic and political renewal that Romania undergoes. 
  Premier Vacaroiu expresses in his message the hope that 
while 
largely approaching the context of the political, economic, 
commercial, and investment relations between the North and the 
South and between the West and the East, the works of the Crans 
Montana Forum meeting in Bucharest will contribute to the 
exploration of the ways of achieving a Europe united in 
well-being and economic cooperation.
