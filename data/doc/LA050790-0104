WINING, DINING OF COUNTY AIDES DECRIED BY SOME; 
GOVERNMENT: ANY SUGGESTION THAT THE GIFTS ARE IMPROPER RAISES THE HACKLES OF 
CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS COUNTY OFFICIALS, WHO SEE FREE LUNCHES, 
DINNERS OR ROUNDS OF GOLF AS ROUTINE AND BENIGN. 
Last December, the Irvine Co. and four other corporations chipped in $2,420 to 
treat a group of county officials to an evening yacht cruise on Newport Harbor. 
Supervisor Don R. Roth attended the affair, replete with hot hors d'oeuvres, 
beer and wine and dancing. But most of the invitations set aside for county 
officials were directed to -- and accepted by -- 14 of the supervisors' 35 
appointed aides. 
In fact, the cruise during Newport Beach's Parade of Lights was among $9,650 in 
gifts -- from ballet tickets to rounds of golf -- that were accepted by aides 
to the five supervisors last year from lobbyists and others doing business with 
the county. 
According to reports filed with the county registrar of voters, the aides 
received more in gifts than the five elected supervisors themselves. 
"The Irvine Co. has a tradition of inviting employees, their spouses and guests 
from business and government to attend the Parade of Lights and share in this 
holiday celebration," read a brief statement issued recently by Larry Thomas, a 
vice president of the firm that is Orange County's largest developer. "We do it 
because it's fun." 
UC Irvine political science professor Mark P. Petracca, however, believes that 
corporate gift-givers commonly seek out the supervisors' aides because of the 
power they wield in providing advice and access to their bosses. 
"Lots of things are nice to have from people who can afford to give them (but) 
why were they given? What was the purpose?" Petracca poses. "It's access -- how 
quickly I let you in to see the supervisor." 
Petracca notes that such gift-giving in county government is most often 
practiced by major developers and businesses that hold or seek county contracts 
and can afford to entertain. 
"The Orange County Homeless Task Force isn't handing out any free basketball 
tickets or dinner chits to aides of supervisors," Petracca said. 
Any suggestion of impropriety, however, raises the hackles of corporate 
representatives as well as county officials, who see an occasional free lunch, 
dinner or round of golf as far more routine and benign. Even journalists 
occasionally pick up a tab for lunch, one aide noted. (No aides reported 
receiving gifts from journalists last year; gifts must be declared only if they 
total $50 or more from a single source over a one year period.) 
Some aides also argue that gift-taking nowadays is a far cry from the days of 
Peter Herman, a former aide to 5th District Supervisor Thomas F. Riley who 
reported $5,853 in gifts in 1985 alone. Herman left under fire in 1987 after it 
was revealed that he had accepted a free four-day stay in Hawaii from a 
developer. Herman now works for Hon Development Co., which last year gave one 
of Riley's aides a lunch, a birthday gift and a ham worth a total of $100, 
records show. 
Riley, who was disturbed by some of Herman's gift-taking, defended the 
practices of his current staff, who reported a total of $3,075 in gifts last 
year -- the highest among the five supervisory offices. 
"If I didn't like it I'd stop it," Riley said. "As far as I know they're not 
doing anything that's going to bring discredit to themselves or to Tom Riley or 
to the county. If they do I'll ask them to leave." 
Riley aide Mark J. Goodman reported 30 lunches and dinners and one breakfast 
with county developers or their consultants last year, as well as a free 
concert. The meals ranged from $6 to $25, according to his statement. 
Goodman, who briefly worked for a developer before joining Riley's staff as a 
transportation specialist, said he has close friends in the building industry 
and, in an abundance of caution, reports any meals they pick up -- even when no 
county business is discussed. 
Goodman, who recently ran unsuccessfully for Laguna Niguel City Council, said 
that despite free meals or campaign contributions he is always ready to tell 
developers "to go to hell when they come in with a bad project. . . ." 
"If a lunch can buy a favor you certainly have no business serving the public," 
Goodman said. 
But Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he believes gift-taking by county 
officials looks bad regardless of the intent. Vasquez reported no gifts during 
the three years he served as an aide to former Supervisor Bruce Nestande in the 
early 1980s. 
This year Vasquez reported accepting $746.85 in gifts, mostly in the form of 
formal dinners and receptions he attended. His staff was the only office to 
report less than $1,000 in gifts. The total for the office -- $330 -- was for 
three invitations accepted to the Christmas cruise. (The Newport Harbor cruise 
was financed by the Irvine Co. and three county contractors: Ernst &amp; Young, 
an accounting firm; LSA Associates Inc., an environmental consultant, and Van 
Dell &amp; Associates, an engineering firm working on the John Wayne Airport 
expansion. Also contributing was the Bechtel Corp., which is bidding to build 
the Las Vegas-to-Anaheim bullet train through a bistate transportation 
authority on which Supervisor Roth serves.) 
"I've always discouraged my staff from accepting any kind of gift as a matter 
of office policy," Vasquez said, "so that there's no real or perceived sense of 
conflict." 
The most generous gift-giver last year was the Philip Morris Cos. Inc. Along 
with its wholly owned subsidiary, the Mission Viejo Co., the corporate entity 
paid out $2,152 in lunches, ballet tickets and golf outings. As one of the 
largest developers in Orange County, the Mission Viejo Co. has frequent 
dealings with county officials, and its development agreements with the Board 
of Supervisors have sometimes been controversial. 
For example, slow-growth advocates and city officials in the South County have 
objected to an agreement in which the board guaranteed the company the right to 
complete its planned construction of 20,000 housing units in Aliso Viejo in 
exchange for millions of dollars in roads and other public facilities. The 
agreement effectively shields the developer from any efforts by local 
government to limit the development. 
"We have many projects before the the county and the supervisors' aides often 
give us insight into what the supervisors want to see in those projects," said 
Wendy Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the Mission Viejo Co. 
Wetzel also said Philip Morris sponsors several national ballets and gives free 
tickets to many business associates, including county staff. 
"It's nice to meet with people socially and get to know them when you don't 
have to discuss business." 
The second most generous company last year was Shapell Industries Inc. of 
Beverly Hills, which gave aides $848 worth of gourmet food baskets, concert and 
fashion show tickets and meals, according to disclosure reports. In 1989 
Shapell was awaiting the supervisors' final ruling on Country Village, proposed 
to be the largest housing development in Laguna Niguel -- more than 4,000 homes 
-- by the time it is complete. 
The project was once a subject of grand jury investigation and the target of a 
lawsuit brought by slow-growth advocates. Eventually a compromise was worked 
out with all parties and the supervisors gave final approval to a slightly 
scaled-back version of the project last December. 
Company officials did not return several calls for comment. 
Shirley Grindle, author of the county's Tin Cup campaign reform law and a 
self-proclaimed political watchdog, is a leading critic of gift-giving by 
corporate interests. Grindle said curbs on the practice were inadvertently left 
out of the reform law she authored, which was approved by the supervisors in 
December, 1978. 
Grindle said that gift-givers "want to be considered as part of the 'in-group' 
so they can get in to see the supervisors or the aides whenever they want to, 
which, by the way, a lot of citizens are unable to do. . . ." 
"You can't really avoid the appearance that those gifts are getting you votes 
or favorable treatment," Grindle said. "At the very least, it makes it 
uncomfortable to go against those who have been wining and dining you." 
Building industry executives dismiss such criticism, contending that to have a 
productive discussion with the aides it is sometimes necessary to get them away 
from the phone and other distractions in their county offices. It is often the 
aide who monitors the complex nuts and bolts of a project for the busy 
supervisor, they say. 
"Communications can take place at a $10 or $15 lunch," said Tom Daly, director 
of governmental affairs for Orange County's Building Industry Assn. "There is 
certainly nothing wrong with that and we believe it is healthy for democracy to 
communicate from top to bottom." 
The supervisory aide declaring the most in gifts last year was Barbara Ann 
Brown, an aide to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. Most of the $1,206 she reported 
in gifts was not received from corporate interests: She declared $900 in free 
dinners or receptions for various political campaigns. 
In second and third place were supervisory aides Dan L. Wooldridge, who 
declared $895 -- mostly in lunches and golf -- and Christine M. Smith, who 
declared $707 in lunches, fashion shows, ballet tickets and the December 
Christmas cruise. Both are aides to Supervisor Roth. 
Wooldridge says his office is scrupulous in reporting anything that might be 
considered a gift. Working lunches for a busy public official are a fact of 
life, he says. 
Wooldridge also dismisses the notion that aides wield great power in a 
supervisory office. 
"Any aide who thinks he makes the decisions is an aide who is not long for the 
world," Wooldridge said.
