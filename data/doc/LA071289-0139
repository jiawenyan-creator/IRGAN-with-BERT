WORLD; 
HAUGHEY FORMS COALITION WITH FOE 
Charles Haughey was elected as Ireland's prime minister for the fourth time 
today after reluctantly forming a coalition with his arch political foe. 
Haughey, an abrasive millionaire known as the Great Survivor in Irish politics, 
won by a vote of 84 to 79 when Parliament returned to select a new leader after 
an inconclusive general election plunged the country into a month-long 
political crisis. 
But he only managed to clamber back into power after agreeing to a coalition 
with the Progressive Democrats, formed three years ago by Haughey dissidents 
united in dislike of him.
