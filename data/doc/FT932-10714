FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Merry month of November
Sir, Why not choose November 11 as the alternative holiday to May Day? Our
European colleagues would find our celebrating the anniversary of the end of
hostilities an unlooked-for demonstration of community spirit. As the US
also celebrates Veterans Day, there would be minimal disruption to financial
markets on both sides of the Atlantic.
