FT  20 JUN 92 / EC seeks oilseed subsidy compensation talks
THE transatlantic wrangle over the European Community's oilseeds subsidies
took a new twist yesterday when the EC said it wanted to negotiate
compensation terms with the US under rules of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) that cover tariff increases.
The request, reluctantly accepted by Washington and approved by Gatt's
governing council, immediately prompted speculation that Brussels intended
to try to negotiate away its commitment under Gatt to duty-free access for
imports of oilseeds such as soyabeans, rapeseed and sunflower seeds.
The US, which claims its soyabean producers have lost Dollars 1bn (Pounds
540m) in sales to the Community because of EC subsidies, has already
threatened to slap punitive duties on Dollars 1bn of European exports if the
issue is not resolved.
The EC has threatened to retaliate if the US goes ahead with trade reprisals
outside Gatt procedures. However, yesterday's decision buys both sides more
time. Under Gatt's Article 28 (4) they now have 60 days to arrive at a
settlement.
US officials remain pessimistic about the chances of success. Mr Rufus
Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, told the Gatt council yesterday that, while
the US wanted a negotiated solution, it could not accept a deal that did not
directly address the problems faced by US soyabean producers. The EC has not
revealed what type of compensation - via lower tariffs on other goods - it
has in mind.
He said the compensation negotiations would be expensive for the EC, which
would have to cover not only the Dollars 1bn loss to US oilseed producers
from the subsidy regime but also a further Dollars 1bn of trade lost by
suppliers such as Argentina and Brazil.
