  [Excerpt] A new political party has just come into being in 
our country. The Party of Beninese Workers Rally [Parti du 
Rassemblement des Ouvriers du Benin, PROB] was inaugurated this 
morning at the Culture House, Ouidah. Its philosophy is to 
enlighten Benin's working class. Delegates to the PROB 
constituent assembly were drawn from all parts of the country. 
Drivers, performing artists, fishermen, and investors came 
together to create a platform for consultation and for the 
defense of their interests. In his opening speech, Mr. Basile 
Noukpliguidi, chairman of the party's preparatory committee, 
described the meeting as a crucial event in the struggle of 
Benin's working class. [passage omitted including indistinct 
portion]
