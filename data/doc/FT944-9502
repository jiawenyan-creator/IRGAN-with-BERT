FT  15 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Goldman widens staff
reshuffle
The global reshuffle at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has reached
Europe with the disclosure that at least six high-level executives based in
London or Frankfurt will move or retire as general partners.
Mr Bob Steel and Mr Rick Garonzik, co-heads of equities and fixed-income
operations, and Mr John Downing, head of equity capital markets, currently
based in London, are to return to New York. Mr Artur Walther, co-head for
Germany, is retiring.
The European operations are retrenching. They have suffered from adverse
trading conditions and will shortly complete across-the-board job cuts of
about 5 per cent.
Goldman yesterday conceded that its expansion from 1,550 employees in Europe
at the start of the year to 1,800 had been excessive. 'We overbuilt a bit,'
said Mr Eugene Fife, chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
Asia, as well as Europe, has seen high-level job turnover, with the
retirement as general partners of Mr Moses Tsang, who led the Hong Kong
office, and Mr Henry James, president of Goldman Sachs in Japan.
Overshadowing all these departures, however, was the surprise resignation
last week of Mr Mark Winkelman, head of worldwide fixed-income operations.
Mr Winkelman left after being passed over for promotion when Mr Stephen
Friedman stepped down as senior partner and Mr Jon Corzine took his place.
Goldman Sachs is a partnership and staff movements follow a biannual cycle
which is now reaching its peak. The firm selects new partners every even
year; and departures and transfers are usually timed to coincide with the
end of the firm's financial year on November 30.
Mr Corzine presented the restructuring as 'generational change that's
essential to make this firm vital'. He said: 'I don't think we are stripping
out the heart and soul of Goldman Sachs.' In Europe, the firm has taken on
14 new partners which, with the six departures, brings the total to 37.
