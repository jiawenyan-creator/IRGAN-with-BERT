  [Text] Ingush refugees will not be able to return to North 
Ossetia unless Ingushetia meets certain conditions, North 
Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov told Interfax in 
Vladikavkaz before flying to Moscow. 
  Galazov said that Ingushetia had to forego its claim on the 
Prigorodnyy District of North Ossetia and that the Ingush 
refugees had to understand they were North Ossetian citizens and 
were not allowed to sabotage the decisions of the local 
authorities. 
  He said it was important that the provisional administration 
let the local authorities organize the life of the North 
Ossetian population. 
  He believed that the use of force to return the refugees 
would result in an out-and-out civil war in the Caucusus which 
would spread to Russia proper.
