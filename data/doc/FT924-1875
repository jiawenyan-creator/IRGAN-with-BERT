FT  16 DEC 92 / Malawi dissidents condemn jailing
A group of Malawi dissidents yesterday condemned the jailing of their leader
and called for continued pressure on the government of President-for-life
Hastings Kamuzu Banda, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
The Alliance for Democracy (Aford) said in a statement issued in Lusaka that
the trial of its interim chairman, Mr Chakufwa Chihana, had been marked by
'unprecedented political interference in judicial proceedings'. Mr Chihana,
a trade unionist and long-time opponent of Mr Banda, was convicted in
Blantyre on Monday on two counts of sedition and jailed for two years.
