FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Dow Chemical tumbles in spite of
hitting target
SHARES in Dow Chemical tumbled Dollars 3 1/8 in heavy trading yesterday
morning in spite of on-target third-quarter earnings from the US chemicals
group, before closing at Dollars 56 3/8 for a net fall of Dollars 2 1/2 .
Analysts were at a loss to explain the stock's movement, given the 9 per
cent decline in Dow's third-quarter net income to Dollars 139m, or 50 cents
a share, was what most analysts had predicted.
A year earlier, Dow posted net income of Dollars 153m, or 55 cents. Sales in
the 1993 quarter fell 8 per cent to Dollars 4.37bn from Dollars 4.75bn. Mr
Leonard Bogner, senior chemical analysts at Prudential Securities, said some
investors were concerned by the company's large loss in Europe.
He blamed Dow's poor European performance on seasonal factors and foreign
exchanges losses rather than a downward spiral in business. 'Since the end
of the third quarter, volumes have picked up and prices in Europe have
improved,' he said.
Mr Bogner cut his full-year estimates to Dollars 2.30 a share from Dollars
2.38, but maintained his 1994 estimates at Dollars 3.50.
Mr Jeff Cianci, analyst at Bear, Stearns noted Europe was particularly weak
in the quarter, but left his 1993 earnings projections of Dollars 2.24
unchanged.
During the quarter, sales for chemicals and performance products dropped 11
per cent to Dollars 1bn while operating income plunged 31 per cent to
Dollars 76m.
Dow blamed falling prices for caustic soda and magnesium for the poor
performance of its chemicals and metals operations. It said performance
products had higher profits in spite of lower sales in Europe.
Sales of plastics fell 8 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn, but operating income
grew 41 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 110m, led by Dow's thermosets and
fabricated products businesses in the US.
Sales of hydrocarbons and energy rose 6 per cent to Dollars 453m. The sector
had operating income of Dollars 12m, compared with an operating loss of
Dollars 8m.
Sales of Dow's consumer specialties group fell 10 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn
and operating income dropped 27 per cent to Dollars 166m.
Mr Enrique Falla, executive vice-president, said Dow saved more than Dollars
200m in research, promotion, selling and administrative expenses and
interest charges compared with 1992.
