SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background on the Utah Program


On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program. General background information
on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16,
and 944.30.


II. Proposed Amendment


By letter dated March 7, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT899). Utah submitted the proposed amendment on its own initiative to ``streamline the Utah program
and to simplify the process for revising permits.'' The provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposed
to revise were Utah Administrative Rules (Utah Admin. R.) 645303224.400, .500, and .600, regarding
the requirements for significant permit revisions.
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the March 28, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 14377), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT910). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period ended on April 27, 1994.


III. Director's Findings


As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds that the proposed program
amendment submitted by Utah on March 7, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations and
no less stringent than SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment.


Utah Admin. R. 645303224.400, .500, and .600, Significant Permit Revisions


Utah's rules at Utah Admin. R. 645303224 set forth those conditions under which an operator's application
for a permit change must be processed by Utah as a significant permit revision. In these rules, Utah proposed to delete
Utah Admin. R. 645303224.400 and to recodify Utah Admin. R. 645303224.500 and .600 as
Utah Admin. R. 645303224.400 and .500, respectively. The rule proposed for deletion requires that
permit changes that are ordered by the Division in accordance with Utah Admin. R. 645303212 and 213 (the
provisions authorizing the Division to order permit revisions) must always be processed as significant permit revisions.
The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) requires each State with primacy to establish guidelines for determining
when a permit revision must be subjected to all of the permit application information requirements and procedures
of 30 CFR, Subchapter G, including the notice, public participation, and notice of decision requirements at 30 CFR
773.13, 773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21. In addition, 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) requires that the above requirements
and procedures shall apply, at a minimum, to all ``significant'' permit revisions. The Federal regulation does not
define the term ``significant.'' Instead, the Federal regulation allows each State to determine, for itself, when
a permit revision is significant, and when it is not significant.
