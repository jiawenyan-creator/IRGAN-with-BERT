FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: OMV recovers to post first-half
Sch240m profit
OMV, the Austrian integrated petroleum and chemicals group, has reported
consolidated pre-tax profit of Sch240m (Dollars 22m) for the first half,
compared with a loss of Sch552m in the corresponding period last year.
The partially privatised group said turnover was flat at Sch40.1bn as
conditions in many of its markets remained weak. However, it was still
aiming to make a profit in the full year through continued cost cutting.
As expected, the pre-tax profit in the second quarter, at Sch50m, was
considerably smaller than that in the first quarter. This was mainly due to
squeezed refinery margins.
The exploration and production division fell into a Sch380m loss in the
first half compared with a profit of Sch260m, due to lower crude oil prices,
lower domestic gas sales and accounting changes.
The Schwechat refinery also went into the red in the second quarter because
of a slump in gasoline margins, but higher profits at the Burghausen
refinery prevented any erosion from the Sch130m profit made by the refining
division in the first quarter. It suffered a Sch380m loss in the first half
last year.
The gas division's profit rose 26 per cent to Sch860m in spite of lower
prices and reduced transport business. The gas storage arm performed well,
taking advantage of increased capacity.
Profit in the marketing division jumped from a nominal Sch30m in the first
half of 1993 to Sch150m in the same period of this year, mainly due to cost
cutting within the domestic network.
The group said it saw 'the first signs of a recovery' in its long troubled
chemicals business in the second quarter, but the reduction in first-half
losses to Sch60m from Sch430m was attributed mainly to cost-cutting.
Similarly, plastics sales rose 4 per cent to Sch3.76bn on higher volumes,
and the division reduced its loss from Sch710m to Sch460m.
