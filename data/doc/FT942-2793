FT  17 JUN 94 / Underwriters braced for Eurotunnel hangover
Eurotunnel's shares closed 14p lower at 303p yesterday, raising the
likelihood that the underwriting syndicate may have to take up a significant
portion of one of the UK's largest ever rights issues. The price of the
UK-listed Eurotunnel units has fallen 18 per cent since June 6.
Underwriters were confident yesterday that small shareholders would take up
their rights in the Pounds 858m share offer, despite the absence of free
travel incentives, but they can ill afford a further fall in the share
price.
The underwriters have a cushion with the rights shares priced at 265p. The
burden will also be eased by fees: Eurotunnel is paying Pounds 42m,
including legal and accountancy costs. The offer closes on Wednesday.
