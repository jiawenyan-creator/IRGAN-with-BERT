FT  04 JUN 92 / Warning on council job cuts after redundancies ruling
LOCAL-AUTHORITY employ-ers warned yesterday that compulsory redundancies
were more likely after North Tyneside council was refused leave to appeal in
the Lords against a decision declaring an enhanced redundancy scheme
unlawful.
Councils were forced to suspend similar schemes last October when the High
Court agreed with the Audit Commission, the public-expenditure watchdog,
that North Tyneside's payments were 3 1/2 times what it was authorised to
pay.
Many councils are considering cutting staff. Mr Stephen Bubb, assistant
secretary at the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities,
said it increased the likelihood that jobs would have to be shed through
compulsory rather than voluntary means.
North Tyneside, a Labour-controlled authority, was charge-capped in 1990. It
introduced the severance scheme because it said it would have to shed 1,100
jobs to meet the capping level.
However, Mr David Allsop, district auditor for North Tyneside, asked the
High Court to rule that the council had wrongly approved enhanced payments
that were Pounds 1.8m in excess of what it was obliged to offer under the
1972 Superannuation Act.
The council said it had the power to make enhanced payments under the 1972
Local Government Act.
About 350 of the council's employees received payments, while another 59
were frozen pending the High Court hearing.
