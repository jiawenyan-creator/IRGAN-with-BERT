FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson unit leaps 156%
JARDINE International Motor Holdings (JIMH), the motor trading arm of the
Jardine Matheson group of Hong Kong, yesterday announced a 156 per cent leap
in net earnings to USDollars 29.7m for the six months to June, from
USDollars 11.6m a year earlier.
The results were up from a low base, with luxury car sales hit by the Gulf
war in 1991. But profits were ahead of most expectations, because of the
strength of sales of the new Mercedes-Benz S series car in Hong Kong and
China.
JIMH said growth was strong in China. The strength of Asian sales was
partially off-set by its performance in Australia, the UK and US. Its new
Lancaster dealerships in the UK were badly affected by the recession, while
profit margins weakened further in Australia.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'The strength of the demand for
Mercedes-Benz cars in Hong Kong and China will enable the group to achieve
excellent results for the full year.' The company recommended an interim
dividend of 1.06 US cents, compared with 0.72 cents last time.
