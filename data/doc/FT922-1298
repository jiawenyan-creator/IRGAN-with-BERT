FT  23 JUN 92 / Observer: The point of no return
If you are going to get fired, it is hard to imagine a more dramatic exit
than that just made by Stephen Chao. Until a week ago, young Chao was one of
the rising stars in Rupert Murdoch's media empire. Then he thought up this
really great idea of how to grab his managers' attention and impress the
boss at a conference in Colorado.
The newly named president of Fox Television stations had wanted to
illustrate a point during a talk on censorship to managers from Murdoch's
News Corp and Fox's parent. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times,
Chao hired a male stripper to disrobe in front of the audience, although it
was unclear what point he was trying to make. Whatever, it came as a great
embarrassment to Murdoch and his assorted guests - including US defense
secretary Dick Cheney.
An enraged Murdoch told Chao that he was fired. 'Sometimes the hardest job a
captain has is to terminate his best lieutenant,' Murdoch is reported as
saying. 'But one thing this company has to stand for is that there are
limits.' It may come as a surprise to readers of The Sun and the News of the
World that Murdoch is a bit of a prude at heart.
