  [Text] Korea has temporarily withheld the submission of its 
final offer list to implement the Uruguay Round [UR] of global 
trade agreement under the auspices of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, government officials said. All 117 member 
countries of GATT that participated in the multilateral trade 
liberalization talks were supposed to present their offer lists 
by Feb. 15 based on the package conclusion reached last Dec. 15 
after seven and a half years of negotiations. Only 10 
countries, however, had met the deadline as of Friday, they said. 
  Unconfirmed reports here attributed the foot-dragging by 
other countries in presenting their country schedules to 
failures to do so by the two biggest participants -- the United 
States and Japan -- over last-minute differences on tariff 
reduction matters. Washington reportedly is calling for 
additional tariff reductions by Japan and is deliberately 
postponing the submission of its offer lists. The government 
officials, however, say all they have heard about it from the 
U.S. officials in this regard was that the heavy snow that hit 
parts of the United States has delayed the printing of the 
related documents. "We doubt the deliberate postponement of the 
list presentation by the United States because once the deal was 
made, there can be no renegotiations of the GATT round," said an 
official of the Economic Planning Board. 
  The official, apparently conscious of the assertions of some 
government critics here calling for partial renegotiations of 
the farm sector agreement, flatly denied any room for a renewed 
deal on the agreement. 
  As to why the government has not tendered its list to the 
GATT secretariat, the official said that it is because the 
government does not want to give the impression it is hurrying 
to seal the Uruguay Round deal while there are still voices of 
disagreement.
