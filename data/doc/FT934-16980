FT  04 OCT 93 / The search for both more and better jobs
IN 1993, says the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) from the International
Monetary Fund, unemployment in industrial countries is expected to surpass
32m, 3m more than in 1982, the trough of the previous recession.* The social
and economic costs of this are enormous.
Little wonder, then, that the Clinton administration is planning a summit on
global unemployment this autumn. Little wonder, too, that the European
Community, whose overall unemployment rate is projected by the IMF at close
to 12 per cent in 1994, is engaged upon its own analysis of the obstacles to
employment.
Yet we already know something about both the employment problem and the
possible solutions. First, as is emphasised in the WEO, the growth of
unemployment since the early 1970s, particularly in the EC, can be explained
neither by accelerated productivity growth nor by faster growth of trade
with developing countries.
Second, the relationship between the growth of output and employment has
varied enormously across the leading industrial countries (see chart).
Third, those differences in labour-absorption have, as could be predicted,
been inversely related to growth of real wages. Last, differences in the
performance of overall employment have not had equivalent effects on the
unemployment, still less on the non-employment, of unskilled males.
The trend growth of labour productivity has fallen from 5 per cent a year in
the EC of 30 years ago to a little over 1 per cent a year now. Nevertheless,
unemployment has risen almost continuously, from 2 per cent of the EC labour
force in 1970. Similarly, the growth of trade with developing countries has
been insufficient to explain rising unemployment and deteriorating unskilled
male employment. The failure has been the poor capacity of these economies
to generate new jobs in place of those that are lost.
Between 1972 and 1992, real gross domestic product rose by 61 per cent in
the US, by almost exactly the same proportion in France and Germany, by a
little more in Italy, and by a little less in the UK. Yet employment rose by
43 per cent in the US, and by very little in France, Germany, Italy and the
UK (see chart).
If output growth is the same, while employment growth is very different,
increases in real wages will, failing implausibly large shifts in the share
of wages in value added, also differ. Between 1972 and 1992 US average real
wages fell by about 10 per cent. Over the same period, French real wages
rose by some 76 per cent, Italian wages by 68 per cent, British wages by 48
per cent and German wages by 43 per cent. It is not difficult, therefore, to
see why Americans voted for a man who promised them more 'good jobs'.
Where the two different patterns seem to give roughly the same unhappy
result is for male non-employment. As Edward Balls pointed out, in this
space on September 6, male non-employment has risen almost everywhere.
Unskilled men will not take, or are not offered, the new jobs created in a
US-style deregulated labour market, while there are few new jobs of any kind
in the more regulated ones.
One response might be for unskilled males to be told firmly that their
expectations are unrealistic, with employers neither needing brawn nor
offering long-term, full-time employment to the unskilled. Quite a different
possibility would be to provide job subsidies specifically for unskilled
males.
The best possibility, however, would be to imitate the Japanese. Between
1972 and 1992, Japanese GDP rose by 119 per cent, Japanese employment by 25
per cent and Japanese real wages by 41 per cent, while unemployment remained
negligible. The Japanesesolution was the highest rate of formation of
physical and human capital in the industrial world, combined with a labour
market that gave new job opportunities to outsiders and job protection to
insiders. This is the only route towards the magic trio of higher output,
higher employment and better jobs.

     INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS - PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.

production: data from national government sources. Includes mining,
manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan
(mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction

as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official
sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total
civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US -
help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all
jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite
leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical
fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general
economic activity.
