  [Text] Zagreb, May 20 (TANJUG) -- Only one in ten citizens 
of the Republic of Croatia is satisfied with the situation in 
his country, a public opinion poll published by the Zagreb paper 
TV-BEST showed. After the breaking up of the ruling Croatian 
Democratic Union (HDZ) which resulted in a parliamentary crisis 
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, the poll was 
conducted on a representative sample of 2,000 people. As many 
as 50.7 percent of Croatian citizens said they were dissatisfied 
with the situation in Croatia and 32.8 percent that they were 
very dissatisfied. The major cause of dissatisfaction for more 
than 85 percent of Croatians is a drop of living standard and 
theft while for 60 percent of the polled said the major cause of 
all troubles was incompetence of the country's leadership. The 
Republic of Croatia proclaimed independence in January 1992 
after violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation.
