FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Austrian Airlines sees wider
loss
AUSTRIAN Airlines expects this year's pre-tax loss from operations to jump
60 per cent to about Sch700m (Dollars 61.4m) in spite of substantial
reductions in operating costs.
Mr Herbert Bammer, joint chief executive, made the gloomy forecast at a
press conference in Vienna yesterday to disclose first-half results.
It will be the third successive operating loss for the partially privatised
airline. The dividend was passed last year and the group has made clear that
none will be paid this year.
In the first half, Austrian suffered a pre-tax loss of about Sch400m
compared with a loss of Sch251.7m on flat revenues of Sch5.3bn. The net loss
expanded to Sch290m from Sch126m, mainly because of severe price
competition. The number of passengers carried was up 3 per cent to 1.4m.
Mr Bammer said the airline would consider scrapping loss-making long haul
routes, possibly including transatlantic ones. 'We have no prestige routes
which we have to fly at any cost,' he said.
On the other hand, Austrian was continuing to build up its profitable
services to eastern Europe, with plans to add Tirana and Odessa to its
schedule this winter.
Austrian is in discussions with Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Scandinavian Airlines System aimed at combining forces to increase their
market power. Austrian's management expects to make a recommendation to its
board on the proposed co-operation or on alternative tie-ups by the end of
August.
Swissair denied reports that it would buy the 36 per cent of the shares of
Balair that it does not own. Balair is a quoted Swiss charter airline.
Swissair said that it was possible that it would make an offer for the
shares, but no decision had been made and it would not happen in the near
future.
