FT  27 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Losses in oils offset bond
yields decline
Wall Street
US share prices ended a shortened day little changed from opening values as
the positive impact of another decline in bond yields was offset by losses
in oil stocks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the 1 pm close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.08 at
3,684.50. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.70 at
463.06, while the Amex composite was 0.05 lower at 463.46, and the Nasdaq
composite 1.69 higher at 754.87. Trading volume on the NYSE was 91m shares.
Trading reopened after Thanksgiving in subdued mood. Many participants chose
to stay away from the markets and extend the holiday into the weekend, and
the New York Stock Exchange agreed to end trading early at 1 pm.
The main feature of the day was falling oil prices.
The declines were sparked by the failure of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (Opec) to agree on cutting oil production levels.
Energy market analysts, who had been expecting an agreement on production
cuts, were surprised by the development, and oil prices dropped sharply to a
new five-year low.
This was positive for bonds, because falling oil prices will help dampen
worldwide inflation. Consequently, Treasury prices rallied, with the
benchmark 30-year bond rising more than half a point, lowering its yield to
6.26 per cent.
While this was good news for equity investors, who have been unsettled
lately by rising bond yields, it caused havoc among oil shares. This, in
turn, depressed the Dow, because the average is heavily weighted in oil
stocks.
Among the biggest decliners Texaco lost Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 63 3/4 ,
Exxon fell Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 61 5/8 , Mobil dropped Dollars 3 5/8 at
Dollars 75, Phillips Petroleum fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 ,
British Petroleum lost Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 58 3/4 and Royal Dutch
Petroleum slipped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 100.
What was bad for oil companies, however, was good for airlines, which will
enjoy the benefits of lower jet fuel costs. UAL rose Dollars 4 1/8 to
Dollars 143 1/2 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, added Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 67 3/8 , USAir put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 13 3/4 and Delta rose
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/2 .
Optimism about consumer demand during the Christmas shopping season
supported retail stocks. JC Penney rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 53, the
Limited firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 23, Sears added Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 55 3/4 , and May Department Stores firmed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
44.
Philip Morris, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 56 3/8 , continued to benefit from
its recently announced plan to cut corporate costs by closing plants and
laying off thousands of workers. AT&amp;T, whose NCR subsidiary also announced a
cost-cutting programme this week, rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 55 3/4.
