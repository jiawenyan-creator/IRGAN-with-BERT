PARENT FIRM TO GO ON WITH PLAN FOR DANA POINT 
A U.S. executive with Qintex Australia Ltd. said Friday that the company's plan 
to build a luxurious resort in Dana Point is still on track, despite the 
bankruptcy of a subsidiary. 
The subsidiary, Qintex Entertainment, filed for protection from creditors this 
week after missing a $5.9-million payment to MCA Inc. that it owed under a film 
distribution agreement. 
The bankruptcy was one more sign of trouble at Qintex Australia Ltd., the 
parent company, which owns 43% of Qintex Entertainment's stock. 
Just last week, Qintex Australia Ltd. saw its $1.5-billion purchase of the 
MGM/UA film studios fall through when Qintex was unable to scrape together what 
was essentially a $50-million down payment. 
"The companies are completely separate entities," said the executive, who asked 
not to be identified. "As of today, there's no indication there'll be any 
impact at all on the resort." But local officials worried Friday that Qintex 
might back out of the resort project. 
"We're anxiously waiting to hear something definite on this," said Dana Point 
Mayor Eileen Krause. The resort hotel could bring a big increase in tax revenue 
to the small, newly incorporated city. 
At least one local company wasn't worried, however. Stein-Brief Group said its 
deal to sell Qintex 232 acres in Dana Point for the resort has already been 
closed. Sources said most of the $132-million price of the land had already 
been paid in cash to Stein-Brief and its partner, Hawaiian hotel developer 
Hemmeter Corp. 
Not yet closed, sources said, is the sale of a further 115 acres in Dana Point, 
owned by Chandler-Sherman Corp., to Qintex for $115 million. Chandler-Sherman 
said it does not talk to the media and refused to comment on the deal. 
An Australian stock analyst, Bryan Madden of Prudential-Bache in Melbourne, 
said Qintex had made only a deposit on the Chandler-Sherman property and was 
deferring payment of most of the $115 million until 1991.
