FT  25 MAY 94 / New German President Herzog outside Schloss Bellevue
Germany's outgoing President Richard von Weisacker with his successor, Roman
Herzog, and their wives outside the president's residence, Schloss Bellevue,
yesterday. The election of Mr Herzog, a Christian Democrat, sparked fresh
exchanges between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU and the Social Democrats
yesterday. SPD leader Rudolf Scharping struck an unusually shrill tone by
questioning the legitimacy of the electoral college vote because it ignored
opinion polls he said showed more popular support for the SPD's candidate,
Mr Johannes Rau. Kohl branded as hypocritical the SPD's criticism and
challenged the disappointed party either to accept the procedure or to
campaign to change it. He said the SPD were 'poor losers'.
