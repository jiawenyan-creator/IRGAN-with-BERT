FT  28 MAR 94 / Observer: Black's moves to pinkness
Newspaper tycoons are ambitiously energetic types, and Conrad Black, who
controls the Telegraph group, is no exception. The US, Canada, Israel and
Australia - he has interests there as well as the UK.
Black's interests are widespread, as is illustrated by an intriguing story
only now surfacing. More than a year ago he held discussions with Emap, the
UK regional newspaper and magazine group run by Robin Miller, about
launching a new British financial daily. There was even a name pencilled in
to edit it - former Financial Times journalist Clive Wolman, now financial
editor of the Mail on Sunday.
Word is, Black and Miller were not planning a full frontal assault on the
FT, but were instead looking at a mid-market tabloid format. The idea died,
apparently because it was thought not to be viable. But 'never say never'
might well be Black's motto . . .
