U.S. BISHOPS' PR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ABORTION 
The editorial states that "public relations and polling are not instruments of 
. . . moral argument" and should not be employed by the bishops. On the 
contrary; these are just the tools that should be used, since their worth is 
proven. 
From its founding, the church has tried to be resourceful in conveying the 
Gospel to all persons. This has never meant confining its message to the inside 
of a building. Today, the church attempts to be effective by utilizing current 
information-gathering methods -- including polling, or even consulting experts 
in non-theological fields, e.g., medicine, psychology or sociology. 
For The Times to argue that modern forms of information collection and 
disbursement are inappropriate for the bishops and are properly "tools of 
election politics" is to suggest that the church may not employ legitimate 
modes of communication. In other places and ages, the term used to describe The 
Times' position -- restricting ordinary forms of religious expression -- has 
been called "repression" or sometimes "censorship." Or can The Times propose a 
modern epithet for the ancient notion of discrimination?
