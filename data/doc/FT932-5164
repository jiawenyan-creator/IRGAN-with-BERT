FT  05 JUN 93 / Gatt panel to study row over steel duties
THE subsidies committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
yesterday decided to set up an independent disputes panel to hear the
European Community's complaint against countervailing duties imposed by the
US on imports of some European steel products.
The EC said yesterday the US system for calculating subsidies and
compensating duties had 'lost touch with reality'. Punitive duties had been
imposed where no subsidies existed, and the amount of the alleged subsidy
was 'excessively inflated' by 'artificial comparisons and arbitrarily chosen
benchmarks'.
The panel investigation, which is to be completed within 60 days, will look
at the US methods of calculating the definitive countervailing duties
imposed last January on imports of certain hot rolled lead and bismuth
carbon steel products worth Dollars 19m a year from France, Germany and
Britain.
Provisional countervailing duties on other steel products, yet to be
confirmed, are not included in the panel inquiry.
