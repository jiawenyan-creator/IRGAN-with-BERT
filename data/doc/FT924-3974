FT  04 DEC 92 / Observer: Recalled
Good to see Gordon Waddell - former rugby international, progressive South
African politician and Anglo-American high-flier - get a proper job at last.
It is five years since he quit South Africa and the chairmanship of
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, better known to old mining
hands as 'Johnies'.
Although Waddell, now 55, was married to Harry Oppenheimer's daughter for a
while, his rise up the Anglo empire was due to his undoubted business
prowess. Hence it has been rather surprising that he has kept such a low
profile since returning to the UK. Apart from a non-executive directorship
of Cadbury Schweppes and an investment trust, his only other interest was a
tiny company on the USM. The chairmanship of Shanks &amp; McEwan should give him
something to get his teeth into at last.
Who knows, he might even turn it into Britain's answer to America's Waste
Management Inc?
