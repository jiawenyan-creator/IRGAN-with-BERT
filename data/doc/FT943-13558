FT  19 JUL 94 / Observer: Eggshausting
Don't talk about roast chicken in Japan; it's something of a problem right
now.
Some southern parts of the country are experiencing the driest, hottest
summer for 20 years. Very nice for tourists perhaps, but tough on chickens.
In the past three weeks, some 110,000 chickens have expired on poultry farms
in Tokushima, a southern state where 6.4m, or about 5 per cent of Japan's
chicken population live.
The problem is the heat. Last week, local temperatures reached 38.4 degrees
Celsius - 101 Fahrenheit - the highest since records started in 1929.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Though hardly a useful
motto for chickens.
