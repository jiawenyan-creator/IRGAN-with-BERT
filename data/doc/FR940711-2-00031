SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This proposal was a solicited application. The National Geothermal Association (NGA) will be merging with the Geothermal
Resources Association (GRA) in the spring of 1994 and together will represent, through membership, practically
the entire geothermal industry. The newly formed industry association will be called the Geothermal Energy Association
(GEA). The Department believes that the proposed effort will benefit the public, and that providing financial assistance
through a grant mechanism is an appropriate method to providing funding. Competition for this effort would have an
adverse effect on continuity and completion of the activities.


The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``*** providing the scientific and educational
foundation and technology *** necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy
sources, and access to technical information***'' (quotation from the Energy Mission Statement).
The National Geothermal Association (NGA) will do this by providing services to support the geothermal industry
through various activities and will work to create a business environment in which the industry can thrive.
Through this financial assistance the NGA (a non-profit organization) will mount an aggressive campaign of information
dissemination, technology transfer and outreach. The objectives for this grant are as follows:
(1) Geothermal Energy Conference_The second annual conference on geothermal energy will be held in the Washington,
D.C. area approximately 1 month after this Agreement is in place.
(2) Geothermal EPACT/Climate-Change Action Group_This group will be comprised of representatives of the geothermal
industry, the utility industry, utility regulators and environmental- and energy-advocacy groups. The purpose
of the group will be to devise initiatives that the geothermal industry and DOE could undertake through cost-sharing
arrangements and that address accelerated use of geothermal resources in the United States, thereby helping to reduce
greenhouse gases.
(3) Utility Outreach Program_The NGA will provide the data and documentation that utilities and utility commissioners
need in order to understand geothermal power generation better and incorporate it into their portfolios.
(4) Develop information on Exporting Goods and Services_Information will be developed that will aid the U.S. geothermal
industry in exporting its goods and services.
(5) Environmental Brochure_A brochure will be developed with the theme ``Geothermal is Clean Air''.
(6) Quarterly Newsletter_A quarterly newsletter on geothermal energy will be published and widely distributed.
(7) Educational Cooperative-Action Alliance_Formation of an alliance to exchange information and coordinate
activities of the various entities in the geothermal community who are producing educational materials.
(8) Washington, D.C. Office_The NGA will maintain an office in the Washington, D.C. area. The purpose of this office
is to develop and maintain the contacts that are necessary for the operation of a domestic as well as an international
export program, to provide educational assistance to various environmental, public interest, and government groups,
and to be able to respond rapidly to problems and opportunities that arise in Washington, D.C. No lobbying activities
will be supported through the funds provided by this grant.)
The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high, given that the NGA has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors.
The staff of the National Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to provide this service. The NGA President
and President elect, respectively, is Tsvi Meidav and Phillip Michael Wright. After the merger of the NGA and GRA into
the Geothermal Energy Association, the Chairman position will be shared jointly by Phillip Michael Wright and David
R. Cox (Chairman of the GRA). David Anderson will serve as the Western Executive Director; he has been the Executive
Director of the NGA since it was established in 1985. These individuals are highly respected throughout the geothermal
industry.
The NGA's base of operation is an office in Davis, California, and is fully capable of meeting their needs.
The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.
The public benefit to be derived from the above mentioned projects and activities are an enhanced awareness of the
benefits of geothermal energy. All of the NGA's proposed activities, projects and efforts are to enhance the competitive
position of the U.S. geothermal industry in the domestic and international energy markets, to develop and conduct
educational programs on geothermal energy and to distribute information. Through this program the NGA will be supporting
the U.S. geothermal industry's efforts to bring more clean, domestic geothermal energy on line.
The services provided through the proposed grant fully support the program's direction and objectives. The National
Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to perform the above mentioned tasks. The NGA is an accepted and
respected industry association and has about 40 member companies, largely from the geothermal service industries.
The NGA has established an information network which is continually growing. Competition for this effort would have
a significant adverse impact on the accomplishment and completion of the proposed activities.
