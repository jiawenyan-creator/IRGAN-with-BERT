The president of an Oklahoma construction company testified that he bribed 
American Indian officials and pretended that a housewife of Indian descent was 
the principal owner of his firm so he could get lucrative contracts to build 
Indian housing. Kraig Kendall, president of K&amp;T Homes Inc., told a Senate 
panel in Washington that the government's policy of requiring companies to have 
51% Indian ownership to win Indian-related contracts was "an invitation for 
fraud and fronts."
