 

Application Submission and Deadlines 


A. Preapplication Letter of Intent 



In order to schedule and conduct site visits as part of the formal review process, potential applicants are encouraged
to submit a nonbinding letter of intent to apply to the Grants Management Officer (whose address is given in this section,
Item B). It should be postmarked no later than one month prior to the submission deadline (September 24, 1994, for October
24, 1994, submission deadline). The letter should identify the relevant announcement number for the response, indicate
the submission deadline which will be met, name the principal investigator, and specify the injury control theme
or emphasis of the proposed center (e.g., acute care, biomechanics, epidemiology, prevention, intentional injury,
or rehabilitation). The letter of 
intent does not influence review or funding decisions, but it will enable CDC to plan the review more efficiently.

Applicants should use Form PHS398 (Rev. 9/91) and adhere to the ERRATA Instruction Sheet for PHS398
contained in the Grant Application Kit. The narrative section for 

each
