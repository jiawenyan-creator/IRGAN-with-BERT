FT  12 JUL 94 / People: Burgmans to head southern Europe for Unilever
Antony Burgmans, Unilever's director of personal products, is about to swap
the world of perfumes and toothpaste for that of ice creams and beverages.
On August 1, he takes up a new appointment on Unilever's Foods Executive as
director for southern Europe, succeeding Charles Miller-Smith, just
appointed chief executive of ICI. The three-strong executive oversees the
smooth running of the group's foods businesses around the world, divided
between north and south Europe and the US.
The appointment will take Burgmans, 47, back to his native Netherlands;
Rotterdam will be the base for his travels around southern Europe.
Burgmans has been in charge of personal products business since he became a
director of Unilever in May 1991. He is also responsible for Unilever's
marketing projects group.
After studying business administration in the Netherlands and social and
political sciences in Stockholm, Burgmans gained a degree in business
administration at Lancaster University in north west England.
He joined Unilever in 1972 and his career has given him an opportunity of
working in near and far-flung parts of the multinational's empire. He was
marketing director of Lever Germany from 1985 to 1987 and then chairman of
PT Unilever in Indonesia until 1991.
Burgmans will be succeeded in London by American-born Robert Phillips, 55,
currently chairman of Unilever Prestige Personal Products. Phillips was
president of Chesebrough-Pond's before joining Unilever in 1991. He is
expected to be nominated to the board next May. If this happens, he will be
the only American director, and only the second American ever to have sat on
the Unilever board.
