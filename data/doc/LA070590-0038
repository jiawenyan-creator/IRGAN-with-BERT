MAYOR'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS DISCLOSED 
Regarding "Mayor Gets Council to Take a Dry View," (Times, June 15): 
Shawn Hubler, the reporter, informs us that Mayor Brad Parton "is a 30-year-old 
'born again' Christian." 
She does not tell us the religious beliefs of any other speaker or council 
members quoted. 
Come on, let's be fair. If personal beliefs are important to the story, why not 
tell us if Ernie O'Dell, Mark Conte or Councilwoman (Barbara) Doerr are 
atheists, Catholics, Baptists or Jews? 
Better yet, should we know if they are "born-again" Catholics, etc.? I fail to 
see what anyone's personal beliefs along those lines have to do with attempting 
to provide a healthy, safe environment for the public. Mayor Parton serves on 
the Beach Cities Coalition for a Drug Free Youth and is trying to take 
constructive action toward that goal, unlike the alcohol and other drug 
pushers.
