SHORT TAKES; 
HESTON PREFERS THE BIG SCREEN 
Charlton Heston says he hates to see epics such as "Ben-Hur" relegated to 
videotape and television screens. 
"Any film originally made for theaters suffers a great deal in the transfer to 
videotape," he said Monday. 
"When someone says, 'Oh, I just got a video of "The Ten Commandments" or of 
"Ben-Hur," for my birthday,' I have to tell them, 'Sorry, but you haven't seen 
it.' " 
Heston was in Detroit to mark the big-screen reopening of his 1959 movie 
"Ben-Hur" at the Fox Theater. 
"Here (at a theater), the moving-image arts are seen as they are meant to be 
seen, in all their glory." 
Heston, 64, won an Academy Award for his role as Judah Ben-Hur. The film, about 
Roman rivalries in Jesus' day, is known for an 11-minute chariot race that 
Heston says remains the greatest action sequence ever filmed.
