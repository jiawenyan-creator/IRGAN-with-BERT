FT  11 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Olympia &amp; York
After its latest round of talks with the banks, Olympia &amp; York's future
remains unpredictable. The hypothesis of the company's collapse, however,
may not be as alarming as some in the property world assume. Conventional
wisdom is that it would be an unmitigated disaster, further swelling the
oversupply of deeply discounted high-quality office space in the City and
West End of London. But it could be that the very remoteness which is
Docklands' basic problem limits its influence on the centre. Indeed, the
City could eventually benefit if the sceptics are finally proved right: that
even with its ill-fated transport system in place, Docklands will never be
more than a classier version of Croydon.
In the shorter term, a collapse might also mean that some tenants who have
moved or are moving to Docklands could wriggle out of their contractual
obligations. Moreover, the huge financial inducements which were used to
bring others to Docklands would no longer be available.
Granted, the effect on the banks could have more serious implications for
the property sector. Lenders have thus far shown a remarkably united front,
as in recent rescues at Mountleigh, Rosehaugh and Speyhawk. The reason -
that they cannot afford to do otherwise - is best illustrated by the
calculation that the cost of fully providing for 20-25 per cent of the UK
clearers' Pounds 17bn of property exposure is equivalent to three years'
profits. There is no knowing the actual figure they have set aside, but one
outside guess is that it is less than half what might be considered prudent.
The risk is that the credit squeeze now facing UK property developers could
turn into a veritable credit crunch. But the banks may well have built the
demise of O&amp;Y into their calculations already, as has the market for
property shares.
