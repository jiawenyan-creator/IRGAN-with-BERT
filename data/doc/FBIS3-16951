  [Text] Riga, Mar 21, BNS -- The Russian Army has failed to 
pay for the Riga airport services as provided by the 1993, June 
2, interstate agreement, Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian 
bureau monitoring the Russian troop withdrawal, told BNS. 
  The Russian Armed Forces owe Latvia at least 25,587 lats for 
608 flights in 1993 and 69 flights this year. Russia also has 
not paid for the use of airspace in those flights. 
  Russian Air Force command representative Anatoly Rudena is 
scheduled to visit Riga Monday [21 March] to discuss the payment 
problems with the bureau and the Latvian Air Communication 
enterprise administration.
