FT  02 MAR 93 / Key index hints at slower US growth
A SLEW of figures yesterday pointed to a steady expansion of the US economy
but probably at a slower pace than the 4.1 per cent annual rate of growth
registered in the second half of last year.
The purchasing managers' index - a closely watched barometer of conditions
in manufacturing industry - fell to 55.8 per cent last month from 58.0 in
January. The dip mainly reflected a slower rate of growth of new orders,
which had soared to a nine-year high in January.
However, the index remained well above the 50 per cent level which is the
threshold for growth of the manufacturing sector.
Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers, brushed off the dip in
the index. He noted several encouraging signs, including the second highest
reading in five years of the association's production index.
The Commerce Department said personal incomes grew 0.5 per cent between
December and January following a 1 per cent increase in the previous month.
Personal consumption spending rose 0.3 per cent against a 0.8 per cent
increase in December. After allowing for inflation, however, real consumer
spending fell 0.1 per cent in January, a reaction to pre-Christmas spending.
However, officials said December incomes had been boosted by the bringing
forward of bonus payments in the securities industry, farm subsidies and
social security benefit payments. Excluding special factors, incomes grew by
only 0.3 per cent in December, less than in January.
The department also reported a 1.3 per cent decline in construction spending
between December and January, the first drop in five months.
Separately the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
existing homes fell 6.4 per cent between December and January, after
seasonal adjustment, against a revised 4.7 per cent gain in the previous
month. However, on an annual comparison sales were up nearly 15 per cent in
January.
