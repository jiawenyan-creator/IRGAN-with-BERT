FT  09 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
WOOL Prices are holding firm at this week's Australian sales, with some
small rises for better styles which are in relatively short supply at this
stage of the season, and following drought conditions in some areas. The
Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator was 582 cents a kg, on April
8, only 7 cents up from last week's close direction. The Easter recess
starts next week and firm markets ahead of the break will be welcome. In
wool using countries the knitwear side has benefitted most from lower wool
prices in the past year but other sectors remain adversely affected by
recession.
