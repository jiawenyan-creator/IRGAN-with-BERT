FRENCH LOTTERY: RAGS TO RICHES TO RICHES TALE FOR HOMELESS WINNER 
A tramp who spent his last few francs on a French lottery ticket -- and won -- 
found he already had a small fortune when he put the check in a bank account he 
had not used for 20 years. 
The homeless man, who has not been identified, won 70,000 francs -- $11,500 -- 
in France's national lottery. Told he needed a bank account to cash the check, 
he remembered an account he held in eastern France. 
Lottery officials who investigated the man's claim discovered the man had 
unknowingly accrued $50,000 in dividends from shares in a firm he once worked 
for.
