FT  27 AUG 92 / MSF to join quality scheme
MSF, the general technical union, will become the first union to apply to
the British Standards Institution's BS 5750 corporate quality assurance
scheme, according to Mr Roger Lyons who takes over as general secretary next
week.
Mr Lyons said that no formal application had yet been made but he expected
one to be made after discussion with the union's staff representatives.
Mr Lyons believes that most unions, including his own, need to be more
'user-friendly, customer-conscious and quality-driven'. BS 5750 sets quality
standards for every company, which are assessed by independent experts. MSF
is being advised on staff training by the Industrial Society and all 120
full-time officials have been called in for discussions on the BS 5750
application.
Other unions, including the TGWU general union, have also promised a quality
assessment to guarantee a certain level of service to members.
The TGWU has said that every member will get an individual statement setting
out what they are entitled to.
The GMB general union is also investigating the possibility of gaining the
Investors in People kitemark, which assesses the general level of training
in an organisation and requires a high standard of training and development
in all areas.
