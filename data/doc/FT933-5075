FT  06 SEP 93 / Row looms over return of ousted members: Issue of
electricians triggers controversy
A PUBLIC row over the proposed return of the electricians to the TUC is
almost certain at congress after yesterday's decision by the TGWU general
union to submit an emergency resolution on the issue.
Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general secretary, said his union opposed the TUC's
peace formula designed to smooth over divisions over membership poaching
between the electricians - now part of the AEEU engineering union - and
other unions in the construction industry.
Mr Morris said: 'We want to have a permanent settlement of the problem and
not a short-term solution.' It remained unclear last night, however, whether
the motion would be accepted for debate.
Britain's biggest union - Unison, the public service union - agreed
yesterday to back the TUC's plan for the return of the electricians after
six years' absence since their expulsion from congress.
It seems likely that the majority of congress will support this but many
delegates remain bitter about the electricians, who used their absence from
the TUC to recruit members from other unions.
