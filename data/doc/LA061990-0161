An Indy-car race -- the first ever outside North America -- will be staged in 
Surfer's Paradise in Queensland on March 17, Queensland state government 
officials announced today. 
Queensland Treasurer Keith De Lacy said the 195-mile Gold Coast Grand Prix, 
which will be run on the 2.8-mile road course in the Gold Coast resort town, 
will begin CART's 1991 schedule and will receive financial backing from the 
state.
