<F P=106> [Interview with Enrique Obando, a military and subversion </F>
analyst, by Vidal Silva Navarrete -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Silva] Having read the Shining Path's [SL] "secret 
document" that was published by LA REPUBLICA this week, are 
there any changes in countersubversive strategy? 
  [Obando] A change was noted at the time [SL leader] Abimael 
Guzman's first letter was released; this document confirmed the 
change, clarified things, and ended speculation. Now we know 
what Abimael wants. 
  [Silva] What does he want? 
  [Obando] Two things. First, to save the leadership, and 
second, to save his entire party. The document says: "The 
people's war should not be developed, it must merely be 
maintained." As a precondition he establishes the need for a 
proletarian leadership, subordinated -- of course -- to him. 
The document adds: "The leadership problem will not be resolved 
for a long time." The document ends by quoting Mao: "All kind 
of miracles will be performed as long as there are masses and 
parties." 
  [Silva] Who is using whom? Is the government using Guzman or 
is Guzman using the government? 
  [Obando] Both are attempting to use the other. 
  [Silva] With what objectives and what are the risks? 
  [Obando] The SL seems to be trying to save its leadership on 
the understanding that members have a messianic view of their 
leaders. Guzman considers himself the greatest Marxist-Leninist 
alive and the only one who can give the right direction to the 
world revolution. That is why it is essential to save the 
leader. 
  [Silva] Save him from death? 
  [Obando] They know they cannot be sentenced to death but 
they 
are trying to maintain Guzman's contact with the party because 
it is useless to have a leader if there is no contact with the 
party. Guzman has managed to pull the strings of the party again 
and is trying to prevent the government from squashing the party 
completely because he knows this can happen. 
  [Silva] Is Guzman in complete control of the party? 
  [Obando] He controls the people in prison and is trying to 
control the people outside prison. 
  [Silva] Can that split the party? 
  [Obando] Yes. But he controls the party's internal struggle 
like in the old times. He talks about developing the struggle 
between two lines and "trying to keep the exodus to a minimum." 
  [Silva] So the government allowed Guzman to take back 
control 
over his party which he lost for a year by being kept 
incommunicado. 
  [Obando] That is right. Guzman is struggling, and apparently 
winning, the struggle against the group headed by Comrade 
Feliciano [Oscar Ramirez Durand, SL chief in central Peru]. I 
understand Feliciano's people are being reported to officials by 
the Guzman group. 
  [Silva] What does the government want? 
  [Obando] To discredit Guzman. The myth already ended, first, 
when he was captured and again when he wrote the letters asking 
for negotiations toward a peace agreement. After calling the 
president a murderer, who starved people, of being a servant of 
imperialism, he now treats him with respect, even with words of 
praise. 
  [Silva] With its references to 5 April [1992, the date on 
which President Fujimori dissolved Congress]? 
  [Obando] Exactly. But the government also wants the SL to 
lay down its arms. Guzman has the key to that because he says 
five or six years will pass before returning to the armed 
struggle. Meanwhile he says the talks must be in diplomatic 
language, no arms must be used, and a struggle must be made to 
allow a new revolutionary wave to emerge. Fujimori is thus 
assured that there will not be any attacks during those five or 
six years. 
  [Silva] Will he then be reelected? 
  [Obando] The big question is if, after that pause, we will 
see new and bigger attacks than those we have seen so far or if 
the government will use this truce to crush the Shining Path 
once and for all. 
  [Silva] Will this be only a truce? 
  [Obando] It could be but, there is also the possibility that 
the government will use Guzman to crush the Feliciano group, and 
once this is achieved then also crush the Guzman group. 
  [Silva] So both Guzman and the government get an advantage 
from the negotiations. The question is, who loses? 
  [Obando] It depends. It is possible that July 1995, which is 
the date given by Fujimori to crush the SL, will not be 
fulfilled but if someone sticks to that date Fujimori may agree 
to nonaggression for some time. Thus, everyone apparently will 
win but the country will lose in the long run. It would be the 
hibernation of the SL prior to a bloodier and more destructive 
return. This would be an act of treason. 
  [Silva] Do you believe this is happening? 
  [Obando] I don't think so, there is no reason for it and the 
Armed Forces would not allow it. The Armed Forces could crush 
the Shining Path. The proof of this is the fact that Guzman is 
negotiating. He would not negotiate if he knew his party's life 
was not at stake despite the blows. 
  [Silva] How can a man who was sentenced to life in prison 
and 
to be held incommunicado, exert pressure and negotiate? 
  [Obando] He cannot exert pressure. The SL received a harsh 
blow but, as the period of agony can last five years or more, 
the government wants a shortcut and are hurrying to fulfill a 
political promise in 1995 for electoral reasons. The SL could 
be crushed slowly but inexorably. There is no need to rush. 
The SL was hit hard because it was rushing, because it took a 
terrorist shortcut to take over the government in 10 or 15 years 
instead of its publicized prolonged people's war of 50 or 60 
years. For taking a shortcut in 1995, one could make the 
mistake of making a pact with the enemy and this is what should 
not be done. The war could last four or five years more and we 
will win it for sure, but because we want to win before the 1995 
elections we will make a pact and subsequently lose. 
  [Silva] You said the Armed Forces would not allow a pact 
with 
the SL, but why think of an institutionalized Armed Forces 
instead of thinking of an institution where personal 
calculations and the permanence in the commands are at play only 
because of the possibility of a presidential reelection? 
  [Obando] The Armed Forces and the police paid for their 
partial victory with their blood. There are lower rank officers 
who paid with sacrifice and with their lives for the struggle 
against the SL. These officers would not see the negotiations 
with good eyes if they know they can win. 
  [Silva] Under what conditions are negotiations held with the 
enemy? 
  [Obando] Negotiations are held when there is a military draw 
or when they are unable to obtain and achieve an easy victory 
and there is no desire to pay the price. 
  [Silva] But is there not a military draw now? 
  [Obando] Yes, but the cost that would be paid would be much 
less than what has been paid so far in almost 14 years of war. 
It would be like giving away something for no reason. 
  [Silva] The officers who were directly involved in the war 
would see the negotiations badly but would be unable to revert 
the situation because of the vertical command in the Armed 
Forces? 
  [Obando] Depending on the agreement reached and whether it 
would allow the SL to fulfill its objective, there may be some 
uneasiness in the Armed Forces, except among those who identify 
themselves with the government. 
  [Silva] Were some officers annoyed when Elena Iparraguirre 
received a cake on her birthday? 
  [Obando] Even some civilians were annoyed, but the fact that 
she received a cake does not seem to me as serious as reaching 
an agreement in the terms established in the document. 
  [Silva] Do you have doubts about the authenticity of the 
document? 
  [Obando] The way it is written seems to me identical to the 
terms the Shining Path leaders have always used, it seems an 
authentic document of the SL leadership in which they admit some 
things that are becoming very difficult to do. 
  [Silva] Considering the strict control on Guzman, the 
Intelligence Service must have known about this document before 
it reached SL militants. 
  [Obando] I have no doubt about that because as far as I know 
the document was sent by a SL woman leader from the Callao 
military base to another prison to convince other members to 
obey Guzman. 
  [Silva] The document describes facts or situations that 
occurred after Guzman was captured. For example it has released 
economic information this month such as the 1993 inflation rate 
or the growth of the gross domestic product. Does Guzman have 
full access to press information? 
  [Obando] Undoubtedly this could have been the first point of 
negotiation, the lifting of the incommunicado status allowing 
the visit of other SL leaders from other prisons, the 
possibility of writing, reading, watching television. Guzman 
knows what is happening outside. 
  [Silva] Is the court sentence to keep Guzman in complete 
incommunicado status being violated by the government and the 
Intelligence Service? 
  [Obando] In theory he is supposed to be incommunicado but I 
would not make a big issue out of this under the understanding 
that it is being done to defeat the Shining Path. 
  [Silva] Is there anything unclear in the negotiations? 
  [Obando] This is a game in which the one who hides his cards 
from the enemy wins. If the government announces its plan and 
everyone knows about it, then it gives victory to the enemy. We 
all know the SL plan and this is an advantage for the government. 
  [Silva] Why is it not possible to have a pact with the SL? 
  [Obando] Because in an agreement there are two parties that 
yield some. Guzman says he promises peace for a period. What 
can the government give in exchange? It cannot allow the SL to 
become a legal political party or surrender in stages by keeping 
armed cells. The only possibility is to discuss the penalties 
for the ones who surrendered or conditions for imprisonment. 
That would be like planting a bomb for the next government and 
that would be treason. 
  [Silva] What other characteristics do you see in the 
document? 
  [Obando] First, an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman's 
leadership, a recognition that circumstances have changed, and 
that appropriate decisions must be made such as the peace 
agreement, and the second congress. The big question is: how 
can Guzman believe he will win with this strategy when all the 
things he writes and the talks he holds are known by the 
Intelligence Service? Guzman is no fool, he knows that, which 
makes me fear there is some agreement about which we do not know.
