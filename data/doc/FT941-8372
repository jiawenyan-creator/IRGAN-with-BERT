FT  19 FEB 94 / Property: So you've got Pounds 100,000 to spend on a home .
. . : A modest cottage is your best bet in the home counties. But the same
money can buy you rather more in the provinces
What can you buy for around Pounds 100,000? In the home counties, the answer
is 'not much'. Mid-Wales was equally snappy: 'Half the county,' said agent
Morris Marshall &amp; Poole. A pause. 'That is a slight exaggeration. But it is
the top end of the market here.' Not so in Scotland, but it has to be good
value when a farmhouse in Angus with outbuildings, paddock and 17 acres
awaits offers of more than Pounds 75,000.
For a home of character in southern England at Pounds 100,000 or less,
cottages are the best bet. Tony Mullucks (of Mullucks Wells) says Pounds
70,000-Pounds 80,000 in east Hertfordshire and Essex buys one that is
habitable but needs modernising. Once cottages have been improved and
extended  - as most have  - the price moves to the Pounds 110,000-Pounds
120,000 range. His most intriguing cottage  - 7 Stoney Lane, a cobbled
street in the middle of the medieval town of Thaxted  - costs just Pounds
60,000.
The choice is harder in Sussex and Surrey but Victorian and Edwardian
terrace cottages are a possibility. Fox offers two in Cuckfield, near
Haywards Heath, at Pounds 89,950 or Pounds 110,000. Older cottages are too
pricey, though. An alternative is a detached three-bedroom new or nearly new
home on a housing development, as advertised in all local newspapers. But
outstanding bargains are hard to find and the prices reflect realistically
the worth of what is being offered.
A more unusual choice is a small town house (grade II) of rendered and
painted stone in Midhurst, West Sussex, which Jackson-Stops offers for
Pounds 80,000, plus Pounds 10,000 for a separate garage.
A year ago, demand for cottages in Suffolk barely existed; now, it is
picking up. Bedford, of Bury St Edmunds, offers them for Pounds 60,000
(needing work) or Pounds 80,000-Pounds 90,000 (in good condition) while
Pounds 90,000 is the price of the School House at Troston, a splendid
Victorian mini-extravaganza in polychrome brick between Bury and Thetford.
For Pounds 82,000, Hamptons is selling the three-bedroomed, thatched Ruth
Cottage (grade II) with a kitchen installed only last year. For just Pounds
54,500, Bedford offers Bridge Cottage in Walsham le Willows.
Hamptons' variation on the new or nearly-new home is a semi- detached house
in a development at Bradfield Hall at Bradfield Combust, near Bury.
Residents can use a swimming pool, gymnasium, fishing/boating lake, bowling
green and tennis court, and the grounds of the big house. This new home is
priced at Pounds 84,500 for a 124-year lease (Pounds 50 ground rent), with a
service charge for the facilities (Pounds 142.66 a month in 1993).
Sailors should consider Woodbridge, on the Suffolk coast, where flats in the
converted Granary development on the banks of the river Debden cost Pounds
79,500, and Tide Mill Cottage Pounds 100,000. The agent, Bidwells, is also
selling conversions in the White Lion, an old coaching inn at Eye, for
Pounds 85-95,000.
In the Cotswolds, agent Hurley Lloyd Thorpe reports little under Pounds
100,000. One is Yew Tree Cottage, in the beauty spot village of
Bourton-on-the-Water (where the river Windrush runs through).
It is a basic abode: stone slate roof, leaded lights, gabled dormer window
and beams match a grade II listing. But space is small: living room, kitchen
and bedroom downstairs, and bedroom and bathroom upstairs. What else do you
expect for Pounds 89,500 in the Cotswolds? Meanwhile, for a guide price of
Pounds 90,000, Lane Fox has the three-bedroom Weavers Cottage in Bibury.
Another option is to buy a flat in a converted country house. A two-bedroom,
ground floor flat in Fosseway House at Stow-on-the-Wold costs Pounds 80,000
leasehold from Hurley Lloyd Thorpe. Pay a bit more and the choice widens. A
cottage in Paxford, near Chipping Campden, is selling for Pounds 109,500
while another in Bledington, near Stow-on-the-Wold, has a price tag of
Pounds 129,000 (both from Hurley Lloyd Thorpe).
In Redlynch, on the edge of the New Forest in Wiltshire, I like the smart
diamond patterning in a brick and flint counterpoint on a semi-detached,
19th century cottage called Kestor. The price (from Woolley &amp; Wallis) is
Pounds 89,500.
In 1907, John Courage  - of the brewing family  - built Bransgore House, on
the south-western edge of the New Forest in Hampshire, as a wedding present
for his daughter. In the 1950s, it became flats. The Bell House, with a bell
to call the outside staff to meals, is attached to the main house and is for
sale on a 63-year lease (from Savills in Wimborne) for Pounds 110,000.
Palmer Snell has the semi-detached Bishops Farmhouse at Old Bradpole, near
Bridport, Dorset, for Pounds 100,000; its special feature is a detached,
one-bedroom annexe which also contains a heated swimming pool. At Christow,
on the Dartmoor side of Exeter, Pounds 105,000 buys parking for 10 cars  -
plus a smart, white-painted gate lodge/cottage (grade II) in which to live
(from Constables).
Near Salcombe, south Devon, Pounds 94,950 will get you Swallows Barn,
converted into three flats and ideal for holiday lets; while, for Pounds 500
more, there is a refreshingly unpretentious new home, erected only last year
by a local builder, at Blackawton, near Totnes (both from Stags).
East of Exeter, College House in Ottery St Mary is across the road from the
glorious church and looks a snip at Pounds 75,000 (from Redferns). Built in
1875 as an extension to the vicarage, it is now two flats, one of which is
vacant.
In Yorkshire, The Hollies in Westow, near York, stands opposite the village
post office. Once two cottages, it was converted six years ago to make a
house and now has four bedrooms, two bathrooms and two staircases (price:
Pounds 109,000). The agent is Blenkin &amp; Co, which reports little of interest
at Pounds 100,000 or less.
Keep going north for canny value, though. Savills' Brechin office in
Scotland is selling two small farmhouses which the purchaser of Kilry Farms
in Glenisla, Angus  - a beautiful glen, 24 miles from Dundee and 28 from
Perth  - does not need. Loanhead of Kilry Farmhouse awaits offers over
Pounds 65,000 and Dalwhirr Farmhouse over Pounds 75,000; it has 17 acres and
fishing rights on the river Isla.
On the Newmiln estate, Guildtown, Perthshire, surplus houses and cottages
are for sale in a Pounds 40,000-Pounds 90,000 range. They need work. But
Mill House, with inscriptions on the walls dating from 1652, 1777 and 1883,
and 1.5 acres, looks enticing. Offers of more than Pounds 50,000 are
invited.
Then there is Wales. The Newtown office of Morris Marshall &amp; Poole is
selling a cottage needing work at Llanbrynamir for Pounds 35,000, while the
Llanidloes office has a smart, 19th century (but still Georgian-style) house
in the town for Pounds 79,500.
For Pounds 40,000, the Montgomery office is offering a cottage inside one
half of the imposing arch that once served as the gate to the county jail.
It includes two bedrooms and even a garden. You pays your money and takes
your picks.
