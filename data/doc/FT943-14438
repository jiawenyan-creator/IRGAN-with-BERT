FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Czech oil shake-up plan rejected
The Czech cabinet yesterday rejected fresh proposals for restructuring the
country's oil refining and petrochemical industry, potentially clearing the
way for further consideration of two earlier plans which would see private
investors take a minority stake in the sector.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister, said a revised industry ministry proposal
would be studied again in a month.
The government has already received two proposals for restructuring the
industry, which is estimated to be in need of a Dollars 1bn investment
programme.
One would see four international oil companies, Shell, Conoco, Total and
Agip, take a 49 per cent stake in the refining business in return for an
immediate payment of Dollars 180m and a Dollars 520m investment programme
over five years. This plan would leave the petrochemical business in state
hands.
The second proposal, which the government favours, has been submitted by
Chemapol, a powerful Czech monopoly oil importer which is itself being
restructured.
