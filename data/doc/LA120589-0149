P.M. BRIEFING; 
CORNING, SUMITOMO SETTLE SUIT 
Corning Inc. will receive $25 million from Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. as 
part of an out-of-court settlement of a 1984 patent infringement lawsuit, the 
companies announced today. 
Corning sued Sumitomo five years ago, alleging that the Japanese company had 
violated its patents for optical waveguide fibers, thin hair-like strands of 
glass that are used for telephone, video and data transmissions. 
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York agreed with 
Corning that Sumitomo had infringed on Corning's patents when it began 
manufacturing its own fibers. 
The court was in the process of determining damages when the settlement was 
announced.
