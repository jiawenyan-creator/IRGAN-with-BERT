FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Swing seen in London marginals
LABOUR has achieved a 6 per cent swing in the crucial 21 London marginals
since 1987, according to an opinion poll published yesterday.
But the findings of the London Weekend Television Harris poll suggest that
the swing would give them only 12 of the 21 seats needed to help secure a
outright victory nationally.
The figures will, nonetheless, come as a significant boost to Labour's
London campaign, after reports last month that residual voter hostility to
perceived hard-left influence in the capital was holding back the party's
progress.
The poll, based on interviews on Tuesday and Wednesday with more than 800
voters, gave Labour 43 per cent, the Conservatives 40 per cent, the Liberal
Democrats 12 per cent, and others 6 per cent.
Labour's performance in the seven marginal outer London new towns targeted
by the party was particularly impressive, according to the poll. It
suggested there had been a 12 per cent swing in these towns since 1987
which, if accurate, would give Labour control of five of the seats. The poll
gave Labour 43 per cent, the Conservatives 41 per cent and the Liberal
Democrats 10 per cent.
The Labour party is putting in enormous campaigning efforts in London.
