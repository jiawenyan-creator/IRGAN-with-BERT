  [Text] North Korean Ambassador to India Cha Pong-chu said 
today that North Korea has no intention to accept additional 
inspections even though the UN Security Council is demanding 
additional inspections on North Korea through its presidential 
statement. 
  Ambassador Cha made it clear today that North Korea has no 
intention to accept additional inspections by saying that North 
Korea had already shown everything that needed to be open, and 
that the International Atomic Energy Agency is making an 
unreasonable demand to North Korea even though it has been 
proven through inspections that there were no problems of 
nuclear weapons development. 
  Ambassador Cha also strongly implied the possibility of 
nuclear weapons development by North Korea by saying that it is 
no longer a secret that the ROK and Japan are developing nuclear 
weapons, and that Japan's nuclear armament is particularly a 
serious problem and if North Korea developed nuclear weapons, it 
would be basically to restrain [kyonje] Japan.
