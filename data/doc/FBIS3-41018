  [Text] Moscow, 28 January -- In an interview with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, a highly placed representative of the 
leadership of Kazakhstan today categorically rejected a report 
that appeared in the Iranian newspaper `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' about 
a special position that Kazakhstan was supposed to have adopted 
over the nuclear weapons in its possession. 
  The report, he stressed, had nothing in common with 
Kazakhstan's position, which was confirmed during the December 
visit to Almaty by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and by the forthcoming signing of an agreement with Russia on 
the strategic nuclear forces temporarily stationed on the 
territory of Kazakhstan. 
  In response to a request from an ITAR-TASS correspondent to 
comment on the Iranian newspaper report, a high-ranking Russian 
diplomat said that, if it were true, it required "careful and 
urgent verification, primarily by Kazakhstan."
