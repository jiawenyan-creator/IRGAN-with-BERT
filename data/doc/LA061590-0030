METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANE'S CREW LOWERS LANDING GEAR BY HAND 
A United Express commuter plane with 17 people aboard landed safely Thursday 
after an electrical problem forced the crew to lower the landing gear by hand, 
authorities said. 
The flight to Sacramento departed Long Beach Municipal Airport at 11:27 a.m. 
but turned around and was back on the ground by noon, said Federal Aviation 
Administration spokeswoman Elly Brekke. 
Instruments on the plane, a twin-engine turboprop Embraer Brasilia, indicated 
electrical problems shortly after takeoff, Brekke said. 
The plane circled the airport while the wheels were lowered. Emergency vehicles 
stood by but were not needed. Mark Peterson, spokesman for West Air Commuter 
Airlines of Fresno, parent of United Express, said there was no emergency 
evacuation of the plane and that passengers were taken to John Wayne Airport 
for a later flight.
