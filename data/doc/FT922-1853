FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Chloride loses power and falls sharply to
Pounds 588,000
MR RAY HORROCKS, chairman of Chloride, said yesterday that the batteries and
electronics company was now 'off the defensive', as it reported a sharp fall
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.05m to Pounds 588,000 for the year to March
31.
The world recession hit all the group's main markets, particularly in
uninterruptible power supplies and emergency lighting, which depend on the
computer and construction industries respectively.
He added that exchange rates hit the results hard, because of currency
depreciations in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. At last year's rates pre-tax
profits would have been Pounds 2.49m.
On the slimmed down group, he said: 'Chloride can now stop playing like the
English football team and can try to play like Sweden in the second half.'
In March 1991, Chloride sold most of its former core batteries business to
Hawker Siddeley, the engineering group, for Pounds 43.5m, because it was
'heading for the fourth division - not in performance, but in size'. The
rump of the batteries side - in Africa - was retained.
Mr Horrocks said that although margin had been sacrificed, the group was now
cash-generative from trading, though 'the joker is demand'.
Turnover on continuing operations fell to Pounds 110.1m (Pounds 115.9m). On
a like-for-like basis, turnover in electronics was Pounds 79.7m (Pounds
82.6m) and losses grew to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.34m); batteries were
brighter - turnover was Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 33.3m) and profits Pounds 4.25m
(Pounds 2.46m). Therefore before interest continuing operations saw a growth
in profits to Pounds 2.04m (Pounds 1.12m).
After a 400 per cent tax charge (because Chloride earned most of its profits
in countries where tax loss benefits are not available) and extraordinary
charges of Pounds 4.4m, relating to disposals and closures, the retained
losses totalled Pounds 4.4m (profits Pounds 7.38m).
