LOCAL; 
RAPE KILLER OF VICTIM, 85, SOUGHT 
Los Angeles police have begun a search for the killer of an 85-year-old Van 
Nuys woman after an autopsy revealed that she was raped and beaten to death in 
her bed at a local retirement home, authorities said this morning. 
Libbie Noble was found dead at 7 a.m. Sunday at the Valley View Retirement 
Center in the 7700 block of Woodman Avenue, authorities said. 
An autopsy conducted Wednesday found evidence of sexual assault, and the cause 
of death was listed as blunt force trauma, Detective Jim Vojtecky said. 
There are no identified suspects in the case. Vojtecky said there was no sign 
of forced entry in the second-floor apartment Noble shared with another elderly 
woman. The roommate, who is deaf, apparently slept through the attack and has 
been unable to aid police, Vojtecky said.
