  [Text] Moscow, June 11, RIA -- Russia and the United States 
favour "additional efforts" to settle the Bosnian crisis and 
support the idea of holding a UN-sponsored conference of the 
foreign ministers of all the parties involved in the conflict, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told a RIA correspondent 
upon his return from a NATO meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. 
  Mr. Kozyrev said he discussed the matter with US Secretary 
of 
State Warren Christopher and the two men made public their 
decision at a joint press conference. 
  Mr. Kozyrev said that a second round of Geneva talks could 
give a fresh impetus to the political settlement process and 
noted that he and his British counterpart, Douglas Hurd, agreed 
that the meeting in Geneva should be held before the G-7 meeting 
in Naples. 
  Next week the liaison group on the mapping of Bosnia will 
hold a new meeting, Mr. Kozyrev reported, adding that the sides 
should work out a common position on the issue as soon as 
possible.
