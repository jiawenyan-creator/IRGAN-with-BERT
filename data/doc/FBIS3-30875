  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Anton Bodis, a spokesman 
for Slovak President Michal Kovac, rejected today allegations by 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar that Kovac had negotiated with 
representatives of the deputies' group of the Meciar-led 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), urging them to 
establish factions within the movement. 
  Bodis was reacting to press reports quoting Meciar as saying 
that "the president is leading consultations (on possible 
factions within the government coalition HZDS) with some 
parliamentary deputies, and recommends concrete alternatives." 
  Bodis said that Kovac last met with HZDS deputies at his 
meeting with all deputies' groups in the parliament late last 
year.
