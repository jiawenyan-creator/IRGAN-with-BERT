FT  15 SEP 92 / End to N Ireland broadcast ban urged
SIR Michael Checkland, director-general of the BBC, yesterday demanded an
end to the ban on broadcasting the voices of people representing
organisations in Northern Ireland considered to be extremist, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
The call from Sir Michael follows the controversy created by a BBC decision
to subtitle many of the comments made by Mrs Bernadette McAlisky, a former
Northern Ireland MP, in a recorded programme on Ulster's troubles.
The BBC director-general said yesterday that the broadcasting ban introduced
in 1988 was a 'totally unacceptable interference' with the editorial
process. He said he would appeal strongly to ministers for an end to the
ban.
Mr Peter Bottomley, a former Conservative Northern Ireland minister,
complained to the BBC about the subtitles. Mr Bottomley said Mrs McAliskey
was not a member of any violent organisation. He said the BBC's action had
put her life at risk.
