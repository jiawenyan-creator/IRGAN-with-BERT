FT  04 JUN 92 / Letter: A costly turn of events
Sir, In February Barclays suggested that we consider transferring our
deposit account balance to a new Business Premium account with interest at
some 7 per cent gross. An ill omen indeed, for three months later Barclays
notified that our church account, for many years conducted free of charge,
would from June bear a commission charge of Pounds 6 per quarter plus 66p
per entry debit and credit.
It appears that these terms are slightly worse than those enjoyed by Paul
McKee (Letters, May 30).
Inquiries soon showed that the clearers no longer see any commercial
advantage in handling small charitable accounts sympathetically.
We are now transferring our modest current and savings accounts to Girobank,
which offers free banking (but for how long?) to organisations employing no
paid officials. Dennis Rump,
