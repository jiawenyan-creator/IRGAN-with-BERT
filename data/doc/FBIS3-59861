  [Text] Time is working against them. Against the Arab 
Middle East, our neighbors. The changeover of the economy of the 
liberal market--which started Asia and is currently promoting 
South America to its spot--passed over the Middle East. 
  In Iraq, Syria, and Jordan, the same elite dominate who 
dominated 15 years ago, with the same outdated and fossilized 
perception of the world. 
  Even in Egypt, an undesirable process of retreating from the 
modernistic ideas ("the open-door policy") of Anwar al-Sadat has 
begun. 
  Husni Mubarak is more cautious, more conservative. 
  It is likely that the guilt lies with the oil. The abundance 
of oil has created, in all of the Arab Middle East, the delusion 
of easy money. Why make the effort, compete, be enterprising, 
if, anyhow, the desert land is saturated with black gold? 
  But the demand for oil has shrunk, a little in the 
beginning, 
and now, very much--and the producing countries, with the 
exception of the shining Gulf emirates, have begun shortages and 
moderation. 
  And it is likely that the guilt lies with the Muslim 
hostility to the West. The regimes in the Arab countries around 
us, especially in large portions of the public opinion there, 
are closing themselves up in a conceptual and cultural bubble 
that repels the "Western" economic ideas as "unsuitable" to the 
Arab-Muslim uniqueness. 
  Asia began to flourish when it became freed from the feeling 
of isolationism and opened to the world; this is happening now 
in South America and Eastern Europe. This is not yet happening 
in the Middle Eastern Arab world. 
  The longer the Arab Middle East continued to cook in its own 
juices, the further it got from the unavoidable economic 
decisions, and it sunk in hostility and pollution. 
  The result: Regression and regression once again. 
  Recently, with the aid of a number of friends from the 
Middle 
East Department of the World Bank in Washington, I made a 
comparison between the economic strength of Arab countries and 
that of Israel, from the years 1977 to 1992. 
  What happened in the 15 years between al-Sadat's visit to 
Jerusalem and the Oslo accord? 
  The answer: Israel has become an economic Middle East 
superpower, which puts all of the countries surrounding it in a 
deep shadow, all of them together, including Iraq. 
  And these are the data: 
  In 1977, the domestic product of the three countries hostile 
to Israel--Jordan, Syria, and Iraq--was $27.4 billion. Egypt had 
a product of an additional $12.1 in the same year, and, in all, 
the domestic product of the four Arab countries came to $40 
billion in that year. 
  Israel had a domestic product of only $10 billion in 1977. 
  The joint economic strength of the four most important Arab 
countries next to us--Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Jordan--was four 
times that of Israel's economic strength 15 years ago. 
  In 1992, the domestic product of the three countries hostile 
to Israel--Jordan, Syria, and Iraq--was $27.7 billion. That is, 
their current product did not grow at all, despite inflation and 
despite the 50-percent increase in population. 
  Egypt had a product of $30 billion in 1992. The total 
product 
of the four Arab countries reached $58 billion last year. 
  Israel alone had a product valued at $67 billion in 1992. 
Our 
economic strength rose by 20 percent over the joint strength of 
Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Jordan. 
  The Israeli economy is more than three times greater than 
the 
economies of Syria and Jordan, and more than double the joint 
economies of Syria, Jordan, and Iraq. 
  This vast gap to our benefit stands out even more when one 
looks at the product per capita, the accepted indicator of 
productivity and prosperity. 
  The growth of the product in current dollars also includes 
the inflation and devaluation components of the local currency. 
In real terms, only Egypt has succeeded, since 1977, in 
maintaining the economic prosperity of its residents. In the 
other three Arab countries, the real product per capita 
declined--between 10 percent (in Jordan) to 70 percent (in 
Iraq). In Israel, the real product increased by 50 percent per 
capita. 
These economic developments have strategic and political 
ramifications: 

  -  Even when all of the defense expenditures of Israel are 
limited to 12 percent of the domestic product, they cost at 
least five to six times--and perhaps even 10 times--more than 
the defense expenditures of Jordan and Syria together (Iraq does 
not currently have measured defense expenditures). 
  -  There is no apparent danger to Israel's survival or even a 
real 
military risk from the "eastern coalition" of Syria, Jordan, and 
Iraq. The clear economic weakness of these three countries has 
turned them into dwarfs opposite Israel. This is a situation 
which is unlikely to change before the year 2015. 
  -  The only chance for the Arab countries near us to get on the 
track of rapid economic growth is a change in perception and 
method: A sharp transition to the economics of a liberal, 
competitive, open market. 
  Except that such a transition invites democracy--and this, 
from the point of view of the traditional Arab regimes, is the 
problem. 
  There is no other model of economic success except for a 
developing competitive and democratic market.

  The Arab countries have been learning this from experience 
during the past 15 years. Even though the population grew from 
60 million residents to 88 million residents, they lost the 
economic race with Israel and retreated far behind. 
  Have they learned something?
