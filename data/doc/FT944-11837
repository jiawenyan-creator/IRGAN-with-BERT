FT  04 NOV 94 / Egyptian death toll mounts
Rescue workers found 18 burned bodies in the village of Dronka yesterday,
pushing to at least 450 the death toll from southern Egypt's fire and flood
disaster. Floodwater and burning fuel swept through the village, 200 miles
south of the capital Cairo, soon after dawn on Wednesday. Flash floods from
Wednesday's six-hour thunderstorm claimed about 60 more victims in other
villages in the provinces of Assiut, Sohag and Qena, security officials
said. Thousands of Dronka villagers who spent Wednesday night in mosques in
the nearby city of Assiut are heading home to search for relatives but have
little hope of finding survivors from 200 houses engulfed by the river of
blazing fuel.
