THE STATE; 
CANCER SOURCE NOT FOUND 
Another study has failed to turn up any single connection among a dozen cancers 
of various types that struck children in McFarland early in this decade. 
Between Feb. 6 and April 28, a medical team from the state Department of Health 
examined 1,885 McFarland children, which represented 95% of all the children 
ages 1 to 12 who live in the Kern County community and surrounding farming 
area. As was the case with earlier studies, this one pinpointed no single 
environmental or other cause for the childhood cancers, said Dr. Rick Kreutzer, 
a state public health officer. "Using the technology now available, it would 
appear at this point that we cannot find anything in the McFarland environment 
that makes it unusual or more dangerous to the residents," Kreutzer said.
