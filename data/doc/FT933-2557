FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Contract security is main
concern of UK dairy farmers
UK DAIRY farmers are more concerned about the security of their supply
contracts with dairy companies when the industry enters a free market next
April than they are about price, according to a survey published today in
Farmers Weekly magazine.
The survey of 918 farmers found that 87 per cent of them were worried about
security - in view of the fact that contracts to supply dairy companies and
Milk Marque, the successor to the Milk Marketing Board, run for only one
year - and 79 per cent were concerned about prices.
Milk Marque has wooed farmers by holding out the hope of higher prices for
their milk. And large dairy companies such as Northern Foods and MD Foods
have responded by suggesting that they will pay a premium over the Milk
Marque price.
But farmers appear to be looking for arrangements with a longer life than
the 12 months generally on offer, and half of those surveyed said they did
not trust the dairy companies to protect their interests.
The poll found that farmers could choose between 19 options for selling
their milk among large and small dairies, local groups and Milk Marque.
Among those who had already decided which organisation to link up with in
the new free market, 71 per cent said they would stick with Milk Marque and
4 per cent opted for the Northern Milk Partnership, which has been set up by
Northern Foods.
Farmers were almost equally split on whether they would agree to have their
milk collected on alternate days as the Milk Marketing Board has suggested -
52 per cent said they woud consider it and 47 per cent refused.
