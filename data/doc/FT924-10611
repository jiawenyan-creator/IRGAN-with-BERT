FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM in defence of growth strategy
CHANGED world conditions justifying the government's decision to accord
higher priority to employment and growth were underlined by Mr John Major,
the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
There had been a material change in economic circumstances outside the UK,
he said, and 'in many ways that does give us new opportunities to develop
our particular strategy for recovery'.
Mr John Ward, Tory MP for Poole, urged him to agree that maintaining capital
expenditure, particularly in relation to the construction industry, would
help to establish the foundation for recovery.
