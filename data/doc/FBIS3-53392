  [Excerpt] "In the future, no agreement will be reached 
without a direct dialogue between the leaders of the Arab states 
and the prime minister of the State of Israel. This also 
applies to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. This is my 
conclusion from the peace process following the Declaration of 
Principles with the PLO." 
  These remarks were made last night by Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin when he emerged from the Labor Central Committee session 
summoned to discuss the results of the Histadrut labor 
federation elections and the agenda for the party convention 
scheduled for the end of the month. 
  Asked whether he had relayed a message to al-Asad via 
Clinton, Rabin replied: "And if I did, would I publicize it in 
the media? In any event, I did not relay any message 
whatsoever." He said he is confident the Clinton-al-Asad summit 
will lead to the resumption of the negotiations with the Syrians 
and the other countries in Washington toward the end of this 
month. 
  Referring to the negotiations with the PLO, the prime 
minister said: "Senior officials sit down and reach agreements, 
and then one of them says that it was not so and that he is the 
boss. Then you say to yourself: We sat in Oslo, Paris, and 
Cairo, and now in Taba, and I still do not know for certain that 
the matter is finished. If there is a lesson to be drawn from 
the negotiations with the Palestinians, it is that no agreement 
should be reached in the future without a thorough dialogue 
between the leaders of the bodies involved in the negotiations."
