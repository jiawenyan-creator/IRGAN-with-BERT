FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japan set to ease grip on yen
bond market
JAPAN'S ministry of finance is poised to ease its grip on placements of
yen-denominated bonds issued overseas as part of its continuing deregulation
of the country's financial markets.
Ministry officials said they could come to a decision early next month to
allow Eurobonds issued by sovereign borrowers to be placed with domestic
investors immediately after the issuance.
In order to protect the country's fledgling straight bond market, the
government has tried to keep Eurobonds offshore by prohibiting yen bonds
issued overseas from entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance.
However, officials said the the 'lock-up' period for Eurobonds issued by
domestic borrowers and corporate overseas borrowers is expected to remain
intact for the time being.
Some securities house officials point out that the eventual lifting of the
placement restriction will make little difference to the Euroyen market.
Japanese securities houses have found their way around the restrictions by
agreeing to 'warehouse' Euroyen issues for three months before selling the
paper off to Japanese investors at the issuing price.
The decision to lift the 'lock-up' rule for sovereign issuers may accelerate
the deterioration of Japan's samurai market, which is currently facing the
departure of top-rated borrowers.
Issuers like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have started to avoid
the samurai market due to the lack of cost differential between borrowers
with low credit ratings and high credit ratings.
