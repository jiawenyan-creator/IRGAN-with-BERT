FT  13 JUL 92 / Observer: Pints of law
Who says a policeman's lot is not a happy one?
A member of North Yorkshire constabulary admitted downing 7 1/2 pints of
strong beer while investigating allegations of after-hours drinking at the
Huntsman Inn at Drax. During a lengthy undercover operation, he and his two
colleagues had consumed a total of 38 pints of ale and an unspecified number
of whisky chasers, at a cost to the taxpayer of more than Pounds 50.
Still, the public purse has emerged with a profit. The pub's licensee was
fined Pounds 1,200 and ordered to pay Pounds 190 costs.
