  [Excerpt] Prague, Dec 22 (CTK) -- The Iranian ambassador to 
Prague last night issued a statement apparently intended to 
distance Iran from reports that the country was seeking to 
obtain nuclear technology from the Czech Skoda Plzen company, 
REUTER's news agency reported Tuesday. 
  Ambassador Rasoul Movahedian, who on Tuesday met Skoda 
General Director Lubomir Soudek, said he welcomed stronger ties 
with the Czech heavy engineering company but said the 
relationship was aimed at peaceful projects only, the agency 
said. 
  Ambassador Movahedian's meeting with Soudek was confirmed to 
CTK last night by Skoda's spokesman Jaroslav Hudec. He gave no 
details of the contents of the meeting, describing it as a 
courtesy call. 
  In his statement, Movahedian said Iran gives priority to 
``friendly and traditional partners'' who offer reliable 
technical and economic joint projects. 
  ``Iran has really no intention to be engaged in non-peaceful 
efforts, neither by the Czech side nor by any other 
international side,'' the agency quoted Movahedian as saying.
