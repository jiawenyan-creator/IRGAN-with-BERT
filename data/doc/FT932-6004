FT  01 JUN 93 / Medical warning issued to smokers
BARONESS Cumberlege, a junior health minister, yesterday said that the
government had no objections to doctors withholding treatment from patients
who ignored advice to stop smoking.
She told the BBC's Today programme: 'If they feel that people they are
treating are less likely to recover than other people on the waiting list,
then that must be a judgment for them.'
Asked whether the doctors weren't playing God, Baroness Cumberlege said:
'Haven't they always?'
But later, she appeared to back-track, issuing a statement saying: 'The
General Medical Council have made it clear that treatment should be
available to all parts of the community and I fully endorse this.'
Consultants at Manchester's Wythenshawe and Leicester's Groby Road hospitals
last week said they refused non-urgent heart bypass surgery on heavy smokers
and they believed other doctors did the same.
