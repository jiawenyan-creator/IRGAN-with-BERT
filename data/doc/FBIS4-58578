  [Text] Palestinian camps in Lebanon and Syria today 
observed a general strike to protest the signing of the 
self-rule agreement between the PLO and the Zionist enemy. 
  A popular demonstration was staged in the Palestinian camp 
'Ayn al-Hulwah in south Lebanon denouncing the agreement and 
describing the PLO leaders who signed it as traitors. 
  Munir al-Maqdah, a Fatah Movement dissident in the camp, 
said 
Yasir 'Arafat has fallen in the trap and that he is now just a 
political refugee entrusted with putting down the Palestinian 
intifadah against occupation.
