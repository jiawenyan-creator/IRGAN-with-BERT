  [Text] Havana, 5 Jan (PL) -- Havana health officials have 
reported that the child mortality rate dropped to 9.4 for every 
1,000 live births in 1993 -- the lowest ever in Cuban history. A 
simple mathematical calculation shows that the 0.8 drop, 
compared to the 10.2 registered in 1992, is equivalent to the 
lives of 121 children. 
  According to information supplied by the Public Health 
Ministry's National Statistics Directorate (Minsap), in 1993 
there were 151,981 births and 1,430 deaths, which were mainly 
caused by perinatal problems (those that occur in relation to 
the birth process) and by several congenital anomalies. 
  According to Minsap statistics, child mortality rates in 
Cuba 
have been decreasing gradually over the past 25 years. For 
example, the figure was 46.7 in 1969, 19.4 in 1979, and 11.1 
child deaths for every 1,000 born alive in 1989. 
  The 9.4 achieved in 1993 gives Cuba the lowest child 
mortality rate in Latin America -- an area that registers very 
alarming figures, like those in Haiti and Bolivia, which were 87 
and 80 respectively, as reported in the World Infancy Status 
report published by UNICEF [United Nations Children's Fund].
