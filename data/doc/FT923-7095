FT  20 AUG 92 / Airlines face CAA levy on licences
A NEW fund to protect customers of failed scheduled airlines should be
financed by an increase in air transport licence fees rather than a
supplement paid by passengers, the Civil Aviation Authority has told
industry representatives.
The CAA said variations in ticket prices would make it difficult to provide
passengers with cash refunds. Instead, it envisages asking other airlines to
honour the tickets of failed carriers, in return for an agreed proportion of
the usual fare from the fund.
The proposals are outlined in a letter from the CAA to airlines and trade
bodies, following the announcement in March by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, then
transport secretary, that the government intended to establish the fund.
Mr Rifkind said protection for scheduled-service passengers would be limited
to those using UK airlines. There are already arrangements to protect
charter passengers.
If the government had proposed protection against failure by foreign
airlines as well, the CAA said it would have imposed a supplement on
passengers at UK airports. It would otherwise have been difficult to collect
contributions from foreign airlines.
The CAA is opposed to the accumulation of a large fund, as investment income
would be taxable. It envisages a fund of less than Pounds 10m - equivalent
to about 25p per passenger over a full year. If the fund were exhausted it
could be replenished by a levy and borrowing.
The primary legislation needed to set up the fund is unlikely to be
introduced before the 1993-94 parliamentary session, according to the CAA.
It said it would consider industry views before making recommendations to
the government.
