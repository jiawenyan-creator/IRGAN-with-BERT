FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Two Italian banks seek capital
injections
Two of Italy's biggest banks have outlined plans for increases in capital.
Credito Italiano, recently privatised, is to ask shareholders for
authorisation to increase its capital by a nominal value of L2bn (Dollars
1.2m) over the next five years, through the issue of shares or a mixture of
shares and bonds.
Meanwhile, Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, has finalised plans for a
two-stage increase in capital which should raise more than L2,500bn for the
bank and allow the company to float a 22 per cent stake on the Milan stock
market. The first stage of the offer is likely to start on July 11.
Credito Italiano ended speculation about an imminent rights issue with a
statement yesterday convening an extraordinary meeting of shareholders at
the end of June to vote on a new authority.
Banca Commerciale Italiana, Italy's other recently privatised bank,
announced plans for a fully-fledged issue of shares and warrants last week,
to raise up to L2,362bn.
Banking sources said that Credito Italiano did not need to raise capital to
finance its own development over the next few years.
However, the group wants to be in a position to move quickly if there are
opportunities for acquisitions.
Cariplo announced in April that it was planning to float new shares in
Milan.
On Monday, the bank confirmed that a first tranche of 600m shares would be
issued at between L2,350 and L2,750, raising between L1,410bn and L1,650bn.
Institutional shareholders will be limited to a 3 per cent stake in the
company. The group has agreed to protect small shareholders' interests by
reserving certain seats on the board for their nominees, an idea borrowed
from the government's new rules for privatisation of the Ina insurance
group.
A second tranche, in the form of bonds and warrants, will be sold before
June 30, 1995, and should raise more than L1,000bn.
