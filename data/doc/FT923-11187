FT  25 JUL 92 / Major insists Mellor will stay
THE PRIME minister yes-terday reaffirmed his support for Mr David Mellor,
the national heritage secretary, insisting that he would remain at his post.
Mr John Major said: 'David Mellor is very well qualified to deal with that
job. He is doing it extremely well. He is going to go on doing it.'
It was the first endorsement in public by Mr Major of the heritage secretary
since newspaper revelations last Sunday of Mr Mellor's alleged relationship
with a 31-year-old actress.
Mr Mellor yesterday won the backing of Mr Rocco Forte, chief executive of
the Forte hotels and restaurants group. Mr Forte, who is also president of
the British Hospitality Association, which represents hoteliers,
restaurateurs and caterers, said: 'It would be a tragedy for the country to
lose his services at this time'. Mr Mellor had already proved himself an
affective advocate of the tourist industry.
Mr Bryan Gould, appointed yesterday as shadow heritage secretary, said: 'The
current furore about ministers' sex lives should not let the British press
off the hook.
'Ownership is too concentrated, the tabloid press is heavily slanted to the
right and ordinary people are too often the victims of sensationalist
reporting.'
