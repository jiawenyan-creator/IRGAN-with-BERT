  [Text] The Chiriqui Province chapter of the National 
Renewal Party (Morena) yesterday nominated former Comptroller 
General Ruben Dario Carles as its presidential candidate for the 
8 May elections. 
  Referring to the National Police, Ruben Dario Carles said 
that 75 percent of its members are still the same as during the 
past regime, a situation that should have instituted a purge. 
He added that the task the Police Academy is performing must be 
encouraged. 
  In addition, Carles believes that it would take an entire 
afternoon, if one were to decide to prepare a list, to establish 
the exact number of government workers who claim to work despite 
low productivity levels. 
  The Morena presidential candidate said that during the next 
few days the other political parties that support his candidacy 
will make their respective announcements. Carles also said that 
he is unaware of what direction the parties that make up the 
ADOC [Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance] will follow. 
According to Carles, "I do not know where they are headed, but 
I do know I am going straight ahead." 
  Upon arriving in Chiriqui, the Morena candidate was cheered 
by a numerous crowd of well-wishers during his tour along 3 
November Avenue, the main commercial street in the City of David.
