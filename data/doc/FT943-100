FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Russia's RNGS to sell shares
Shares in the Russian company JSC Rosneftegazstroy (RNGS), the legal
successor to the former Soviet ministry for oil and gas construction, are to
be offered to international institutional investors through a series of
private placements.
RNGS, advised by Geneva-based Rhone Finance, expects to raise up to Dollars
25.5m through the sale of 3.7 per cent of the company's shares. It has
permission to sell up to 10 per cent of the company.
Under the terms of the initial placement the shares will carry a fixed
dividend of 8 per cent, payable half-yearly - in US dollars - and will be
redeemable up to December 31, 2000. Funds from the private placements will
be used partly for real estate development in Moscow.
RNGS is a general contractor on oil and gas construction, municipal and
commercial construction and infrastructure development in Russia. It has
200,000 employees and has management control over 37 oil and gas companies
under a co-operation agreement with the ministry of fuel and energy.
Meanwhile, senior managers from five Russian self-styled 'blue chip'
companies yesterday presented details of recent performance and outlined
their companies' prospects to investors in London.
