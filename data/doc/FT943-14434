FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Uralita set to spin off
chemicals
URALITA, the Spanish industrial group in which a number of UK institutions
took a significant stake last year, is to group its chemical operations into
a separate company in order to pave the way for a possible outright sale.
The reorganisation would allow Uralita to concentrate more fully on its core
building materials business, analysts say.
The group is Spain's building materials market leader.
A number of UK institutions, lead by Scottish Widows, last year paid
Pta7.6bn (Dollars 58m) for a 15 per cent stake in Uralita. The vendor was
Grupo March, Spain's leading holding company.
Buffeted by recession, Uralita lost Pta7.4bn last year but strong
first-quarter results suggest that losses could be brought down to Pta1.5bn
this year and that the group could be profitable in 1995.
Uralita plans to underwrite a Pta15bn capital increase, a sum equivalent to
the book value of its plastic and chemical assets, for Rocalla, a fibre
cement company that is to acquire Uralita's chemicals assets. Rocalla is to
change its name to Aragonesas.
Rocalla, which is 95 per cent owned by Uralita, and is listed on the the
Madrid and Barcelona stock exchanges, will pass its cement business across
to Uralita.
The disposal of the chemical units grouped in the re-launched Aragonesas,
either through a trade sale or through a placement with institutional
investors, is expected to take place early next year.
Uralita is believed to have a placed a price tag of between Pta20bn and
Pta23bn on its chemicals assets.
