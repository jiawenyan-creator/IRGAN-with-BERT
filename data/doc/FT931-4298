FT  11 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator reached a new low for the
present selling season yesterday. It fell 11c to 453c a kg and is getting
closer to the low point, 428 reached in the week when free market conditions
returned after the collapse of the floor price in February, 1991. The latest
forecast for wool production this season is slightly higher than the
preceding estimate, and production next year is tentatively estimated at
only 5% lower. With consumption well down mainly because of Russia's
continuing and apparently indefinite absence from the market.
