  [Excerpts] Prague, Feb 21 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel does not consider Defence Minister Antonin Baudys' Bosnia 
initiative "fortunate and usual," but cannot discuss it in 
detail because he knows about it only from the press, his 
spokesman Ladislav Spacek told CTK today. 
  Baudys acquainted journalists with his proposal to end the 
Bosnia conflict on Saturday [19 February], admitting that he had 
consulted neither the government nor parliament. [passage 
omitted] 
  Havel believes that Baudys should have first discussed his 
proposal with Czech leaders, Spacek said, adding that Havel also 
doubts the composition of the committee because it is based on 
the assumption that the Bosnia conflict is a conflict of three 
cultural-religious orientations. 
  Havel believes that violence must be stopped in Bosnia and 
that civic society, in which people of various ethnic origins 
and religions co-exist in peace, must be restored, spacek 
pointed out. 
  Havel has also said that before being made public, similar 
initiatives must usually be consulted on confidentially through 
diplomatic channels with the parties concerned, Spacek stressed. 
  Commenting on the same issue, Jiri Holub, former 
Czechoslovak 
ambassador to Italy (1990-92) and coordinator of the Realistic 
Bloc, said at a press conference today: "I cannot imagine an 
acceptable explanation which Minister Baudys could give to the 
president, government and parliament after his return from 
Turkey." 
  Baudys left for a three-day official visit to Turkey on 
Sunday [20 February]. 
  The opposition Realistic Bloc is made up by the Czech Social 
Democratic Party (CSSD), the Liberal Social Union (LSU) and 
several extra-parliamentary groupings.
