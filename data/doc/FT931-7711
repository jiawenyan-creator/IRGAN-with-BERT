FT  23 FEB 93 / Observer: TUC development
It is more than four years since European Community president Jacques Delors
made his rousing speech at Britain's Trades Union Congress in support of a
social Europe which so upset Mrs Thatcher.
Hence, it is rather surprising to learn that the TUC has only just agreed to
follow some of its more go-ahead members and open an office in Brussels. But
at least there shouldn't be any lack of contenders to run the new outpost,
given that the TUC's domestic career opportunities look so bleak.
