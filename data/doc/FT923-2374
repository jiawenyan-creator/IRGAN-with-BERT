FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: British effort to suspend mechanism
quickly rebuffed
BRITAIN'S attempts to persuade its EC partners to suspend the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism were quickly rebuffed by senior treasury and central
bank officials at their crisis meeting, it emerged yesterday.
The EC's secretive monetary committee, which in effect manages the European
monetary system, took just under six hours to frame a communique aimed at
soothing the turbulent currency markets.
The crisis meeting was already the EC's worst-kept secret when it began just
before midnight on Wednesday. It ended at 5.30am yesterday under the glare
of television arc lights, when the committee opted to endorse suspension of
ERM membership for sterling and the lira, and devaluation of the peseta,
rather than temporary suspension of the whole grid system.
The British plan - which would have allowed the 11 currencies to find their
own level in the markets - was apparently backed by the Italians and
Spanish. But their partners rejected what was seen as an attempt to save
political face at home, and a threat to the future of the EMS.
'(Suspension) would have been really awkward,' said one senior central bank
official yesterday. 'If one had embarked on general floating (of
currencies), one would really have undone the whole structure.'
Officials yesterday claimed that the atmosphere of the meeting had been
comparatively calm and free from recriminations.
British officials claimed that other EC members had repeated calls for lower
German interest rates - without making any headway.
It was clear that political considerations had a strong influence, including
the need to be able to reaffirm economic and monetary union (Emu) as a
legitimate goal of the Community.
Asked as he left the meeting if the committee's decision marked 'the end of
Emu', Mr Horst Kohler, German state secretary of finance, said the meeting
was simply 'the continuation of good co-operation' among the 12.
