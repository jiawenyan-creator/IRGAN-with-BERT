FT  11 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury retreats
The fall-out from the PepsiCo profits warning on Thursday jolted several key
stocks across the food and drinks sectors. The US soft drinks and fast food
group warned that stiff competition in its home market, particularly from
cheaper colas, would keep second-quarter profits flat.
PepsiCo singled out the success of Cott, the Canadian producer of own label
cola for North American retailers, as one of the main reasons behind the
downturn. Cott has recently moved into the UK market, making cola for
Sainsbury, which was embroiled in a big row with Coca-Cola over accusations
of copying the famous Coke label. Worries over Cott's impact on the UK
market hit Coca-Cola's UK joint venture partner Cadbury Schweppes, the
shares sliding 13 to 452p.
Credit Lyonnais Laing took the opportunity to reiterate its sell
recommendation on the stock, arguing that should Cott's penetration in the
UK match that of its home market Canada, Cadbury's profit growth over the
next three years will be wiped out. But Strauss Turnbull, which brought out
a buy note on the stock recently, took a different view, pointing out that
Coca-Cola was matching and even beating Cott-produced cola on price in the
UK to protect its market share.
Also hit by the PepsiCo story was Grand Metropolitan, which runs the Burger
King fast food chain, although the shares managed a rally to close a penny
better at 426p. Bass retreated 5 to 515p on fears that PepsiCo will not now
proceed with the long-rumoured Pounds 400m purchase of Britvic of which the
UK brewer has a share. However, analysts said the fears were unfounded and
that the deal was currently getting Brussels approval.
