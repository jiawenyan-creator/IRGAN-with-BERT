<F P=106> [Article by Anita Smolenska: "Cabinet of Ministers Proposes </F>
Changes in the Police Law"] 
  [Text] Riga, 22 Mar -- During its session today, the 
Cabinet of Ministers has accepted changes in the law "On 
Police," granting police the right "to search, under special 
circumstances and with well-founded suspicions, means of 
transportation, their drivers and passengers, with the aim of 
finding and confiscating guns and explosive materials." 
  As is known, the Cabinet of Ministers already once granted 
such powers to the police. It was done during the Saeima's 
[parliament] Christmas break, when the Cabinet of Ministers took 
advantage of Article 81 of the Satversme [Constitution] 
permitting the government to make decisions under the rule of 
law. The Saeima annulled this law when it returned, on the 
basis of a special decision, according to recommendations from 
both the Juridical and the Defense and Internal Affairs 
Commissions. At present, the Cabinet of Ministers has decided 
to conduct the changes in ordinary legislative fashion. "During 
discussions in the Saeima, the government was told that the 
rejection was of a formal nature rather than an essential 
character," Minister of Special Tasks Edvins Inkens stated at a 
press briefing today. "Information from the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs proves that from the moment the police lost 
these rights, criminals have become more impudent." 
  The changes in the law, which were adopted today, also 
foresee that the police will be obliged to take care of people 
who have found themselves in a state of helplessness due to lack 
of means and housing, by bringing them to the institutions of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The police will be 
responsible for them. As E. Inkens explained, this provision 
refers to beggars and homeless people.
