Businesses and residents have filed $1.1 million in damage claims against the 
federal government from fires that raged through Yellowstone National Park and 
surrounding forests last summer, forest officials say. U.S. Forest Service 
officials are processing the more than two dozen claims, which will be passed 
on to the U.S. General Counsel's Office, said Arlene Bateman, who is handling 
claims filed through the Forest Service's Region II office in Missoula, Mont. 
Government attorneys will review each claim to determine whether negligence or 
nature caused the damage, Bateman said. The Forest Service's policy to allow 
fires started by nature to burn unless they threatened lives, property or 
historic sites generated enormous controversy that has still not been resolved.
