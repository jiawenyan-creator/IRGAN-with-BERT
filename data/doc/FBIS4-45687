  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- The Black Sea's 
fish potential had more than halved in the last 30 years because 
of pollution, more than 40 fish species were destroyed in this 
sea, said Louis Rey, member of the Crans Montana Forum 
Foundation's Council. 
  The session on "Mediterranean and Black Sea International 
Network for Clean Technology Transfer" sounded the alarm as 
regarded the ecological situation, warning on the necessity that 
urgent steps be taken in order to mend the situation. "The 
Black Sea pollution is a very urgent and very important issue 
for the international community," said in turn Jean Paul 
Carteron, president of the Forum Foundation. The Black Sea, he 
said, is an ecological bomb, as tremendous amounts of wastes 
were disposed of in it. The speakers highlighted the necessity 
of a more intense cooperation among the riperian countries in 
view of curbing this real scourge and sustained the idea of 
developing and transferring clean technologies allowing both for 
industrial development and the preservation of an unpolluted 
environment. Aurel Constantin Ilie, minister of environment of 
Romania, stressed his country's interest and involvement in the 
transfer of technology both as regarded the Black Sea protection 
but also the protection of the Danube and its delta for which 
there was even an international project. He showed there are 14 
zones in Romania where the environment is systematically damaged 
by polluting technologies. Romania does have solutions for 
these zones but no funds to apply them, he added.
