GARDEN GROVE WOMAN DIES IN CRASH 
An elderly woman was killed Sunday when her car went through a red light, 
struck a pickup truck and crashed through the display window of an auto 
dealership in Garden Grove. 
Inga Jones, 83, of Garden Grove was pronounced dead on arrival at UC Irvine 
Medical Center after the 6:55 p.m. accident, authorities said. 
The woman was driving west on Garden Grove Boulevard when she apparently failed 
to notice the red light at Brookhurst Street, said Detective Mike Clabaugh of 
the Garden Grove Police Department. Her car hurtled into a pickup truck, then 
careened into the front of Vina Auto Sales. 
Clabaugh said Jones was fatally injured when she struck the steering wheel and 
dashboard of her car. She was not wearing a seat belt.
