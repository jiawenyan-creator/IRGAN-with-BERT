  [Text] More than ever before, the question of Kosova has 
been put on the daily agenda of international issues, President 
Rugova stressed in a recent interview with ZERI journal. 
  Speaking about the possibility of starting the process of 
resolving the Kosova problem, Rugova stressed that the 
Muslim-Croat agreement in Bosnia and, before it, the NATO 
ultimatum, mark the beginning of the process of ending the war 
in Bosnia. Within this framework, we can consider the 
possibility of the necessity of resolving the Kosova issue. 
  After assessing the pragmatism of U.S. policy and its role 
in 
considering the question of Kosova, President Rugova added that 
so far, Europe has enabled the preservation of the status quo 
but not the solution of problems in former Yugoslavia. He 
stressed the role of U.S. initiative in mediation, in which 
European allies should take a part in consultation with Russia. 
  He added that the beginning of a dialogue would mark an 
important achievement, although dialogue should be seen as a 
process. We should be prepared for negotiations to defend our 
position.
