 

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a series and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same series will
relate solely to: (a) the method of financing certain expenses that may be imposed upon a particular class of shares
and which are limited to (i) incremental transfer agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable
to a specific class of shares, (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials
such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class of shares, (iii)
blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares,
(v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class,
(vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares, (vii) trustees' fees incurred as a
result of issues relating to one class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified
that should be properly allocated to one class of shares which shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order,
(collectively, ``Class Expenses''); (b) the impact of different rule 12b1 plan (if any) or shareholder services
plan (if any) payments made by a particular class of shares; (c) voting rights on matters which pertain to rule 12b1
plans or shareholder services plans; (d) the conversion feature applicable to classes of shares sold subject to a
CDSC which are convertible into a class of shares not subject to a CDSC; and (e) the designation of each class of shares
of a series. 
 
2. If a series implements any amendment to its rule 12b1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by a class of shares under the plan into which another class will convert (the ``Target Class''), existing
shares of the class that will convert (``Purchase Class'') will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the
Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The trustees shall take such action
as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares
(``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed
advisable by the trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase
Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material
respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class or New Purchase
Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall
be effected in any manner that the trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance
with condition 6 below, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class
or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Advisers and the Distributors. Purchase Class shares sold after
the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided
that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are
disclosed in an effective registration statement. 
 
3. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion,
the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined
in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based
sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.
