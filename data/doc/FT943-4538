FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Baird to refocus activities
William Baird, one of Marks and Spencer's leading suppliers, yesterday
announced plans to withdraw from the engineering sector and concentrate on
its core clothing and textiles business.
Announcing flat first-half profits of Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 8.77m), the group
said its long-term aim was to sell its three remaining engineering
businesses.
'We want to focus on textiles and we will make disposals, although we're not
in any hurry,' said Mr Donald Barr, chairman.
The engineering division made a reduced contribution of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds
2.7m) following the disposal earlier this year of the UK businesses of
Darchem's building services division, a provider of relocatable
accommodation units, and some of the assets of the Dalfratex and Scotswood
businesses.
By comparison, the textiles division reported a 24 per cent increase in
operating profits to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 7m) in the six months to June 30.
Sales by the division - comprising contract clothing, home furnishing,
fabrics and brand clothing - rose 15 per cent to Pounds 233.3m (Pounds
203.6m), and underpinned a rise from Pounds 230.7m to Pounds 240.5m in the
group total.
Of the textile businesses, the sharpest improvement was reported by contract
clothing, which increased profits from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 4.38m
following a maiden first half contribution from Richard I Racke, the M&amp;S
supplier acquired last year.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 5.2p, and the interim dividend is
maintained at 3.55p.
