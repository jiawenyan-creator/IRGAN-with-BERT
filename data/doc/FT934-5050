FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Fundamental reviews of expenditure are under way
 -Red Book details
The government announced in February that it would conduct in-depth reviews
of all public spending by every department of state. This work, expected to
take much of the period of this parliament to complete, goes well beyond
traditional survey arrangements. It examines long term trends in spending on
individual programmes to assess whether these are sustainable. It seeks out
areas from which the state might withdraw altogether or where better
targeting is appropriate.
This work is focused on the medium term; but the early results of the first
four reviews (into social security, health, education and the Home Office)
have helped inform the decisions taken during this Survey affecting those
four departments.
The next batch of reviews will cover employment and transport programmes,
the legal departments, Trade and Industry, Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise, HM Treasury and urban expenditure.
