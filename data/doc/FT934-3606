FT  08 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Helping to make the NHS more
efficient
Sir, As a former director of human resources in an NHS trust hospital, I
agree that efficiencies attained in the private sector are attainable in the
NHS. However, I believe that there are five significant pre-conditions:
(1) Any savings made on reducing central bureaucracy should not be
immediately clawed back by the Treasury but rather made available by trusts
to facilitate change.
(2) Boards of directors must be allowed real freedom, without the
interference of national pay bodies, to negotiate locally whatever salaries
are required to recruit and retain the best clinical and managerial staff
within their overall budget.
(3) The rules on capital spending must be relaxed to allow private
investment.
(4) The cost of large-scale redundancies, which currently is borne in year
and therefore can prevent a trust from meeting targets, should either be
centrally funded or allowed for over a longer period, say five years.
(5) The rules on transfer of undertakings for public employees needs to be
sorted out to facilitate contracting out of non-core activities.
Public service organisations want to do better but government has to
deliver.
