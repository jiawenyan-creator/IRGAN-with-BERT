FT  30 JUN 94 / New leader for Italy's CGIL
The CGIL, Italy's main union confederation long dominated by the left,
yesterday elected Mr Sergio Cofferati, a leading member of the chemical
workers' union, to succeed Mr Bruno Trentinas as secretary-general. Mr
Cofferati, 46, will be the CGIL's youngest leader. He also breaks the
tradition of selecting the leadership from the ranks of the powerful
engineers. He takes over at a difficult time for the union movement,
experiencing declining membership and a steady erosion of influence. More
than half of the CGIL's 5m members are now pensioners. The confederation is
under pressure to forge a closer ties, if not merge, with the other two main
confederations, the CISL and the UIL. The three no longer reflect the old
cold war division of the union movement when the CGIL was dominated by the
Communists, the CISL by the Christian Democrats and the UIL by the
Socialists and Social Democrats.
