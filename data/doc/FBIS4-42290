<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jalal Talabani, Patriotic Union of </F>
Kurdistan leader, by Mehmet Ali Birand in Damascus for the "32d 
Day" program -- live; in English with simultaneous Turkish 
translation] 
  [Text] [Birand] We are receiving reports that forces 
belonging to Mas'ud Barzani have captured the Halabjah area and 
that your forces are withdrawing. Are these reports correct? 
  [Talabani] No, they are not correct. Barzani's forces are 
being supported by Iran, and for this reason they captured 
Halabjah. 
  [Birand] So, actually Iranians captured Halabjah. Is that 
correct? 
  [Talabani] Forces belonging to Islamic Action, Hezbollah, 
and 
the KDP [Kurdish Democratic Party] have captured the Halabjah 
area with the support of Iran. 
  [Birand] Could you tell me your reasons for fighting 
Barzani? 
  [Talabani] There is no fighting right now. There was 
fighting four, five days ago. 
  [Birand] Yes, but you are saying that Islamic Movement 
forces 
and the Hezbollah are fighting against you. What do you think 
they want? 
  [Talabani] This was true four days ago. Is is not true now. 
Four days ago, they were fighting with Iran's support. There is 
no fighting right now. 
  [Birand] Turkey is trying to mediate between you and Mr. 
Barzani. Did you agree to meet Mr. Barzani, in Turkey or in 
some other place? 
  [Talabani] We welcome Turkish mediation and I am ready to 
meet Mr. Barzani. 
  [Birand] What do you ask in order to establish a cease-fire? 
What do you expect from Mr. Barzani? What do you want Turkey to 
tell him? 
  [Talabani] There are problems between Mr. Barzani and 
myself. 
We have to establish a cease-fire and pave the way for a 
political solution. 
  [Birand] Will you meet Mr. Barzani in Turkey? Do you know 
when you will meet him? 
  [Talabani] I will meet Mr. Barzani very soon. 
  [Birand] Who will not attend the meeting? Have you already 
agreed to come to Turkey? Is it Mr. Barzani who is postponing 
the meeting? 
  [Talabani] I think Mr. Barzani will arrive in Turkey in the 
coming days. 
  [Birand] Does that mean that in the next few days you two 
will meet in Turkey? 
  [Talabani] I do not have a clear idea. 
  [Birand] KDP officials say that you are in cooperation with 
the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Can you tell me why you 
are cooperating with the PKK? 
  [Talabani] I do not know who is saying these things. We are 
not cooperating with any forces. We trust our own people and 
our own forces. The Kurds know who those are who trust 
foreigners and foreign forces. 
  [Birand] We have received quite a number of reports 
regarding 
your cooperation with the PKK. We have reports that the PKK is 
more active in territories under your control. 
  [Talabani] I can give you an example. It has been possible 
for the people of the KDP around the Irbil area to capture 
(Badiras) under these good conditions. [sentence as heard] 
  [Birand] Don't you think that the PKK is gaining power in 
northern Iraq while you fight the KDP? 
  [Talabani] There is no PKK presence in our area. Perhaps, 
the PKK has a small camp outside Zhalah and this camp is full of 
women, children, and sick people. I am not aware of any other 
PKK presence. 
  [Birand] There are reports attesting to the PKK presence in 
northern Iraq. In conclusion, what do you think will be the 
outcome of your meeting with Mr. Barzani. Will there be a peace 
agreement? 
  [Talabani] I plan on coming to Turkey shortly and meeting 
with Mr. Barzani. 
  [Birand] I thank you very much, Mr. Talabani.
