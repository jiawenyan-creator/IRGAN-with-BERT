  [Text] Furukawa Electric Industry Co., Ltd. (Furukawa 
Electric), has developed a highly heat-resistant, plastic-based 
optical fiber that can be used at temperatures of up to 
145C. As a result of the adoption of a new, highly 
heat-resistant plastic for the optical signal transmitting core, 
the new fiber was found to have signal transmission performances 
greatly superior to those of silicone-based optical fiber, 
previously considered the most heat resistant, particularly 
under conditions of high temperature and high humidity. The 
fiber is being produced in two grades: one capable of 
withstanding a temperature up to 145C, and the other, 
125C. Their prices are approximately 4-9 times that of 
PMMA-based (poly-methylmethacrylate-based) optical fiber. 
Furukawa Electric plans to develop applications for the new 
optical fiber in automotive electrical equipment and optical 
sensors. 
  The performance of an optical fiber is essentially 
determined 
by its core material. Today, among plastic-based optical fibers, 
the PMMA core is the mainstream because PMMA has excellent 
optical transparency and optical transmission capability. 
However, PMMA is stable to temperatures in the 80-85C range 
only. Spaces around an automotive engine sometimes reach 
temperatures as high as 120C, which limits the use of PMMA. 
Also commercialized are optical fibers based on thermosetting 
silicone which is stable up to 150-170C. However, such 
fibers do not have excellent transmission capability, and they 
tend to show serious deterioration at high temperature and 
humidity. 
  According to the explanation given by Furukawa Electric's 
Optical Technology Research Institute, the plastic used for the 
fiber core was ``a highly heat-resistant resin that had not seen 
much optical applications.'' The transmission loss in an optical 
fiber is mainly caused by the absorption of light as a result of 
the resonance between the signal light and carbon-oxygen 
molecular bonds that are usually present in plastic materials. 
Although full disclosure has not been made on the new fiber, the 
following has been reported: ``Much effort was given to reduce 
the molecular bonds that would resonate with signals of 
wavelengths of 660 and 760 mm, in order to minimize the 
absorption.'' As a result, the transmission loss with the new 
fiber was only 0.6 dB/m, which was worse than 0.2 dB/m of the 
PMMA fiber, but better than that 1.3 dB/m of the silicone-based 
fiber (see the attached table). 
  The new fiber did not change its transmission capability 
even 
after left standing at a temperature of 145C. If that had 
been a PMMA fiber, its core would have melted and become 
incapable of optical transmission after one hour. Furthermore, 
the new fiber's transmission loss increased by only 0.2 dB/m 
after left standing for 500 hours in a high-temperature, 
high-humidity environment at 80C and 95 percent relative 
humidity. Under the same conditions, a silicone-based fiber 
would ``absorb moisture resulting in serious optical scattering 
inside the core, and the transmission loss would increase by 1.5 
dB/m.'' 
  Another advantage of the new fiber over the silicone-based 
fiber is its machinability. An optical fiber needs to have a 
mirror finish on its end face in order to minimize the end-face 
scattering loss when optical signals enter the end face. It 
takes five minutes or so to cut and grind the end face of a 
thermosetting, hard silicone-based fiber, which can also be 
easily damaged. In contrast, the end face of the new optical 
fiber, being thermoplastic like PMMA, can be mirror-finished by 
simply pressing the face against a heated plate for less than 
one second.
