2 Chartwell Representatives Quit Avon Panel: Explaining the resignations, 
Chartwell Associates said the special Avon Products Inc. committee was 
unwilling to find ways to increase the value of the cosmetics company. 
Avon denied the allegation. The panel was part of a truce worked out in the 
spring under which Chartwell agreed not to wage a threatened proxy fight 
against Avon. Avon's stock rose $1.25 to $26.75 in NYSE trading.
