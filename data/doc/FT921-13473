FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lords urge end to row over blocked
EC funds - Regional Development
THE government was urged yesterday to settle a long-standing European
Community regional funding dispute in order to release cash for development
projects.
The Lords committee on the EC warned that important programmes were being
delayed by disagreement with the Commission over the concept of
'additionality'. The Brussels rule says any structural expenditure decided
by the EC must be additional to that which would be spent by national
authorities.
Britain's inability to satisfy the Commission that this principle was being
followed in all cases has slowed down the receipt of money for a number of
projects around the country.
In a report which generally backed the aims of Commission policies on
reducing regional disparities in the EC, the committee said the
additionality row was causing particular setbacks to a scheme to revitalise
former mining areas in South Yorkshire.
The committee recommended that by making local government finance procedures
more transparent, Britain could show that anticipated grants for UK spending
plans did, in fact, add to what would have been spent without the extra
money.
The report pointed out that Britain was the main country affected by an
'additionality' discord with the Commission.
