  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China's 
129-billion-yuan budgeted debts for 1994 will not hobble 
economic growth, said K. C. Mun, an economics professor of the 
Chinese University of Hong Kong, who is here attending a session 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
(CPPCC). 
  According to Chinese Government's 1994 draft budget, the 
country's internal and external debts will total 129.245 billion 
yuan, 39.361 billion yuan bigger than the previous year's. 
  Mun did not regard that as a serious problem, saying that 
the 
debts will account for only 3.8 percent of the gross national 
product (GNP) and that the ratio of debts to GNP is far lower 
than that for Western economies. 
  "The debts are within a safe margin," said Mun, noting that 
China's current economic growth rate will enable the country to 
repay the principal and interest. 
  From this year on, the government begins to make up its 
deficit by issuing treasury bonds instead of overdrawing on the 
banks. This is the main reason for the rise of debts, Mun said. 
  He said that the change will greatly strengthen the role of 
the central bank in regulating and stabilizing banking business, 
and in accelerating the establishment of a full-fledged bond 
market. 
  He suggested that China issue bonds overseas to draw foreign 
funds to the domestic market. 
  A real danger for China's economy, he said, is runaway 
investment in fixed assets by local governments. 
  "Today, what is urgently needed is concerted efforts by the 
central and local governments to exercise macro-controls, 
especially on unbudgeted fixed assets investment," he said.
