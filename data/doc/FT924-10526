FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Asia Pacific off to
slow start
THE Asia Pacific new vehicle market has enjoyed the fastest growth rate of
any region during the past 15 years, but General Motors remains a relatively
small participant.
Its regional strategy remains fragmentary with its main presence revolving
around a 37.4 per cent shareholding in Isuzu, one of the smaller Japanese
vehicle makers. Isuzu is mainly a producer of commercial vehicles and
four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicles, while its car operations lack the
scale of its competitors.
Isuzu is providing significant product and technology support for GM's light
commercial vehicle and four-wheel drive leisure utility vehicle ranges in
global markets, but it has also confronted GM with serious problems in the
face of continuing losses. GM also holds a 3.5 per cent stake in Suzuki.
Elsewhere in Asia one of GM's main targets for involvement in the rapid
growth of the region was in South Korea, where it has held a 50 per cent
stake in Daewoo Motor. GM had hoped to develop the venture as an important
low-cost production base in Asia. It provided technology in the shape of the
Opel Kadett which has been produced in South Korea and sold in the US.
But the venture has been dogged by problems and by the divergent ambitions
of the two shareholders, GM and the Daewoo group. The conflicts have led
this year to divorce and a final agreement is expected to be signed soon,
under which the Daewoo group will take over GM's 50 per cent holding for
around Dollars 170m.
GM appears to be looking belatedly at the prospects for growth in China,
where it formed a joint venture early this year for the production of light
commercial vehicles. It has been more successful in Taiwan, where it sold
nearly 15,000 vehicles last year and plans to begin assembling Opel cars
next year.
