  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 28 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korea 
realistically have just enough time for only one of the two 
sides to dispatch a presidential envoy, and this will have to be 
enough to meet the prerequisites for the third round high-level 
Pyongyang-Washington dialogue, an official here said Monday. 
  The official said Seoul's announcement on suspending South 
Korea-U.S. joint military exercise "Team Spirit" can be made 
only after the inter-Korean contact takes place at the truce 
village of Panmunjom. 
  North Korea said it will respond Tuesday to South Korean 
proposal for contact, clouding chances that the inter-Korean 
meeting can take place in the morning as expected. 
  If the meeting fails to open, then the Team Spirit 
suspension 
announcement would necessarily have to be delayed as well, the 
official said. 
  Pyongyang and Washington agreed on a small package deal 
where 
they and Seoul would announce on Tuesday the steps each would 
take. 
  North Korea is to accept an International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspection team and allow it to begin nuclear 
check from March 1. 
  South Korea, in return, is to announce Team Spirit 
suspension 
while the United States will announce the date and place of next 
round of high-level dialogue with North Korea. 
  Announcements by Seoul and Washington, however, carry 
conditions that North Korea must allow unrestricted inspections 
by the IAEA and must successfully carry out inter-Korean 
exchange of presidential envoys. 
  "We hope that both Seoul and Pyongyang would be able to 
exchange envoys before the North Korea-U.S. meeting. But 
realistically, time allows us to have only one side make the 
visit," the official said on condition of anonymity. 
  The Pyongyang-Washington dialogue is set for March 21 in 
Geneva.
