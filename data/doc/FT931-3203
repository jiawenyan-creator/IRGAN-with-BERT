FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Fuel and excise duty dismay for car owners
MOTORISTS were hit yesterday by increases in both fuel duty and vehicle
excise duty.
The taxation of the private use of company cars will also rise significantly
in the next financial year.
The company car taxation system will be drastically reformed from 1994/95
through a system based on car list prices rather than on engine size. This
will mean increases in tax bills for a large minority of drivers but smaller
bills for more than half. Thereafter, individuals' own choice of cars will
determine the size of their tax liability.
The government warned yesterday that the cost of motoring is set to rise in
real terms every year. It intends to raise road fuel duties by at least 3
per cent a year in real terms in all future Budgets as an incentive for
motorists to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles.
The price of a gallon of unleaded petrol rose yesterday by 12p to around
Pounds 2.29, while that of a gallon of 4-star rose by 15p to around Pounds
2.52.
Duties on all road fuels, including diesel, rose by 10 per cent and the
vehicle excise duty on cars was raised by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125.
These raise by Pounds 50 the average cost of motoring for a driver covering
10,000 miles a year.
Company car users face a further 8 per cent increase this year in tax scale
charges, which the chancellor claimed would raise company car taxation 'to a
level which fully reflects the true value of the benefit of a company car.'
In spite of the increases, the motor industry gave a cautious welcome to the
Budget, but car retailers warned of the impact on new car sales of the
chancellor's determination to increase the cost of motoring in real terms in
every future Budget.
The Automobile Association said the government's motoring tax proposals were
'more highway robbery'.
'With one hand the chancellor has taken more from the motorist in excise
duty than he needs to replace new car tax; with the other, he has made all
motorists subsidise new cars, and done little to benefit the environment or
industry.'
Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, said: 'The increase in both fuel
tax and vehicle excise duty further increases the cost of motoring, but, on
balance, affects the cost of usage more than ownership, which is our
preferred option.'
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, said that the reform of company car taxation was 'extremely
welcome'.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation said the company car tax reforms were
'sensible' and would 'produce a fairer and more transparent tax system than
previously'.
The Freight Transport Association claimed that industry's costs had risen by
at least Pounds 230m a year with the 10 per cent increase in the duty on
diesel. 'In real terms this increase in fuel duty will mean that the cost of
operating a 38 tonne truck will go up by about Pounds 1,000 a year,' it
said.
