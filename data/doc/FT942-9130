FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges up but investors
stay cautious
Wall Street
Although US blue chip issues tended to edge higher yesterday in the wake of
firmer bonds, trading was subdued as the market awaited a likely interest
rate increase from the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 11.82 ahead at 3,671.50.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a slight 0.35 up at 444.49,
but the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.89 easier at 431.68 and
the Nasdaq composite down 5.01 at 711.91.
Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 235m shares and overall
declines narrowly outpaced rises by 1,185 to 961.
From the opening bell, the mood of the market was cautious, with traders and
investors reluctant to commit themselves ahead of today's meeting of the
Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee. Wall Street analysts expect the
FOMC to sanction a rate increase, possibly one as large as a 50 basis-point
rise in the federal funds rate and a similar increase in the discount rate.
If the Fed puts up rates, it will be the fourth monetary policy tightening
in as many months, and like the previous three, it will be designed to slow
the pace of economic growth and stave off any return of inflation.
Trading was subdued yesterday, not just because of the expectation of a rate
rise, but also because participants were unsure how the market will react if
the Fed does act. Normally, rate increases are bad for stocks, but because
the move is already priced into the bond and equity markets, investors may
be disappointed if the Fed decides not to act this week. Conversely, a rate
increase could be greeted by a jump in share prices, primarily because it
would please the bond market and end any uncertainty about Fed policy.
Yesterday, what little strength there was in equities came courtesy of a
firmer bond market, where the benchmark 30-year bond improved  1/2 point,
and the yield edged lower to 7.446 per cent. Analysts said bonds advanced
because the April industrial production figures - which showed a rise of 0.3
per cent - contained no nasty surprises.

in busy trading on news that General Motors, the company's parent, plans to

Another stock higher on news of a divestiture was Mead Corp, which put on

Mead Data Central unit so that it could focus in future on its core forest
