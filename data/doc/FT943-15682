FT  08 JUL 94 / IBM plans to shut the door
IBM yesterday gave the European Commission a year's notice that it intends
to drop an undertaking it gave in 1984 to supply on request information to
some competitors enabling them to design systems compatible with IBM
equipment. The undertaking was given after Commission complaints that its
dominant position in the information technology industry was harming
competition. The voluntary undertaking included computer memory and software
practices, and resulted in the suspension of proceedings against IBM in one
of the biggest competition cases ever to come before Brussels. The
Commission will review the case next year to decide whether IBM still
occupies a dominant position. Yesterday, IBM said: 'The information
technology industry and numerous business practices have changed
dramatically since we signed this undertaking in 1984. . . . the dynamics of
the industry have made most of the undertaking's terms obsolete.'
