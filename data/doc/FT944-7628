FT  24 NOV 94 / Yeltsin's bank chief rejected
The Russian parliament yesterday rebelled against President Boris Yeltsin's
nominee for the chair of the central bank - defeating the candidacy of Mrs
Tatyana Paramonova by 127 votes to 10. The surprise vote came 'not because
we did not like Tatyana Paramonova but because we did not like the way she
was proposed and the way Victor Gerashchenko (the previous chairman) was
relieved of his post' according to Mr Sergei Baburin, one of the leaders of
the nationalist opposition in the state duma (lower house)'. Mr
Gerashchenko, with other senior officials and ministers, was a victim of the
sudden fall of the rouble on 'Black Tuesday' last month and the resulting
wrath of the president. The vote leaves Mrs Paramonova, a former deputy
chairwoman, as acting head of the bank - a weak position at a time when the
financial authorities in Russia are pushing for the acceptance of a tough
budget for next year aimed at bringing down inflation to 1 per cent a month
by the end of 1995. Mr Yeltsin faces the choice of keeping her in an acting
position, or proposing a compromise candidate.
