FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Recovery continues at Saab
Automobile
Saab Automobile, the Swedish carmaker, yesterday announced a SKr284m
(Dollars 39.4m) pre-tax profit for the first nine months and said it was on
course for its first full-year profit in six years.
The result represented a SKr1.34bn improvement on 1993's figures and
reflected cost-cutting, higher sales volumes and the weakness of the Swedish
krona.
The third-quarter profit of SKr144m was the group's second successive
quarterly surplus. It ended a five-year stretch of losses that dated back to
1989, when General Motors of the US became a joint owner in the company,
alongside Saab-Scania. In the third quarter of 1993 the group made a SKr369m
loss.
Saab's turnround was reflected in higher sales for the nine months, which
rose to SKr13.06bn from SKr11.47bn.
Retail sales jumped 24 per cent to 65,700 units from 52,800.
The success of the group's new 900 model, launched last year, has been the
most significant factor in the upturn. It accounted for 40,600 sales in the
nine-month period, compared with 25,100 for the older and bigger Saab 9000.
The company expects to sell about 92,000 cars in 1994, comfortably
surpassing last year's 73,600 and the break-even level of 83,000.
At one point the group hoped 1994 sales might climb as high as 95,000. A
shortage of convertible and 3-door 900 models, particularly in the important
US market, is the main reason it expects to fall short of this level.
US sales are expected to reach 23,000, compared with 18,000 last year.
The group's other improving markets include Sweden - where nine-month sales
rose to 12,300 from 7,000 - Taiwan, Australia and Italy.
The company said the weaker dollar would only have a limited impact on its
1994 figures, partly because of hedging.
Saab has swallowed more than SKr8bn in new capital from its owners and
accumulated losses of more than SKr11bn since General Motors became a
shareholder and took over management.
In 1993 the group made a SKr1.37bn loss.
