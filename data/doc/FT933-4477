FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (10): Satellites move closer
to earth - Global Technology Projects
LAST MONTH the dream of a truly global handheld mobile telephone service
moved a step closer when Motorola, the US electronics group, won financial
backing for its Iridium satellite tele- communications system - described as
the world's biggest private-sector aerospace project.
Companies from North and South America, Europe and Asia agreed to provide
Dollars 100m in cash and promised another Dollars 700m as the first stage in
financing the Dollars 3.4bn Iridium project.
Motorola, which conceived the project, has invested about Dollars 270m of
the Dollars 800m itself and expects its stake to fall to 15 per cent as new
investors join. Other US investors include Raytheon, the aerospace company,
and Sprint, the telecommunications group.
In Europe Stet, the holding company for Italy's domestic and international
telecoms businesses, is involved as is Mawarid, a Saudi Arabian industrial
group. The Japanese, including Sony, Mitsubishi and Mitsui, have invested as
the Nippon Iridium Corporation.
The financing agreement gives Motorola a clear lead in the race to build a
mobile telephone system capable of handling telecommunications traffic
literally 'from anywhere on earth'.
Satellite systems already provide a range of key telecommunications services
including maritime and aeronautical communications where land-based systems
are not an option. They also provide links to inhospitable and remote areas
of the world using briefcase-size portable satellite terminals, such as
those supplied by Inmarsat, the London-based 69-member International
Maritime Satellite Organisation.
These mobile com- munications satellite services are mostly based on
geostat- ionary satellites (Geos) which orbit the earth at a height of
12,000 miles or more. In contrast the Iridium system, and a handful of
similar schemes proposed by other consortia, are based on an emerging
technology called low earth orbit satellites (Leos).
Leos orbit at a much lower 550 to 6,000 miles. Because they are closer to
earth, telecom- munications systems built around Leos should suffer less
from the characteristic echo heard on some satellite voice links.
Perhaps more importantly, they will work with much less powerful - and
therefore smaller and lighter and cheaper - telecommunic- ations equipment
including pocket-sized handsets.
However Leos do have a number of disadvantages. Like Geos, they are solar
powered but because they orbit lower they will spend more time in shadow and
therefore have a much shorter lifespan of around five years compared to 10
or more for conventional satellites. They also rely on largely untested
digital telecommunications tech- nologies.
But their biggest - and costliest - disadvantage is that to provide reliable
global coverage many more Leos are needed than would be the case with their
higher-flying counterparts. In the case of Motorola's Iridium project for
example, 66 small telecom- munications satellites will be required.
Iridium plans to place the 'constellation' of satellites in orbit over two
years starting in 1996 and will use a combin- ation of McDonnell Douglas
Delta rockets from the US, the Proton rocket from Russia and China's Long
March launch vehicle. Commercial services would start in 1998.
Another five US-based consortia have proposed similar schemes although none
are quite as ambitious as Iridium and no other project has yet won hard cash
financial backing.
They include Odyssey (6-12 satellites), Globalstar (48 satellites), Ellipso
(12-24 satellites) and Constellation (48 satellites.) Participants in these
other Leo telecom- munications projects include US aerospace companies
Loral, TRW and Fairchild; France's Matra, Aerospatiale and Alcatel; Deutsche
Aerospace; Matra-Marconi, the Anglo- French joint venture; and Italy's
Alenia.
Most of the groups plan to start commercial operations between 1996 and
1999, some with coverage limited initially to the northern hemisphere.
Another group, American Mobile Satellite, a joint venture between McCaw,
Hughes and MTEL, already has a geostationary satellite system in operation
although coverage is limited to just North America.
Several other groups including Orbital Sciences and Starsys Global
Positioning of the US have plans for Leo systems which would provide data
rather than voice services.
Motorola's success in securing financial backing for Iridium is expected to
trigger a race between the other Leo contenders. Not only are there limits
to the world's satellite launching capacity, but most analysts believe the
market can probably support only two competitors.
To supplement revenues from voice traffic Leo systems will also carry fax
messages, paging, facsimile, computer data and provide radio- determination
satellite services, which locate telephones by latitude and longitude.
Iridium hopes to attract between 1.5 and 2 per cent of the number of
cellular telephone users by the end of the century - perhaps as many as 1.5m
subscribers.
Each customer will have to buy either an Iridium handset or a dual purpose
handset which will work with both Iridium and the buyer's own local mobile
telephone network. Calls will cost about Dollars 3 a minute, expensive in
comparison with conventional cellular rates.
Some analysts question whether Leos make economic sense as a mass market
voice telecommunications delivery system in competition with
terrestrial-based networks.
Even if the economics of Leo telecommunications networks can be worked out,
their backers face some formidable other problems. Not least is the need to
raise further substantial funding.
Iridium, for example, will need to follow last month's initial funding
tranche by another of almost equal size within two years. The remaining 60
per cent of the money needed will come from the debt market, says Goldman
Sachs, Motorola's adviser. By that stage Iridium and system developers will
also have to overcome a number of other difficult issues if they are to win
the backing of inter- national investors.
Among these is the issue of frequency allocation. Last year the World
Administrative Radio Conference in Spain agreed which frequencies to
allocate to Leos in principle.
But since then, the various groups backing the systems have been unable to
agree how this allocation should be divided up - threatening to delay the
timetable for licensing global mobile satellite systems in the US.
The dispute has arisen because Iridium, unlike all its other rivals, plans
to use time division multiple access technology - which does not allow
sharing - for its system. Each TDMA user has to be granted the exclusive use
of a designated block of frequen- cies. In contrast, all the other proposed
systems would use code division multiple access or spread spectrum
technology which is able to share a block of frequencies. The US Federal
Communications Commission has yet to rule on the issue.
Another set of unresolved problems relates to who should regulate Leo
operators - an issue which is exercising the European Commission and other
would-be regulators. Motorola, like most of the other contenders, has only
an experimental licence from the FCC while a European Com- mission report on
Leo satellite networks in December 1992 said it would take at least another
five years to answer regulatory and other questions.
However the biggest problem remains the apparent potential oversupply of
satellite system operators. That has not been eased by Inmarsat's own plans
for a new satellite-based global hand-held mobile telephone service
designated Project 21.
Inmarsat, seen by many as the main rival for Motorola's Iridium project, had
planned to base Project 21 on a Dollars 2bn Leo network. However, at the end
of July it abandoned the Leo concept in favour of a network using fewer
satellites placed in higher geostationary or inter- mediate orbits.
The decision to opt for a conventional system, taken after Inmarsat
commissioned reports on the various options and a potential user survey,
should enable Inmarsat to reduce its investment to about Dollars 1bn.
But whether the decision will benefit Iridium and the other Leo groups is a
moot point. On the one hand, it means Inmarsat is giving up the supposed
advantages of Leos and could have implic- ations for the type of service
that it is able to offer. This may make it easier for Mot- orola and others
to secure investor support for their Leo systems. On the other hand, it
highlights the technical com- plexities of Leo systems and may enable
Inmarsat to prov- ide a significantly cheaper service.
In the next few years these contrasting approaches will be put to the test.
Whatever the outcome, it seems certain that the by the end of the decade
satellites will have added another important dimension to hand-held mobile
communications.
