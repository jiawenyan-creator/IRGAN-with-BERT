  [Text] YONHAP--It has been learned that the U.S. Government 
is considering to forcibly deport Kim Chong-hwi, former 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] presidential senior secretary 
for foreign affairs and national security, whose application for 
permanent U.S. residency has recently become a diplomatic issue 
between the ROK and the United States. 
  A high-ranking government official said on 28 January 
"regarding our government's 26 January official request against 
Kim's application for U.S. visa extension and permanent 
residency, the U.S. side informed us of its intention to shelve 
his visa extension." 
  The official added: "I know Kim's visa holds good for one 
year and it would expire in April. The U.S. Government is 
considering the question of shelving his visa extension and 
deporting him from the United States." 
  This official, however, expressed his concern by saying: 
"What is annoying is that there is legally no way for our 
government to bring him home, even if the United States did 
expel him, unless he returns voluntarily. There is a 
possibility that the matter becomes complicated, if Kim chooses 
to go to a third country." 
  The official predicted that "it is hard to expect an 
immediate settlement of the Kim issue, because if the United 
States shelves his visa extension, Kim would be able to stay in 
the United States for at least a period of time if he decided to 
retain a lawyer to legally fight the case."
