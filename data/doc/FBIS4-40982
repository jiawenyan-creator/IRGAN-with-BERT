  [Text] The Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy is concerned 
about the possibility of creating nuclear weapons in North Korea 
and other countries, Head of the Ministry's Public Relations 
Department Georgiy Kaurov told a press conference in Moscow. 
North Korea has no nuclear weapons today, he said. But every 
country possessing a nuclear reactor can create a nuclear bomb, 
he added. 
  He announced that any reactor can produce plutonium which 
may 
be used for creating a nuclear bomb. However, a nuclear bomb 
cannot be made without a radiochemical laboratory. North Korea 
will finish the construction of such a laboratory in 1996, he 
said. 
  He stated that not a single specialist possessing 
information 
about methods of creating nuclear weapons has left or will leave 
Russia. There are no Russian nuclear physicists in North Korea, 
he said. 
  The Ministry's leading specialist in atomic energy Vladislav 
Kotlov said that conclusions about the amount of accumulated 
plutonium might be made indirectly, without an inspection. One 
can assert that North Korea has nuclear weapons only after 
tests, he said. He believes that the amount of plutonium 
accumulated in North Korea is measured in grams and is 
insufficient for creating nuclear weapons. 
  He thinks that nuclear weapons in North Korea are a 
political 
issue and that some would like to overly exaggerate it. "All 
this is coming from South Korea and Japan, whose position is 
supported by the U.S.," he said. 
  Kotlov, who ran the construction of the North Korean nuclear 
complex, said that the construction got underway in 1963 and 
that two years later a water-type nuclear reactor was put into 
service. 
  The North Korean nuclear complex was intended for the 
production of isotopes for medical and industrial purposes, and 
for carrying out experiments. The North Korean reactor's 
capacity was 2000 kilowatt when it was put into operation, he 
said.
