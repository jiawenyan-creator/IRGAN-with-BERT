FT  08 FEB 93 / Belgium opts for federal state
BELGIUM'S parliament has approved wide-ranging reforms to transform the
country into a federal state and devolve more powers to its regions, writes
Andrew Hill in Brussels.
But the vote - a majority of only two - is unlikely to end the acrimonious
debate about whether constitutional reform heralds a split between
Flemish-speaking Flanders and francophone Wallonia. The vote rewrites the
first article of the constitution for the first time since Belgian
independence in 1830. Subject to approval in the upper parliamentary
chamber, it now reads: 'Belgium is a federal state.'
The package of reforms, many which still have to be approved, will devolve
responsibility for agriculture and foreign trade to the regions, which
include Brussels.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister and a Flemish Christian
Democrat, denied that a positive vote would precipitate the disintegration
of Belgium. 'I say clearly that this reform of the state does not lead to
separatism but is truly based on federalism,' he said.
