THE STATE; 
CONTRACT SPURS YOSEMITE RUSH 
Tourists flocked to Yosemite National Park after park concession workers 
overwhelmingly approved a new labor contract. The ratification vote eliminated 
the threat of a strike by hundreds of hotel, recreational, custodial and retail 
workers in the park during the usually busy Easter Week. Union members voted 
301 to 14 to accept the new, three-year contract with Yosemite Park and Curry 
Co. The pact includes a 10.5% wage increase over three years along with 
improved health care benefits and improved housing benefits. "Once people heard 
there was a tentative agreement, a lot of them decided to come to the park for 
Easter," said park spokeswoman Mallory Smith.
