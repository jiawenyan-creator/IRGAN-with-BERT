<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Pedro Lovaina, Cuba's charge </F>
d'affaires in Nicaragua, by Alfonso Malespin Jiron in Managua; 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Malespin] Cuba is ready to celebrate 35 years of 
the victory of its revolution. Under what conditions is the 
Cuban Revolution celebrating this anniversary? 
  [Lovaina] Cuba is celebrating the 35th anniversary of the 
revolution amid the most adverse circumstances in its entire 
history -- a time when the socialist bloc no longer exists and 
the United States is stepping up its inhumane blockade. This 
entails enormous sacrifices by our people, who are resisting in 
an effort to protect our national dignity, sovereignty, and the 
progress achieved in the areas of health, education, and labor. 
  To give just a few examples, this year the death rate for 
children fell to 9.6 for every 1,000 children born alive. We 
have more than 51,000 doctors, and more than 80 percent of the 
population is covered by the family doctor plan. Not a single 
school child has been denied registration. Despite our current 
difficulties, Cuba has achieved very high health indexes 
compared with the ones the revolution encountered in 1959. 
  [Malespin] The Cuban Government implemented important 
changes 
in 1993. What goals does the country plan to achieve with them? 
  [Lovaina] All of the measures uphold our socialist 
principles 
without giving up a planned economy. Although there will be 
increased participation of foreign capital, state ownership will 
prevail. Cuba is looking for structures that will allow a 
better integration into the world economy, particularly with our 
Latin American brothers. 
  [Malespin] Some people think Cuba is implementing a 
Chinese-style communism. Would you place your country in that 
category? 
  [Lovaina] We have taken other experiences into 
consideration, but, above all else, it is essentially a matter 
of implementing an efficient, mature socialism that solves 
national problems and allows us to efficiently achieve 
development without abandoning the concept of social justice, 
essentially taking into consideration maritime ideas, too [as 
published]. 
  [Malespin] Different experts have warned that these measures 
involve too many risks. What is the evaluation as we start 1994? 
  [Lovaina] No human project is free of risk -- nor is it free 
of mistakes -- but it is important to face these risks and 
protect the homeland, the revolution, and socialism, as Fidel 
has stated many times. 
  [Malespin] [Ernesto] Che [Guevara] warned against making the 
mistake of giving imperialism even a foothold. Has not Cuba 
done this with these measures? 
  [Lovaina] He said this within a certain context, and what he 
meant was that no concessions should be made to the principles 
of imperialism. The measures adopted today by Cuba are 
revolutionary measures to defeat the blockade, to save the 
revolution's essential achievements, and to protect our 
sovereignty and national independence. These policies are 
outlined by the Communist Party of Cuba and by Fidel Castro, and 
they are fully supported by our people. 
  [Malespin] The international community has supported Cuba by 
condemning the U.S. blockade, but it also has asked President 
Fidel Castro's Government to make in-depth changes. Will there 
be any in 1994? 
  [Lovaina] The blockade is aimed at isolating Cuba 
politically 
and economically, at undermining the Cuban people's 
determination to resist, and at creating the image that Cuba is 
hell. It does this in an effort to discourage solidarity with 
Cuba and to impose an even more abhorrent political system than 
the one that existed before 1959. 
  While a wall has been built to prevent illegal immigrants 
from other countries from entering the United States, in Cuba's 
case millions of dollars are spent to encourage illegal 
immigrants and people without documents to risk their lives to 
reach U.S. territory. 
  There are no limitations whatsoever on any Cuban citizens of 
legal age to travel to the United States -- or to any other 
country -- just as there are no limitations on any Cubans living 
in the United States, or other U.S. residents, from travelling 
to Cuba. 
  The United States, however, denies visas to 60 percent of 
the 
Cuban citizens who request them at the U.S. interests office in 
Cuba. Also, the U.S. authorities have strict penal sanctions 
for North American citizens who visit Cuba. 
  [Malespin] Referring to official relations with Nicaragua, 
what is their current status. 
  [Lovaina] Official relations between Cuba and Nicaragua are 
good, respectful, and friendly. Until this year, Cuba has 
maintained free medical assistance in Nicaragua, and a Cuban 
medical brigade will end its mission in Nicaragua this year. 
  A new medical assistance agreement has been signed. It will 
be paid for with financial aid from international organizations. 
Also, some 900 Nicaraguan students will receive free 
scholarships in Cuba.
