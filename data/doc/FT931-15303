FT  13 JAN 93 / Pedestrian takes to skis in Aberdeen
A PEDESTRIAN took to skis in Aberdeen yesterday when snow virtually
paralysed Scotland as hundreds of roads were closed by drifts and abandoned
cars.
Police appealed to drivers not to travel needlessly as gales lashed the
country, closing schools, disrupting rail services and leaving thousands of
homes in East Kilbride without power.
A pregnant woman was taken to hospital in a police convoy led by a
snowplough after an RAF rescue helicopter twice failed to reach her home in
Aviemore.
The main A9 trunk road to the Highlands was closed, cutting off the northern
part of the country.
Some minor roads in Edinburgh were closed, and an Automobile Association
official said: 'It is just chaos across the whole of the country.'
The blizzards were the result of a record low-pressure system crossing the
north of the British Isles which also brought chaos south of the border,
hitting Northern Ireland, the north of England, much of Wales and the West
Country.
In Wiltshire a woman driver died when she got out of her car after a
collision and was hit by a car that skidded into a lay-by.
The London Weather Centre said there was no sign of any immediate
improvement, with high winds predicted for the rest of the week, more snow
expected in the north and sleet showers spreading across central and
southern England as temperatures fell.
