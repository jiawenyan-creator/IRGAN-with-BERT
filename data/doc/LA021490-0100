AT&amp;T TO OFFER NEW TRANSLATION SERVICE 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph today will unveil a new nationwide telephone 
translation service designed to help institutions communicate with callers who 
do not speak English. 
The new service will be offered to businesses, public utilities, institutions 
and providers of emergency services, according to an AT&amp;T statement. 
Subscribers would be provided quick access by phone to someone who can 
translate a call received from a speaker of a foreign language. AT&amp;T is 
expected to announce that Spanish and some Asian languages -- Japanese and 
Chinese, for example -- will be among those translated. 
The telecommunications giant is expected to release further details at press 
conferences today in San Francisco and New York City. Officially, AT&amp;T 
would not name the organization providing the translation operations nor 
disclose how subscribers would be charged or which languages would be 
translated. Sources at the company said AT&amp;T has established a new division 
to operate the service. 
The new service is not related to a translation service established about two 
years ago for Spanish-speaking residential AT&amp;T customers. GEORGE WHITE
