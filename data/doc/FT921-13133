FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: DTI launches investigation into
underwriting company
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday launched an investigation
into CR Driver &amp; Company, a small insurance underwriting firm closely linked
with London United Investments, the insurance group which collapsed in May
1990.
The DTI said yesterday that the investigation would be carried out under
Section 432 of the 1985 Companies Act. This is the section of the act which
makes it an offence to misinform shareholders.
The inspectors for CR Driver will be Mr William Marcus QC and Mr Angus
Gilroy. They were appointed inspectors to LUI in October 1990 and the DTI
said yesterday that the new investigation arose from information uncovered
during the work on LUI.
Under the terms of their mandate, the inspectors will have very wide powers
and be able to require the produc-tion of documents and the attendance of
witnesses whom they can examine under oath.
In an affidavit sworn in May last year, the inspectors said that their
investigations showed that between 1976 and 1989, HS Weavers (Underwriting),
a wholly owned subsidiary of LUI, had made deductions totalling Dollars 46m
(Pounds 25.6m) from reinsurance premiums and paid them to companies in
Germany and Switzerland, known as the Smith companies, for reasons that were
still unclear.
CR Driver was not part of the LUI group but it shared a number of common
personnel and Mr Ronnie Driver was a former LUI director and chairman.
The two companies also had the same registered office. CR Driver went into
liquidation on December 3 last year when Mr Raymond Turner of Neville
Russell was appointed liquidator.
The collapse of LUI resulted in the largest ever levy on the 500 general
insurers in the UK: each was asked to pay 0.5 per cent of its net income for
1990 to pay for it.
