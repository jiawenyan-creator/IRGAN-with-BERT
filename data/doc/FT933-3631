FT  13 SEP 93 / People: Non-executive directors
Independent Pension Consultants, the Glasgow-based company which acts as an
independent trustee of employee pension schemes, has appointed Ian Bankier
its non-executive chairman. Bankier is one of Scotland's best known
corporate lawyers. He resigned as partner of the Glasgow solicitors McGrigor
Donald in February to pursue his own interests as a consultant to plcs. He
is on the board of Murray Johnstone Development, a venture capital company
which is part of the Glasgow fund management group, and advises other
companies.
Independent Pension Consultants was set up 20 months ago by Neill Fraser,
formerly with Murray Johnstone. David Bowes-Lyon, a director of Hill Samuel
Scotland who ran Union Discount's Edinburgh office until it was closed last
year, becomes a non-executive director.
