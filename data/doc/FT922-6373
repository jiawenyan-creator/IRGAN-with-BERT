FT  26 MAY 92 / Mafia magistrate's funeral
The funeral of Giovanni Falcone, the magistrate who led Italy's battle
against the Mafia, took place yesterday at Palermo Cathedral, after he was
assassinated at the weekend. Government members who attended were jeered by
angry Sicilians, frustrated by the murder and Italy's power vacuum.
