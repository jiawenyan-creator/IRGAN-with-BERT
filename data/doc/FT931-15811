FT  11 JAN 93 / Continental acquisitions by British companies down
THE NUMBER of British corporate acquisitions in the rest of Europe fell last
year in spite of the impending launch of the single European market, says a
survey by Translink, the cross-border mergers and acquisitions adviser.
Preliminary findings from the analysis showed that 159 deals were completed
in other European countries by British companies last year. The figure has
fallen steadily in the past four years from 284 in 1989, 247 in 1990 and 175
in 1991.
Acquisitions of British companies by buyers from elsewhere in Europe were
also down at 200 compared with 232 in 1991. In 1990 the number was 279 and
the year before 239. Companies blamed the uncertain economic outlook and
turmoil on foreign exchanges in the final quarter of last year for the fall
in corporate activity.
Among UK companies the most active acquirers were in the banking and
financial services sector, and they were also the most popular targets for
foreign companies.
Some 18 British companies in the sector made acquisitions elsewhere in
Europe, while 25 British companies were acquired by overseas buyers.
In engineering, British companies made 18 acquisitions. The electronics,
electricals and computers sector - the most popular sector for British
takeovers of foreign companies in 1991 with 39 - fell to second place last
year with only 20.
The fall in UK deals reflected an overall decline in activity in Europe to
1,431 deals, compared with 1,649 in 1991, 1,468 in 1990 and 1,266 in 1989.
US companies were the most active acquirers in Europe, completing 219 deals
compared with 168 in 1991. French companies were pushed into second place,
with 197 cross-border deals from 246 in 1991.
