FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: NRMA flotation hits roadblock -
Demutualisation plan faces a challenge
One might imagine that, in exchange for a 'free' handout of shares worth
anything from ADollars 500 (Dollars 367) to ADollars 2,000, customers would
be fairly sanguine about their insurance company's legal structure.
But NRMA, the large Australian personal lines insurer which wants to move to
shareholder-owned status via a ADollars 2.2bn-plus stock market flotation
before the end of the year, is running into surprising roadblocks as it
pursues the demutualisation path.
This week, two dissident directors who are opposed to the flotation scheme
will mount a legal challenge, arguing that NRMA's prospectus is misleading
and deceptive. Already, complaints from some NRMA members to the Trade
Practices Commission, the Australian watchdog, have forced the insurer to
publish corrective advertisements over sale details.
More fundamentally, such stirrings raise doubts about the degree of support
which the insurer will be able to secure from members when they finally vote
on the issue on October 19. If demutualisation is successful, NRMA would
become Australia's largest quoted insurance company, but it needs 75 per
cent of members voting in favour before it can proceed.
One opinion poll, published over the weekend, suggested that only 56 per
cent of a 600 member-sample was supportive, while 21 per cent was opposed.
The remaining 23 per cent was undecided.
Stung by these results, NRMA retorted that its own research indicated that
more than 80 per cent of members would support the scheme. It also noted
that the same unfavourable survey showed an 81 per cent 'yes' vote among
members who had already returned polling forms.
Nevertheless, while NRMA officials publicly profess a 'quiet confidence'
about the outcome, a heavy lobbying and publicity campaign speaks volumes
for the inherent uncertainty.
This unexpected tussle has two causes. The first derives from the company's
history, which means that it is much more than just an insurance operation.
Secondly, the rationale behind the flotation has not been particularly well
articulated, and members could justifiably claim to be confused.
NRMA was formed as a motoring club in 1920, mainly to lobby for better roads
(its acronym derives from its original name, the National Roads &amp; Motorists
Association). Within a few years, it had begun to provide emergency
breakdown services. In 1925, it added an insurance arm.
Over the next five decades, the organisation entered the life and home
contents insurance markets, but remained focused on its New South Wales
base. Geographical expansion only entered its strategy this year, when it
moved into Victoria.
Today, NRMA's business splits into two parts. On the one hand, there are the
insurance operations, which are still dominated by the motor business. Car
policies accounted for 51 per cent of NRMA's ADollars 1.1bn premium income
last year, with compulsory third-party policies accounting for 15 per cent.
This makes NRMA Australia's largest motor insurer, with more than 1.6m
policies in force.
On the other, there is the road service division, which ranges from a
24-hour helpline for car breakdowns to travel information and a hotel
booking facility. It is broadly similar to the RAC and Automobile
Association in the UK, although Australia's geography makes membership a
more essential precaution.
To access these services, a motorist must become an NRMA member and pay a
one-off joining fee of ADollars 36 plus an annual subscription of the same
amount. There are currently more than 1.8 members, about 70 per cent of whom
also hold NRMA insurance policies. These people will determine the company's
future.
The prospectus, sent out to members, is remarkably bland about the reasons
for the float: it says simply that NRMA wants to demutualise 'to enable its
financial success to be shared with its members'.
Since then, directors and NRMA officials have been more ingenuous, stating
that the flotation is vital to future growth. They point out that mutual
insurers have a limited ability to raise new capital quickly. A prudent
mutual, therefore, will tend to store funds for unexpected needs.
By floating, and having access to the stock market as a capital source, NRMA
will be able to use its funds more efficiently. There will be less need to
hoard funds, at the same time, it will be able to generate new capital if it
wants to expand. Directors acknowledge that more diversity in insured risks
would be desirable.
In addition, NRMA has noted that it has 'significant' tax credits which it
cannot utilise at present. As a listed company, it could use these in
payment of franked dividends. Finally, directors have claimed that stock
market status would encourage a more 'market-driven' focus within the group.
Worry among members centres on this last point, one particular fear being
that efforts to pursue efficiencies on the insurance side will undermine
services on the motoring side.
At present, NRMA barely breaks even on motor services. According to the
rather scant financial information contained in the prospectus, motor
services have incurred annual losses ranging between ADollars 6m and
ADollars 10m over the past four years. This has been covered by 'member
services investment income' in the ADollars 11m to ADollars 13m range.
The insurance division has been more rewarding, with underwriting losses
consistently outweighed by investment income. Pre-tax profits on this side -
before unrealised investment gains or losses - have run out at ADollars 44m,
ADollars 192m, and ADollars 125m over the past three years. Results in the
first year, moreover, were depressed by catastrophe claims. About ADollars
100m is estimated for the year to end-June 1994 with ADollars 141m forecast
for the current year.
But on this score, too, opponents of demutualisation fear that shareholders'
demand for profits will mean higher premiums. In particular, they claim that
NRMA is planning to discontinue insurance rebates for members.
The company, not surprisingly, has said that these fears are exaggerated.
According to Mr Ray Willing, chief executive, NRMA will continue to provide
'a world-leading road service and competitive insurance premiums'. The
organisation claims that alternative means of distributing excess capital to
members - through insurance rebates, say, or low membership fees - are
either inefficient or less equitable.
As for worries that a listed NRMA could be taken over, it points out that
there is a 5 per cent cap on any single shareholding until 2000, and some
protections under federal legislation thereafter.
NRMA has even gone so far as to claim that the flotation - with its
associated share handout - is 'one of the greatest acts of corporate
generosity' seen in Australia.
Somehow, with two weeks to go to the crucial vote, all members have yet to
be convinced.
