FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Black still keen to lift stake
in Fairfax
Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media entrepreneur, said yesterday he still
hoped to be allowed to increase his stake in John Fairfax, the Australian
newspaper publisher, to 35 per cent. However, he said he had no plans to
talk to members of the federal government on his current trip to Australia,
writes Nikki Tait.
Mr Black, whose UK-based Telegraph group holds 24.8 per cent of Fairfax's
shares, is limited to 25 per cent under Australian foreign ownership rules
for media assets - a level he has previously indicated is unsatisfactory.
With Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, and Mr Rupert Murdoch also
holding smaller stakes in Fairfax, there has been persistent speculation
that Mr Black will eventually sell out. However, after yesterday's annual
meeting of Fairfax shareholders, Mr Black said his stake was 'the ultimate
long-term hold'.
At the annual meeting, Sir Laurence Street, Fairfax chairman, said the group
had reached a 'profitable and strategically important phase' and was
'currently negotiating the establishment of strategic alliances and joint
ventures with local and international partners in pay-TV and other media
outlets'.
