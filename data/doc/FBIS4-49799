  [Text] The Xiamen Intermediate People's Court recently 
passed judgments of first incidence concerning the Wu Wenxin gun 
smuggling case, which has not been heard of for five years. Six 
Taiwan criminals were separately sentenced to death, life 
imprisonment, or jail terms. The case occurred in 1987. At 
that time Wu Wenxin, a resident of Penghu in Taiwan, 
collaborated with Zhang Liguo, deputy manager of a mainland 
export and import trading company, and other persons in planning 
and finding sources of firearms in Shenzhen, Beijing, Jinan, and 
Fuzhou. They successively smuggled a total of 1,900 firearms 
and 45,300 rounds of ammunitions, earning illegal profits worth 
$170,000. This case has attracted great attention from both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait. The Xiamen Municipal People's 
Procuratorate prosecuted these criminals in 1990.
