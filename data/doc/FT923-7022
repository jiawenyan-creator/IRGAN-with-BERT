FT  20 AUG 92 / World News In Brief: Legal regalia
The Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay (left) today throws the great wig debate
open to the public. Even defendants are to be asked whether they think
judges and barristers should put aside wigs and gowns. Court dress costs the
taxpayer from Pounds 15 for a pair of judge's stockings to Pounds 1,590 for
a full-bottomed wig or at least Pounds 8,000 for the gold-laced ceremonial
robes used by Lords Justices.
