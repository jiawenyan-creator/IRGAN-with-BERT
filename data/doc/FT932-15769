FT  10 APR 93 / Second fugitive arrested in Ireland
IRISH police yesterday arrested Mr Pearse McAuley, who is wanted in Britain
in connection with conspiracy to murder and other terrorist crimes. Mr
McAuley escaped from Brixton jail in south London two years ago.
His fellow fugitive, Mr Nessan Quinlivan, was detained by Irish detectives
last Sunday after a raid on a farmhouse in Co Tipperary and later faced
firearms charges in the anti-terrorist Special Criminal Court in Dublin.
Mr McAuley was detained at Dublin's Connolly station.
He was arrested by special branch officers under Ireland's Offences Against
the State Act for questioning about the possession of a firearm and other
offences.
Both men are wanted by Scotland Yard for the Brixton break-out and plots to
kill Sir Charles Tidbury, the former Whitbread brewery chairman, and to
cause explosions in Britain.
Mr Quinlivan is due back in court after Easter. So far no formal attempt has
been made for his extradition to Britain and the Irish authorities have made
clear the charges against him in Dublin will have to take precedence.
The IRA yesterday released a video showing armed terrorists. The
three-minute tape of masked men in battledress was accompanied by a warning
that Britain must choose between peace and what it described as 'the
inevitability of war'.
