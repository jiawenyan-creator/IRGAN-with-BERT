FT  25 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: UK brewers
The market must have perceived a certain industrial logic behind Greene
King's abortive bid for Morland, judging by yesterday's 8 per cent fall in
the combined value of the two companies. The fact that the bid still failed
after such an apparently auspicious start must be faintly unnerving for the
Whitbread Investment Company (WIC). Despite the outcome, WIC has divested
itself of a big enough portion of its stake in Morland to comply with the
restrictions on the brewing tie which come into force in November. But it
may now find it rather harder to scale down its 32 per cent stake - worth
around Pounds 65m - in Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed.
After the successive failure of the assaults on Devenish, Invergordon and
now Morland, it is difficult to escape the impression that companies in the
brewing and drinks sector seem immune from takeover. It may be that large
blocks of their shares are closely held by loyal institutions. In the case
of Morland, it may also be that WIC was seen as a forced seller and
therefore that the bid price was inevitably pitched too low. Whatever the
reason, a climate has been created in which WIC seems unlikely to find a
plausible predator for Marston who will take its holding off its hands.
An alternative approach will almost certainly be needed. The Marston stake
is the largest holding that remains to be tackled before the November
deadline. It does not lend itself to the technical resolution found for
Brakspear, whereby part of the holding was re-allocated between WIC and
Whitbread and part sold back to Brakspear itself. On the other hand,
conditions do not seem all that propitious for an offering in the market.
