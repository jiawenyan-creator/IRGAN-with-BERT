FT  31 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
Silver closed firmer on the London bullion market after dipping on news of a
larger than expected fall of 5 per cent in US durable goods orders for
December. After opening 6 cents higher it reached a high for the day of 426
cents a troy ounce before retreating to its recent 411 to 422 cent range.
Comex silver futures were sharply lower at midday. On the LME aluminium
prices held relatively steady during the afternoon as renewed support
developed after a morning slump to around Dollars 1,250 a tonne for
three-month metal. Traders said the day had been active, with the recent
build-up of resistance on any rises to around Dollars 1,300 slowing the
market's upward momentum and prompting widespread liquidation. Technical
traders had been looking for a downward reaction to correct an overbought
situation, but the market will need some evidence that consumers are
prepared to pay higher prices before it retests the highs. Copper closed
steady in dollar terms. The market continues to monitor the situation in
Chile, where miners have said they will stage protests against Codelco
privatisation measures. In Chicago soyabeans were falling fast at midsession
as chart-based sell orders were triggered under Dollars 5.72 a bushel for
March.
