FT  14 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Two outsiders for Bell Canada
Bell Canada is a rare breed among the regulated monopolies which have been
plunged into free-for-all competition, writes Bernard Simon.
Canada's biggest telephone company has met its rivals head on, to the point
where this once-bureaucratic behemoth is quickly gaining a reputation as an
agile, forward-looking animal.
The transformation is reflected in a recent management shake-up. Bell, which
is wholly-owned by BCE, the Montreal-based telecoms conglomerate, has
reached outside its own ranks to fill two top jobs. Ian McElroy, 44, takes
over as chief executive of a new 'competitive services' division, which will
include sales to large customers and long-distance services, which were
deregulated in 1992.
For the past year, McElroy has been president of BCE Mobile Communications,
which includes BCE's cellular telephone interests. Most of his career before
that was spent with IBM's Canadian subsidiary, where he rose to
vice-president for system operations.
John MacDonald, 41, previously chief executive of NBTel, New Brunswick's
telephone company, was named executive vice-president for business
development and chief technology officer, with responsibility for such areas
as multimedia and advanced intelligent network services.
MacDonald, whose business card includes his electronic mail and Internet
sign-ons, has helped turn NBTel into one of North America's most innovative
telephone companies.
Announcing the latest appointments, John McLennan, Bell's chief executive,
reiterated that 'anyone who wants to take our customers away from us is in
for the fight of their lives. We're not going to concede anything to
anyone.'
