FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: TDK has 18.4% decline in profits
TDK, the world's largest maker of magnetic tape, yesterday reported an 18.4
per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y11.01bn (Dollars 88m) in the first
quarter of the fiscal year which ended in June. Sales rose by 0.8 per cent
to Y133.5bn.
The results reflect the poor market conditions in the electronics industry.
TDK's sales of electronic materials and components were off by 3.4 per cent
to Y91.4bn. However, the company said it increased sales of thin film and
other magnetic heads, metal magnets and chip capacitors.
The company also increased sales of audiotape and videotape in the face of
stagnant market conditions. Floppy disks and satellite receiving antennae
sales also rose, producing an 11.3 per cent rise in TDK's recording media
division to Y42.12bn.
Overseas sales, led by the US, rose by 5.8 per cent to Y70.32bn.
Net after-tax earnings dropped by 19.2 per cent to Y5.29bn.
