FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: YJ Lovell restructures finances - Pounds
45.8m debt-for-equity swap and placing and open offer for Pounds 30m
YJ Lovell (Holdings), the builder and property developer, has announced a
capital restructuring. The agreement followed negotiations lasting more than
a year with six banks, four building societies and one US lender.
Lovell's creditors have agreed to a Pounds 45.8m debt-to-equity swap and
given the go-ahead for a placing and open offer.
The restructuring, expected to inject Pounds 60.6m into the balance sheet,
will reduce gearing from about 400 per cent to 29.5 per cent.
Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said without a radical reorganisation the group
'would have gone into orderly liquidation'.
He added that 'less than competent' managers had over-extended the company
in the 1980s. The group has endured three successive years of large pre-tax
losses since 1990.
The group also announced that in the year to September 30 the pre-tax
deficit reached Pounds 60m against a shortfall of Pounds 27m last time,
restated for FRS 3. Lovell blamed the sharp decline on Pounds 55.3m in
property and land write-offs, mostly in the US.
The figures were further depressed by interest charges of Pounds 5m (Pounds
7.71m). Increased borrowing pushed off-balance sheet gearing, the debt
incurred on joint venture business, up to 650 per cent.
Turnover totalled Pounds 221.3m (Pounds 274.8m) of which Pounds 207.8m
(Pounds 244.5m) related to continuing core activities. Losses per share came
out at 71.2p (30.4p) and the final dividend is again omitted.
Hoping to shed some light on the results, Lovell said its core businesses
reported an operating profit of Pounds 368,000 although this was down
sharply on a Pounds 16.2m gain last time.
Faced with few signs of an imminent upturn in the property market, Mr Bob
Sellier, chief executive, said the company would be reducing its US
operations and hinted at UK disposals.
He predicted it would compete more effectively once the capital
restructuring, placing and open offer had been completed.
Under the restructuring, Lovell's principal creditors have agreed to swap
Pounds 45.8m of debt for 45.8m convertible preference shares. The banks will
be able to take ordinary shares at 12 1/2 p once the issue has been fully
completed in two years' time.
Separately, Lovell is placing 316m new ordinary shares at 10p to raise
Pounds 29.7m net of expenses. The open offer has been made on a 19-for-5
basis for existing shareholders.
The company has agreed to reduce the nominal 25p value of existing shares to
1p as part of the capital reorganisation and then consolidate them into 10p
shares. It will also effect a capital reduction to eliminate the deficit on
the profit and loss account.
The banks have also agreed to further borrowing of Pounds 37.5m, made up of
a Pounds 25m four year term loan and up to Pounds 12.5m in working capital
facilities.
Once completed the restructuring, open offer and placing will give the banks
and other creditors a 49 per cent stake and new shareholders will control 40
per cent.
After unveiling the restructuring, Mr Hichens said he would 'make way for a
new chairman following the reconstruction of the company's finances'.
Mr Trevor West, finance director since 1989, is to take early retirement.
The shares closed down 1/4 p at 11 1/4p.
