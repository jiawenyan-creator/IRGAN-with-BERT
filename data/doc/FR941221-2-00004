SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) hereby announces the interest rates on advances made during the first calendar
quarter of 1995 from municipal rate electric loans. Pursuant to regulations originally published by the Rural Electrification
Administration (REA) at 7 CFR 1714.5, the interest rates on advances of funds from municipal rate loans are based on
indexes published in the ``Bond Buyer'' for the four weeks prior to the first Friday of the last month before the beginning
of the quarter. 




The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub.L. 103354,
101 Stat. 3178), signed by President Clinton on October 13, 1994, provides for the establishment of RUS as successor
to REA with respect to various programs, including the electric loan program established by the Rural Electrification
Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.). On October 20, 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture issued Secretary's Memorandum
10101, establishing RUS and abolishing RUS. Therefore, RUS is publishing this notice implementing a rule
originally published by REA. 

In accordance with 7 CFR 1714.5, the interest rates are established as shown in the following table for all interest
rate terms that begin any time during the first calendar quarter of 1995.
