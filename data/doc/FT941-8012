FT  22 FEB 94 / ITC to revive Channel 5
The Independent Television Commission yesterday came out in favour of
re-advertising the franchise for Channel 5, provided the government
guarantees that the necessary frequencies will remain available over the
next few years.
The commission rejected the only bid for the franchise when it was initially
advertised in December 1992 and has been considering whether to re-advertise
or reserve the frequencies for the development of digital television
channels.
The commission's move was welcomed by the consortium consisting of MAI, the
controlling shareholder of Meridian Broadcasting, Time Warner, the world's
largest media group, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and Thames
Television. The consortium has said it would bid if the television channel
were advertised.
The commission is seeking assurances from the government that it accepts a
Channel 5 service 'is not incompatible with a longer-term strategy for
digital terrestrial television'. It is understood that opinion within the
Department of Trade and Industry is divided on the issue.
Digital transmission would allow television signals to be compressed,
permitting the transmission of several channels in place of one. The
consortium said yesterday that it would be misconceived for the government
to block the availability of a new freely-available terrestrial channel
'whilst considering a technical system which is still some years from
introduction'.
However, Mr Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television and
chairman of the ITV engineering policy group, said the frequencies should be
used to create terrestrial digital television.
'While the ITC has a duty to consider the case for Channel 5, the government
needs to decide if the new developments in digital television should now
take priority'.
