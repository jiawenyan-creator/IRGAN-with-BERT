BRIEFLY 
Hiring Increases Planned: More than a third of West Coast hiring executives 
surveyed recently said they plan to expand their middle-management and 
professional staffs in the next six months. Half said they plan to maintain 
their current staff size. The results were part of a nationwide poll by 
Management Recruiters International, the nation's largest search firm. 
Nationwide, 39.1% of the hiring officers said they planned to expand their 
staffs, compared to 37.4% on the West Coast. David Reiss, head of Management 
Recruiters in Beverly Hills, said the region was slightly behind the national 
average because of a big increase in hiring last year.
