  [Text] Major cities in southern Philippines are bracing for 
renewed terrorist attacks in retaliation for the military 
offensive against the Abu Sayyaf extremists. 
  In General Santos City, Police Superintendent Renato Santos 
met with security agency owners yesterday to draw up plans to 
protect the city from terrorist raids. Santos said he would tap 
the vast army of private blue guards in security in securing 
private businesses in the city. Santos said intelligence 
reports confirmed that the Abu Sayyaf terrorists plan to carry 
out new bombings and kidnappings of prominent ethnic businessmen 
in General Santos City and South Cotabato. 
  He said the fierce fighting between advancing government 
troops and the extremists left six soldiers dead Tuesday, while 
15 others were wounded in the final assault to free a Catholic 
priest held hostage by the group. The priest, Father Cirilo 
Nacorda, is being held by the Abu Sayyaf for money. Soriano 
[name as heard] said the government assault has the tacit 
approval of Moro National Liberation Front chief Nur Misuari.
