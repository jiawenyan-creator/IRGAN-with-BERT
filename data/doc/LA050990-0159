WORLD; 
QUAYLE HAILS U.S. WWII SOLDIERS 
Vice President Dan Quayle hailed America's World War II soldiers today as 
heroes who laid the groundwork for European unity, but some veterans boycotted 
a ceremony because of Quayle's military record. 
In remarks to about two dozen members of the American Legion of Paris, the vice 
president praised Dwight D. Eisenhower's vision of world peace. 
"Eisenhower foresaw that the Europe that existed in his time must change to 
reflect the fundamental principles that these heroes fought for, principles 
that the United States and France have shared for some 200 years," he said. 
But one of the legionnaires present said that several people in his 750-member 
organization declined to attend the ceremony at the American Embassy because 
they believed that Quayle avoided combat duty during the Vietnam War by joining 
the Indiana National Guard. 
"That bothers some of the members," said a Vietnam veteran who asked not to be 
identified.
