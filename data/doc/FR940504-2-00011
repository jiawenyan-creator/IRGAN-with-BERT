&bull;Steel wire rod 5.5 mm or less in diameter, with tensile strength greater than or equal to 1040 MPa, and the following
chemical content, by weight: carbon greater than or equal to 0.79%, aluminum less than or equal to 0.005%, phosphorous
plus sulfur less than or equal to 0.040%, and nitrogen less than or equal to 0.006%;

Termination of Investigation


On April 20, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published its Final Determination of Sales at Less
Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon and Alloy Steel Wire Rod from Canada in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 18791). In a letter dated April 18, 1994, petitioner notified the Department of the withdrawal of its April 23,
1993, petition and requested termination of the antidumping investigation.
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.17(a), upon the petitioner's withdrawal of the petition, the Department may terminate
an investigation after notice to all parties to the proceeding and after consultation with the International Trade
Commission (ITC). Furthermore, the Department may not terminate an investigation unless it concludes that termination
is in the public interest. All parties to the proceeding have been notified of the petitioner's withdrawal and we have
consulted with the ITC. No objections were received regarding termination of the investigation. In addition, we
have concluded that termination of the investigation is in the public interest. Accordingly, we are terminating
the antidumping investigation of certain alloy and carbon steel wire rod from Canada. This action is taken pursuant
to section 734(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.
