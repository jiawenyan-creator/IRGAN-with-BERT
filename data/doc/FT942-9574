FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Don't lose out on holiday - Bethan
Hutton outlines the points to watch when buying travel insurance
Why was it, one experienced travel insurer mused the other day, that when a
claim was submitted for missing luggage, it always turned out that the
suitcase was full of Calvin Klein and Janet Reger designer underwear rather
than the plain Marks and Spencer smalls you might expect to find?
And was it not strange, he continued, that so many people had their hi-tech
cameras, gold Rolex watches and remaining travellers cheques stolen on the
last day of their holiday, did not have time to report the theft to police,
and then could not find the original receipts?
Fraud is an issue pre-occupying the insurance industry. Many companies
suspect - rightly or wrongly - that a hard core of people view submitting an
insurance claim as a normal part of returning from holiday, along with
sending off the snaps to be processed and displaying the latest souvenir on
the mantelpiece. This could be pushing up premiums for honest customers.
While it is difficult for insurers to prove that someone's expensive camera
is not in the hands of a thief, they can have their doubts - and,
increasingly, such a claim is likely to be turned down unless the claimant
can provide police certificates and original receipts. This can catch
genuine claimants unawares. So, if you do have something stolen on holiday,
make sure you get as much evidence for it on the spot as possible.
New technology is also helping to stamp out fraud. Within the next year or
so, insurers will be able to check dubious cases against a database to find
out if the same person has had a run of 'bad luck' for the past few summer
holidays.
Travel insurance does not cover you for carelessness. One of the most common
claims is for possessions stolen from beach bags while the owner was
swimming.
These days, such claims often are rejected due to 'lack of reasonable care'
 -a clause you are almost certain to find if you study the small print
carefully.
The best advice is to travel light, and dress simply, leaving all valuable
items such as jewellery and watches at home or in the hotel safe. But the
insurance ombudsman has ruled against companies applying this rule too
strictly, on the basis that you cannot be expected to go everywhere
empty-handed.
Cover for personal possessions accounts for a substantial proportion of the
cost of insurance premiums. Yet, many people may be paying twice over for
items which are covered already.
Most comprehensive household contents policies already provide a certain
amount of cover for possessions taken away from the home; usually, that can
be extended further for less than a travel insurer would charge.
This is particularly true for large, expensive items such as camcorders.
Travel insurance policies tend to have a single item limit of around Pounds
300, which rules out all but the most basic camcorder, but household
insurers normally are quite happy to cover big-ticket items.
Bradford &amp; Bingley building society has acknowledged this with its range of
travel insurance policies; these offer a 20 per cent discount if you opt out
of baggage cover because your household insurance already covers it.
Frizzell divides its policy into sections, so you are not obliged to take
the baggage and cash cover. Other insurers may soon follow.
Most travel insurance continues to be sold through travel agents, who tack
it on as an extra when you book your holiday. New rules mean that tour
operators can oblige you to take out insurance. It does not have to be
theirs, but they can insist that any alternative offers at least equivalent
cover.
Often, though, tour operators' own insurance is poor value. More than half
the premium can disappear in commission, and the maximum cover for
possessions or cancellation can be lower than independent policies.
You should, if you have time, shop around before you book the holiday. And
do not think of just the usual sources. Brokers, banks and building
societies all can sell you something - but have you thought of checking what
your private health insurer has to offer?
Gold card-holders should also check what level of cover they get for their
annual fee. Some cards, such as Barclays, have fully comprehensive annual
insurance but others provide only a few elements - travel accident,
cancellation and delay only, for example, without the crucial medical cover.
Also worth considering is annual travel insurance. Halifax is the latest on
the market, with Lloyds Bank planning to launch its version next month.
Policies can cover individuals, couples or families. For anyone who goes
abroad more than once a year, they are likely to be better value than
single-trip cover, as well as being more convenient.
They can even be cheaper for just one holiday. Take a family of two adults
and two children spending two weeks in America with Lloyds. Single-trip
cover would cost Pounds 155.60 but the new annual policy would cost Pounds
126.25 for the same family and cover it for any number of other trips as
well.
The table gives an indication of the general range of prices, but, of
course, details of cover vary, so assiduous reading of the small print is
still a good idea. If, for instance, you are going on an expensive
inter-continental trip, check that the policy covers the full cost of
cancellation - limits can be as low as Pounds 1,000 on budget policies.
