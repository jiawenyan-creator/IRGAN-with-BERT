FT  22 JAN 93 / Leading Article: BA off course
YESTERDAY'S statement from British Airways on the Virgin scandal is quite
unsatisfactory. The board has satisfied itself that none of its members
'implemented or authorised' the dirty tricks campaign. If that means none of
them knew about it, we are left with the picture of a company woefully short
of operational intelligence at board level. In an industry not noted for its
delicacy, BA should already have had an explicit code of conduct. But even
if such a code had been in place, BA could not have policed it.
Where BA goes from here is a question bristling with issues of corporate
governance. Critics of the Cadbury report have argued that to put in
non-executive directors to police the executives is to set the board at each
other's throats. In most cases, this seems an objection worth thinking
about. BA's case suggests otherwise. The implication of yesterday's
statement, after all, is that no management changes are required at any
level. Lord King can see out his twilight months and Sir Colin Marshall will
succeed him as chairman and chief executive.
This seems complacent to the point of absurdity. The board is in dire need
of outside talent, not only to run the business but to correct the
inward-looking and obsessive tendencies of the BA culture. At the very
least, shareholders should insist that Lord King's job be split on his
departure.
It remains possible, of course, that matters will take an uglier turn. BA's
actions were anti-competitive at the least. If official action should
follow, the rules of the game will change. If not, the board should take a
tough line. If Sir Colin were to insist on both jobs or nothing, he would
undoubtedly be hard to replace. But if a company lets itself fall under the
spell of a dominant individual, it has itself to blame when things
eventually go wrong.
