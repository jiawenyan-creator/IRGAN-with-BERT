  [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (XINHUA) -- A seven-member 
delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
arrived here today to begin a two-week inspection of seven 
nuclear sites in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK). 
  The inspections will be carried out in accordance with an 
agreement reached between the DPRK and the IAEA on February 15 
in order to "safeguard the continuation of the nuclear 
facilities' security." 
  This action will be the first of its kind since a three-man 
inspection team came to the DPRK to change monitoring devices at 
a nuclear site in the Yongbyon region last August. 
  The inspections are one of the measures called for in an 
agreement reached between the DPRK and the United States on 
February 25. Under this agreement, the DPRK accepted 
inspections by the IAEA and agreed to resume inter-Korean 
working level contacts. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. announced the cancellation of this 
year's 
military maneuvers with South Korea, and agreed to hold the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. meetings in Geneva on March 21.
