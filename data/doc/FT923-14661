FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Minorco and Outokumpu up Ivernia stakes
Two big mining groups, Minorco and Outokumpu, are to increase their
interests in Ivernia West, the junior Irish exploration company which owns
48 per cent of Europe's second-largest known zinc-lead deposit, at Lisheen,
County Tipperary.
Ivernia is to raise IPounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.15m), before expenses, by a
conditional placing of 11.6m shares at I39p each compared with an unchanged
closing price yesterday of I37p.
Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of
South Africa, is to subscribe for enough shares to take its present 16.9 per
cent stake to 24.5 per cent while Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish
resources group, will raise its shareholding slightly from 24.3 per cent to
24.5 per cent.
Last week the three companies revealed they had agreed to bid jointly for
the 52.5 per cent of Lisheen recently put up for auction by Chevron,
third-largest of the US oil groups.
The balance of the Ivernia shares have been conditionally placed by Riada
Corporate Finance and James Capel. Proceeds will be mainly spent at Lisheen
where Ivernia expects to contribute IPounds 3.75m during the coming year.
