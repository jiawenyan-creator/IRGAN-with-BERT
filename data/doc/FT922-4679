FT  04 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
THE WOOL market is approaching its dull between-season period and prices are
showing no pronounced trend in either direction. From a trading point of
view this persuades buyers to postpone action for as long as they can,
making it difficult for margins to be maintained. The cheaper forward seller
gets whatever business is going and the amount of hand-to-mouth buying is
limited. The Australian Wool Corporation's overall market indicator has
shown very small changes, with particular buying orders having a distorting
effect in individual categories. At 593c/kg on June 3 it was unchanged on
the week.
