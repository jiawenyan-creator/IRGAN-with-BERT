FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Rights and Issues
The split capital Rights and Issues Investment Trust saw net asset value per
capital share dip 4.4 per cent, from 545.7p to 521.9p, during the six months
to June 30.
Directors stressed, however, that the trust had outperformed its benchmark -
the FT-SE-A All-Share Index - which dropped 13 per cent during the same
period.
They added that the main unquoted investment - Phosyn - had performed well
with record pre-tax profits in 1993 and an intended revaluation of the
trust's 25 per cent stake 'may lead to a material increase in asset values'.
Net revenue for the six months to end-June edged ahead to Pounds 139,476
(Pounds 136,535). The interim dividend per income share goes up to 2.5p
(2.4p); directors expect to pay a final of not less than 6.5p.
