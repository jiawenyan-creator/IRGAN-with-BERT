FT  06 APR 94 / Food discounter steps up price war
Kwik Save, the UK's largest food discounter, intensified price competition
in the grocery market yesterday when it announced it was cutting the price
of one in 10 branded products by up to 15 per cent.
Asda and Gateway have made low prices a central part of recovery programmes
after encountering difficulties in the early 1980s. Tesco, the UK's
second-largest grocery retailer, last year launched a cut-price Tesco Value
range. In October J. Sainsbury, the market leader, cut the prices of 300
own-label products.
