  [Text] The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that "on the 
whole the U.S. President's State of the Union address leaves the 
impression of a long-term and bold document oriented to the 
future," the deputy head of the information department of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, Mikhail Demurin, told a briefing in 
Moscow today. 
  Demurin pointed to the American administration's intention 
to 
retain the United States' active involvement in international 
affairs. "We are pleased to take into account the United 
States' intention to assign key importance to partnership 
relations with Russia confirmed by the president and to support 
Boris Yeltsin's course of reforms in the future," the diplomat 
said.
