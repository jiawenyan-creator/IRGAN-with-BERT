FT  29 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: MEPC
The short term impact of the Canary Wharf administration on the likes of
MEPC may well be mildly positive. But it would be unwise to gamble too much
on tenants flocking back from Docklands - or no longer being tempted to go
there - when there is still the distinct long term possibility of a receiver
simply slashing the rents. In the meantime, yesterday's decision by MEPC
merely to maintain its interim dividend emphasises why investors in property
companies are keeping a weather-eye on yields, focusing at least part of
their attention away from the conventional, but increasingly unreliable,
asset value yardstick. With capitalised interest reducing and earlier rent
targets from new developments getting harder to meet, the prospect for
dividend growth over the next two to three years would seem to be limited. A
7.5 per cent yield on the shares at last night's 355p thus seems about
right. The good news is that thanks to investment property sales the company
is on target to maintain the absolute level of net borrowings at the year
end.
