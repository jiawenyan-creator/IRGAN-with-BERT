  [Text] Sofia, March 23 (BTA) -- In connection with the 
forthcoming discussion of UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
increase in keeping with the UN Security Council Resolution 900, 
I would like to refer to the letter of President Zhelyu Zhelev 
to the UN secretary general and to the declaration of Bulgaria's 
Foreign Ministry of March 14, reads a statement of the spokesman 
for Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry. The letter and the declaration 
express the position of the Republic of Bulgaria that both the 
need for an increase of UN forces in this region and the 
prospects for future stability should be considered, reads the 
press release sent to BTA. 
  The Republic of Bulgaria consistently supports all 
constructive initiatives aimed at a swift and lasting settlement 
of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would like to point 
out that in our opinion the non-participation of Balkan states 
in UNPROFOR is a stabilizing factor, promoting regional security 
and stability in the long run, the statement says.
