FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Barings trebles to Pounds 35.5m midway
BARINGS, the privately controlled UK merchant banking group, trebled pre-tax
profit from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 35.5m in the first half of 1993.
Last year the group took action to stem heavy losses at Baring Securities,
its trading subsidiary, cutting 108 jobs.
Mr Peter Baring, chairman, said yesterday that the subsidiary had made a
significant recovery following the reduction in both personnel and expenses.
The group's reputation for the quality of its research had been retained.
It had held its leading position in its most important markets of Japan,
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, and continued to grow in other south-east
Asian markets as well as Latin America. Half the group's employees work
outside the UK, with a quarter in the Asian region.
Investment banking had enjoyed generally favourable market conditions in the
period, and Barings had been well-placed to benefit, he said.
Baring Asset Management 'substantially increased' its contribution. Baring
Brothers had 'maintained a high level of activity' although the corporate
finance market had remained relatively quiet.
Mr Baring also said that Dillon Read, the Wall Street investment bank in
which it has a 40 per cent interest, had performed well during the six
months.
