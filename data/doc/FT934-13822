FT  20 OCT 93 / Gummer gives warning on water charges
THE government yesterday warned that further improvements in water standards
must be balanced against costs to consumers. It also said it was talking to
other European Community states about ways to reduce the cost of
implementing the latest waste-water directive.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said: 'Charges will have to rise to
finance further improvements.'
He also confirmed the UK was sounding out other EC member states on whether
changes could be made to the timetable for implementing the Urban Waste
Water Treatment directive.
Mr Gummer complained that the cost of implementation 'has greatly exceeded
initial estimates'.
UK water companies have estimated it will cost about Pounds 10bn to meet the
directive's requirement to upgrade treatment of sewage, especially the 200m
gallons of raw sewage which are pumped directly into British tidal waters
each day.
Mr Gummer's comments - in a written answer to a parliamentary question  -
coincided with publication of a government report which outlined the
political and policy framework which Ofwat, the water industry regulator,
will use in setting annual percentage increases in water bills for the 10
years to the year 2005.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said he was 'delighted that ministers
had recognised that further improvements should proceed at a rate which
customers can afford'. The water companies said Mr Gummer had 'taken the
strain off consumers'.
The government report also suggested that:
The regulator look at the extent to which water companies could raise more
funds through borrowing or equity financing rather than through consumer
charges.
Regulators ensure that any action they take to make marginal improvements to
standards does not cause companies to incur substantial costs.
That companies' capital programmes be geared to a 'reasonable certainty of
meeting requirements' rather than trying to achieve 'absolute certainty'.
