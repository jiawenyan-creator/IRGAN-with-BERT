Donald Trump's crumbling real estate empire will be examined next month at a 
hearing called by House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), 
it was revealed today. 
Gonzalez said aggressive oversight is needed now to ensure that banks do not go 
the way of the thrift industry. 
Gonzalez, who had staff investigators in New York last week, has asked bank 
regulators and Trump lenders to testify at the hearings, to begin Aug. 9. 
Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank group and a Trump lender, has been asked to 
testify, according to one source, and Chase Manhattan Corp., also involved with 
Trump, may be summoned as well. 
In addition, Trump and representatives of the Trump Organization will be asked 
to appear, a committee spokesman said.
