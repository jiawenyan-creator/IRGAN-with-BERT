SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9429), NRC published for comment a proposed overall revision of the regulations applicable
to radiographic operations, 10 CFR Part 34. In an attempt to clarify the rule language and make the regulations more
compatible with Agreement State regulations governing industrial radiography, numerous changes to the regulation
were proposed. Included with the changes is a proposed amendment that would require licensees to ensure that individuals
acting as industrial radiographers, in addition to meeting other existing training and qualification requirements,
be certified through a radiation safety program by an NRC recognized certifying entity. 



The objective of this workshop is to attempt to resolve the remaining issues regarding radiographer certification
implementation, particularly issues concerning reciprocal recognition, information sharing, inspection and
enforcement activities, oversight of certifying entities, and multiple examinations. NRC also plans to discuss
certain changes made in the overall revision of Part 34 and modifications to the proposed rule that resulted from the
public comments. 



Conduct of the Meeting: 

The workshop will be co-chaired by Mr. Paul H. Lohaus, Deputy Director, Office of State Programs and Dr. John E. Glenn,
Chief, Medical, Academic, and Commercial Use Safety Branch, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards. The
workshop will be conducted in a manner that will expedite the orderly conduct of business. A transcript of the workshop
will be available for inspection and copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW, [Lower Level],
Washington, DC 20555 on or about January 13, 1995. 

The following procedures apply to public attendance at the workshop: 

1. Questions or statements from attendees other than participants, i.e., participating representatives of each
Agreement State, ASNT, and participating NRC staff, will be entertained as time permits. 

2. Seating for the public will be on a first-come, first-served basis.
