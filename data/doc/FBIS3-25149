  [Text] Following the intertribal conflict in Ghana, about 
3,500 Ghanaians have for the past week been taking refuge in 
northern Togo as they flee current ethnic clashes in the Bimbila 
Region, situated at 370 km north of Accra, which shares a common 
border with Togo's Dankin border province. Degni Adjama brings 
you the details. 
  [Adjama] About 2,000 of these fugitives, mostly children and 
youths, arrived between 1 and 5 February, and their movement has 
increased since 6 February. According to the Ghanaian press, 
the Bimbila clashes between the Konkomba and Nanumba tribal 
communities have already claimed at least eight lives. Although 
the Ghana-Togo border has supposedly been closed since 5 
January, customs officers have not prevented the fleeing 
Ghanaians from entering Togo. Anyway, most of the fugitives 
entered Togolese territory through uncontrolled areas.
