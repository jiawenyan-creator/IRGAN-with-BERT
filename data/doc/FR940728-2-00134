RTCA, Inc.; RTCA Special Committee 185; Aeronautical Spectrum Planning Issues




Pursuant to section 10(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (P.L. 92463, 5 U.S.C., Appendix I), notice
is hereby given for the formation of a new Special Committee (185), Aeronautical Spectrum Planning Issues. The notice
and the Terms of Reference are as follows:




Subject: 

Invitation to participate in the work of Special Committee 185, Aeronautical Spectrum Planning Issues.


At its meeting held on July 13, 1994, the RTCA Technical Management Committee established SC185 to develop


Aeronautical Spectrum Planning Issues 

that would:


&bull;investigate current and anticipated frequency allocation initiatives


&bull;their potential impact on the aviation community


&bull;recommend appropriate action


Mr. Kris Hutchison of ARINC was appointed by the Technical Management Committee.


The work of this committee will likely be of particular interest to airlines, the Department of State, the Department
of Commerce, NTIA, FCC, business and general aviation, airport operators, communications equipment designers,
manufacturers, suppliers and users.


The Proposed Terms of Reference for the committee are enclosed for your reference. All interested individuals are
invited to participate in this activity and are encouraged to attend the first meeting to be held on September 12,
1994 at the RTCA Conference Room, 1140 Connecticut Avenue, NW., Suite 1020, Washington, DC.



Proposed Terms of Reference

Aeronautical Spectrum Planning Issues




On July 13, 1994, the RTCA Technical Management Committee established Special Committee 185 to review current aeronautical
frequency allocations and to develop a spectrum to accommodate the operational and technical requirements associated
with the evolving Communications, Navigation and Surveillance system. The CNS system is placing new demands on aviation
spectrum resources and is changing the way existing systems utilize those resources. Therefore, the Special Committee
shall:


&bull;Identify existing aviation spectrum resources


&bull;Determine the near-term and long-term civil aviation spectrum requirements


&bull;Prepare the related technician and operational justification supporting the aeronautical frequency allocations


&bull;Develop and propose recommended changes or additions to the International Radio Regulations as needed to
satisfy such requirements.



Guidance




The Special Committee in its work should:


1. Review current requirements and associated frequency allocations for continuing validity both near and long
term.


2. Identify requirements for new or planned systems and concepts expected to come into being during the referenced
time-frame and recommended specific areas of the spectrum resource needed to satisfy these requirements.


3. Consider the political and regulatory implications, both domestic and international; of current and foreseen
demands upon the aeronautical frequency spectrum as they may relate to forthcoming World Radio Conferences of the
International Telecommunication Union, and recommend alternative strategies to satisfy such spectrum requirements
at these conferences and in the domestic regulatory form.


4. The committee should complete its work within ten months.







Issued in Washington, D.C., on July 22, 1994.
