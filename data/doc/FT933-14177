FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure at Pounds 8m despite
Aintree debacle
AINTREE'S Grand Debacle failed to prevent Stanley Leisure Organisation, the
betting shop, casino and snooker club group, lifting pre-tax profits from
Pounds 7.82m to Pounds 8.05m in the year to May 2.
Stanley would normally net up to Pounds 300,000 from the Grand National. But
offsetting the loss of the Aintree profit, it benefited from evening racing
during the period. It would press, however, for a more 'betting
shop-friendly' racing schedule.
Stanley did not adopt FRS 3. Mr Paul Olive, financial director, said the
standard would not have altered the year's results. The previous period
covered 53 weeks.
Mr Leonard Steinberg, chairman, said 'turnover has gone up and we feel that
the company and the industry generally has come out of recession.' Turnover
improved from Pounds 203.3m to Pounds 218.4m.
The company increased the number of its betting shops to 326 (314) at the
year-end. The total currently stands at 355. The division contributed Pounds
189.6m (Pounds 174.3m) to turnover. The average stake per slip increased to
Pounds 3.45 (Pounds 3.38); however pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 5.76m
(Pounds 6.22m).
The acquisition in February of the Surrey Group of betting shops in Scotland
for Pounds 2.99m contributed 2 per cent of total turnover and Pounds 50,000
to pre-tax profits.
The casino division, which accounts for about half of group turnover, now
has 18 (17) outlets and contributed Pounds 6.73m (Pounds 5.94m) to pre-tax
profits on increased sales, thanks mainly to cost control.
The snooker division made a small profit masked by its inclusion with
central costs.
Gearing rose to 36.8 per cent (35.3 per cent) on net debt of Pounds 34.2m
(Pounds 29.5m). Net asset value per share rose to 210p, up 10 per cent on
last year, in part as a result of a Pounds 5.34m surplus on property
revaluation.
A proposed final dividend of 2.8p makes a 4.32p (4.16p adjusted) total.
Earnings per share rose to 12.78p (12.32p restated).
