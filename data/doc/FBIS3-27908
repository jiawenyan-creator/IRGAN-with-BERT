  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- The Parliaments of South 
Korea and the European Union (EU) on Thursday vowed to help 
forge close political and economic relations between Korea and 
the EU. The pledge was contained in a joint statement adopted 
by representatives of the two congresses in their meeting in 
Seoul Thursday afternoon. The statement said that the two sides 
decided to promote bilateral relations through a basic treaty on 
economic cooperation and a joint manifesto for close political 
consultations. The two parliaments decided to establish their 
consultative organization soon after general elections of the EU 
Parliament were held in June this year. 
  The statement also said the two sides would support the 
creation of an experts club to study ways to promote bilateral 
relations and would strive to ensure stepped-up cooperation 
between the EU and APEC (Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation). 
  The meeting was attended by about 20 parliamentary delegates 
from the two sides. South Korean legislators were led by Yi 
Han-tong of the Democratic Liberal Party and the head of the EU 
delegation was G. Rinsche.
