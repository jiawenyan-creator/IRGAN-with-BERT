  [Text] The Angolan authorities have accused Zaire of siding 
with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] in the Angola war. They described Zaire's involvement 
as aggression. The accusation comes in the wake of warnings 
made by the UN Security Council to Angola's warring factions. 
The Angolan Government says Zaire has been violating the UN 
Security Council's sanctions on UNITA, particularly the supply 
of military equipment and fuel. The Zairian ambassador in 
Luanda says there (?is not) enough evidence to prove that Zaire 
is assisting UNITA. The Angolan Government has invited a UN 
commission of inquiry to visit northern Angola to draw its 
conclusions.
