FT  02 AUG 93 / Observer: Hot property
When Bill Hussey, well-known boss of Ghana's Ashanti gold mine, was picked
to be operations director of the newly-formed Bakyrchik Gold, he was
surprised to learn that his new workplace might be hotter than his last.
After all, the arid North eastern steppes of Kazakhstan, where Hussey is
being sent to develop a 9m oz gold mine, is considerably closer to the
Arctic circle than Ghana. But Hussey's latest challenge also happens to be
just 250km west of the former Soviet Union's nuclear test sites. However, it
was a false alarm. According to Hussey's geiger counter, detectable
radiation levels at his new mine are less than the World Health Organisation
standards.
