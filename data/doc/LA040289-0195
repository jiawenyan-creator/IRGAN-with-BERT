GARDEN NEWS: TOTALLY TOPIARY 
"The Complete Book of Topiary" (Workman Publishing: $10.95) is just that, and 
delightful as well, and now the author, Barbara Gallup, is coming to the Los 
Angeles State and County Arboretum on May 16 for a special lecture and 
workshop, beginning at 10 a.m. The cost of the illustrated lecture and luncheon 
is $40. A workshop follows at 1:30 p.m. Each participant will make a topiary 
turtle to take home. Cost: $75, including all materials. This is a fund-raiser 
for the hard-working California Arboretum Foundation. Reservations are required 
and they can be made by writing to the foundation at 301 N. Baldwin Ave., 
Arcadia, Calif. 91006. ROBERT SMAUS
