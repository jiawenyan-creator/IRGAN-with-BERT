  [Text] Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov has signed an edict 
on currency regulation and currency control. According to this, 
the only legitimate means of payment in Crimea is the national 
currency -- the karbovanets. The currency of other states, 
including the Russian ruble, is treated as foreign currency on 
Crimean territory. Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Saburov had 
previously reported that the law on currency regulation 
envisaged setting up a currency exchange in Crimea.
