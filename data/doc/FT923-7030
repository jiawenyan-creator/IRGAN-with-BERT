FT  20 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Official measures
produce limited advance in Nikkei
THE FINANCE Ministry's emergency package to support the banking system had a
limited effect on equities, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rallied 341.33, or 2.4 per cent, to 14,650.74. However,
some traders were disappointed that the index failed to recoup Tuesday's
620-point loss. It fell to a low for the day of 14,194.40 in mid-morning,
before setting a high for the session of 14,807.01 in the afternoon on
arbitrage-related index-linked buying.
Volume increased modestly to 220m shares from 185m, while rises outscored
declines by 626 to 321, with 144 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks recovered 14.62 to 1,117.12, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 4.17 to 925.68.
The Finance Ministry's measures were greeted with cynicism by dealers and
investors, as the package failed to reveal new and concrete measures to
support the banks, or the stock market. Directives by the ministry
requesting banks to refrain from selling stock holdings to boost interim
profits, and allowing them to shore up profits by removing stock evaluation
losses from the interim profit and loss statements, were welcomed by the
banks, but criticised by analysts as a temporary solution.
Some analysts welcomed the drastic change in the ministry's attitudes
towards the banks and stock market. Mr Jason James, strategist at James
Capel, said the ministry was finally addressing the seriousness of the
problems.
However, institutional investors failed to react. 'We are encouraged by the
shift in the authorities' stance, but we would have to see the major
economic measures to be announced at the end of this month,' said a fund
manager at a leading life insurer, 'we are in no hurry to buy.'
Banks were firm, Fuji Bank advancing Y50 to Y1,340. Nippon Housing Loan, the
home-loan company, moved ahead a further Y24 to Y191. It was again the day's
leading active issue, rising on short-covering by dealers.
High-technology blue chips rose on bargain hunting and short-covering.
Hitachi improved Y11 to Y729 and Toshiba Y7 to Y554. However, Sony declined
Y20 to Y3,540 and Pioneer Electronic Y10 to Y2,660. Both stocks had led the
fall on Tuesday, and some dealers, pessimistic over the companies' earnings
results that were announced after the market closed yesterday, sold ahead of
the news.
In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 190.94 to 15,728.16 in volume of 17.3m
shares.
Roundup
THE REST of the region was almost equally split between advances and
declines.
SINGAPORE recovered from an early fall on bargain hunting and the Straits
Times Industrial index, which sank more than 3 per cent to a 19-month low of
1,269.40 in the late morning, ended a net 1.16 up at 1,312.11. Volume rose
to 74.03m shares from 59.27m.
SEOUL's index climbed 14.14 to 479.09 in anticipation of the government's
planned bail-out and on the back of a late buying spree in Daewoo shares.
Brokers said 10 of Daewoo Group's 17 listed stocks went the day's limit up
as investors discounted rumours that the group's chairman harboured
political ambitions.
Brokers said government measures were expected to include the issue of stock
stabilisation bonds (SSB), a waiver of inheritance taxes on SSBs and an
easing of tight money supply. Government officials declined to comment.
NEW ZEALAND eased in thin, volatile trading but Fletcher Challenge and
Telecom rose. The NZSE-40 capital index shed 3.05 to 1,498.17.
Fletcher Challenge ended 3 cents up at NZDollars 2.58 after reporting its
first ever loss of NZDollars 157.5m, in line with expectations. Telecom was
3 cents ahead at NZDollars 2.35, after touching NZDollars 2.38, following
strong interest overnight in the US. The company is expected to report a
steady first-quarter result today.
HONG KONG retreated on an afternoon sell-off by overseas institutions, the
Hang Seng Index falling 54.72 to 5,620.44 in turnover down from HKDollars
2.52bn to HKDollars 2.02bn. Sentiment was dented further by heavy selling of
Hang Seng Index futures, and Jardine Matheson dropped HKDollars 3 to
HKDollars 53 on rights issue rumours.
AUSTRALIA was brought gently lower by weak bank stocks. Westpac again
slipped below its ADollars 3.00 rights issue price, to ADollars 2.97 for a
loss of 4 cents, while ANZ fell 7 cents to ADollars 3.21. The All Ordinaries
Index dipped 3.4 to 1,561.6.
BHP's offer to buy 37.5 per cent of Foster's Brewing at the equivalent of
ADollars 2.39 per share came after the close, when Foster's was 10 cents off
at ADollars 1.73. The deal was on the cards, but the price may interest the
market today.
TAIWAN's weighted index fell 38.98 to another 19-month low of 3,733.93.
Sentiment, already weak, was hurt by reports quoting Tsai Wan-lin, head of
the Cathay insurance and construction group, as saying he would visit China
to explore investment opportunities; this was perceived as a further threat
to the weakening domestic property market.
