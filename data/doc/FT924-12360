FT  21 OCT 92 / Major in strongest denial yet on ERM
PRIME MINISTER John Major yesterday made his most categorical denial yet
that Britain's European partners had offered a realignment of the exchange
rate mechanism before the suspension of sterling from the system on 16
September.
Responding to a question from Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour trade and industry
spokesman, Mr Major said that no such realignment had been proposed,
'neither formal nor informal'.
Mr Bell referred to statements by senior Bundesbank and Italian central bank
officials 'that there was a general realignment available to the British
government prior to Black Wednesday'.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had failed to answer the same question
when he appeared before the Treasury and Civil Service committee last week,
Mr Bell said.
During prime minister's question time, Mr Major also put the pursuit of
'recovery with low inflation' at the heart of the government's economic
strategy.
His answers underlined the extent to which the strong opposition to
devaluation which he expressed prior to the pound's departure from the ERM
has since been revised.
Emphasising that economic circumstances had worsened in other countries in
recent months, Mr Major highlighted the government's achievement of 'low
inflation both in terms of the retail price index and underlying inflation'.
