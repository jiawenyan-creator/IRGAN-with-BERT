COMPUTER TAX PROGRAMS ARE FASTER, NEATER AND FREE OF ARITHMETIC ERRORS. BUT 
IT'S UP TO YOU TO KNOW THE IRS RULES. 
Using a personal computer to prepare your income tax returns seems like a 
natural. 
It is faster than doing taxes by hand, neater and free of arithmetic errors. 
But even with Ask Dan, the only program that gives tax advice, it isn't like 
sitting across the desk from a tax accountant. 
If you already do your taxes by hand and have a computer, you may want to try 
one of the three tax preparation programs reviewed here -- TaxView/MacInTax, 
TurboTax, or Ask Dan. 
TurboTax, $75, published by ChipSoft Inc. of San Diego, runs on IBM PCs and 
compatibles with as little as 256 kilobytes of memory and either two floppy 
drives or a hard drive. 
Ask Dan, $90, published by Legal Knowledge Systems Marketing in Drexel Hill, 
Penn., also runs on IBM PCs and compatibles with at least 512 kilobytes of 
memory and either two floppy drives or a hard drive. 
TaxView/MacInTax, $119, published by SoftView Inc. of Camarillo, runs on IBM 
and compatibles and on Macintosh computers. 
TaxView is the IBM version, requiring at least a PC/AT or compatible, with 640 
kilobytes of memory and a hard disk. You also must have a graphics monitor, 
preferably color. 
MacInTax is the Macintosh version, running on Mac 512Ke or any more powerful 
Mac model with either two floppy disk drives or a hard drive. 
TurboTax has companion state return programs for 41 states ($40 each). Ask Dan 
has state tax programs for California, New York and Massachusetts ($12 each). 
TaxView/MacInTax has state supplements for California and New York ($65 each). 
All three import financial data from other software, such as spreadsheets and 
databases. TurboTax goes a step further by importing directly from Quicken, 
Dollars &amp; Sense, Managing Your Money, and TurboTax Personal Finance 
Manager. 
All three include numerous tax forms that cover most individual and many small 
business taxpayer needs, with TaxView/MacInTax having the most complete list. 
Consult the list printed on the back of each package for details. Both TurboTax 
and TaxView/MacInTax print complete returns, including the form 1040, on most 
laser or dot matrix printers. The IRS is very fussy about the look of the form 
1040 that it will accept, and most other tax preparation programs, including 
Ask Dan, require special preprinted forms. 
TaxView/MacInTax and Ask Dan make it easy to prepare multiple returns. TurboTax 
makes it so difficult that only expert PC users should try. 
Their are big distinctions in the way the three programs work. 
TaxView/MacInTax presents a graphic facsimile of the tax forms on the screen, 
using Microsoft Windows on PCs (included with TaxView) or the built-in graphics 
ability of the Macintosh. The graphics make this program the easiest to use, 
but, a little slower than the others. 
Both versions use a mouse pointing device to move the screen cursor to the 
blank desired and execute the proper command by clicking on the mouse button. 
Highlight the desired line with the mouse and click once to enter data or click 
twice to reach a worksheet on which to itemize elements comprising that entry 
-- multiple cash contributions, for instance. Amounts are automatically totaled 
and carried forward as required. 
IRS instructions are available by moving the cursor to the appropriate text 
line on a form, clicking the button twice and reading them in the text window 
that pops up. Another click removes them from the screen. 
Calculations are automatically updated. The program keeps a list showing which 
forms are part of the return and which of those are not yet done. 
The manual is concise and easy to read. Veteran Mac or Windows program users 
will barely have to read it. Sections on the tax forms are adequate but skimpy. 
The program also includes a copy of Arthur Young's 1988 Federal Tax Highlights. 
There are a couple of glitches in these otherwise excellent programs, however. 
In both TaxView and MacInTax, it is cumbersome to reopen a tax file that you 
already have worked on. 
Also, the version of TaxView currently on dealers' shelves has some problems 
working smoothly and efficiently with Windows, especially in printing. 
A spokeswoman for SoftView said a new version of TaxView was being written and 
would be sent free to all registered users. I tested a preliminary release of 
the new version and it cured the printing problems I had with the original. Its 
laser printed 1040s were the best. 
TurboTax has been around longer than TaxView/MacInTax. By today's programming 
standards, it is needlessly awkward to use. 
A new feature this year puts a graphic image of the form on your screen similar 
to that displayed by TaxView/MacInTax. But the faster way to use TurboTax is 
with its text-based simulation of the tax forms. Color is used to good 
advantage to indicate various kinds of entries, if your computer is so 
equipped. 
TurboTax opens with a personal data entry form in which you supply names, 
social security numbers, filing status and other basic information that goes on 
the 1040 and other forms. The program transfers the entries where they are 
needed. 
Unfortunately, you can waste time on that first form if you try to fill in the 
five-year tax history section, which is not needed in completing your tax 
return although the screen doesn't tell you that. (The history feature is 
automatically updated yearly from last year's return if you use TurboTax each 
year.) 
New this year is the Auto Interview Work Sheet that enables the program to 
select forms needed based on the answers. There is a depreciation and 
amortization work sheet where answers to a series of questions are distributed 
to several inter-dependent forms. 
The program uses a pop-up main menu and related sub menus to give users access 
to its various forms and functions. 
Single line entries on forms can be expanded to itemization worksheets, as in 
multiple cash contributions. 
For added speed, TurboTax normally does not make math calculations until you 
choose a menu item instructing it to do so. That can be disconcerting because 
forms will appear incomplete, and data won't transfer from one form to another 
until you issue the calculation command. You can set it to automatically 
recalculate, but the program slows noticeably, especially if you are working in 
the graphics mode. 
TurboTax has other awkward features. For one, ChipSoft still hasn't developed a 
simple, rational way to move from one blank to another on a form. 
Deletion or modification of erroneous entries is too difficult. 
It is hard to find the on-screen IRS instructions for forms because the command 
to reach them is buried at the bottom of a sub-menu where users are apt not to 
find it. 
The manual is clear, thank goodness, because even experienced computer users 
will have to read a substantial portion before successfully working with 
TurboTax. The section on individual forms is complete and easy to understand. 
No tax manuals are included with the program. 
Ask Dan is different from other tax preparation programs because it gives tax 
guidance to users. 
There is an "Ask Dan" question-and-answer sequence available at the touch of a 
keystroke to help guide users in completing many, but not all, of the entries 
on various form. 
For instance, in the section on charitable contributions under Schedule A, Ask 
Dan warns of 16 "Tax Trap" situations where contributions are not deductible. 
Among them, gifts to social clubs, raffle ticket purchases and the value of 
time and services. 
Elsewhere, Ask Dan advises that the standard mileage method of depreciating a 
car is usually better than the alternatives. 
In another section, computer owners are reminded that if they write letters to 
friends on the computer they are not using it 100% for business, as required to 
obtain the full deduction. 
Ask Dan reviews completed returns and makes comments. It will tell you, for 
instance, that large medical expense deductions, large state and local tax 
deductions, large contributions and business use of the home, if present, are 
triggers for IRS audits. 
It also will offer advice, depending on your return, such as suggesting that 
you and your spouse consider filing separately or think about buying tax-free 
bonds to reduce taxes next year. 
Aside from the help and advice, there is nothing fancy about Ask Dan. It has no 
graphic renditions of the tax forms to display on your screen and its work 
sheets and "scratch pad" screens for toting up itemizations are very simple. 
There is one bothersome glitch in Ask Dan, however. It is cumbersome to carry 
figures forward from a scratch pad work sheet to the form on which they 
belong.Want More Info?
