He was 76 when he died Feb. 1 of an undisclosed illness at the Motion Picture

Ambro's work at the Charles Mintz studio in Hollywood caught the eye of the

Music," "Alice in Wonderland," "Peter Pan," "Lady and the Tramp," "Sleeping 
Beauty," "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" and "Gay Purr-ee." 
Born in St. Louis, Ambro moved to California in 1932 to study drawing. He left

television specials and Hanna-Barbera's production of "Charlotte's Web." 
Ambro became Hanna-Barbera's supervising animator for "Heidi's Song" before he 
left in 1982. The next year, Ambro began teaching character animation at the 
California Institute of the Arts in Valencia.
