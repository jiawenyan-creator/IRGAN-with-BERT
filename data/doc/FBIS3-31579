  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bucharest has 
issued a statement expressing satisfaction over the receptivity 
shown by the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict when they 
accepted the measures aimed at halting hostilities in the 
Sarajevo area, which is seen as a first step to finding a 
negotiable and viable arrangement for Bosnia-Herzegovina as well 
as for all Yugoslav territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
also considers that the Russian contingent within UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] can play a positive role in totally assuaging 
the tense situation in Sarajevo and welcomes the realism shown 
by the ministers of certain important NATO states in examining 
the situation in Sarajevo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
believes that all these encouraging signs can give further 
impetus to negotiations.
