FT  04 FEB 93 / The Daf Crisis: Management buy-out proposed
A MANAGEMENT buy-out of part of Leyland-Daf's UK business was proposed
yesterday by Mr Ian McKinnon, former head of Leyland Bus, Tony Jackson
writes.
Mr McKinnon was manufacturing director of Leyland Trucks from 1981 to 1985.
In January 1987 he led a Pounds 4m buy-out of Leyland Bus, which was then
losing Pounds 30m a year. In the following year the business was sold to
Volvo of Sweden at a large but undisclosed profit.
Mr McKinnon, who is now with Alcan, the aluminium group, said he would
propose to buy only the truck plant at Leyland in Lancashire, employing
2,000 of Leyland-Daf's 5,500 workforce. The van operation in Birmingham and
the Albion plant in Glasgow would be excluded.
Mr McKinnon said he would be joined in the venture by Mr George Newburn,
former manufacturing head of Leyland Bus and formerly a plant manager with
Leyland Trucks.
