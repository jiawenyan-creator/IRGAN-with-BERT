FT  19 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report
London Metal Exchange COPPER prices slumped to new six-year lows with late
weakness undermining all other metals with the exception of tin. Prices fell
through a succession of expected support levels, leaving the three months
position Dollars 47 down at Dollars 1,657.50 a tonne. Dealers explained that
last week's technical rally, which took the price above Dollars 1,700,
lacked fundamental justification. As stocks were expected to continue rising
with no production curbs on the horizon, prices would probably fall further,
they added. At the London Commodity exchange a rise in COFFEE futures was
attributed by dealers to option covering as the market became more
enthusiastic about Brazil's announcement that it was begining purchases this
week under the producers' export retention scheme. The January position
touched Dollars 1,224 a tonne before closing at Dollars 1,216, up Dollars 24
from Friday. COCOA prices firmed in early trade, the most active near March
position reaching Pounds 956 a tonne. But the rally petered out around
midday and the price closed unchanged at Pounds 944 a tonne.
