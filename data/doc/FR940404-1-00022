The Proposal 
 


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Sandpoint, Idaho, to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the enroute and
terminal area in western Idaho. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates
for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas are published in Paragraph 6006
of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14
CFR 71.1(58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently
in the order. 
 
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
