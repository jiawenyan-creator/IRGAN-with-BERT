DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMEN GET 4 YEARS IN SLAYING OF EX-FRIEND 
Two women who beat a 20-year-old San Fernando woman to death with a baseball 
bat were sentenced Monday to four years in state prison. 
Dawn Rodriguez, 21, of San Fernando and Socorro Mauricio, 21, of Pacoima 
pleaded guilty in March to voluntary manslaughter in connection with the death 
of Elizabeth Valdivia. 
Valdivia was beaten to death as she walked home from work on the night of June 
13, 1989. Rodriguez and Mauricio were arrested a short time later. 
Investigators said the three women had been friends, and that Rodriguez and 
Mauricio were upset by a breakup in the relationship. 
Valdivia's family members urged San Fernando Superior Court Judge John H. Major 
to impose a tough sentence on Rodriguez and Mauricio. "They have to pay for 
what they did," said Victor Valdivia, brother of the deceased woman.
