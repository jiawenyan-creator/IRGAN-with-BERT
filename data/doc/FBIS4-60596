  [Text] Tehran, May 24, IRNA -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said here today that the Islamic Republic regrets efforts being 
made to split up the unity of Islamic Yemen. He expressed hope 
that the officials in Yemen would try political solutions for 
safeguarding the accomplishments of the country. 
  Referring to the situation in the occupied land, he said 
Iran 
had previously warned against anti-Palestinian schemes. He 
cautioned that plots were underway to pit Palestinians against 
each other. 
  The spokesman said Islamic Iran warns against the plots 
being 
hatched by the Zionist occupiers. He said Iran yearns to see 
the Palestinians for ever united in their ranks. 
  Asked to comment on King Fahd's observation on the Persian 
Gulf islands of Iran, he said such remarks are aimed at 
strengthening the position of alien forces and weakening the 
Muslim people of the region. 
  These islands belong to the Islamic Republic and would 
continue to be so and calling them "Arab islands" would not 
change the reality in connection with those territories of the 
Islamic Republic. 
  The Iranian official commented that Fahd would obviously 
have 
done a lot better had he called on the Zionist regime to abide 
by international protocols and respect international conventions 
and refuse to engage in such acts of state terrorism as 
abduction which it did in Lebanon of a prominent leader just a 
few days ago.
