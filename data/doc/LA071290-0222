CRANK PHONE PUT OUT TO PASTURE IN RUGGED IDAHO 
The nation's last known hand-crank party line was disconnected today when 
residents of central Idaho's rugged Salmon River canyon received private-line, 
touch-tone service. 
"It's sure nice," country store owner Garry Pedrow said in answering the first 
incoming call. 
"I'm not screaming anymore." 
Public Utilities Commission President Joe Miller made the first call out from 
Pedrow's store to Gary C. Byrne, administrator of the Rural Electrification 
Administration, which financed the switch. 
The Depression-era system had grown familiar, and Pedrow and his 17 neighbors 
greeted the change with mixed emotions. 
"I hate to see the historical value of it leave, but as far as being in 
business it's hard to communicate on this line!" Pedrow yelled into the 
mouthpiece before the change Wednesday.
