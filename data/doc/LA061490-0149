COMMUNITY DIGEST: DOWNEY; 
COMPROMISE WORKED OUT TO ALLOW PESTICIDE STORAGE 
The Downey City Council on Tuesday gave final approval to a compromise 
agreement that will allow the county to store thousands of pounds of pesticides 
in a new warehouse near the southwest corner of Imperial Highway and Garfield 
Avenue. 
The County Board of Supervisors is expected to approve the agreement in coming 
weeks. 
The city would then drop its lawsuit against the county, which was filed last 
December. 
For months, Downey officials have opposed the county's plans to store 
pesticides at the facility, which is near residential neighborhoods. 
Of special concern were plans to fumigate the stored squirrel bait -- 
poison-laden grain that can become infested with insects. Small amounts of 
poisonous gas are vented into the air after such fumigations. 
Under the compromise, the county would fumigate only if the air-conditioning at 
the facility failed. Insects could breed in the grain if the temperature in the 
storage bin rises above the low-50s. 
The county plans to store nine pesticides at the facility, including 9,500 
pounds of squirrel bait.
