FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Credit Agricole sees static
profits
Credit Agricole, the network of agricultural co-operative banks which is one
of the largest forces in French banking, expects to report static net
profits of about FFr5.2bn (Dollars 881m) for 1993.
Mr Lucien Douroux, who took over as chairman last year when Mr Philippe
Jaffre left to head the Elf Aquitaine oil group, said in an interview with
Les Echos newspaper that the bank had produced a very good performance in a
difficult economic climate.
The French banks have had a tough time for the past two years, due to the
sluggish state of the credit market and the impact of the economic recession
on their corporate loans and property holdings. Some banks have plunged into
the red. Others have suffered sharp falls in profits.
Credit Agricole has remained relatively resilient against this grim
scenario. It saw net profits rise by 6 per cent to FFr5.2bn in 1993 from
FFr4.9bn in 1992. Mr Douroux said cuts in French interest rates had a
moderate impact on the bank's 1993 results, but should have a positive
effect this year.
Hermes, one of the best known names in French luxury goods, managed to
increase net profits by an estimated 21 per cent to FFr200m last year, in
spite of the difficulties in the luxury market.
The company, which is still controlled by the Hermes family, had previously
predicted more modest growth in profits to FFr180m in 1993 from FFr165.2m in
1992.
However, Hermes yesterday forecast that the final level of growth would be
higher as its export sales had been particularly good during the year. It
experienced strong growth in silks, leather goods and clothing, but saw
sales fall in perfume and tableware.
The luxury goods industry has for the past three years been badly affected
by the global economic recession. However, Hermes, which operates at the
very top of the market, has emerged unscathed.
