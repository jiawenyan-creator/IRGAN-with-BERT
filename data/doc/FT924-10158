FT  02 NOV 92 / Venture fund set up for east Midlands
A VENTURE capital fund has been launched to provide cash, usually in the
form of share capital, for small businesses in the east Midlands.
The Midland Enterprise Fund for the East Midlands is the second of a series
designed to cover the UK, region by region. The first was set up in the
Yorkshire region. The third, for East Anglia, will be announced in January
and the fourth, for the south-east, in February. The main commercial
investor is Midland Bank.
The funds are designed to provide sums of between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds
125,000. That area of the venture-capital market has generally been ignored
by the established funds because the cost of appraising a business has not
justified the provision of capital in such small doses.
Mr Kevin Caley, managing director of the east Midlands fund, said: 'This is
the first time anybody has attempted to make commercial investments at this
sort of level.'
