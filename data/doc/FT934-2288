FT  15 DEC 93 / Mercedes selects plant for city car
Mercedes-Benz said last night it would build its new A-class 'Baby Benz'
city car at its Rastatt plant in Germany rather than at other sites it had
considered in Britain, France or the Czech Republic, Reuter reports from
Bonn.
The company said that management and the works council had agreed on the
site after long and difficult negotiations.
Mercedes said it would give further information at a press conference
scheduled for this morning by its parent company, Daimler-Benz.
In the talks on the plant's site, the works council and unions favoured the
Rastatt plant, which was completed last year. According to analysts it is
under-utilised.
Mercedes, worried about plummeting sales and profits, favoured other,
lower-cost sites, company sources said.
Analysts said Mercedes had to be extremely careful with costs for the
A-Class because it would be competing in a high-volume market where profit
margins are very small.
The IG Metall engineering union had threatened reprisals if Rastatt were not
chosen.
The A-Class, due to go into production in 1997, will be built at a rate of
about 200,000 a year and 2,500 workers will be employed.
