FT  14 JUL 94 / Observer: Guillotine motion
So how was your July 13? While most of Britain's commuters were struggling
to get to work during the fifth rail strike, Observer was pleasantly
surprised to find that not only had the Hampton Court to Waterloo service
not been cancelled but the number of trains had doubled from two to four an
hour yesterday.
The morning took an even better turn when the FT receptionist rang to say
that Le Croissant Shop, had delivered a box of hot croissants for Observer
to commemorate Bastille day. If it had been delivered on the correct day,
Observer would have been on holiday.
