FT  13 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Services may have added to problems
THE decision of US and EC negotiators to embrace disputes over trade in
services and on market access in their meetings over the past two days in
Brussels may have demonstrated earnestness of intent, but clearly added to
the problems of breaking the Uruguay Round deadlock.
Little progress has been made in settling disputes on services and market
access, largely because Geneva-based negotiators have been unwilling to
budge until the US and the EC reveal their hands on farm trade. For many
developing countries, concessions from the US and the EC on farm trade are
essential before they table any offers.
A vicious circle has developed as the US has in turn refused to table its
own position without offers from the EC and developing countries.
A storm blew up when the US threatened to withdraw telecommunications,
financial services and transport, especially maritime services, from any
offer it might make on services trade.
Since these were for many countries the only services areas of interest in
the US market, the motive for continuing serious talks evaporated.
For the EC, a critical US concession on services would be willingness to
re-table telecommunications, financial services and maritime services. It is
understood that fresh openings on financial services have been discussed,
but headway on maritime services has been seen as unlikely.
Telecommunications concessions are unlikely until the EC can agree terms for
liberalising its internal market. On market access, the EC is urging the US
to attack its peak tariffs.
The US wants the EC to agree to scrap some that are already low, but
progress is hampered by awareness that mutual concessions need to be matched
by other countries.
