FT  06 OCT 92 / Lecturers win rights claim
THE government conceded in the High Court yesterday that 60,000 lecturers in
further education colleges are covered by a European directive intended to
safeguard workers' employment conditions after takeovers. Mr John Patten,
education secretary, was ordered to pay costs estimated at Pounds 25,000
incurred by the Natfhe lecturers' union.
By meeting the lecturers' claim before legal argument began in a case
brought by Natfhe, the government limited its concession to them and
forestalled the possibility of a general judgment by the court that would
have favoured many more workers.
The lecturers will retain their current collectively negotiated pay and
conditions of employment, which had been threatened because the colleges are
due next year to be removed from council control and become independent
corporations.
Mr Patten accepted a court declaration that EC rules would cover college
lecturers after the change of status.
Natfhe said UK law breached EC rules on employment protection because it did
not require employers to honour the employment contracts they inherited when
acquiring non-profit-making organisations. Contracts must be honoured when
one organisation takes over another in the private sector, and Natfhe argued
that the rules should protect all workers.
The move does not mean that the government has conceded that UK law was in
breach of the directive.
Natfhe called the court's declaration 'a historic victory'. The Polytechnics
and Colleges Employers' Forum said: 'This will push up the unit costs of
most colleges and is likely to increase the prospects of redundancy for
further education lecturers.'
