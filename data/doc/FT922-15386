FT  01 APR 92 / Observer: Screen betting
Let's hope that financial futures boffin Compton Hellyer has more luck with
his latest sporting venture than he had with his horse - Docklands Express -
in the last Grand National. It fell at the first fence.
Hellyer, who is even madder about sport than about his beloved financial
futures, has come up with a spiffing wheeze to keep city dealers glued to
their Reuters' screens. He is backing a couple of young thrusters - Angus
Hamilton, 25, and Richard Thomas, 27  - who have set up Sporting Index.
Specialising in spread betting, which differs from fixed-odds betting in
that it enables a punter to bet either way on a result or score, the new
bookies will offer regular spread prices on all major sports. Prices will be
carried on a page (Spio) on the Reuters screen.
However, young Hamilton is balking at giving a price on Hellyer's Docklands
Express in Saturday's Grand National. Whoever heard of a bookie worried
about conflicts of interest?
