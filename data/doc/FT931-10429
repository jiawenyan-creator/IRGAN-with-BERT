FT  09 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Mexican bank to launch
warrants linked to notes
NAFINSA, the Mexican government-owned development bank, is preparing to
launch an unusual Eurobond issue with warrants into Grupo Televisa, the
Mexican media giant.
The Dollars 100m issue of five-year bonds, arranged by Bankers Trust, is
accompanied by an issue of three-year warrants, which can be exercised into
Televisa American depository shares in the third year.
The deal offers investors the first long-dated warrants on an individual
stock in the Mexican market.
The issue is expected to carry a six per cent coupon, and has been largely
pre-placed with emerging market funds and traditional warrant buyers. The
deal is expected to be launched officially today.
The warrants, which can be traded separately, are likely to be priced at a
premium of 20 per cent to the current stock price.
The commercial paper and medium-term note ratings of Kingfisher, the UK
retailer, have been put under review for a possible downgrade by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US rating agency, as a result of the company's planned links
with Darty, the French group. S&amp;P said it will be meeting Kingfisher's
management soon.
