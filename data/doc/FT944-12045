FT  03 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): WPP's training mix
Martin Sorrell, chief executive of marketing services group WPP, hopes to
capture the interest of up to five 'ambidextrous brains' at Cambridge
University today. WPP is offering a three-year graduate trainee programme
spanning the advertising, public relations, design and research interests of
the group. The trainee places - rather grandly dubbed 'marketing
fellowships' - are among the first of their kind in the sector.
Sorrell's presentation to final-year students will outline the demands of
the constituent business as including 'flair and slog; intuition and logic;
left brain and right brain'.
The programme, which is likely to extend to recruitment from other UK
universities next year, and the US and East Asis in subsequent years, is
part of WPP's efforts to strengthen cross-disciplinary understanding.
Clients are looking, says Sorrell, for solutions that may not be primarily
based in media advertising.
Recruits will move around WPP sponsoring companies - including J. Walter
Thompson, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Hill and Knowlton, Millward Brown, Sampson
Tyrrell, and the Henley Centre - before taking up a permanent post.
WPP's move coincides with another to develop practitioners capable of
implementing the much vaunted 'integrated marketing' approach.
The Integrated Marketing Communications Initiative, launched last week,
embraces such bodies as the Public Relations Consultants Association, the
Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, the Direct Marketing Association
and the Sales Promotion Consultants Association.
Members of the trade bodies are being asked to sign up to a charter,
pledging support for cross-disciplinary training and work placements. An
advertising agency, for example, might offer a work placement to someone
from a PR company, and vice versa.
