FT  28 JAN 94 / Observer: Stitched up
First it was the in-flight casino; now it's the on-board tailor. From next
month passengers on Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic airline to Hong Kong
will be able to order the mile-high suit.
The customer will be measured on board. The details will be faxed from the
aircraft to a Hong Kong factory, which will make up the suit during the
visit.
Business travellers spend only three days on average in Hong Kong. What they
wanted most of all was to buy a suit; but they never have the time. But what
if the flight's delayed? Time enough for two suits presumably.
