EARNINGS 
Amoco Corp.'s 1988 earnings jumped 52% to $2.063 billion. Revenue climbed to 
$23.9 billion, up 6%. Fourth-quarter profit eased to $375 million from $377 
million, while revenue advanced to $6.2 billion from $5.9 billion. The 
Chicago-based oil, chemicals and plastics company said strong fourth-quarter 
gains in chemicals and refining operations were offset by lower earnings from 
explorations and productions, due to lower worldwide energy prices.
