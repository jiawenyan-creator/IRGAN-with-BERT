  [Text] Moscow April 27 Tass -- Foreign investments in 
Russia will not be liable to a 23 per cent tax, Russian Acting 
Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told Business-Tass on Wednesday. 
  "Foreign investments in the form of finances allocated to 
joint ventures created on the Russian territory or in the form 
of payment by foreign legal entities and private individuals for 
acquired securities of Russian enterprises, as well as loans and 
credits granted by foreign banks and credit institutions should 
not be liable to the value added (20 per cent) tax and the 
special (3 per cent) tax", Dubinin said in an official statement. 
  "Not subject to taxation are finances granted on a free 
basis 
by foreign states to Russian enterprises and organisations in 
the form of subsidies for implementing goal-oriented 
programmes", he added. 
  According to acting legislation, the turnover taxable by VAT 
and the special tax includes finances received from other 
enterprises and organisations, Dubinin said adding that excluded 
from them are contributions by founders to the authorized 
capital and sums used for joint activities. Free from VAT and 
the special tax are transactions on issuing and transferring 
loans, as well as operations connected with the circulation of 
securities (shares, bonds, certificates, bills of exchange, 
etc), according to the minister.
