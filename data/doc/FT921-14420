FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Crown Comms in the red
CROWN Communications, the radio broadcasting company which owns London's LBC
station, plunged into the red last year as losses mounted at its French RFM
subsidiary. There is no dividend.
The total deficit for the 12 months to end-September came to Pounds 6.79m,
compared to taxable profits of Pounds 611,000 last time. Turnover rose from
Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 23.8m.
Mr Brian MacLaurin, corporate affairs director, said RFM incurred losses of
almost Pounds 3m.
Losses were also incurred at IRS, Crown's advertising arm.
Gearing, which stood at 200 per cent before the Pounds 4.5m rights issue in
October, was down to 100 per cent. This would be further reduced by the sale
of non-core assets.
During the year, Crown sold its stakes in Southern Radio for Pounds 3.8m and
Radio Forth for Pounds 1.3m. However, interest charges rose by Pounds 1m to
Pounds 2.8m, due to delays on those sales.
Losses per share deepened from 1.3p to 22.9p.
