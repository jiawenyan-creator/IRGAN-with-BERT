  [Text] Amman, AL-RA'Y -- U.S. Navy vessels in the Straits 
of Tiran have continued to stop commercial vessels bound for 
al-'Aqabah. An official source at the Tawfiq Gharghur &amp; Sons 
Shipping Company told AL-RA'Y on 1 March the Maltese ship 
"Angelic" was intercepted at the Straits of Tiran by the U.S. 
Navy. The ship was coming from Eastern European ports with 2062 
tonnes of goods and dozens of containers on board. The U.S. 
Navy inspected the ship on the pretext that they could not have 
access to some packages addressed to Jakarta Port in cabin No. 
3, which contained no goods for Jordan at all. 
  This took place despite the fact that the captain and crew 
of 
the ship cooperated fully with the inspection team and proposed 
sealing the ship's cabins that contained no cargo for Jordan. 
The purpose was to allow the ship to unload the al-'Aqabah 
goods and then go back to the inspection site while the other 
cabins were still closed. The inspection officer, however, 
refused and prevented the ship from proceeding toward 
al-'Aqabah. The ship was forced to head for Suez Port to unload 
its cargo for Jordanian merchants.
