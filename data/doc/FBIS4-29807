  [Text] Relations between the Indonesian Defense and 
Security Department and the U.S. Defense Department continue to 
be excellent even though the education and training program for 
Indonesian military officers conducted by the U.S. Defense 
Department has been stopped. Navy Commodore Yuswaji, chief of 
the Defense and Security Department's Public Relations and 
Foreign Relations Bureau, said this to reporters in Jakarta 
yesterday. 
  Yuswaji said in fact only a small number of U.S. Congressmen 
had wanted to stop the training program. He added that it does 
not mean the Defense and Security Department and the Indonesian 
Armed Forces headquarters will automatically send their officers 
to Australia, which has close ties in military training programs 
with Indonesia, though there are several education and training 
academies there.
