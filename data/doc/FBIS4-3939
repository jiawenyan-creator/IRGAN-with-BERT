  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA)--The Beijing Friendship 
Corporate Club, the first of its kind in China, has been set up 
here to promote economic exchanges between Chinese and overseas 
companies. 
  An official of the club said that it would provide 
information and services to members to help them find 
cooperation opportunities throughout the world. 
  Members of the club will also share experience and 
information in enterprise management and operation, he said. 
  The club currently has 51 members--34 Chinese enterprises, 
11 
foreign-funded businesses and six foreign firms. 
  These members are engaged in such sectors as manufacturing, 
commerce, urban construction, trade, science and technology and 
tourism, the official said. 
  He said that all Beijing-based state-owned enterprises, 
collectively-owned businesses, foreign-funded firms and offices 
of foreign companies can apply to join the club, provided they 
abide by the articles of association of the club. 
  Economists here said that the establishment of this club is 
a 
need posed by the creation of a market economy in China, because 
companies need to share experience and information. 
  They expressed the belief that such clubs will help expand 
cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies, help Chinese 
firms enter the global market and facilitate the establishment 
of a modern enterprise system in China.
