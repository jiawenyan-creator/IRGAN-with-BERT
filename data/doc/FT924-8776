FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Honeywell to consolidate
operations
HONEYWELL, the US controls group, announced plans to consolidate its
aerospace operations, and reposition its home and building controls and
industrial units.
In connection with these moves the company will take a fourth-quarter
pre-tax charge of about Dollars 100m, or 90 cents per share after tax. The
charges will partially offset gains of Dollars 273m from settlements of
patent infringement suits filed by Honeywell against several camera
manufacturers.
Honeywell said that its Space and Aviation unit will be 'appropriately sized
for changing market conditions', characterised by declining deliveries of
new aircraft and continuing reductions in defence spending.
Honeywell is to increase its annual dividend by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.78,
accelerate a Dollars 600m share repurchase programme and split its stock
two-for-one.
