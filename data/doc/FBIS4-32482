<F P=106> [Interview with Georgi Pirinski, National Assembly deputy </F>
for the Bulgarian Socialist Party, by Kameliya Evgenieva; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Evgenieva] Mr. Pirinski, this is the second time 
that you have resigned as deputy chairman of the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] parliamentary group. The first time, the 
reason was your objection to the choice of Petur Boyadzhiev as 
prime ministerial candidate. What is the reason this time? 
  [Pirinski] My different understanding of the line that the 
BSP should follow in the period following the congress. 
  [Evgenieva] Was the congress not to your liking? 
  [Pirinski] Quite the contrary. It gave a true direction for 
the party's work. The problem is that after the congress a 
different line was put forward, which gave priority to social 
demands and problems. This to some extent disengages the BSP in 
relation to the progress of the reforms. 
  [Evgenieva] Why did you refuse to join the BSP Executive 
Bureau? 
  [Pirinski] I cannot be effective in a bureau with such a 
membership. 
  [Evgenieva] Can you be more specific? 
  [Pirinski] Because of the views of the colleagues who 
accepted leading positions in the ruling bodies. 
  [Evgenieva] Such as? 
  [Pirinski] It is not a matter of any particular person, but 
of the positions adopted on the main issue that was under 
discussion in the BSP Supreme Council last year and at the 
beginning of this. It refers to whether we should commit 
ourselves to the reforms or adopt a more neutral position 
regarding the main problem of the market economy, placing more 
stress on social demands. 
  Any attempt to look for a personal angle or personal 
conflicts ignores the essence of the problem. Therefore, I 
decline to answer your question. 
  [Evgenieva] I gather that you want to keep names to 
yourself. 
  [Pirinski] This is not true. 
  [Evgenieva] Before the congress your name was often 
mentioned as the next BSP chairman. Did anyone promise you his 
support? 
  [Pirinski] All kinds of lies, speculative assumptions, and 
insinuations have been made. No one offered me any support. 
For me, this matter simply did not arise, because in recent 
months none other than the party chairman [Zhan Videnov] has 
adopted the line that was and is the right one for the BSP. 
  The trouble is, however, that at the congress much was said 
in support of commitment to the reforms, but the actions that 
followed the congress somehow do not provide convincing evidence 
of this.... 
  [Evgenieva] How do you explain this? 
  [Pirinski] Some members of the BSP leadership may not be 
well enough convinced that the social democratic line is the 
right one. Perhaps they were afraid of how the congress would 
react to this policy, and after the congress they may have 
decided that there is no need to move ahead so fast in this 
direction. 
  [Evgenieva] Who is to blame for this? 
  [Pirinski] I have no explanation. 
  [Evgenieva] You normally supported Zhan Videnov, but 
recently, in the debate on whether to support Lyuben Berov, you 
came out against him. 
  [Pirinski] The political realities on 26 May made it 
necessary to support the cabinet. Prime Minister Berov was 
elected on a program that stated that he would lead the country 
into the elections. This was the alternative that we also 
chose. The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] is attempting to 
mount an intensive campaign on how the Communists betrayed Berov 
and cast the country into chaos on the eve of their congress. I 
think it would have been political blindness to fall into such a 
trap. Accordingly, there is no reason to think that my 
disagreement with Zhan Videnov's opinion was an act against him. 
  [Evgenieva] Why did you decline President Zhelev's 
invitation to participate in the consultations on privatization? 
  [Pirinski] Zhelev should have invited Professor Stoilov, 
because he actively participated in drafting the Law on 
Amendments and Additions to the Privatization Act. My refusal 
will give me more opportunity to defend my own views in public. 
  [Evgenieva] How? 
  [Pirinski] The OSD [Alliance for Social Democracy] will hold 
its own conference and will try to show the party and society at 
large what it thinks is the right policy at the present juncture. 
  [Evgenieva] Excuse me, but you seem to be fighting for your 
policies in a very strange way. You refuse to join the leading 
BSP bodies, and so give up the chance of directly influencing 
them, but in the meantime you continue to maintain that you will 
influence the BSP. 
  [Pirinski] The other day I met a group of serious BSP 
members who do not support the OSD. They consider that the 
OSD's viewpoint deserves serious attention. People have 
expressed disappointment because the OSD is setting up its own 
clubs instead of joining the party organizations. Therefore, 
you should not think that because we hold no positions in the 
leading bodies means that we have no influence on party thinking. 
  [Evgenieva] What do you think about the influence wielded by 
Lilov, Lukanov, and Zhan Videnov? Who do you think came out on 
top at the congress? 
  [Pirinski] At the congress Zhan Videnov definitely defended 
his position as leader and convincingly demonstrated that he has 
authority and support. However, in the 10-day period following 
the congress, it seems to me that the views of Lilov and those 
who share his views became firmly established in the Executive 
Bureau and the commission responsible for finally drafting the 
program. 
  [Evgenieva] Do you think that the postponement of the BSP 
program until September is a setback for Aleksandur Lilov? 
  [Pirinski] You should ask him this. I think that it was a 
well founded decision by the BSP. How various people regard it 
is their problem. 
  [Evgenieva] What is your comment on Andrey Lukanov's removal 
from the BSP Supreme Council? 
  [Pirinski] This is a loss only for the Supreme Council.
