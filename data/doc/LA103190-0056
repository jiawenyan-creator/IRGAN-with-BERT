ANITA M. GREEN; REFORM CONGREGATION PRESIDENT 
Anita M. Green, president of Shir Chadash -- The New Reform Congregation in 
Encino, who campaigned for a synagogue in Woodland Hills, has died in a North 
Hollywood hospital. She was 42. 
Ms. Green of Encino died Saturday from a gunshot wound suffered Thursday 
morning. Police said a motorcyclist shot her once as she drove her Corvette 
into a parking lot behind a North Hollywood tax consulting business owned by 
her husband, Melvin Green. Police have made no arrests in the case. 
The daughter of Holocaust survivors, she was born Jan. 30, 1948, in New York 
City. Ms. Green was a founding member of the 8-year-old congregation and had 
served as its lay president since 1987, Rabbi Steven Jacobs said. Two weeks 
ago, Ms. Green and her mother participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for the 
Woodland Hills temple. 
Ms. Green was active with the Jewish Reform movement in Israel and was involved 
with Central American refugee support programs, Jacobs said. 
She is survived by her husband; a son, Scott Arnow of North Hollywood; her 
mother, Riva Rice of Sherman Oaks; and a sister, Linda Borson of Philadelphia. 
A funeral was held Tuesday with burial at Eden Memorial Park in Mission Hills. 
Groman-Eden Mortuary handled the arrangements. 
Donations can be made to the Anita M. Green Memorial Chapel in care of Temple 
Shir Chadash, 17000 Ventura Blvd., Suite 302, Encino 91316.
