  [Text] On 16 May Song Yong-tae, vice minister of the 
National Unification Board, said: "The goal of resolving the 
nuclear issue is to completely scrap North Korea's nuclear 
weapons -- if it is proven it possess them." 
  At the third 1994 Advisory Conference for National 
Unification held that day at the Secretariat for the South-North 
talks in Samchong-dong, Seoul, he presented a report entitled: 
"The Status of Recent Developments in South-North Relations and 
the Direction of Countermeasures." He said: "The ultimate goal 
of resolving the nuclear issue is not only to check North 
Korea's nuclear development, but also to seek a complete 
scrapping of nuclear weapons in case North Korea should possess 
them." 
  Such a report by Vice Minister Song is noteworthy in that it 
was disclosed at a time when some circles are stressing the need 
to tolerate [mukin] North Korea in case it has developed a small 
amount of nuclear weapons.
