SMOKE DETECTORS 
As a fellow pariah, I enjoyed the letter from R. W. de Vries about smoking in 
Europe (June 11), especially in France. There is an even better place for 
smokers. In Turkey it seems one is always offered a cigarette, together with 
the inevitable glass of tea, as one of the many gestures of friendship and 
hospitality. 
And on domestic flights in Turkey, there is no such thing as a no-smoking 
section. Hooray -- this will keep most Americans out of Turkey and it is one of 
the few places left abroad where one can have a wonderful holiday for very 
little money and without running into a lot of other visitors. 
Turkey, a loyal ally of this country, perpetually gets a bum rap from the media 
here, but its greatest asset as a tourist destination, especially for a woman 
who travels alone as I do, is that it is perfectly safe.
