  [Excerpt] Unal Erkan, state of emergency region governor, 
has announced that 607 terrorists were neutralized in operations 
conducted by security forces during the month of May. Speaking 
to citizens in Bingol, Erkan remarked that the terrorist 
organization is on the verge of collapse as a result of 
successful work and that the terrorists are left with the 
options of dying or surrendering. 
  [Begin Erkan recording] Also last month, 500 terrorists were 
killed. Can an organization survive if it loses 500-600 
terrorists in one month? This is not possible in the face of 
our state and our nation. We will conclude this matter. There 
are also other schemes involved. We will be careful. [end 
recording] 
  Stressing that the organization is also serving the 
interests 
of foreign forces, Erkan noted that the pictures taken of the 
terrorist organization's leader with Armenian priests appeared 
in some press organs. [passage omitted]
