FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Mexico proposes sweeping changes
to its markets
THE Mexican government is set to introduce legislation that will bring
regulation of its stock and capital markets into line with those of the US,
enabling Mexican brokerages and banks to compete more effectively with
foreign rivals.
Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, announced the planned changes at a
Mexican stock market convention yesterday. The legislation will be ready in
10 days. By promoting clear international norms, it is intended to encourage
more foreign investment in Mexican stocks in Mexico.
'We have to be competitive internationally and make sure the business in New
York comes back to Mexico,' Mr Aspe added in an interview. Most important
Mexican stocks - such as Televisa, Vitro, Telmex, ICA and Cemex - are traded
on the New York Stock Exchange or over-the-counter in the form of American
Depositary Receipts in New York.
Mr Aspe said the government would introduce new laws on insider trading and
permit only companies that have a certain proportion of their capital in
public hands to be quoted on the stock market. It would also encourage more
self-regulation in the market, enabling banks and brokerages to respond more
quickly to market demands.
There would be tighter stipulations on the information that had to be
reported, and market-makers would be introduced to improve liquidity in the
stock market.
But, said Mr Aspe, existing limitations on voting shares in some stocks open
to foreign ownership would not be changed; nor would the percentage of
non-voting ('L' or 'C') shares of the total capital be altered.
