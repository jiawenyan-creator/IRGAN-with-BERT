FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Computer Management expands to near Pounds
10m
COMPUTER Management Group, the privately-owned computing services company,
saw pre-tax profits improve by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 9.52m in 1992 as a
result of careful housekeeping, higher interest income and strong foreign
earnings.
The company now derives 60 per cent of its sales from overseas, chiefly the
Netherlands, where according to Mr Ronald White, chairman, the market
continues to grow strongly.
Revenue was Pounds 116.2m, a 12.8 per cent improvement over last time's
Pounds 103m. Operating profit was Pounds 9.01m (Pounds 9.07m).
Earnings per share increased to 41.3p (39.8p).
The group intends to seek a market listing.
