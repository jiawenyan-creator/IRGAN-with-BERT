FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Voest Alpine buys Manilla coal
stake
VOEST ALPINE of Austria is to take a 40 per cent stake in the state-owned
Semirara Coal of Manilla (SCC) under a debt restructuring agreement, AP-DJ
reports from Manila.
According to the SCC president, Mr Manuel Domingo, the deal covered debts of
Sch1.89bn (Dollars 163.4m) owed by SCC, of which Sch210m was converted into
equity in SCC.
Voest Alpine's equity participation diluted the National Development
Company's share in SCC to 56 per cent from 89 per cent and the Development
Bank of the Philippines' stake to 4 per cent from 11 per cent.
Mr Domingo said the restructuring also paves the way for the increase of
SCC's capitalisation from 475m pesos to 1.2bn pesos (Dollars 47.6m).
SCC is expected to earn a net income of 50m pesos to 100m pesos this year.
