LIZ SMITH: CELEBRITY HONCHOS DUDED UP FOR CHARITY 'HOEDOWN' 
MARY TYLER Moore won my vote for the best costume at the Literacy Volunteers of 
New York City "Hoedown" Monday night in Manhattan's Armenian Church rec hall. 
She was in suede fringe showing plenty of that fine MTM leg. 
Two other midnight cowgirls were Claudette Colbert and Gayfryd Steinberg, both 
head-to-toe in black and wearing what each told me was "a real cowboy hat." 
Tita (Mrs. Sammy) Cahn had on an authentic Indian headdress, but was too 
chicken to wear it until the New York City Swing Band had revved the crowd up 
to total madness. She ended the night with feathers flying. 
You should have seen Peter Jennings and Kati Marton in their authentic Wild 
West togs. However, the sedate Mike Wallace came as a civilian, and Walter 
Cronkite, my Texas pal, was more informal than Western. Pauline Trigere wore 
her bandanna like a mask and had on mismatched cowboy boots. "I made a fashion 
mistake," the fashion giant said. Brooke Astor was in a dirndl that seemed to 
come from west of the Alps. She looked divine, saying, "It still fits me after 
35 years!" Barbara Walters and Beverly Sills had a table right out of "Girl of 
the Golden West." 
Would you believe Nancy and Henry Kissinger dressed up wild and woolly? They 
were wonderful. And it is always fun to watch dudes trying to eat the Joe T. 
Garcia of Ft. Worth special tamale without removing the shuck. 
Thanks to Steve Ross and Time Warner and many other generous souls, Literacy 
racked up almost $500,000 with this one, which may become an annual event. 
I'M SO happy to report Betty Furness is doing well at Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Hospital in New York. Doctors say her surgery was entirely successful and 
there's no sign that her abdominal malignancy had spread.
