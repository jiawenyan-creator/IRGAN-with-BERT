FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BSS feels the chill of recession
THE BSS Group's new position as the UK's second largest distributor to the
domestic heating market provided it with little insulation from the
recession in the half year to September.
Pre-tax profits tumbled 21 per cent to Pounds 4.08m (Pounds 5.16m). That was
in spite of a 7 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 112.5m (Pounds
104.8m) and a sharply reduced interest bill, down at Pounds 776,000 compared
with Pounds 1.07m.
Mr Alan Milne, finance director, said that Cadel - a rival loss-making
domestic heating supplier whose key assets BSS bought from the receiver for
Pounds 19.1m in June - contributed Pounds 14m in revenue in the quarter it
was under BSS management, but only Pounds 286,000 in operating profit.
Overall operating profit fell to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 6.23m).
Mr Milne said Cadel's integration with BSS's domestic heating and plumbing
division would be completed by March. The division would contribute at least
half of group turnover by next year. He said demand was weak in all the
sectors BSS served.
The purchase of Cadel had limited the impact of a 4 to 5 per cent fall in
domestic demand, and increased market share helped offset an 11 per cent
drop in industrial and commercial demand.
Mr Milne said: 'We are hoping for growth in 1993-94, but it is too early to
see any sign of an upturn yet.'
A 5.75p interim dividend is maintained. Earnings per share fell from 16.4p
to 11.44p.
