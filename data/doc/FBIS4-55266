international law and consular affairs of the Slovak Foreign 
Affairs Ministry, has handed a note to the Embassy of the 
Republic of Hungary in Bratislava. The note is a reaffirmation 
of Slovakia's readiness to continue in talks on the temporary 
water economy regime on the Danube in connection with the 
Gabcikovo hydroelectric project. The note reasserts that the 
Slovak side regards such talks as desirable and already proposes 
the second date this year for holding a meeting that should take 
place in Bratislava between 18 and 19 May.
