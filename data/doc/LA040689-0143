Sports agent Norby Walters was a victim of "poisonous innuendo" and broke no 
laws, a defense attorney said in his summation. But a federal prosecutor argued 
in Chicago that Walters and associate Lloyd Bloom had perpetrated fraud. 
Jurors were to begin deliberating the fate of Walters and Bloom today after 
receiving instructions from U.S. District Judge George Marovich. 
"This has been about fraud from day one and it will be about fraud when you go 
back to that jury room," U.S Attorney Anton Valukas told jurors in his closing 
arguments. 
Walters, 58, and Bloom, 29, were charged with mail fraud, conspiracy to commit 
fraud and racketeering, accused of luring dozens of college athletes with cash 
and other gifts to sign contracts with them in violation of National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. rules, then using threats to keep the athletes in line. 
"Mr. Walters may have violated NCAA rules but he never violated for an instant 
any law," said Walters' attorney, Robert Gold.
