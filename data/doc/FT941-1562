FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: MasterCard makes up ground on
Visa
MasterCard International made further inroads last year into the dominant
market position of its bigger rival, Visa International, as the transaction
volume handled by the payment system rose 28.1 per cent.
The increase to Dollars 320.6bn was driven partly by its earlier entry into
co-branded credit cards. Last week Visa reported a 16.9 per cent gain in
volume last year, to Dollars 542.2bn.
The marked difference in the two organisations' growth rates means that,
while Visa remains the leading international payment system, MasterCard's
volume has risen to 59 per cent of its rival's, compared with 54 per cent in
1992.
Speaking at MasterCard's annual meeting in New York, outgoing chairman Mr
Pete Hart said the growth had come from a focus on providing better value to
cardholders.
The battle for market share among credit-card companies in the 1990s has
turned largely on the benefits for using cards, such as free air tickets.
In the US, which accounted for some 43 per cent of each group's volume last
year, MasterCard volume rose to Dollars 139.1bn, a gain of 23.4 per cent,
while Visa increased to Dollars 229.9bn, a rise of 18.2 per cent.
Mr Peter Dimsey, head of the US region, said MasterCard's operations there
had been 'revitalised' by its involvement in co-branding and developing
point-of-sale debit cards.
