  [Text] A serviceman dies in the Russian Army every hour, 
Anatoliy Alexeyev, chairman of the International Committee of 
Defending the Rights of Servicemen and Their Families told 
Interfax. He said that 25 to 30 soldiers and officers died daily. 
  According to the Defense Ministry, over 2500 people died in 
the Russian Army but the committee believed that the real figure 
was at least twice that. 
  A 19,000 rubles, about 9.5 dollars, pension is paid for a 
soldier who died in the line of duty but only to parents who are 
older than 50. No pension is paid to the family of an officer. 
  Alexeyev said that the military prosecution office had not 
opened a single case against commanding officers of the units 
where soldiers were killed. No investigation of a death of 
servicemen in the times of peace has been brought to a 
conclusion. 
  He also said that the human rights of servicemen and 
draftees 
were continuously infringed on. In particular, numerous youths 
whose weight was below the norm and who could not therefore be 
legally drafted were forcibly held in recruiting offices and fed 
until their weight was brought up to the norm and then sent to 
the Army.
