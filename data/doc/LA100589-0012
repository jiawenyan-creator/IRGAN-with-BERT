DUMPING L.A. TRASH IN DESERT 
What will the little boys with the train fetish think of next? Two years ago it 
was "missiles-by-rail" and now it is "trash-by-train." We wonder if Christmas 
gifts of toy train sets for these wackos will end their frustrations and nutty 
ideas for our Riverside County rights-of-way and leave us to the serious 
business of promoting needed rail commuter service between Coachella Valley and 
the coast through the pass and Inland Empire.
