FT  28 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Typhoons may force Tokyo to import rice
JAPAN is under increasing pressure to import rice to counter an expected
shortfall in this year's crop, which has been severely damaged by a spate of
typhoons and an unusually cold summer.
The Agriculture Ministry yesterday denied Japanese newspaper reports that it
has already decided on limited imports, but officials have admitted the
annual rice harvest index, due to be announced on Thursday, will show a
sharp fall in production.
Imports will be an embarrassment for the Japanese government, which has
resisted international pressure for the rice market to be opened as part of
a settlement under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks.
There was a suggestion from within the government yesterday that emergency
imports could be used to signify the opening of the market, although Tokyo's
negotiating position has been that a decision on the rice market is
impossible until the US and EC reach agreement on farm trade. It is more
likely that imports would be characterised as a once-only response to the
shortfall.
One Japanese negotiator explained that differences between the US and EC
made a rice market opening difficult to justify to politically influential
Japanese farmers.
Japan relaxed its ban on imports in 1984, when 150,000 tonnes of rice were
imported from South Korea, and rice was imported in the harsh years
immediately after the second world war.
The rice harvest index for August was 95, against the 100 of an average
year, but it is widely expected the index for September will slip to about
85.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has indicated he will be more
flexible on the issue than his predecessors. However, the largest group in
Mr Hosokawa's coalition government, the Social Democratic party, formerly
the Japan Socialist party, is strongly opposed to rice imports.
