FT  12 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: End of an era for German veterans
It took only a few minutes after their 2-1 loss to Bulgaria in the World Cup
quarter-finals on Sunday for the German team to start breaking up.
Heads low, the Germans left the field to hear goalkeeper Bodo Illgner
announce his retirement. Illgner, 27, was first to go, though his decision
was not prompted by age.
Several veterans are sure to leave, and captain Lothar Matthaus, 33, could
be among them, although he said he had no immediate plans to quit.
The future of coach Berti Vogts also looks uncertain. Defeat marked
Germany's earliest exit since 1978, when they were stopped in the second
round, also as defending champions.
'Tough times are coming up for the coach, but I want to stay around as long
as I'm having fun and I am still having fun,' said Vogts, 47, who took over
from Franz Beckenbauer after Germany's 1990 triumph.
Veteran defender Guido Buchwald, 33, is moving to Japan in the twilight of
his career, and striker Rudi Voller, 34, and defender Andreas Brehme, 33,
will not return.
Vogts, counting on experience, picked 12 men from the 1990 squad. But many
were over the hill.
'I hope that many players will continue because we need an experienced
basis,' Vogts said. 'But new players also have to come in and new ways have
to be found. We have to rebuild now and concentrate on the 1996 European
championships.'
Qualifying rounds start this autumn - and Germany will play Bulgaria.
