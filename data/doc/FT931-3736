FT  13 MAR 93 / Fishermen blockade port to repel French trawler
A FRENCH trawler was last night prevented from entering Milford Haven
harbour in west Wales when three trawlers blockaded the entrance and warned
that no French boat would be allowed into the port.
The French trawler was forced to remain at anchor outside the harbour last
night, unable to land her cargo.
More British boats are expected to join the blockade in time for high tide
this morning when another French trawler is expected at Milford Haven with a
cargo of fish. Trawlermen are protesting at the effect of imports on local
prices and claim that some of the French fish landed at the Welsh port are
re-exported to France.
Jimmy Burns writes: Earlier yesterday fishermen's leaders called for a
European Community import ban on Russian cod but held back from supporting a
blockade of ports.
Officials of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which
represents most fishermen in England and Wales, called for the ban at a
meeting in Grimsby, where fishermen this week stopped lorries from
delivering Russian fish to the local market.
The UK Association of Frozen Food Producers yesterday warned that any import
ban could lead to a shortage of fish by the summer.
Mr Geoffrey Molloy, the association's chairman, said: 'Banning cod imports
will not help the consumer and will certainly not help prices. The increases
in landings which the fishermen complain about are, in fact, caught by UK
fishermen themselves.'
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said yesterday the
government would not back the fishermen's call for a ban at next week's EC
council of fisheries ministers.
