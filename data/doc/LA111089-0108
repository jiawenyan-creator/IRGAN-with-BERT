THE GALLERIES: THE VALLEY 
Moving surreptitiously through the park benches and beaches of Santa Monica 
armed with a camera, Ruth Bavetta takes unnoticed snapshots of seniors sunning 
or staring blankly, and of youths tanning oiled, taut bodies or huddling in 
intimate conversation. The paintings that Bavetta makes from these photos have 
been called photorealism but that's a misnomer as there is an inbred 
awkwardness to the figures' positioning, an inaccuracy to their anatomy and a 
foreshortening that gives scenes a bizarre, even distorted twist. 
An instinctive and emotional colorist, the artist borrows her palette from the 
under belly of a rainbow trout, highlighting figures' translucent skin, the 
folds of sun-blanched white frocks or the silvering hair of advanced age in 
incandescent pinks, lilacs and blues. All the above are in Bavetta's 
voyeuristic peeks at elderly card players, skinny-legged grandpas in Bermuda 
shorts gazing pensively out to see the mood of a memory, or of a reality spied 
through the half-closed eyes of a reverie. 
That's the good news. The bad news is that in too many paintings awkward 
draftsmanship eventually yanks our attention away from the scenes' pathos. In 
"The Dead Sunbather" and in another view of a Barbie-doll blonde who torques 
her body to look back at us, ill-placed depth cues and sketchy handling make 
protagonists look dwarfed. (Orlando Gallery, 14553 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks,
