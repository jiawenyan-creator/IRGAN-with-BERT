FT  28 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): GKN - Other Companies
On Wednesday, the engineering and industrial services group is expected to
report a 20 per cent decline in profits for 1993. The group hinted at a
Pounds 97m pre-tax figure - down from Pounds 121.8m - three weeks ago when
it launched a contested Pounds 497m bid for Westland, the UK's only
helicopter manufacturer.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, has blamed the decline on redundancy and
restructuring costs of some Pounds 20m and an exceptional Pounds 11m charge.
