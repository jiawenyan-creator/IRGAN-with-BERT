FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Fiat construction arm gets
merger approval
Cogefar-Impresit, the Fiat construction subsidiary, yesterday took another
step towards the creation of Italy's largest construction group, when
shareholders approved the first phase of a planned merger with two other
building companies.
At the same shareholder meeting, the chairman and chief executive of Cogefar
said they would stand down, having completed the cleaning-up of the company.
A number of former Cogefar executives were allegedly involved in Italy's
bribes scandal, but Mr Marcello Franco, who became chairman in May 1993,
said yesterday that he and Mr Paolo Rucci, outgoing chief executive, had
'carried out the job of regularising and systematising the accounts'.
Fiat announced in December that it planned to cut its exposure to the
building sector with a complicated three-way merger between
Cogefar-Impresit, Lodigiani (Italy's second largest private construction
group) and Girola (a smaller construction group).
Cogefar shareholders yesterday approved the merger with Impregilo, an
existing joint venture between the three companies which is the vehicle for
the deal. Impregilo should take over Lodigiani and Girola's construction
activities before the end of the year.
Mr Franco and Mr Rucci will remain on the Cogefar board, which will be
enlarged to include Mr Francesco Carraro, Impregilo's chairman.
