FT  04 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Road tolls: excise option more
efficient and fairness essential to their success (1)
Sir, Transport secretary John MacGregor ('Motorway charges put on hold until
after election', November 26) will be doing very well to develop a scheme
for electronic road tolls by 1998. Quite apart from the little matter of the
election, there is the total antipathy (initially apparent in the 'Traffic
in Towns' report, 1964) of the department of transport and of road lobbies
to any kind of direct charging of motorists for road use.
At present the only 'usage tax' (ie, related to road use, not ownership) is
fuel excise duty at some Pounds 1.20 per gallon - that is, 6p to 3p per mile
for large to small cars. To equate to typical EU toll levels and city public
transport charges this direct charge ought to be three to four times higher.
Thus Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is to be congratulated for embarking
on this route, for excise duty tolls are not only cheap to collect and hard
to avoid, they also have formidable effects on fuel efficiency and
pollution, and they surcharge congestion.
Mr Clarke's excise tolls are far superior to Mr MacGregor's electronic tolls
which, given the negligible R&amp;D pursued by the transport department so far,
could easily remain unsuitable as a means of charging for direct road use
for a very long time.
