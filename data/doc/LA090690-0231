TIMOTHY LEARY DAUGHTER HANGS SELF IN CELL, DIES IN HOSPITAL 
The daughter of LSD guru Timothy Leary, sentenced to a mental hospital for the 
criminally insane for trying to kill her boyfriend, has died after hanging 
herself with a shoelace in a county jail cell, authorities said today. 
Susan Martino, 42, also known as Susan Leary, was found Monday morning hanging 
by the shoelace, tied to her cell bars at Sybil Brand Institute for Women in 
East Los Angeles, Sheriff's Deputy Mary Landreth said. 
She died at 6 p.m. Wednesday at Santa Marta Hospital, Landreth said. 
It was not immediately known how long Martino had been hanging in her single 
cell, but Landreth said she was in a special block where deputies check the 
welfare of each inmate every 20 minutes. 
Martino was arrested by Glendale police on Jan. 5, 1989, for the attempted 
murder of her live-in boyfriend. During a hearing last month, a judge once 
again found her mentally incompetent and sentenced her to Patton State Hospital 
in San Bernardino County.
