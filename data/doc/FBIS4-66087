Situation in Crimea"] 
  [Text] The EU [European Union] expresses its grave concern 
at the recent developments in the Crimean region of Ukraine. 
Noting that the situation in the Crimea has deteriorated over 
the past week, and taking into consideration the decision of the 
Crimean Parliament of 20 May, it urges the continuation of 
efforts to find negotiated and legitimate solutions to the 
issue, without resort to confrontation or unilateral actions. 
  The EU reaffirms its full support for the territorial 
integrity of a sovereign Ukraine in accordance with the charter 
of the United Nations and with the principles of the CSCE final 
act and warns against actions which risk creating instability in 
the area. 
  The EU reiterates that an escalation of the conflict would 
have severe consequences for the stability in East Europe.
