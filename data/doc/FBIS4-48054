  [Text] The military base at Tugela Ferry in Natal was 
attacked by unknown people last night. The Natal security 
committee said the troops at the base returned fire and that 
some of the assailants may have been struck. Meanwhile the 
South African National Defense Force is continuing to confiscate 
weapons in terms of the emergency measures in KwaZulu/Natal. 
Our Durban news staff reports that in the latest incidents 
firearms were found in a house in Greytown, a kraal near 
KwaMbonambi, and a road block near Port Shepstone.
