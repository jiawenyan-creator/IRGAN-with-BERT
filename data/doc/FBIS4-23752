  [Text] Durban June 13 SAPA -- A tripartite alliance in the 
KwaZulu/Natal Midlands at the weekend called on African National 
Congress MPLs [member provincial legislature] and MECs [member 
executive council] to boycott any meetings of the provincial 
legislature at Ulundi. Dr Blade Nzimande, spokesman for the 
ANC/Congress of South African Trade Unions/South African 
Communist Party alliance, on Monday [13 June] said a weekend 
congress had voted for Pietermaritzburg as the provincial 
capital. 
  The province's Executive Council holds its weekly meeting at 
Ulundi on Tuesday. If the three ANC MECs attend it will be their 
first official visit to the former homeland capital and 
traditional seat of the rival Inkatha Freedom Party. 
  Dr Nzimande said the congress had called for a referendum on 
the siting of the capital, a suggestion once made by IFP 
President and Minister of Home Affairs Mr Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  Both the IFP's rivals in the provincial legislature, the ANC 
and the National Party, favour Pietermaritzburg for the capital. 
  The ANC says political intolerance is rife in Ulundi. The 
organisation cites the murders there of three ANC election 
campaigners in April. 
  Premier Dr Frank Mdlalose's office could not be reached for 
comment. 
  The Executive Council has still to make proposals to the 
legislature on the siting of the capital.
