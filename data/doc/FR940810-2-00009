SUMMARY:

 In response to a request by the Municipal Castings Fair Trade Council and its individually-named members (petitioner),
the Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order
on iron construction castings from Canada. The review covers 
four manufacturers/exporters of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period March 1, 1991, through

February 29, 1992. For these preliminary results, we applied best information available (BIA) for all four of the
manufacturers/exporters. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins during the period. 


Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On March 5, 1989, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 an antidumping duty order on iron construction castings from Canada (51 FR 7890). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)
the petitioner requested an administrative review of four manufacturers/exporters. We published the notice of
initiation on April 13, 1992 (57 FR 12797). The Department is now conducting that administrative review in accordance
with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 


Scope of the Review 


Imports covered by this review are shipments of certain heavy and light iron construction castings. Heavy castings,
are limited to manhole covers, rings, and frames, catch basin grates and frames, cleanout covers and frames used for
drainage or access purposes for public utility, water, and sanitary systems, from Canada, classifiable under Harmonized
Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 7325.10.0010 and 7325.10.0050. Light castings are limited to valve, service,
and meter boxes which are placed below ground to encase water, gas, or other valves, or water and gas meters, classifiable
as light castings under HTS item numbers 8306.29.0000 and 8310.00.0000. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience
and Customs purposes only. The written description remains dispositive. 

This review covers sales of certain Canadian iron construction castings by Associated Foundry (Associated), Fonderie
LaPerle/LaPerle Foundry Division (LaPerle), Penticton Foundry Ltd. (Penticton), and Titan Foundry Ltd. (Titan),
during the period March 1, 1991, through February 29, 1992. 



Analysis 



We received only one questionnaire response, and that was from LaPerle. Based on our analysis of LaPerle's response,
we have determined that LaPerle is related to other manufacturers/exporters for which it did not provide information.
LaPerle and its related entities meet all five criteria, in addition to ownership, that the Department considers
in determining whether to collapse related parties, as laid out in 

Certain Granite Products from Spain, 

53 FR 24335, 1988; 

Certain Granite Products from Italy 

53 FR 27187, 1988; 

Steel Wheels from Brazil, 

54 FR 8780, 1989; 

Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan, 

54 FR 48011, 1989; and 

Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled
Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length
Carbon Steel Plate from Canada, 

58 FR 37099 (July 9, 1993). The five criteria, in addition to ownership, are as follows: 

&bull;Whether companies have interlocking boards of directors 

&bull;Whether companies have similar production processes, facilities or equipment so as to facilitate shifting
of production between facilities 

&bull;Whether companies operate as separate and distinct entities 

&bull;Whether companies share marketing and sales information or offices 

&bull;Whether companies are involved in the pricing or production decisions of the other entity 

Based on our analysis of these criteria, the information on the record indicates that 13 other companies, in addition
to those included in the notice of initiation of administrative review, are sufficiently related to be collapsed.
It is our preliminary determination LaPerle and all its related companies should be treated as a single entity. (For
more information see the analysis memorandum for the preliminary results.) Therefore, in effect, we are now conducting
a review of one single company, comprised of various individual components, including LaPerle.
