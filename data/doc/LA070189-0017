THERE'S BARELY ROOM FOR SPORTS IN SPORTS SECTIONS THESE DAYS 
All the legalisms and legalese involving Pete Rose, his bookmaker, Commissioner 
Giamatti and Judge Nadel are much ado about nothing, simple delays in a drama 
fast becoming stale. As the judge said, a 14-day delay will hurt neither major 
league baseball nor the public. This thing's already gone on longer than 
Kareem's farewell tour. Either Rose will be able to explain away the hard 
evidence, especially the betting slips, or he will not. If he cannot, he should 
be gone. 
For God sakes, let's play ball!
