DOW RISES 8.43 DESPITE SOME INVESTOR JITTERS 
Stock prices rose slightly Thursday in restrained trading that reflected 
uncertainties over news from Panama, the progress of a Treasury debt auction 
and an upcoming report on inflation. 
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 8.43 to 2,382.88. 
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 4 to 3 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 785 issues 
up, 602 down and 568 unchanged. 
After an early selloff, the market moved higher behind strengthening bond 
prices, which rose on a Commerce Department report of lower-than-expected 
retail sales figures for April. The government said retail sales rose a modest 
0.4% last month. 
Analysts said the number pointed to a slower economy, giving the markets 
impetus to move out of their recent slump by signaling lower interest rates. 
But activity remained subdued with investors awaiting the final day of the 
Treasury's $28.75-billion three-day round of borrowing. There was uncertainty 
over how a new glut of Treasury debt would be absorbed. 
Many market participants also withdrew in nervous reaction to President Bush's 
announcement that he was sending more troops to Panama. 
"That kept some traders on the sidelines wondering what steps might be taken 
there," said Charles Jensen, technical analyst with MKI Securities Corp. 
"Otherwise, we might have had a better response." 
The market has spent most of the week waiting for April producer price numbers, 
which it hopes will provide a clearer indication of inflation in the economy. 
Observers said last Friday's jobless report confused investors, because while 
it showed higher unemployment and a slowing economy, it also showed that wages 
rose substantially in April, suggesting that inflation is still a problem. 
The producer price report is scheduled for release today. 
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Avon fell 3/8 to 39 1/2, Pan Am lost 
3/8 to 4 5/8 and IBM dropped 1/2 to 109 1/8. 
Hilton Hotels, meanwhile, surged 6 1/2 to 72 on news that the company would 
consider takeover offers. Block Enterprises also rose 1 1/8 to 27 3/8, and 
General Electric gained 1 1/8 to 49. 
In Tokyo, the main Nikkei stock index gained 89.14 to close at 34,08.49. 
In London, share prices closed mostly lower in an atmosphere of continued 
unease about possible labor actions. 
The Financial Times 100-share index finished 6.4 lower at 2,110.6. 
Credit 
Bond prices rose after three days of declines, aided by favorable inflation 
indications and what analysts called strong demand at a government securities 
auction. 
The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose 15/32 point, or $4.69 per $1,000 face 
amount, after falling a total of about $15 earlier in the week. Its yield fell 
to 9.06% from 9.10% late Wednesday. 
Yields on the 30-year bonds rose to 9.11%, up from 8.91% at the last comparable 
auction in February. It was the highest rate since 30-year bonds averaged 9.17% 
a year ago. 
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose 7/16 to 11/16 point, intermediate maturities rose 13/32 point and 
long-term issues were up 11/32 to 15/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a $1,000 bond. 
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds closed up 1/8 at 91-31/32. The average yield to maturity dropped to 7.60% 
from 7.62% late Wednesday. 
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.72% as the discount fell 7 basis 
points to 8.43%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.91% as the discount fell 9 
basis points to 8.42%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.03% as the discount 
fell 12 basis points to 8.37%. 
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.69%, down from 9.75% late Wednesday. 
Currency 
The dollar gained against most major currencies despite further evidence of a 
slowdown in U.S. economic growth. 
Gold prices rose, partly in response to the tension in Panama. 
In London, one British pound cost $1.6655 late Thursday, down from late 
Wednesday's $1.6717. Sterling weakened against the dollar in New York, ending 
the day at $1.6645, compared to $1.6740 on Wednesday.

dollars, up from 1.1849.

from late Wednesday's bid of $376.60. Earlier, gold bullion for current 
delivery rose $3.30 to $381 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. 
Gold bullion prices improved slightly in Europe. Gold traded late in London, 
the major market, at $379, up from $377.25. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold rose 
to $378.20 from $376.75. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $377.25, down

ounce, up from $5.607 on Wednesday. Silver traded late in London at $5.66, down 
from $5.68. 
Commodities 
Crude oil futures prices climbed back above $20 a barrel and petroleum product 
prices soared in a rally bolstered by President Bush's decision to send combat 
troops to Panama. 
On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell, precious metals advanced, 
cattle prices rose and pork futures were mixed. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude settled 
unchanged to 54 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in June at $20.06 
a barrel; heating oil was 0.07 cent to 1.20 cents higher, with June at 48.68 
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.80 cent to 2.56 cents higher, with June 
at 67.28 cents a gallon. 
Soybean futures ended sharply lower on the Chicago Board of Trade amid 
forecasts of rain and disappointment over the government's reluctance to 
subsidize a sale of U.S. soybean oil to the Soviet Union. 
Wheat and corn futures also retreated. 
After the markets closed, the Agriculture Department issued a report estimating 
1989 U.S. winter wheat production at a decade low of 1.43 billion bushels. 
Wheat settled 1 3/4 cents lower to 1 1/2 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in May at $4.28 a bushel; corn was 1 1/2 to 3 1/4 cents lower, with 
May at $2.76 1/4 a bushel; oats were 1 1/2 cents lower to 1/2 cent higher, with 
May at $1.84 1/2 a bushel; soybeans were 6 3/4 to 10 1/4 cents lower, with May 
at $7.51 1/2 a bushel. 
Most cattle futures ended slightly higher in light trading after weakening 
earlier in the session. Pork futures settled mostly lower amid profit taking 
after two days of steep gains.
