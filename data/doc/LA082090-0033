PARIS CONFIRMS IRAQ HAS DETAINED 27 FRENCH NATIONALS 
France confirmed Sunday that 27 French nationals were being held somewhere in 
Iraq, after the wife of one hostage accused Paris of keeping their detention 
secret for three days. 
A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that the French citizens had been taken 
away, soon after the unidentified Frenchwoman appealed on France's TF1 
television channel for their rescue. 
The woman said the hostages included her husband and a 4-year-old girl 
traveling without her parents. 
"Iraqi authorities informed us officially on Saturday, Aug. 18, of their 
intention to implement the measures they announced recently concerning 
foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait," the spokesman said. 
He did not say when the government learned of the French group's removal.
