Class B. 

Class B AM radio stations are unlimited time stations rendering service only over a primary service area. These stations
are authorized to operate with a minimum power of 0.25 kW (or, if less than 0.25 kW, an equivalent RMS antenna field of
at least 141 mV/m at 1 km) and a maximum power of 50 kW (or 10kW for stations that are authorized to operate in the 16051705
kHz band). For FY 1994, each licensee of a Class B AM station will be assessed a $500 annual regulatory fee.

16. 

Class C.

 Class C AM radio stations operate on local channels and are designed to render service only over a primary service area
that may be reduced as a consequence of interference. These stations are authorized to operate at not less than 0.25
kW, nor more than 1 kW. Class C stations that were previously licensed to operate with 0.1 kW may continue to do so under
our rules. For FY 1994, each licensee of a Class C AM station will be assessed a $200 annual regulatory fee.

17. 

Class D.

 Class D AM radio stations operate either daytime, limited time or unlimited time with nighttime power less than 0.25
kW and an equivalent RMS antenna field of less than 141 mV/m at one km. Class D stations operate with daytime powers not
less than 0.25 kW nor more than 50 kW. Nighttime operations of Class D stations are not afforded protection and must
protect all Class A and Class B operations during nighttime hours. For FY 1994, each licensee of a Class D AM station
will be assessed a $250 annual regulatory fee.

18. 

AM Construction Permits.

 For FY 1994, persons holding a construction permit for a any class of a new am station are subject to a $100 annual regulatory
fee for each outstanding permit. Upon issuance of an operating license to cover the construction permit, this fee
is no longer applicable. Instead, licensees will pay a regulatory fee amount based upon the designated class of the
licensed station, as described above, as of the date the regulatory fee payment is due.



b. FM Radio Stations



19. 

Licensed Stations. 

FM radio stations must meet the location, power and antenna height requirements for stations designated as Classes
C, C1, C2, or B, as set forth in sections 73.205, 73.210 and 73.211 of the Commission's Rules. For FY 1994, each commercial
licensee of a Class C, C1, C2, or B FM station will be assessed a $900 annual regulatory fee per license. FM radio stations
meeting the location, power and antenna height requirements for stations designated as Classes A, B1, or C3, as set
forth in the Commission's rules, have a smaller coverage area. Thus, for FY 1994, each commercial licensee for a Class
A, B1, or C3 FM Station will be assessed a $600 annual regulatory fee per license.

20. 

FM Construction Permits.

 Persons holding a construction permit for any class of a new FM station, except Class D, are subject to a $500 annual
regulatory fee per outstanding permit in FY 1994. Upon issuance of an operating license to cover the construction
permit, this fee is no longer applicable. Instead licensees will pay a regulatory fee based upon the designated class
of the licensed station, as described above, as of the regulatory fee payment is determined.



c. Television Stations



21. 

VHF and UHF Commercial Licenses. 

Commercial VHF and UHF television licensees, including licensees of satellite stations, will be assessed a regulatory
