FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel shares fall on rolling stock
costs
THE SHARE price of Eurotunnel fell by more than 3 per cent yesterday
following reports of further problems in rolling stock production because of
a dispute over costs.
It is the latest in a series of rows over who should pay for the soaring
cost of the project which since 1987 has risen from Pounds 4.8bn to over
Pounds 9bn.
According to Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French
construction companies, production in Bruges of the single deck carriages
which will carry cars, coaches and caravans has been halted.
Problems have been caused by a dispute between Transmanche and Bombardier of
Canada, the rolling stock producer, over the rising cost of the wagons.
Production of double deck wagons at Valenciennes in France had also halted
because of a separate strike unconnected with Transmanche.
Eurotunnel shares fell from 492p to 473p. The share price previously had
risen sharply following the company's claims that it had won an important
victory in conflict over costs with Transmanche.
Eurotunnel has taken confidence from an International Chamber of Commerce
ruling that Transmanche could not pursue an all-embracing claim for extra
payments for fitting out the tunnel but would have justify individual
elements of the claim separately.
Transmanche said the decision will have little bearing on the outcome of its
claim to be paid Pounds 1.4bn in 1985 prices for works originally priced at
Pounds 620m. Eurotunnel has offered to pay Pounds 1.2bn of which Pounds 900m
would be cash and Pounds 300m in shares or quasi-equity.
Mr Jean-Claude Jammes, chairman of SAE, the French construction company and
a Transmanche shareholder, warned it would be impossible to meet
Eurotunnel's proposed opening date of December 15.
