  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 20 May (EFE) -- Official sources 
reported here today that the Brazilian Government will start 
negotiations with Canada regarding the alleged "dumping" (unfair 
trade practice) charges brought against Canada by the United 
States and Argentina concerning Canadian wheat sales to Brazil. 
The sources said Brazil plans to exhaust negotiations with 
Canada before proceeding to open a formal investigation. 
  The United States and Argentina have charged that the 
Canadian Government has subsidized its wheat and, therefore, its 
price has become more competitive than U.S. and Argentine wheat 
on the Brazilian market, which will need to import 5 million 
metric tons of wheat this year. 
  Brazilian wheat producers have demanded that the Brazilian 
Government investigate the charge that Canadian wheat might be 
subsidized. 
  A Brazilian Government official said: "We are going to 
exchange ideas (with Canada), but we do not intend to formally 
start an `antidumping' investigation." [passage omitted]
