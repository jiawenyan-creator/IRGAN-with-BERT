FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Creditors close in on Curragh
CREDITORS have closed in on Curragh, the Canadian lead-zinc producer, after
its failure to raise new equity, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Curragh, which has been in bankruptcy protection since April and has closed
mines in north-west Canada because of low base metal prices, has been trying
to raise up to CDollars 75m (USDollars 99m) in new equity since early last
year.
Mr Clifford Frame, chairman, negotiated a CDollars 50m infusion from Korea
Zinc and Samsung but the deal fell through. His attempts to find help in
Europe failed last week .
An Ontario court has put Curragh's Faro mine into receivership on behalf of
unsecured note-holders owed almost USDollars 250m.
