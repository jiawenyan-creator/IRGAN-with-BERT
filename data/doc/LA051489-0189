Soviet sports authorities had planned to send hockey star Vyacheslav Fetisov to 
the United States to try to persuade teammate Alexander Mogilny to return after 
defecting, a Soviet newspaper reported. 
The daily Stroitelnaya Gazeta said the trip was canceled at the last minute 
because of travel problems. 
Mogilny, 20, a center for the Soviet national team, defected after the Soviets 
won the world championships last month in Stockholm. He has signed a contract 
with the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League.
