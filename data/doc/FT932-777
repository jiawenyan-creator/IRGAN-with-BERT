FT  26 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Richemont's rich deal
It would be easy to depict Richemont's restructuring as a cynical,
short-term exercise designed to release cash to help the Swiss-based company
repay Pounds 612m of loan notes due next year. No doubt such financial
demands crossed the Rupert family's collective mind more than fleetingly.
But Richemont has long demonstrated that its interests as Rothmans' majority
shareholder are not inimical to those of minority investors. Further
consideration of its asset reshuffle emphasises the point.
Following the restructuring, Rothmans' shareholders will receive a fair
dollop of cash in the form of a 76p pay-out per share. Moreover, Rothmans'
dividend cover will drop from almost five to just over two. That will still
leave the reshaped Rothmans with a yield below that of BAT Industries. But
as a pure tobacco company, Rothmans promises to pursue expansion more
aggressively, perhaps offering a faster rate of growth.
The whole deal depends, though, on Dunhill's minority shareholders agreeing
to fold their interest together with Richemont's Cartier business into the
newly created Vendome. Dunhill's shareholders may justifiably gripe at the
higher valuation placed on Cartier's assets. They may also object to being
relegated to an even less significant minority without any compensating
goodwill premium. But Dunhill is suffering tough trading conditions. The
application of Cartier's management skills and access to a more extensive
distribution network should help compensate. The merger will also remove
Richemont's inherent problem of allocating financial resources between its
various luxury brands. The restructuring may not immediately release much
additional value. Richemont will have to persuade Dunhill shareholders that
it should yield rewards over time.
