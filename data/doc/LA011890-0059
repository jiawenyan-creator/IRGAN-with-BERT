CITY CELEBRATES KING'S BIRTHDAY, ITS DIVERSITY 
The spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. descended on Parcher Plaza -- the heart of 
civic Glendale -- for the first time Monday, as about 80 city officials and 
employees celebrated the 61st birthday of the slain civil rights leader with an 
outdoor party. 
The Rev. David Scott of the North Glendale United Methodist Church delivered a 
speech, calling for continued progress toward racial unity and citing King's 
famous "I Have a Dream" address. 
The Glendale High School Chamber Choir opened the festivities with a soulful 
rendition of the national anthem and entertained the crowd after the speech. 
Volunteers served free turkey and ham sandwiches and potato and macaroni salad, 
and Mayor Jerold Milner read a proclamation. 
In many respects, the celebration mirrored hundreds of King festivities around 
the country. But for at least one Glendale minority employee, it was a special 
day. 
"Twenty years ago it was uncomfortable for minorities to come into this city at 
any time, particularly in the evenings," said Glendale Community Relations 
Coordinator Rick Reyes, who has worked for the city for 29 years. 
"Even today there are pockets of resistance, but the attitudes are slowly 
changing." 
As recently as three years ago, a black delicatessen owner left town after 
attacks by vandals who repeatedly smeared her store with racist graffiti. 
In past years, the city quietly recognized King's day with a proclamation and a 
lunchtime movie in the basement of city hall.
