  [Text] Tunis, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat has chaired a series of meetings of the 
Central Committee of Fatah movement and the PLO Executive 
Committee during the last few days, reliable Palestinian sources 
said here today. 
  The meetings discussed the Cairo deal and the latest 
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. 
  Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres signed a 
partial agreement in Cairo last Wednesday [6 February], which 
deals with the implementation of the September 13 PLO-Israeli 
peace accord. 
  The sources told XINHUA here today that the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee held a meeting 
last Sunday, with PLO Chairman 'Arafat presiding. A number of 
committee members were absent. 'Arafat explained the Cairo deal 
at the meeting. 
  Abu-'Alaa' [Ahmad Quray'], head of the Economic Department 
of 
the PLO, made a speech on the economic talks between the PLO and 
Israel, pointing out obstacles in these talks. 
  No agreement was reached on finance, trade or customs so 
far, 
he said. 
  As for the meetings of the Central Committee of Fatah 
movement -- PLO's major group, the sources said that differences 
on the Cairo deal are still standing, pointing out that some 
members called for amendment to some articles. 
  These amendments, the sources say, must be compatible with 
the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. 
  The Palestinian sources stressed that President 'Arafat 
convinced his aides that what was signed in Cairo was a draft 
agreement, but not a final agreement. 
  The draft is amendable and negotiable and it prepares for 
the 
signing of a final agreement on the implementation of Israel's 
pullout from Gaza and Jericho, 'Arafat said.
