FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Stagecoach arrives at Pounds 13m - East
Kent Travel acquired as further purchases are considered
STAGECOACH, the Perth-based regional bus service operator, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m in the year to April 30, compared to
Pounds 8.24m and ahead of the Pounds 12.8m forecast at the time of the
company's flotation in mid-April.
Mr Brian Souter, chairman, said the results reflected both organic growth
and the effect of recent acquisitions.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 18.3m (Pounds 15.8m) including Pounds
679,000 from acquisitions, while net interest costs fell to Pounds 5.16m
(Pounds 7.43m). Turnover increased to Pounds 154.3m (Pounds 140.7m).
Earnings per share increased by 38 per cent to 8.3p (6p). No final dividend
is recommended but the notional net dividend of 3.8p, set out in the
flotation prospectus, would have been covered 1.8 times.
The group plans to use the Pounds 20.6m proceeds of the flotation to assist
further acquisition-led growth. 'We think there are tremendous opportunities
for us as a bus company to grow,' Mr Souter said yesterday.
The company, which already runs bus services in 13 UK regions and counties
and in Kenya, Malawi and New Zealand, is acquiring East Kent Travel, the
subject of a management buy-out from National Bus in 1987, extending its
grip over bus services along the south-east coast.
'We are currently investigating a number of other UK bus opportunities and
anticipate substantial activity over the next 12 to 18 months,' he said. In
addition to acquisitions Stagecoach is also likely to bid for services in
London and south Manchester when they are 'privatised'.
Over the past year Mr Souter said the group had made significant progress
towards achieving a target group operating margin of 15 per cent by lifting
bus operating margins from 11.2 per cent to 11.9 per cent.
As part of a five-year fleet modernisation programme the group took delivery
of 299 new vehicles in the UK last year and 112 vehicles overseas.
Expenditure on new vehicles over the next two years will be Pounds 27m
following the Pounds 40m spent over the last 3 years.
Despite heavy capital expenditure of Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 13.7m) during the
year the flotation proceeds ensured that the group ended April with reduced
net borrowings of Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 46.9m), equivalent to gearing of 58
per cent, down from 243 per cent a year earlier.
