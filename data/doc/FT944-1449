FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Fairhaven bid terms disclosed
Eagleville announced the terms yesterday of a paper and cash offer for
Fairhaven International, the Bermuda-registered holding company which has
OGC International, the oil services group, as its main asset.
The offer, which was first revealed on November 9, values Fairhaven at
Pounds 71m.
Eagleville, which already owns 28.9 per cent of Fairhaven, is controlled by
Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipping magnate. Through other interests, Mr
Olsen controls 75 per cent of Fairhaven. The offer is designed as a
tidying-up exercise for Olsen interests and a means of taking Fairhaven
private.
Eagleville is offering one OGC share for every 5 Fairhaven shares, giving
them a value of about 29p.
This is a 30 per cent premium over the price of 22 1/2 p that Fairhaven
shares had on November 8, the day before its directors announced that they
had received an approach from Eagleville which might lead to an offer.
Alternatively, shareholders can elect to take a cash offer of 27p a share.
Nearly 60 per cent of holders have so far undertaken to accept the paper and
not the cash offer.
