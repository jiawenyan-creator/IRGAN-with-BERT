GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL TO HELP SIMI SCHOOLS 
Gov. George Deukmejian has signed a bill to help Simi Valley schools finance 
classroom renovation if voters approve a March 7 ballot measure that would fund 
the improvements. 
The measure, which Deukmejian signed Friday, gives the Simi Valley Unified 
School District more time to repay a 20-year-old state loan, Supt. John Duncan 
said. 
Sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), it would extend the 
repayment time of the debt from three to six years, Duncan said. 
The extension would reduce property taxes paid annually by homeowners, Duncan 
said. However, it is contingent on passage of Measure A, a $35-million bond 
issue that will be submitted to voters March 7. The district is seeking passage 
of Measure A for repairs to its 27 schools, most of which are more than 25 
years old. 
"It's hard to understand, but, basically, if voters pass the new bond issue, 
their property taxes will drop as a result of this bill," Duncan said. 
Under the bill, for example, the owner of a $100,000 house would pay an annual 
property tax to the district of $88 instead of $120, Duncan said.
