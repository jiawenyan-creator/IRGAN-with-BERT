FT  10 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A matter of forms
I HAVE JUST received a dividend from Euro Disney sent by the National
Westminster bank. They say the form claiming a French tax refund should be
completed in quadruplicate. Does this mean I should send four forms to the
NatWest and one to the inspector of taxes in this country? Also, in claiming
back the French withholding tax, it seems I shall lose a percentage of it.
How much will actually be sent to me and my wife? Finally, do I claim the
full amount that is on the dividend slip, as the shares are held jointly
with my wife? She is a 25 per cent taxpayer and I am a non-taxpayer.
Send all the completed copies of the form RF4-GB to your tax office. The
inspector will complete his part, keep one copy for his file and send the
others back to you; you should then send them back to the bank. You will be
paid the 50 per cent avoir fiscal (tax credit) plus 2.5 per cent out of the
25 per cent withholding tax; so, ultimately, you will bear 22.5 per cent
French withholding tax - which is equivalent to 15 per cent of the
dividend-plus-avoir fiscal. As a basic-rate taxpayer, your wife ultimately
will bear UK tax at 10 per cent on the dividend-plus-avoir-fiscal, so she
will end up with 75 per cent of the dividend-plus-avoir-fiscal (subject to
the variation in the exchange rate between the time the dividend was
converted to sterling and the time when the payment from the French
government arrives).
A joint claim by your wife and yourself will probably be acceptable to the
French tax authorities. If your wife's tax affairs are dealt with at a
different tax office from yours, however, it might may be simpler to ask the
bank for another form so that each of you can submit a claim in respect of
your half share of the dividend.
