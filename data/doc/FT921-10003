FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Stolen card refund
WHEN a cash card and its personal identification number get intercepted in
the post, an account-holder can suffer needlessly if his bank does not act
promptly to put things right.
A foreign student, staying for a few months in London to learn English,
opened an account at the Fulham branch of Barclays Bank in November last
year. He deposited Pounds 2,000 and waited for his cash card to arrive. It
never came. Instead, almost all his money was siphoned from his account.
When he complained to the bank, he was told he would get a refund and given
a Pounds 150 credit to tide him over. But 10 further visits to the branch
produced no action and his requests for an interview with the manager were
refused.
An approach to Barclays' regional head office produced a promise to help -
but still nothing happened. Now, however, after being contacted by the
Financial Times, Barclays has investigated the case and the money has been
refunded in full.
A Barclays' representative said: 'The case should have been referred to our
fraud department and then the refund would have been made, but this does not
seem to have happened in this case. We are still trying to find out why. We
can only apologise.'
