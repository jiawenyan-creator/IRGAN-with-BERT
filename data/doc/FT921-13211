FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Dow Corning's senior debt rating
downgraded
MOODY'S Investors Service yesterday downgraded Dow Corning and Corning's
senior debt rating amid concern about possible litigation over silicone gel
breast implants made by Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow
Chemical and Corning, the glass products manufacturer.
The downgrade was followed by news of a product-liability suit filed against
Bristol-Myers Squibb in Chicago which alleges that the company's silicone
breast implants have serious and dangerous side-effects.
Lawyers said they expected to add claims against Dow Corning by the end of
the week. Although Bristol-Myers maintains that its implants are safe, the
company last year decided to close its breast implant operations.
Dow Corning's senior debt rating was cut to A2 from Aa2. The company's
long-term debt and commercial paper ratings were placed under review for
possible downgrade.
Although the implants bring in only 1 per cent of Dow Corning's annual
sales, there is increasing concern that the company may be flooded with
lawsuits as the controversy over the devices grows.
While Moody's downgraded Corning's long-term senior debt rating to single-A2
from single-A1, the rating agency left Dow Chemical's standing unchanged.
Dow Corning said the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) had asked for specific
new documents on its implants. The company disputed that the documents were
'new' and said it had already released this information to the FDA.
Dow Chemical, the second biggest US chemicals group, says it will take a
one-time pre-tax charge of Dollars 370m against fourth-quarter earnings. The
charge will push the company into the red for the period.
