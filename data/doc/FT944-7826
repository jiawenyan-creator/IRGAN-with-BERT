FT  23 NOV 94 / Cabinet probes 'smart cards'
The cabinet has set up a sub-committee to investigate the potential use of
'smart cards' by government departments.
The sub-committee, chaired by Mr David Hunt, the prime minister's chief
cabinet troubleshooter, includes ministers representing most of the big
government departments.
Several departments are reviewing the potential uses of smart cards, with
which individuals could carry personal details such as health records and
benefit entitlements.
The terms of reference require the sub-committee to ensure a co-ordinated
approach to the developing technology of card systems, which allow
information to be stored electronically on cards about the same size as a
credit card.
It is also required to take account of 'the impact on the individual
citizen', reflecting cabinet sensitivity about opposition to smart cards by
civil liberties groups.
The most widespread use of such cards in other countries is to operate
electronic 'road-pricing' systems, under which drivers pay for access to
restricted areas.
