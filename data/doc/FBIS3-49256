  [Text] Knin, Jan 6 (TANJUG) -- Croatia is preparing a new 
offensive on the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), the general 
staff of the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) army warned Thursday. 
  The army statement said the Croatian army is reinforcing its 
positions, regrouping and bringing new troops into central 
Adriatic hinterland. The statement adds that the Christmas 
truce between the forces of the RSK and Croatia agreed at talks 
in Brussels on December 22 is mostly holding. 
  The Serbs declared the republic of Serb Krajina in 1991 in 
areas of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, where they are 
a majority population, in response to the secessionist policy of 
the Croatian authorities and their attempt to downgrade the 
Serbs from a constituent nation to a national minority. 
  Because of the ensuing clashes between the Krajina Serbs and 
the Croatian authorities, who do not recognize the RSK, Krajina 
was declared a UN Protected Area (UNPA). Nonetheless the 
Croatian army on three occasions, in June 1992 and in January 
and September last year, mounted offensives on the RSK killing 
and expelling the civilian population, looting, burning and 
destroying their homes.
