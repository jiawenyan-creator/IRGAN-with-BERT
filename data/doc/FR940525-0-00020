ANADA 200143 is as a generic copy of Agri-Bio's NADA 139190. ANADA 200143 is approved as of May
25, 1994. The regulations are amended in 558.550 

Salinomycin

 (21 CFR 558.550) to reflect the approval. 
This approval is for use of single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds. Roxarsone is
a Category II drug which, as provided in 558.4, requires an approved Form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated
feed. Therefore, the use of salinomycin, roxarsone, and bacitracin zinc Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated
feeds as provided in ANADA 200143 requires an approved Form FDA 1900. 
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and 514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
123, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(ii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
