  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- China plans to choose 
the best tourist cities annually from now on as an effort to 
improve the quality of services in the country's tourist 
industry. 
  "It is also aimed at upgrading China's reputation in tourist 
service both in China and the world," said a spokesman for the 
State Tourism Administration (STA). 
  The tourist cities will be appraised in terms of service 
quality, tourist response and environment, whose specific 
criteria will be published by the administration, he noted. 
  The spokesman said that a system for publicizing service 
quality will be established covering all the nation's tourist 
management bodies, with letters of complaints from tourists made 
public. 
  The bureau will also run a special program, "investigations 
of service quality hot spots," to encourage the public and news 
media to supervise service quality, the spokesman said. 
  The official said the service quality criteria will embrace 
the service offered, enterprise management and tourism 
facilities. 
  The STA also set up a special committee to formulate rules 
and regulations in order to upgrade the means of transport, 
tourist sites, foods, shopping and recreation, he said. 
  The official said professional ethics is "an important 
factor" for appraisal.
