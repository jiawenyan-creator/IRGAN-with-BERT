  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said today that Japan would cooperate with the 
United States to settle serious trade and economic issues in the 
spirit of mutual trust. 
  In a speech on policy to the Japanese Diet (parliament), 
Hosokawa also pledged to foster forward-looking relations with 
the international community in the coming years. 
  The statement comes after the failure to reach an accord on 
trade issues in last months summit talks with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. Japan rejected U.S. demands to set numerical 
targets on the country's imports of U.S. products. 
  However, Hosokawa told the Diet that he believed Japan must 
take effective measures to achieve a highly significant decrease 
in its current account surplus over the medium term, while 
firmly adhering to free-trade principles. 
  Commenting on Sino-Japanese ties, the premier noted that the 
two countries had made major strides forward over the last 20 
years and more. 
  "I intend to work to have the cooperative relationship 
between Japan and China contribute even more to the 
international community," said Hosokawa, who is scheduled to 
visit China later this month. 
  The prime minister stressed that Japan would work to achieve 
stable and open cooperative relations with the Asian-Pacific 
region where economic development is most encouraging.
