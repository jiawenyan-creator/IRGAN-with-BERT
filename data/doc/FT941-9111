FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Howard recovers to Pounds 37,000
Shares of Howard Holdings yesterday firmed 4p to 29p, after the property
development and plant hire group returned to the black at the interim stage.
On turnover of Pounds 3m, which compared with sales of Pounds 1.47m last
time and almost matched the Pounds 3.07m achieved in the group's last full
year, pre-tax profits for the six months to end-October amounted to Pounds
37,370, against a Pounds 197,771 loss.
The outcome also reflected reduced interest charges of Pounds 152,739
(Pounds 212,072).
Mr John Howard, chairman, said the property development side 'now appears to
be reaping the financial benefit of a change in emphasis from building flats
to houses'.
After a nil tax charge, earnings per share emerged at 0.15p (losses of
0.75p).
