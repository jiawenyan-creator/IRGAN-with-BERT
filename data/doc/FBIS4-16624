  [Text] Chairman of the Belarusian Parliament Mechyslaw Hryb 
told journalists in Minsk Monday that during the talks with 
Russian President Yeltsin in Moscow late last week the two sides 
reached the understanding that the signed Belarusian-Russian 
documents (on the unification of monetary systems) should be 
strictly in line with the Constitutions of the two countries. 
  Hryb said that changes may be introduced in the text of 
Article 5 of the Belarusian-Russian agreement to avoid changes 
in the Belarusian Constitution. 
  In line with the existing Belarusian Constitution, the 
Republic's national bank is a the only body with the right to 
shape monetary policy independently. 
  In line with the Russian-Belarusian agreement, these 
functions are carried out by the Russian Central Bank under 
conditions of a single monetary system. 
  Asked by INTERFAX to assess the initiative by Kazakh 
President Nazarbayev on the creation of a Euro-Asian union, Hryb 
said that so far the idea had not been discussed officially. 
  Meanwhile, the CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya in 
an 
interview with Interfax on the same day in Minsk said that 
Nazarbayev's idea suggests the thought for closer unity among 
the CIS countries, though the European model of the community is 
prefered by many Commonwealth states. Korotchenya believes that 
it will take time for CIS states to agree to Nazarbayev's idea. 
  He did not rule out the probability of the fact that with 
time the leaders of the CIS states may return to the idea of a 
Euro-Asian union.
