FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper leads LME metals to
firmer ground - Market Report
Significant underlying demand for COPPER uncovered by a dip yesterday
morning gave encouragement to other London Metal Exchange contracts, which
closed mostly higher on the day.
'Everyone wants to buy copper on dips . . . there's a widespread feeling
that the copper price could move up strongly in September,' a trader
commented.
Early dealer selling and liquidation and an LME warehouse stocks rise put
copper on the defensive in early trading and the three months delivery
position fell to Dollars 2,370 a tonne. But at the close it was at Dollars
2,390, up Dollars 7 a tonne.
Traders said the early sell-off in copper reflected volatility created by
the market adjusting to a new, lower, short-term trading range.
ALUMINIUM was also undermined by a stocks rise, three months metal dipping
to Dollars 1,477 a tonne in early trade. A steady recovery for the rest of
the day triggered shortcovering in after hours trading, however, which
prompted a burst up to Dollars 1,504, up Dollars 19 from Monday.
Traders warned that selling was likely to be attracted above Dollars 1,500,
though a break above Dollars 1,510 could signal fresh gains.
ZINC remained underpinned by trade buying and rallied to the top end of its
narrow trading range late in the day. From a morning low of Dollars 963 a
tonne the three months price rallied to Dollars 969, up Dollars 5 on the
day.
European precious metals markets remained quiet as New York, where most of
the recent moves have started, failed to offer direction.
In London, GOLD closed at Dollars 382 a troy ounce, down 70 cents, while
SILVER eased 2 cents to Dollars 5.22 1/2 an ounce.
