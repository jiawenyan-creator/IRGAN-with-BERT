FT  31 JUL 93 / Turkey's bank chief resigns
TURKEY'S respected Central Bank Governor Rusdu Saracoglu announced his
resignation yesterday after a long policy dispute with Mrs Tansu Ciller, the
new prime minister, John Murray Brown writes from Istanbul.
The departure of Mr Saracoglu, a pivotal figure in the country's economic
progress of the 1980s, will inevitably raise new doubts about Turkey's
commitment to a policy of stable prices.
Mrs Ciller has criticised the governor for his support of high interest
rates to protect the currency at a time when exports are falling and the
trade gap widening.
However, Mrs Ciller's failure to curb the fiscal deficit had forced her to
turn increasingly to the Central Bank, much to the governor's chagrin, for
short-term advances - thus fuelling monetary expansion.
In 1992, the Bank abandoned its monetary targeting and adopting a more
limited strategy to dampen exchange rate volatility, vital if Turkey is to
bring inflation down from around 60 per cent.
Turkish bankers yesterday played down the impact on the markets, although
the timing, coming just before the weekend, suggests the government is keen
to limit the damage.
