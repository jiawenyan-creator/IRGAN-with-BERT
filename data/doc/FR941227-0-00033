 

Adoption of the Amendment 


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


39.13 

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 398849 (59 FR 11531, 
March 11, 1994), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 399100 to read as follows:





942604 Jetstream Aircraft Limited: 

Amendment 399100. Docket 
94NM25AD. Supersedes AD 932510, Amendment 398849.

 



Applicability: 

Model 4101 airplanes having constructors numbers 41004 and subsequent; on which Modification JM41307A or JM41307B
has not been installed previously; certificated in any category. 





Note 1: 

This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding 
applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to
the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of
the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (e) to request
approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe
condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should
include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no
case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this
AD.

 



Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could result in reduced controllability of the
airplane, accomplish the following: 
(a) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 932510, 
Amendment 398849), perform a detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the bearings in the aileron quadrant
in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control, in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin
J41A27026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994. 
(1) If no damaged bearing is found, repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days. 
(2) If any damaged bearing is found, prior to further flight, replace the damaged bearing with a new bearing in accordance
with the service bulletin, and repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days. 


Note 2: 

Paragraph (a) of this AD restates the requirement for an initial and repetitive inspections contained in paragraph
(a) of AD 932510. Therefore, for operators that have previously accomplished at least the initial inspection
in accordance with AD 932510, paragraph (a) of this AD requires that the next scheduled inspection be
performed within 7 days after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (a) of AD 932510.



(b) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 932510, 
Amendment 398849), adjust the aileron secondary stop in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control system
in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41A27026, Revision
1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994.
