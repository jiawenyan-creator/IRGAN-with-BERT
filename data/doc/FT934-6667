FT  24 NOV 93 / School sixth forms achieve best A-levels
Schools appear to achieve a higher standard in academic exams than sixth
form colleges, government A-level figures show today.
But the complete data on all the A-level exams taken in the state sector,
available for the first time, shows that deprived areas are capable of
strong academic performance.
Candidates attempting two or more A-levels - the necessary requirement for
gaining a university place - fared significantly better in schools than in
tertiary colleges.
Using the University Central Admission System's A-level points system, where
an A grade is worth 10 and an E is worth two, candidates in English schools
managed 12.85 on average, compared with 10.19 at colleges.
When all state schools and colleges were ranked according to their average
A-level points score only 10 colleges man-aged a place in the top 200.
English education has shifted towards sixth form colleges over the last few
years. Local authorities can save money by closing several small school
sixth forms and creating one large tertiary college, a practice encouraged
by the Audit Commission.
But comparing schools and colleges is difficult, as many colleges offering
A-levels regard the exams as a sideline to more important mainstream
vocational training.
When the FT analysed the results of candidates attempting fewer than two
A-levels - who are presumably taking them as a supplement to vocational
training as this would not be enough for university entrance  - the gap was
much narrower, with school pupils gaining 2.76 points on average, compared
with 2.70 at colleges. Further, schools tend to be more selective than
further education colleges, who have born the brunt in the recent expansion
in children staying in school after 16.
The size of sixth form colleges also has to be taken into account. High
A-level averages are harder to sustain over a large number of pupils.
Thus the performance of Colchester's sixth form college is very strong. It
averaged 17.2 A-level points (in 43 different A-level subjects) over 707
pupils, and even managed to gain 15 places at Oxford and Cambridge in spite
of the presence in the town of two top grammar schools. The college offers
43 different A-levels subjects and a range of extra-curricular activities.
Also, A-level comparisons can now be made between local education
authorities.
The three authorities which have converted entirely to tertiary colleges
were all above average - Bury in Lancashire had a points score of 13.80,
Richmond, London had 13.40 and Harrow 12.30.
The close link between social deprivation and academic underperformance is
much weaker once pupils pass compulsory school age.
Sheffield's top-performing A-level score (15.91) indicates this strongly.
But the poorest performing A-level authorities - Southwark (5.63), Newham
(6.35), and Tower Hamlets (7.69), are among the 10 most deprived English
authorities on government figures.
