  [Text] The Zimbabwe-Cuba Friendship Association today 
expressed full support to negotiations being carried out by U.S. 
Congressman Charles Rangel, a Democratic Party representative, 
seeking the lifting of the economic blockade against Cuba. 
  The association sent a message to Rangel who this week 
submitted a bill to Congress demanding the end of the inhumane 
U.S. policy against Cuba.
