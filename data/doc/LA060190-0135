FOR THE RECORD 
Malpractice verdict -- An article on May 17 incorrectly said Dr. Randolph H. 
Noble of Encino had been ordered to pay part of a jury award of more than $1 
million in a malpractice case. The jury found Noble 30% responsible for the 
death of a patient following surgery at Rancho Encino Hospital, but he had been 
dropped from the case in a pretrial settlement. No damages were assessed 
against him by the jury.
