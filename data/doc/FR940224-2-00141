First Union National Bank of North Carolina; Notice of Intent to Establish Three Operating Subsidiaries Which Will
Acquire the Partnership Interests of Lieber  Company and the Assets and Liabilities of Evergreen Asset Management
Corporation. [OCC Control No. 93ML08023.] 
Mellon Bank, N.A.; Notice of Intent to Establish Certain Operating Subsidiaries Which Will Acquire Most of the Assets,
Operations, and Activities of the Dreyfus Corporation. [OCC Control No. 93NE08043.] 



First Union National Bank of North Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina (First Union) filed a notice with the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on November 1, 1993 (First Union Notice), pursuant to 12 CFR 5.34,

1

 advising the OCC of First Union's intent to establish three operating subsidiaries. The First Union Notice describes
First Union's intent to acquire, through First Union's proposed operating subsidiaries, two affiliated investment
advisory companies, Lieber  Company, a New York general partnership, and Evergreen Asset Management Corp.,
a Delaware corporation, (collectively referred to as ``Lieber'').

</FOOTNAME>
The OCC's regulation concerning operating subsidiaries, 5.34, provides that national banks may establish
or acquire operating subsidiaries to engage in activities that are part of or incidental to the business of banking.
Where a national bank intends to engage in new activities in an operating subsidiary, it must notify the OCC. The OCC
reviews the bank's proposal to determine whether the proposed activities are legally permissible for a national
bank's operating subsidiary and to ensure that the proposal is consistent with prudent banking principles and OCC
policy which considers customer needs and fair treatment. 
</FOOTNOTE>


Mellon Bank, N.A., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Mellon) filed a notice with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC) on December 30, 1993 (Mellon Notice), pursuant to 5.34, advising the OCC of Mellon's intent to establish
certain operating subsidiaries. The Mellon Notice describes Mellon's intent to acquire, through operating subsidiaries,
most of the assets, operations and activities of The Dreyfus Corporation, a New York corporation (Dreyfus). 
The First Union and Mellon Notices propose activities for operating subsidiaries that have been approved for national
banks. The magnitude of the Mellon transaction, however, is significant. Because the First Union Notice involves
the acquisition of entities that engage in activities similar to Dreyfus, the OCC considers it appropriate to consolidate
the two notices for the purpose of soliciting public comment. 
Although notices filed pursuant to 5.34 do not require public comment under existing OCC regulations, the
OCC has reserved the right, pursuant to 5.2(b), to adopt procedures different from those specifically provided
in its corporate applications regulations if the OCC deems such actions appropriate in acting on a particular application
or filing. The OCC considers it appropriate to seek comments from the public concerning the First Union and Mellon
Notices. 
First Union has assets of approximately $20 billion. Both First Union and its holding company, First Union Corporation
(FTU), which has assets of approximately $71 billion, already have substantial involvement in trust and investment
activities, including mutual fund administration, brokerage, master trust and custody, institutional investment
management and personal trust. FTU currently administers approximately $43 billion in assets and manages approximately
$27 billion in assets. The Evergreen family of 15 mutual funds currently has assets of approximately $3.6 billion.
Lieber principally provides investment advice and administrative services to the Evergreen funds, several large
institutional investors and a number of high net worth individuals. The First Union Notice details the functions
currently performed by Lieber for its clients. 
Mellon has assets of approximately $28 billion. Both Mellon and its holding company, Mellon Bank Corporation (MBC),
which has assets of approximately $36 billion, already have substantial involvement in trust and investment activities,
including mutual fund administration, brokerage, master trust and custody, institutional investment management
and personal trust. MBC currently administers approximately $615 billion in assets and manages approximately $135
billion in assets. Dreyfus, the sixth-largest mutual fund company in the United States, provides investment advice
and administrative services to over 130 mutual funds with approximately $80 billion in assets. 
The Mellon Notice details the function of each of the existing Dreyfus corporations and subsidiaries and sets forth
which entities will be acquired as operating subsidiaries of Mellon, which will be acquired as operating subsidiaries
of MBC, and which will be sold or liquidated. Pursuant to Mellon's proposal, several of the Dreyfus entities will become
operating subsidiaries of Mellon. The Dreyfus operations currently include subsidiaries which provide investment
advisory, brokerage, and administrative services to registered investment companies which are known to the public
as the Dreyfus family of mutual funds. 
The OCC invites public comment on the First Union and Mellon Notices in order to provide interested parties with an
opportunity to express their views concerning the proposed acquisitions that may assist the OCC in making a final
determination concerning the First Union and Mellon Notices. 
The First Union and Mellon Notices and any public comments submitted are available for inspection by appointment
at the OCC headquarters in Washington, DC. Appointments may be made by calling the Disclosure Unit at the telephone
number listed in the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this request for public comment. Photocopies of the First Union and Mellon Notices and any public comments
submitted are available upon written request from the Disclosure Unit at the address indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this request for public comment. Pursuant to 12 CFR 4.17, a fee may be assessed to cover duplication costs.


Interested persons are encouraged to express their views in writing to the OCC concerning the First Union and Mellon
Notices.
