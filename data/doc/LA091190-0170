FAILING BANKS MAY DRAIN NATIONAL INSURANCE FUND 
The nation's bank deposit insurance funds could be wiped out by losses that 
banks are experiencing from declining real estate values and risky investments, 
congressional auditors said today. 
At least 35 of the nation's 200 largest banks are likely to fail or require 
assistance over the next year at a cost to the government of $4.4 billion to 
$6.3 billion, the General Accounting Office said in a report to the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
"Not since its birth during the Great Depression has the federal system of 
deposit insurance for commercial banks faced such a period of danger and 
uncertainty," Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher said. "We have a lot of 
situations out there that could wipe the fund out." 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. already faces losses of $2 billion this 
year atop losses of $5.1 billion in 1988 and 1989, the accounting office said. 
In addition, it said, the FDIC has a contingent liability of $8 billion for 
troubled loans now held by the acquirers of already-failed banks in Texas.
