SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This block management area (BMA) includes 92,810 acres. Public land is administered by the BLM, Judith Resource Area,
Lewistown District. This designation is the result of a cooperative effort among private landowners, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Montana Department of State Lands and the BLM.
The purpose of this designation is to prevent damage to soil, vegetation and scenic resources, to open additional
private and state lands for hunting and to reduce landowner/recreationist conflicts so as to provide a higher quality
hunt. 



The off-road vehicle limitation area is located in northern Petroleum County, Montana. It includes all public lands
administered by the BLM north of the Crooked Creek and Dunn Ridge roads. 

Hunting within the described block will be subject to the following rules. 

1. All off-road vehicle travel is prohibited. 

2. All roads not shown on this map or signed as open, are closed to motorized vehicle use with the exclusive exception
of retrieving downed big game. Big game retrieval is allowed between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. daily on open or closed roads.
Prior to or after these hours, motorized vehicles are not permitted on closed roads or off roads. No off-road vehicle
use will be allowed on any lands within this BMA. 

3. All public land in this management area is open to walk in hunting. 

4. The private land in this management area is open to walk in hunting, except around residential areas, shipping pastures
and portions of the Weingart, Iverson, Sikveland and Square Butte Grazing Association Ranches (these are individually
signed at reasonable access and boundary points). 

5. Camping on private land requires landowner permission. 

6. Camping is permitted on public land (14-day stay limit) within 100 yards of open roads. Direct access by motor vehicle
is permitted to and from campsites using the most direct route to avoid damage to soils and vegetation. Such camping
is also allowed within a reasonable distance down closed roads, after obtaining a special use permit issued by the
Judith Resource Area. 

7. Use of state land is governed by the Department of State Land (DSL) regulations. There are four major areas where
these rules differ from those used in the rest of this BMA. These include: (1) A DSL recreational use license is required
for general recreational use; (2) Camping is allowed within 200 feet of an open road and is limited to two days only;
(3) No open fires or fireworks are allowed; and (4) Horses cannot be kept on state lands overnight. 

8. Outfitters and other recreationists must use certified weed free hay on BLM and DSL land for their livestock.
