FT  13 FEB 92 / Observer: On the rocks
The icicles were almost audible when Ernest Saunders, former chief executive
of Guinness, turned up on Radio Four's Today programme to discuss the
collapse of the Guinness II trial.
Before the interview Saunders had been asked to wait in the tiny hospitality
room at Broadcasting House with another guest already there. His face
blanched markedly when he opened the door to find Barbara Mills who, as
director of the Serious Fraud Office, was the power behind his 10-month
sojourn at Ford Open Prison.
The surprise was mutual. Carelessly or cunningly, Radio Four had told
neither of them that the other was to be there.
