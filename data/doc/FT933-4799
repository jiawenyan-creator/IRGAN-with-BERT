FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Whitbread sells Lansbury inns to private
buyer
Whitbread has sold 15 of its Lansbury hotels to Countryside Coaching Inns, a
newly-formed private company.
The sale, for an undisclosed sum, is part of Whitbread's reshuffling of its
hotel portfolio. The food, drinks and leisure group says it intends to sell
a further eight Lansbury hotels, leaving it with 19.
The remaining hotels are 50 to 60 room three-star establishments. The hotels
sold and those still up for sale do not fall into this category.
The group also has its Travel Inn brand of budget hotels, as well as Country
Club hotels, which it markets as conference venues with sporting facilities.
