FT  15 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Appeal to Congress for unfair trade
damages
MR CHARLES CORRY, chairman of USX Corporation, yesterday urged Congress to
pass legislation giving American companies the right to seek damages against
foreign companies which employ illegal trade practices in the US market,
writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Testifying before the Senate banking committee on US-Japanese trade, Mr
Corry called President Bush's controversial trade mission to Japan 'a step
in the right direction', but Japan, he said, must commit itself to trade
deficit reduction.
Senator Don Riegle, chairman of the banking committee, is sponsoring the
same proposal introduced in the House by Congressman Richard Gephardt, the
House majority leader.
It would require Japan to reduce its trade deficit 20 per cent over each of
the next five years, or face retaliation against its exports of cars and car
parts.
