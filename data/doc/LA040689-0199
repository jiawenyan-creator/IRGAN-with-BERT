SIKH RADICALS KILL 9 IN PUNJAB 
Sikh extremists killed nine people in northern Punjab today, including a Sikh 
priest dragged from his temple and hanged from a tree. 
Twelve members of the Bhindranwale Tiger Force of Khalistan stormed the home of 
Buta Singh in Jaspal and accused him of being a police informer, police said. 
Buta Singh was among 104 Sikhs freed from jail March 6 under a new government 
policy of placating moderate Sikhs. They had been held four years without trial 
after their capture in a bloody 1984 army assault to oust armed Sikh radicals 
in Amritsar's Golden Temple. 
"He begged for mercy and even told them that he was one of the Jodhpur 
detainees who fought the battle for Khalistan," said Buta Singh's widow, 
Balwinder Kaur.
