BRIEFLY 
Pickens Walks Out: Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. and 50 other Americans 
stalked out of the annual shareholders meeting of Koito Manufacturing Co. in 
Tokyo after the Japanese auto parts company refused to give him a seat on its 
board or answer his questions. 
Pickens, with a 26.4% stake in Koito, sought at the meeting to win approval for 
seven proposals, including four seats on the 20-member board and an increase in 
the company dividend. A majority of shareholders voted down all seven items. 
Pickens is Koito's largest shareholder.
