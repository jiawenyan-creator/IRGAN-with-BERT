FT  03 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Benefits
of traffic curbs doubted
SHORT-TERM measures to reduce urban pollution by restricting traffic have
little or no effect on levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is blamed for the
rapid rise in asthma cases.
During the London smog of December 1991 people were asked not to make
unnecessary journeys. But Mr Derek Elsom, reader in geography at Oxford
Brookes University, said this type of restriction does little to reduce the
pollutant because the limiting factor is ozone, which is at much lower
levels than nitrogen oxides.
