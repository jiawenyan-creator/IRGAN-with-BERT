  [Text] Emomali Rakhmanov, head of the Tajik state, has 
described the murder of Mayonsho Nazarshoyev, the deputy 
chairman of Tajikistan's Council of Ministers, as a planned 
political act. He said this today at a mourning ceremony of 
farewell that took place outside the national parliament 
building. The Tajik leader stressed that, by this terrorist 
act, committed on the night of 10-11 March, certain extremist 
forces had reckoned on causing fear and confusion among the 
people of the republic, and on frustrating the peace efforts of 
the country's leadership to attain civil peace and national 
reconciliation. But they miscalculated, Emomali Rakhmanov 
declared. 
  Meanwhile, ITAR-TASS reported, citing trustworthy sources, 
two persons have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of the 
deputy prime minister of Tajikistan.
