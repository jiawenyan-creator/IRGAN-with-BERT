FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: All you need is love . . . and dress
sense
Sir, Bravo, Clement Crisp (Arts: 'The decline and fall of elegance', July
18)] In my stalls seat at the Royal Opera House (not paid for by corporate
hospitality) I have rubbed thighs and shoulders with a man wearing shorts
with an Hawaiian shirt.
