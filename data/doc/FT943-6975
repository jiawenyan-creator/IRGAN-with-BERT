FT  25 AUG 94 / World News in Brief: Maradona given 15-month suspension
Soccer star Diego Maradona received a 15-month suspension for taking banned
stimulants during the World Cup. The penalty could prove the end of the
career of the 33-year-old Argentine, who is widely regarded as the best
player of his generation. World soccer's governing body FIFA also fined
Maradona SFr20,000 (Dollars 15,400) for taking the 'cocktail' of five
derivatives of ephedrine, traces of which were found in a random drug test
after Argentina's victory over Nigeria on July 25.
