FT  29 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Volumes in derivative markets died away on Friday although futures dealers
were becoming increasingly jittery ahead of the new year which is expected
to see some massive expiries in traded options, writes Peter John.
The contract on the FT-SE 100, which expires in March, opened at 3,417 -
slightly lower than Thursday's close - but was squeezed up to 3,435 as
dealers attempted to unwind positions.
The spread between March and the underlying market widened to 24 points, a
slight premium over its estimated fair value - the figure which takes in the
cost of carrying minus dividends and is currently calculated at about 20
points. Turnover reached 2,129 lots.
The calm was deceptive. Leading life assurers are believed to have taken on
significant hedge positions before the stock market's most recent 300-point
rally. Many of these positions would make money until the stock market hits
3,350 at which point they become worthless.
The hedges, often puts which give the holder the right to sell the market at
a fixed price and time, will expire on the last two trading days of the the
year and that expiry is predicted to lead to volatile trading in the
underlying and derivative markets, including the traded options sector.
Options turnover on Friday was slightly higher than might have been expected
with both Trafalgar House, which is in the process of heavy restructuring
following shock losses recently, and Reuters Holdings seeing more than 1,000
lots changing hands, the equivalent of one million shares. Total options
turnover was 17,367 lots by the early midday close.
