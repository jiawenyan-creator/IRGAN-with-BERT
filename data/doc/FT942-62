FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan in move to lift Indian
presence
J. P. Morgan has taken a minority stake in a recently formed Indian fund
management venture, signalling its intention to gain a greater presence in
the country's fast-growing capital markets.
The US bank has acquired a 40 per cent interest in the investment management
arm of Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a privately
owned development bank.
The fund management company was set up last year following deregulation of
the Indian mutual fund industry to allow private-sector companies to compete
for investments.
The joint venture company will initially sell mutual funds (or unit trusts)
to individual investors in India, although investment in the funds will also
be open to non-resident Indians and foreign institutions who are registered
with the local authorities.
Morgan said that this represented the first step in a long-term strategy to
become a strong domestic money manager in India.
Morgan and ICICI already have an investment banking joint venture, which was
launched last year.
