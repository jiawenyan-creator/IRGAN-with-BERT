FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: ITC ruling batters US steel
group share price
SHARES in USX-US Steel, the Pittsburgh-based steel unit of USX, yesterday
plunged Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 after an International Trade
Commission decision on foreign competition turned out less favourable to US
producers than expected.
The ITC rejected about half the Commerce Department's penalties against
foreign steel producers, and said 'dumped' and subsidised steel had not
injured American producers. The US steel industry was disappointed with the
ruling, which followed the department's assesment in June that foreign
companies were importing products at rates below fair market value.
The ITC decision came as USX-US Steel reported a second-quarter net loss of
Dollars 333m, or Dollars 5.66 cents a share. This included an after-tax
charge of Dollars 403m related to anti-trust litigation against its former
railway subsidiary, the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad.
A year earlier, the company had restated net income of Dollars 2m, or 3
cents a share.
Stripping out the one-time charge, the company said operating income rose to
Dollars 56m from a restated Dollars 34m a year earlier.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX Corporation, the consolidated parent
company, attributed the improvement of its steel group to firmer industry
conditions. Sales in the quarter rose to Dollars 1.43bn from Dollars 1.27bn.
For the six months, the steel group had a net loss of Dollars 320m, or
Dollars 5.49, against a deficit of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 26.03.
LTV, the US steel group which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, says a US appeals court has ruled in its favour, upholding a
lower court ruling in a lawsuit against USX's former Bessemer and Lake Erie
Railroad unit.
The award stems from a 1982 lawsuit charging that some railroads had
monopolised dock handling and inland transportation of iron ore to steel
mills.
