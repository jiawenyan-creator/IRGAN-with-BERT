FT  13 MAY 94 / Rail drug tests yield convictions
Random drug and alcohol checks on British Rail and London Underground
employees led to 60 cases where tests proved positive or where samples were
not supplied in the first year of their introduction, a report said
yesterday.
The tests, introduced in December 1992, had led to 16 convictions up to
February this year and 46 other prosecutions were in progress.
The test record emerges in a study on alcohol and drug policies in the
workplace undertaken by Incomes Data Services, an independent research body.
The costs to employers of alcohol abuse is estimated at Pounds 960m a year
for long-term sickness absence, said the study which added that alcohol was
blamed for a fifth of workplace accidents.
An increasing number of employers were seeing a business case for weaning
employees off alcohol and other drugs, the report said.
