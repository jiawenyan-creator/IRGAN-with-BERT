IN COURT 
A summary of Southern California-related business litigation developments 
during the week of Dec. 18. 
Copyright Suit Filed Over Hip Replacement: Zimmer Inc., a Warsaw, Ind., 
company, filed a patent infringement suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles 
against Techmedica of Calabasas Tuesday, charging that the company copied its 
patented hip prosthesis. Techmedica makes custom hip replacements, which Zimmer 
claims are based on its patented design. Clyde Pratt, president of Techmedica 
said, "We have reviewed their patent and feel that their claim is baseless."
