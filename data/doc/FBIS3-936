<F P=106> [Article by Gert van der Westhuizen: "White Wolves Declare </F>
27 April Day of Resistance"] 
  [Text] The White Wolves have declared 27 April to be a day 
of resistance and have called upon members "to hail" the day 
with acts of insubordination. In addition, they plan to take 
down National Party (NP) and African National Congress (ANC) 
posters, boycott Coca-Cola, and delay traffic on highways in the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area. According to 
the February edition of BOEREBRANDWAG, their official 
newsletter, all parties and organizations taking part in the 
election must be viewed as enemies and traitors to the "Boer 
nation." The White Wolves feel that "Boers" can only participate 
in an election if it is held exclusively for "Boer compatriots" 
in their own state. 
  At the same time, White Wolves members are being encouraged 
to display banners with "Boer slogans" at sports events. The 
four-colored flag [of the old South African Republic] is to be 
hoisted in the organization's various districts as well. Readers 
of the newsletter are "invited" this month to pile up stones in 
front of the doors of "hostile elements" in their districts. 
Coca-Cola will also be boycotted from the beginning of this 
month to 1 April because Afrikaans is no longer being printed on 
its soft-drink containers. This part of the White Wolves' 
resistance plans already began on 22 January when empty "Coke 
bottles" were smashed in front of Coca-Cola plants in Hercules 
and Pretoria. 
  And if everything goes according to plan, the "communist 
government" is going to lose a lot of money in the next three 
months because the White Wolves are going to delay traffic along 
"strategic routes" by driving at a maximum of 60 km per hour on 
various days on highways in the PWV area.
