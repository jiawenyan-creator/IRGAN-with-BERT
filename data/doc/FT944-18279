FT  04 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Telecom pressures Nikkei
as Taipei remains at high
A further and accelerated decline in Japan Telecom depressed market
sentiment and, in spite of a moderate rise for the Nikkei 225 average,
trading volume registered its third lowest figure this year, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 86.22 firmer at 19,650.03 after a high for the day of
19,672.53 in the morning session and a low of 19,571.01 in the afternoon.
Share prices improved on a higher futures market, but most investors
remained inactive.
Volume totalled 158m shares, against 225m. Dealers and public funds held the
sidelines, and corporate investors were also absent. Many brokers, hurt by
the low trading activity, are hoping for some activity over the next few
weeks. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities commented: 'It could be the calm
before the storm. It is time share prices went either up or down.'
The Topix index gained 2.11 at 1,579.00, while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.56
to 288.95, but declining issues led rises by 471 to 428, with 248 stocks
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.67 firmer at 1,296.63.
The decline of Japan Telecom to a new low since its listing on September 6
depressed investor confidence. The stock was finally Y110,000 off at Y3.87m
after falling to a low of Y3.83m.
The stock's performance is crucial to investor confidence ahead of the
listing of Japan Tobacco shares later this month. Payments for the stock by
investors who won the lottery for the public offering are due to be made a
week from today; but traders expect many investors to waive the purchase if
Japan Telecom keeps on falling.
Japan Airlines slipped Y12 to Y735 following reports that the company will
record Y45bn in unrealised losses in the first half due to forward exchange
rate contracts.
Automobile shares gained ground on strong car sales. The Japan Automobile
Dealers Association said car sales in September rose by 6.4 per cent from a
year earlier, their fourth consecutive gain. Toyota Motor advanced Y20 to
Y2,050 and Honda Motor added Y20 at Y1,670.
Mitsubishi Electric rose Y11 to Y713 after an upward revision of its
earnings estimate for the current year, while Mitsubishi Oil put on Y30 at
Y1,100 on projections of doubled profits from a year earlier.
Former state owned companies were lower. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
receded Y9,000 to Y871,000 and East Japan Railway Y7,000 to Y478,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 11.15 to 21,996.28 in volume of 19m
shares.
