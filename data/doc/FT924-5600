FT  26 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Austrian vans get clear road
THE European Community is likely to lift the threat of import duties on
Austrian-made Chrysler vans, following a compromise between Vienna and the
European Commission on reducing state aid to the US manufacturer.
Austria has agreed to cut the level of aid to Chrysler's plant in Graz from
33.3 per cent to 14.4 per cent of the investment. The Commission yesterday
approved the compromise which will now be put to EC member states.
Austrian officials said Chrysler would not have to repay any of the aid, but
a final tranche will be paid only if the company goes ahead with the final
phase of construction.
The imposition of duties would have unleashed a diplomatic storm between the
EC and Austria, which has applied to join the Community. Chrysler had also
threatened legal action against the Community.
Brussels had wanted aid to the Sch5.6bn (Pounds 328m) plant to be brought
down to 8 per cent, in line with rules on state aid for carmakers in the
wealthiest Community countries.
Its demands were made under the 1972 free trade agreement with Austria,
which outlaws subsidies which distort competition in the EC.
