FT  06 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Deserving shelter project
Sir, I read with interest the article by Andrew Taylor highlighting the
problems of obtaining empty premises as temporary winter shelter for the
homeless ('Shelter is sought for winter homeless', September 28). Allied
Domecq (formerly Allied-Lyons) was very glad to have been able to provide
some accommodation for this scheme over the past couple of years. Indeed, we
very much regret that we are unable to do so again in 1994.
I recognise that many companies may have misgivings about lending their
premises for such a project. However, I can assure them that the shelter at
our premises was extremely well organised and any problems in making the
building habitable were minimised with help from Crash (Construction
Industry Relief &amp; Assistance for the Single Homeless).
I would urge the leaders of business in London to trawl their organisations
to find suitable premises that can be offered for this deserving scheme. If
anyone wishes to learn more about our experience, I would be delighted to
hear from them.
