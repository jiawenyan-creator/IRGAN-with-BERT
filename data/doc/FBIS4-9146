<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj </F>
by Mimmo Lombezzi in Belgrade; date not given: "We Will Attack 
Italy With Our Missiles"] 
  [Text] Vojislav Seselj is in Belgrade. He is the leader of 
the Serbian Radical Party, the extremist faction of the Serbian 
nationalists, and is the political referent and ideologue for 
the chetnik terrorists who are fighting on the Bosnian front. 
This interview is with "Studio Aperto" [news bulletin on Italia 
1 TV channel]. 
  [Lombezzi] Yeltsin's envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, has said that 
Russia must not support a group of Serbian extremists that is 
dragging the other Serbs into war. 
  [Seselj] Vitaliy Churkin is applying American politics in 
the 
Balkans. We do not care what he said, Churkin asked [Serbian 
President] Milosevic to destroy the Serbian Radical Party and 
Milosevic said that he will do all that he can to satisfy him. 
However, I am telling you that we are indestructible. And that 
neither Churkin nor Milosevic can do anything. 
  [Lombezzi] It seems that NATO is planning other raids. What 
solutions do you propose for the Muslim enclaves and for Gorazde? 
  [Seselj] I would advise them to make their pilots fly a 
little lower so that they can see the Serbian posts and so that 
even ours can see them better through the antiaircraft finders. 
They will end up like the British aircraft that was shot down a 
few days ago. The Serbs are certainly not scared of an air 
attack; we have already won this war. The Americans can get as 
angry as they please but the territories that we have taken over 
will not be returned. 
  [Lombezzi] Some right-wing parties in Italy would like to 
rediscuss the borders of Istria and Dalmatia... 
  [Seselj] I personally would like to see that what was once 
Italian -- that is Zara and some islands in Dalmatia, Istria, 
Fiume, and Carnaro -- will be returned to Italy. Hundreds of 
thousands of Italians were chased away from Croatia. According 
to the principle of justice all this must be returned to Italy. 
We were very happy when we heard that [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi won, I think he is a real patriot. We hope that his 
policy in this issue will be reasonable and that his government 
will act effectively in returning to Italy that which is 
Italian. We Serbs are willing to help him. 
  [Lombezzi] How will 2 million refugees be able to live? 
  [Seselj] Why should this worry us? They wanted this war, 
they lost this war, and the direct consequence of this is losing 
territory. They should have thought about this before when they 
would not accept any compromises; they wanted all of Bosnia and 
now they will have 10 percent of the territory. 
  [Lombezzi] According to the UN human rights commission, your 
men have become responsible for the ethnic cleansing and 
massacres in Bosnia. 
  [Seselj] Crimes bearing the signature of the Serbian Radical 
Party have never been proven. This demonstrates that its 
accusations are completely unfounded, as are those of the West, 
which does not know what is happening here. 
  [Lombezzi] If the international court on war crimes in the 
former Yugoslavia wants to put you on trial, will you present 
yourself? 
  [Seselj] I do not recognize the legality of this court, but 
I 
am telling you that if they accuse me I will present myself 
voluntarily. I really do not want to miss this show. 
  [Lombezzi] Will Italy be at risk if NATO launches other 
raids? 
  [Seselj] Italy has already exposed itself to a terrible risk 
because the American aircraft leave from Aviano air base to bomb 
our positions. This time we have not reacted against Italy 
because we appreciate and respect Berlusconi, who has still not 
succeeded in forming a government, but we believe that he will 
not allow somebody to tread on Italy's national interests and to 
push Italy into a conflict with its friend Serbia. We are 
waiting to see how the Italian Government will be composed, and 
then we will decide whether to attack or not. However, I am 
telling you that this can lead to the most serious consequences 
because we have very powerful weapons. Our SS-20's can reach the 
Italian coast and even further inland. NATO is fully aware of 
this; all these missiles are hidden underground and cannot be 
destroyed, not even with nuclear weapons.
