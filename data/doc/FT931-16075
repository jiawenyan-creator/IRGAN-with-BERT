FT  08 JAN 93 / Minister sees new hope in US airline row
MR JOHN MacGREGOR, transport secretary, yesterday signalled a new phase in
attempts to resolve the dispute with the US over air services, saying he
looked forward to working towards a more liberal agreement on flights
between the two countries with the incoming Clinton administration.
Speaking in Brussels, Mr MacGregor renewed calls for UK airlines to be given
greater access to the US domestic market.
He acknowledged this would present the US with 'difficult decisions about
changing their 50-year-old restrictions on foreign ownership and control of
US carriers.
'I had hoped that we and the US government would have been able to agree to
a step-by-step programme to open skies, with the next major change achieved
just as quickly as the US Congress were prepared to change their laws on
foreign control,' Mr Mac - Gregor added.
His remarks came two weeks after a proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 493.40m)
deal collapsed when British Airways pulled out because of 'excessive
demands' by the US government. Under the deal, British Airways would have
bought a 44 per cent stake in USAir.
Mr MacGregor yesterday expressed his regret that BA had had to withdraw its
offer. 'The proposed alliance between BA and USAir was a bold and
imaginative one, which could have greatly assisted progress towards removing
restrictions in the present air services agreement between our two
countries,' he said.
