FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: 29% pay rise for Sainsbury's top director
The remuneration of the highest paid director of J Sainsbury, the food
retailer, increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 280,000 in the year to
mid-March. The company would not comment on the identity of the recipient.
It said that there had been a number of retirements and appointments to the
board over the year. The total remuneration for directors rose by about 16
per cent, less than the rise in profits and dividends. Pre-tax profits of
Pounds 628m were 21 per cent higher. Dividends, at 8.75p, rose 20.4 per
cent.
Sainsbury said it aimed to pay directors well in relation to their
responsibilities but not to give vast increases or pay large bonuses as a
result of small increases in profits.
Lord Sainsbury, the chairman, who retires in November, saw his remuneration
rise from Pounds 189,000 to Pounds 221,000.
