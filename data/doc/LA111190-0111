SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; 
TEXAS TECH INTERCEPTS FIVE PASSES, BEATS TCU 
Texas Tech intercepted five passes and probably stole Texas Christian's bowl 
hopes in the process Saturday in the Red Raiders' 40-28 Southwest Conference 
victory over the Horned Frogs at Ft. Worth. 
Texas Tech, which is 3-7 overall and 2-5 in the SWC, ended a three-game losing 
streak. The Horned Frogs lost their third consecutive game, fell to 5-4 and 3-3 
and probably lost out at their chance of a berth in the Independence Bowl. 
TCU took a 7-0 lead on a 19-yard touchdown run by Curtis Modkins, but Texas 
Tech cornerback Ronald Ferguson stunned the Frogs by intercepting a pass by 
Matt Vogler at the Raider 25 and returning it 75 yards for a touchdown to make 
it 7-7. 
Tracy Saul intercepted two of Vogler's passes and Brian Dubiski and Sammy 
Walker one each in the second half, and the Raiders converted them into 17 
points. 
Last Saturday in a 56-35 loss to Houston, Vogler passed for an NCAA record 690 
yards. 
Baylor 34, Arkansas 3 -- The Bears (5-3-1, 4-1-1) stayed in the race for the 
SWC championship by handing the the Razorbacks (2-7, 0-6) their sixth 
consecutive defeat in a game at Waco, Tex. 
Steve Needham, starting in place of the injured J.J. Joe, completed 11 of 13 
passes for 133 yards and two touchdowns to give the Razorbacks their worst 
conference record since 1942. 
Rice 30, Southern Methodist 28 -- Rice (5-5, 3-4) held off a late charge by SMU 
(1-8, 0-6) in an SWC game at Houston, giving the Owls a chance for their first 
winning season in 27 years. 
Rice has won five games for the first time since finishing 5-6 in 1980. The 
Owls could earn their first winning season since a 6-4 finish in 1963 with a 
victory over Baylor next week. 
Trevor Cobb, who gained 167 yards in 29 carries, scored on touchdown runs of 
six and 44 yards for Rice. 
SMU quarterback Mike Romo, who missed last week's game against Texas A&amp;M 
with a sprained ankle, completed 40 of 62 passes for 452 yards and four 
touchdowns.
