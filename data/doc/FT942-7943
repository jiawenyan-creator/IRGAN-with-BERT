FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Samsung in Japanese purchase
Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest consumer electronics company, has
bought 51 per cent of Lux, the Japanese audio company, from Alpine
Electronics for Y2bn (Dollars 19m), writes John Burton in Seoul.
It is the first time a Korean company has taken control of a listed Japanese
concern. Lux, which was established in 1925, has encountered financial
difficulties because of the high yen.
Under its agreement with Samsung, Alpine Electronics also agreed to pay
Y2.5bn of Lux's Y2.7bn total debt.
Samsung said it acquired Lux to gain access to advanced digital audio
technology that the Japanese company has developed. Lux's main business is
the production of amplifier equipment and components, which are sold under
the name Luxman.
