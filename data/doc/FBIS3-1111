  [Text] Revelations of police involvement in violence and 
weapons supply have met with a denial from kwaZulu chief 
minister, Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, on the one hand, while on 
the other the ANC [African National Congress] is convinced that 
this confirms the existence of the so-called third force. The 
revelations came to light at a joint news conference by State 
President F.W. de Klerk and Mr. Justice Richard Goldstone 
yesterday. 
  Inkatha Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi denied that any members 
of 
his organization were involved in weapons supply. 
  [Begin Buthelezi recording] I am completely unaware that he 
supplied guns to any person, including any member of the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party]. I am just as surprised as anyone else 
about the allegations because I'm not aware which member of the 
IFP he was supplying with guns. [end recording] 
  The 36-page report released to the media yesterday contained 
allegations involving top police officials including deputy 
police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Basie Smit, CID 
[Criminal Investigations Department] Chief Johan le Roux, and 
the head of the police counterintelligence division, Major 
General Krappies Engelbrecht. They and other police officers 
named in the report have been placed on compulsory leave.
