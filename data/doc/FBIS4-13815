  [Excerpts] Damascus' official papers yesterday praised 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remark that he would be willing 
to evacuate settlements from the Golan in the framework of a 
peace agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Last night, Jerusalem received the Syrian reaction to 
Rabin's 
remarks with satisfaction. Political sources view the Syrian 
statements as a reply to Rabin's "public diplomacy" vis-a-vis 
Damascus. [passage omitted] 
  Jerusalem hopes that, during his upcoming visit to the 
region, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will take 
advantage of both countries' reciprocal signals and work to 
promote the arrangement between Syria and Israel. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yesterday in Bucharest, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told 
YEDI'OT AHARONOT that when he met PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, 
the latter asked: "Why did Rabin say he is willing to remove 
settlements from the Golan in return for peace, and is unwilling 
to evacuate settlers for peace with the Palestinians.?" 
  Peres: "I explained that Rabin's remarks are not solely 
related to the Golan Heights, but to all sectors. We are all in 
favor of the principle of territories for peace, but there is no 
need to deal with evacuating settlements at this time. I was 
very glad to hear that Rabin himself corrected his remarks the 
next day. Otherwise, his statement could have harmed the 
negotiations with the Palestinians." 
  Peres was referring to Rabin's clarification that leaving 
Jewish residents under Syrian sovereignty on the Golan would be 
irresponsible. [passage omitted]
