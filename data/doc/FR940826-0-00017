 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are eight spearmint oil handlers subject to regulation under the order and approximately 260 producers of spearmint
oil in the regulated production area. Of the 260 producers, approximately 145 producers hold ``Class 3'' (Native)
spearmint oil allotment base, and approximately 160 producers hold ``Class 1'' (Scotch) spearmint oil allotment
base. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as
those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of handlers and producers of Far West spearmint oil may be classified
as small entities. 
The Far West spearmint oil industry is characterized by producers whose farming operations generally involve more
than one commodity and whose income from farming operations are not exclusively dependent on the production of spearmint
oil. The U.S. production of spearmint oil is concentrated in the Far West, primarily Washington, Idaho, and Oregon
(part of the area covered by the order). Spearmint oil is also produced in the Midwest. The production area covered
by the order normally accounts for 75 percent of the annual U.S. production of spearmint oil. 
This rule increases the quantity of Native spearmint oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers
during the 199495 marketing year, which ends on May 31, 1995. This rule increases the salable quantity from
897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds and the allotment percentage from 46 percent to 56 percent for Native spearmint
oil for the 199495 marketing year. 
The salable quantity is the total quantity of each class of oil that handlers may purchase from, or handle for, producers
during a marketing year. The salable quantity calculated by the Committee is based on the estimated trade. The total
salable quantity is divided by the total industry allotment base to determine an allotment percentage. Each producer
is allotted a share of the salable quantity by applying the allotment percentage to the producer's allotment base
for the applicable class of spearmint oil. 
The initial salable quantity and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for the 199495
marketing year were recommended by the Committee at its October 6, 1993, meeting. For both Native and Scotch spearmint
oils, the Committee recommended salable quantities of 897,388 pounds and 723,326 pounds, and allotment percentages
of 46 percent and 41 percent, respectively. 
A proposed rule incorporating the Committee's October 6, 1993, recommendation was published in the December 21,
1993, issue of the 

Federal Register

 [58 FR 67378]. Comments on the proposed rule were solicited from interested persons until January 20, 1994. No comments
were received. Accordingly, based upon analysis of available information, a final rule establishing the Committee's
recommendation as the salable quantities and allotment percentages for both Native and Scotch spearmint oils for
the 199495 marketing year was published in the March 16, 1994, issue of the 

Federal Register

 [59 FR 12151]. 
Pursuant to authority contained in sections 985.50, 985.51, and 985.52 of the order, the Committee unanimously recommended
at its June 14, 1994, teleconference meeting that the salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint
oil for the 199495 marketing year be increased. The Committee recommended that the Native spearmint oil salable
quantity be increased from 897,388 pounds to 1,092,577 pounds. Based on a revised total allotment base of 1,951,032
pounds, the allotment percentage is increased from 46 to 56 percent which results in a 195,189 pound increase in the
salable quantity.
