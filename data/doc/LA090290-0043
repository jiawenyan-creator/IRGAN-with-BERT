UMBERG'S OCCUPATION AND PRINGLE SUPPORTERS' LAWSUIT 
Quoting from the article "Pringle Partisans Sue Umberg Over His Title on 
Ballot" (Aug. 23): "The squeaker of a victory, however, was immediately marred 
by accusations that the Republicans had used dirty tricks to scare away 
potential Democratic voters by posting guards at several heavily Latino 
precincts in Santa Ana." 
As many times as I have read the above accusations, I have never heard an 
explanation as to how the Democrats arrived at the conclusion that the security 
guards were there to scare them away. 
If a person is doing nothing wrong, why is there any reason to be intimidated 
or fearful of a security guard?
