  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 24 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- The Indonesian 
Foreign Ministry on Friday expressed deep regret over the plan 
of the Malaysian Non-governmental Organizations (NGO's) to 
conduct a forum on East Timor. 
  "The holding of such a forum will definitely damage the 
solidarity and good relations between Indonesia and Malaysia as 
both are members of the ASEAN," Foreign Ministry Information 
Director, Irawan Abidin, told ANTARA. 
  A transnational news agency said that the Malaysia Action 
Front, a group comprising 30 NGOs, is organizing an East Timor 
forum late Friday. 
  "A good number of people were invited to attend the two and 
a 
half hour forum. But it is different from the one held recently 
in Manila which was conducted on a large international scale," 
Syed Hussain Ali, who would be one of the speakers at the forum, 
quoted by AFP as saying. 
  Irawan Abidin said he is still waiting for a detailed report 
regarding such planned forum from the Indonesian Embassy in 
Kuala Lumpur. 
  "But, I believe that it is just a "disinformation campaign" 
from certain groups to test Indonesia's reaction," he said.
