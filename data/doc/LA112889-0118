MAN ANSWERS DOOR, FATALLY SHOT IN HEAD 
A man was fatally shot in the head Monday after he answered a knock on his 
apartment door, police said. Investigators have no suspects and have not 
established a motive. 
Martin Renteria, 26, was pronounced dead at United Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana about 20 minutes after the shooting, police spokeswoman Chris Schwartz 
said. 
The shooting occurred about 4:55 p.m. at the Tustin Arms Apartments in the 
15000 block of Tustin Village Way, where Renteria rented a two-bedroom 
apartment. 
"One shot was fired," she said. "We believe it was from a handgun."
