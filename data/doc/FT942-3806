FT  13 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ford aims to increase car sales
in Japan
Ford, the US motor vehicle manufacturer, has launched an aggressive strategy
to gain a bigger share of the Japanese new car market.
It has begun to export right-hand drive cars to Japan for the first time
from the US and from Europe, and has also set prices in Japan which undercut
many rival import models.
The group, the world's second largest manufacturer of cars, has benefited
from the strong appreciation of the yen, and claims that in some cases its
products are now priced below similar models from domestic Japanese
competitors.
Ford has already increased its holding in Autorama, its Japanese
distribution channel, to 45.1 per cent to give it parity with Mazda, its
24.5 per cent-owned Japanese affiliate.
Ford's trademark is replacing the Autorama name on Ford dealers' signs
throughout Japan, and it has begun to expand dealer outlets through other
channels with the opening of the first three Nissan/Ford dual dealers.
Previously, most of the cars sold under the Ford marque in Japan have been
rebadged Mazda products.
But the US company has now launched a strategy to give equal importance to
the sale of imported cars in the Japanese market.
It has set itself a target of selling around 200,000 cars a year in Japan by
the year 2000, of which half would be imports (chiefly from Ford plants in
North America and in Europe) and half would be rebadged Mazdas.
Last year, it sold 39,753 rebadged Mazdas, such as the Ford Telstar (Mazda
626) and the Ford Laser (Mazda Familia/323), in Japan, while sales of Ford
cars imported from the US totalled only 5,111.
This month, Ford has launched in Japan right-hand drive versions of its
European-built Mondeo, which is produced at its plant at Genk, Belgium, and
has begun to sell right-hand drive versions of its Probe coupe, which is
built at AutoAlliance, its 50:50 joint venture plant with Mazda, in the US.
