 



Discussion: 

Grant awards made in FY 1995 will be for either four or five years, depending upon the peer review score received by applicants
in the competition. The grant award cycle for currently funded grantees under the McNair program will not be modified.




Changes: 

None. 



What Definitions Apply? (Section 647.7) 






Comment: 

One commenter suggested that the definition for 

first-generation college student

 might be clarified by utilizing the language agreed upon in the Talent Search Program for the similar definition of


potential first-generation college student

 (643.7). 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees with the commenter. 



Changes: 

The definition of 

first-generation college student

 has been revised to reflect the definition of that term in the Talent Search Program regulations. 



Comments: 

None. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary has reviewed the regulations since the publication of the NPRM and has determined that providing information
on what groups are underrepresented in graduate education is beneficial to all prospective applicants. However,
there is no need to define both 

Individuals from groups underrepresented in graduate education,

 and 

Groups underrepresented in graduate education.

 



Changes: 

The definition of ``Individuals from groups underrepresented in graduate education'' has been deleted and replaced
with the definition of ``Groups underrepresented in graduate education.'' 


Further, an additional definition has been added to this section for ``target population.'' Applicants are asked
to provide information on their proposed ``target population'' under the ``Need'' criterion, which was revised
in response to comments that the criterion not be restricted to an applicant's student population. 




Comments: 

Several commenters questioned the definition of 

summer internship.

 Exception was taken to the phrase, ``*** that normally will occur between the junior and senior year
***'' because it appears restrictive and one commenter suggested that the term ``experienced practitioner''
be defined. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary disagrees that the definition of this term could be interpreted as requiring that a summer internship
take place only between a student's junior and senior years but decided to delete the phrase nevertheless. 



Changes: 

The definition of ``summer internship'' has been revised, and the Secretary has replaced the term ``experienced
practitioners'' with ``experienced faculty researchers.'' 




How Does the Secretary Decide which New Grants to Make? (Section 647.20) 





Comments: 

Two commenters observed that the eight point maximum prior experience score conflicts with the language included
in the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary has raised the maximum prior experience score to 15 points as required by a statutory change made by the
Higher Education Technical Amendments Act of 1993. 



Changes: 

The maximum score for all the criteria in 647.22 is l5 points. Further, the Secretary has modified the maximum
score for each criterion in that section to reflect the new total score. 



Comments: 

One commenter objected to the provision that additional points, equal to l0 percent of the applicant's score, be awarded
to applications from Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and the
Northern Mariana Islands. The commenter objected because the commenter believes it gives those applicants an unfair
advantage. 



Discussion: 

The requirement that priority be given to 
proposals submitted by the territories was deleted from the Higher Education Act by the Higher Education Technical
Amendments Act of 1993. 



Changes: 

The provision has been deleted from 647.20(a) of the regulations. 



Comments: 

Several commenters objected to 647.20(c) of the proposed regulations, which describes how the Secretary
awards grants when two or more applications receive identical scores and all of these applications cannot be funded.
The commenters suggested that the use of a subjective selection factor such as geographical distribution was not
impartial and could possibly be construed as setting a new precedent for other TRIO funding. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that a tie-breaker that takes into account underserved geographic areas is appropriate.
The Secretary further believes this provision reflects congressional concern regarding equitable distribution
of services to geographic areas and eligible populations that have been underserved by the program. 



Changes: 

None. 



What Selection Criteria Does the Secretary Use? (Section 647.21) 





Comments: 

Several commenters questioned why the ``Need'' criterion is based on the eligibility of students at the applicant
institution when the program legislation does not restrict an applicant's service area to its own student population.




Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that the ``Need'' criterion as published could inadvertently restrict the applicant's service
area. 



Changes: 

Section 647.21(b) has been revised and reformatted to appear as 647.21(a). 



Comments: 

One commenter suggested that 647.21(c)(2) would be strengthened by adding an objectives section, which would
require the inclusion of information on specific process and outcome objectives relative to the purposes of the McNair
program, their relevance in addressing the needs of the target group, and their clarity and attainability given the
project budget and other resources.
