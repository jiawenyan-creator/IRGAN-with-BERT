  [Text] The Vance-Zakharakis meeting was held in New York 
with President Clinton's special envoy Matthew Nimetz. The 
talks will resume shortly. No statement on these talks has been 
made but Mr. Nimetz's presence confirms the U.S. interest in 
resolving the problem and the existing movement around it. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent in New York recording] 
Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry secretary 
general, held a substantive meeting for many hours here in New 
York with Cyrus Vance, UN special mediator in the Skopje [the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. The 
meeting, which will continue in the afternoon, was also attended 
by Matthew Nimetz, President Clinton's special envoy on the 
issue. [end recording] 
  Mr. Zakharakis conveyed the Greek Government's positions on 
this phase of the negotiating process to Mr. Vance. In 
accordance with his practice, the UN secretary general's special 
mediator refrained from saying anything on the progress of the 
talks until, as he made it clear, he meets tomorrow with a 
Skopje representative. The round of talks will continue next 
week. 
  Diplomatic circles say these talks will determine the 
future, 
although it is still early to assess whether there is any chance 
to break the current stalemate. However, according to 
indications thus far, it should be expected that both the Greek 
and Skopjean sides will present a position that will allow some 
rapprochement toward a compromise formula that would allow the 
resumption of the dialogue. 
  Mr. Matthew Nimetz, President Clinton's special envoy and 
formerly a close associate of Mr. Vance, described the meeting 
as constructive and emphasized the U.S. Government's interest in 
finding a solution to the problem.
