FT  02 FEB 94 / Observer: Generally speaking
Those who hope Algeria's new head of state, General Lamine Zeroual, can
prevent the country sliding into civil war can take comfort from incidents
in his past.
During riots in October 1988 - which broke the power of the ruling Front de
Liberation National Party - one of the towns where no blood was shed was
Constantine, a long-standing hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism and the scene
of violent rioting in November 1986. The commander of the military region
enclosing Constantine was none other than Zeroual; he disobeyed orders and
refused to open fire against the demonstrators. Soon after, he was appointed
head of the land forces but resigned his command a few months later, and in
1989 retired.
