FT  03 APR 93 / World News in Brief: Erratic day for equities
Heavy falls in Wellcome and BAT Industries, an erratic pound and weakness in
other European markets and on Wall Street produced a confusing session for
London traders. The UK stock market gyrated through a range of more than 33
points. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 8.5 down on the day at 2,869.9.
