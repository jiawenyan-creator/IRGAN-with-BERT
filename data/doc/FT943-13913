FT  16 JUL 94 / Criminal reforms to miss assent
The Criminal Justice Bill, which has been the subject of intense opposition
in the House of Lords, will not receive its royal assent by the start of the
Commons' summer recess, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said
yesterday.
He confirmed that the legislation would not have passed through all its
parliamentary stages by the time the Commons rises on Thursday.
