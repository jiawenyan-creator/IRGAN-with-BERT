<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(G), it intends to award a grant in the amount of $50,000 to the
National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in support of scientific evaluation work in operational
radiation protection, radionuclides in the environment, guidance on occupational and public exposure resulting
from diagnostic nuclear medicine procedures, and practical guidance on the evaluation of human exposures to radiofrequency
radiation. Pursuant to Public law 88376, the NCRP was chartered to collect, analyze, develop, and disseminate
in the public interest information and recommendations pertaining to radiation protection. The NCRP's cooperation
with national and international organizations, governmental and private, ensures that the recommendations provided
incorporate the latest scientific information for the protection of radiation workers and members of the general
public. Under this grant award, the NCRP seeks to provide guidance and recommendations that will minimize human exposure
and, thus, reduce health effects of radiation. Eligibility for this award is therefore restricted to NCRP.
