STORM LEAVES IN ITS WAKE SCORES OF ACCIDENTS ON COUNTY FREEWAYS 
The fast-moving Pacific storm that dumped more than half an inch of rain in 
South County moved out of the region this morning, leaving in its wake scores 
of traffic accidents along the county's freeways, authorities said. 
The California Highway Patrol reported that more than 70 traffic accidents 
occurred during a 12-hour period that ended at 6 a.m, mostly fender benders 
caused by motorists unused to the slippery roads. 
"Cars were just going too fast and they lost control," CHP spokeswoman Linda 
Burrus said. "As soon as the officers were cleared from one accident, they were 
sent to another scene." 
County Environmental Management Agency officials said the storm produced the 
first measurable rainfall since June. 
Santiago Peak, part of the Santa Ana mountains, was hit hardest, measuring 1.1 
inches of rainfall, while San Juan Capistrano and El Toro each recorded .71 
inches, EMA spokesman Shailesh Batel said. 
Some parts of central and north Orange County had far less rainfall, he said. 
Santa Ana had .16 inches, Anaheim and Fullerton both had .28, Brea had .24 and 
Cypress had only a trace of rainfall at .08 inches.
