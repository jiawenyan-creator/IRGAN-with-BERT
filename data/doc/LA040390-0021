SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD 
A corporate jet caught fire Monday after falling 50 feet at takeoff and 
skidding off a runway at Palomar Airport, an airport official said. The two 
pilots in the plane escaped with minor injuries. 
"The aircraft was 50 feet in the air when it veered to the right, then to the 
left, and then to the right again," said tower manager Duane Rakotz. "It 
tilted, and the wing hooked in the dirt, and the aircraft slid for about 2,000 
feet." 
Rakotz said a fire erupted from one of the Lear-35 jet's engines. Carlsbad 
firefighters put the flames out. The Federal Aviation Administration is 
investigating. 
An airport employee, Jackie Warner, said there were "lots of flames and smoke. 
We didn't expect the pilots to just walk away." 
The pilots are employees of Flight International, a company that contracts with 
the Navy to perform training missions. The names of the pilots will be 
disclosed today, officials said.
