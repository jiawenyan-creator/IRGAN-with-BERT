MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Humans vs. Terminator Again: It seems there's no terminating Arnold 
Schwarzenegger in the role of the murderous and unstoppable cyborg. 
Schwarzenegger will star in a sequel, set for release next summer. Also 
appearing in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" is former "Beauty and the Beast" star 
Linda Hamilton. Schwarzenegger returns on a mission to kill Hamilton's son, who 
is destined to lead the Human Resistance against machines. James Cameron will 
direct the film for Carolco Pictures. Cameron co-wrote and directed the 
original "The Terminator" and has also written and directed "Aliens" and "The 
Abyss." CLAUDIA PUIG
