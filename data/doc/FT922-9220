FT  08 MAY 92 / Regalian proposes sale by tender
THE depressed London property investment market has prompted Regalian, a
property developer, to adopt the unusual tactic of selling an office block
by tender.
It hopes to choose four potential buyers to bid for Red Lion Court, an
office building in Southwark near the City of London. The 128,500 sq ft
building, which is let to Lloyds Bank, has a reserve price of Pounds 45m. In
1989 Regalian tried to sell the property for Pounds 65m.
The reserve price of Pounds 45m would give a net yield of 9.3 per cent,
slightly higher than that on long-dated gilts.
