  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
Wednesday [19 January] ended two days of working-level talks on 
government procurement of medical equipment, a priority sector 
of the bilateral trade framework negotiations, without progress, 
government sources said. 
  Japan offered a new concession by lowering a minimum value 
of 
medical equipment to be bought through open tenders to 100,000 
special drawing rights (SDRs), or about 15 million yen, from 
130,000 SDRs, while the U.S. side stood pat on its demand for 
cutting the minimum value to 5,000 SDRs, the sources said. 
  Among other outstanding points was how to revise Japan's 
procurement procedures with a view to improving market access 
for foreign medical technology, they said. 
  U.S. negotiators asked Japan to increase transparency and 
openness of its government procurement market by introducing 
American systems, which Tokyo claimed are not necessarily 
applicable to the Japanese systems, they said. Both sides will 
continue discussing the issue at a subcabinet-level meeting 
scheduled for January 23 and 24 in Washington, which could be 
followed by a working-level meeting, they said. 
  The working-level talks did not take up the matter of 
"objective criteria," which is a main issue on the agenda of the 
subcabinet-level negotiations, they said.
