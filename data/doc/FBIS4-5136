  [Text] Malaysia does not consider as a security threat to 
the country the Royal Thai Navy's plan to purchase a helicopter 
carrier. This was stated by Chief of Navy Vice Admiral Datuk Sri 
Mohamed Sharif Ishak. He said any development of the armed 
forces of the ASEAN countries should not be considered as a 
threat because it could contribute to regional defense 
capability. He even revealed that the stronger the forces the 
better the grouping. He was speaking at a maritime security 
forum of the Malaysian Institute of Maritime Affairs in Kuala 
Lumpur. 
  Meanwhile, visiting Rear Admiral Thammanun Nathirot of the 
Royal Thai Navy said Thailand has no plans to buy an aircraft 
carrier or an attack warship, but will buy a helicopter carrier 
to provide support for its sea defense system.
