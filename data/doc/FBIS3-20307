  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- Though the right-wing 
alliance can count on a safe majority in the Lower House, with 
366 seats in the 630-seat chamber or 50 over the quorum, matters 
in the Senate were still unclear and are likely to remain so 
until the first test is put to this house. 
  There are 326 seats in the Upper House, 315 elected plus 11 
life senators, with 164 seats required for a majority as 
compared to the 155 newly-elected or incumbent senators under 
the loose-knit Freedom Front banner. The variables in the 
search for the other nine votes are now thought to be infinite. 
  Under focus could be the three senators sent to Rome from 
the 
northern Trentino Alto Adige region for the German-speaking 
Suedtiroler Volkspartei [SVP]. This party, however, issued a 
communique today saying, "From the present, the SVP excludes any 
form of cooperation with a government which, beside Forza Italia 
and the Northern League, sees the presence of the neo-Fascists," 
or the National Alliance southern leg of the Freedom Pole tripod. 
  The SVP also said, "the exclusion" of the National Alliance 
would "leave open the hope that Forza Italia and the Northern 
League could commit themselves to a federalist system in the 
framework of which there would be necessary attention given to 
the minorities." 
  Others who could receive Freedom Pole overtures in the new 
Senate are the successful candidate of the Valdostana Union, the 
Alpine League senator and the one brought in on the Pannella 
slate. 
  Aside from possible swing votes in the strongly-flattened 
center, with 31 seats as compared to 122 sewn up for the 
Progressive Coalition, the life senators could be crucial. 
These are former Heads of State Francesco Cossiga and Giovanni 
Leone and Giulio Andreotti, Paolo Emilio Taviani, Giovanni 
Agnelli, Carlo Bo, Norberto Bobbio, Leo Valiani, Giovanni 
Spadolini, Francesco De Martino and Amintore Fanfani.
