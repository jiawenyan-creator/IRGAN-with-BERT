FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: US Steel ahead in third quarter
on higher prices
US Steel, the country's biggest steelmaker, reported a 40 per cent jump in
underlying operating income in the third quarter as higher steel prices
contributed to its continuing turnround.
The company, part of the USX group, said operating income (before a Dollars
13m gain from the sale of a coal seam) rose to Dollars 93m.
This represented Dollars 36 for each of the 2.6m tons produced, compared
with Dollars 27 a ton on production of 2.5m tons the year before.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman, said that 'ongoing price improvement and
efficient operating levels throughout our plants' meant that the company was
positioned to improve its results further.
Overall, US Steel's net income jumped Dollars 57m, to Dollars 90m. The
latest period was lifted by one-off credits of Dollars 32m, compared with
Dollars 11m in the year-ago quarter.
US Steel, like Marathon and Delhi, other subsidiaries of USX, has a separate
quote on the New York Stock Exchange. Its earnings per share reached Dollars
1.11, up from 41 cents.
Marathon, meanwhile, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 102m on sales of
Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 30m on sales of Dollars 3bn the year
before.
The results were lifted by a net Dollars 48m from asset disposals, after
deducting a charge for an inventory valuation adjustment and reorganisation
costs.
A higher oil price helped the company to report exploration and production
profits of Dollars 73m, compared with a loss of Dollars 9m the year before.
Operating income from refining and marketing slipped to Dollars 123m from
Dollars 146m, reflecting the lower profit margins on refined products being
achieved by all energy groups.
Marathon's earnings per share rose to 35 cents, from 10 cents the year
before.
