FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bekaert returns to the black
BEKAERT, the Belgian producer of wire and steel cord, has announced net
profits of BFr2.71bn (Dollars 80m) for 1992, against a loss of BFr652m the
previous year, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
The results included a capital gain of BFr1.05bn on the sale of shares in
its Japanese steel cord joint venture. However, Bekaert's net profit still
tripled between 1991 and 1992 when adjusted for exceptional gains and
charges.
The directors have proposed a net dividend of BFr250 for the year, against
only BFr100 per share in 1990 and 1991. Belgian analysts have long said that
Bekaert will be one of the first Belgian industrial companies to profit from
any improvement in the economy.
