FT  09 MAY 91 / CBI opposes stricter EC merger rules
THE Confederation of British Industry made a plea yesterday for little or no
change to the UK's approach to regulating takeovers and mergers.
In its written evidence to the Commons trade and industry committee inquiry
on takeovers and mergers, the CBI said self-regulation was preferred to the
statutory control proposed by the draft European takeover directive.
Any attempts to make the system more rigid so as to make takeovers more
difficult would be strongly opposed by UK business, it said.
Statutory regulation of takeovers would inevitably lead to delay, expense
and increasing resort to litigation during takeovers, as had become the
practice in the US. The Takeover Panel was part of the City's system of
self-regulation and had the advantage of flexibility, allowing a quick
response to changes in the commercial environment.
The CBI said it had 'serious problems' with the draft directive on the
ground that the whole basis of the UK's efficient and flexible approach to
the takeover process and mergers might be at stake under the EC proposals.
The MPs heard an opposing view from BAT Industries, which said the Takeover
Panel was unaccountable and had unfair procedures, and that there was
secrecy and lack of certainty about the way it operated.
The draft takeover directive would cure those defects and present an
opportunity to enhance the quality of the regulation of takeovers in the UK,
it said.
A new body properly constituted and properly accountable to parliament
should be set up to be the UK supervisory body under the European proposals,
it added.
