</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations governing mutual-to-stock conversions of insured
savings associations. The purpose of these amendments is to revise, clarify and update the current regulations to
strengthen the conversion standards and ensure the integrity of the conversion process. 


The amendments revise and clarify the appraisal standards; prohibit the use of ``running'' proxies by management
of converting associations; place the current tax-qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) stock purchase
priority after those of eligible depositors; provide stock purchase priority to long-term depositors; require
that a stock purchase preference be given to eligible depositors residing in the association's local community;
prohibit management stock benefit plans in a conversion; prohibit merger conversions except in supervisory situations;
lengthen the conversion public comment period; require associations to submit business plans for all conversions;
prohibit the repurchase of a converted association's stock within one year of conversion; and make publicly available
preliminary conversion proxy materials. 
Interested parties are invited to submit written comments on the conversion regulations, both as to the amendments
adopted here and the issues on which comment is specifically solicited and as to any other current provisions of the
conversion regulations as they relate to this interim rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Introduction 


The OTS has broad authority to authorize and regulate mutual to stock conversions of savings associations under sections
5(i) and (p) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended (HOLA), 12 U.S.C. 1464(i) and (p).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For the past 20 years_since the OTS's predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) instituted mutual to stock
conversion regulations in 1974
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
_mutual to stock conversions have been a successful vehicle for bringing new capital into the thrift industry. Since
1974, over 1,000 mutual savings associations have converted to the stock form of ownership, in the process raising
approximately $16 billion in new capital.

The OTS also has broad authority to approve and regulate mutual savings and loan holding companies under section 10(o)
of HOLA, 12 U.S.C. 1467a(o).

</FOOTNOTE>


While mutual to stock conversions provide an opportunity for thrifts to raise capital, they may also provide an opportunity
for an association's insiders to engage in transactions that transfer to the insiders an inappropriate amount of
a converting association's value. Thus, the OTS mutual to stock conversion regulations reflect standards and safeguards
developed over the years to maintain the integrity of the conversion process, to ensure safety and soundness by responding
to the potential for abuses in thrift conversions and to allow the conversion process to function effectively as a
capital raising tool.
