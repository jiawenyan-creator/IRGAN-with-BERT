  [Text] Sarajevo, February 20 (XINHUA) -- Continued heavy 
snow is hampering a full withdrawal of Serbian heavy weapons, 
and U.N. peacekeeper monitoring of all weapon sites around 
Sarajevo, with the NATO deadline only hours away. 
  The U.N. special envoy to Bosnia, Yakushi Akashi, told 
journalists here that because of heavy snowfall and road 
conditions, some weapons still inside the NATO exclusion zone 
around the city might not be under the "actual control" of the 
U.N. Protection Forces (Unprofor) by the deadline of midnight 
GMT Sunday [20 February]. 
  He said that the U.N. could do "a number of things" to make 
any weapons not under surveillance "non-operable." But he 
refused to give the percentage of weapons that had not been 
withdrawn or placed under U.N. control. "But this failure is 
not necessarily sufficient reason to call in air strikes," he 
added. 
  However, U.S. Army General John Shalikashvili, chairman of 
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters, "...Any weapons 
remaining after the deadline within the 20 km circle that are 
not under U.N. control are subject to air strikes -- any. It 
didn't say 90 percent. It didn't say 26, (or) whatever." 
  Shalikashvili is travelling with Defense Secretary William 
Perry for a five-nation defense ministers meeting at Aviano 
airbase, Italy, at the 11th-hour before the midnight GMT 
deadline. 
  The final NATO pre-deadline strategy meeting was attended by 
defense ministers from the U.S., France, Britain, Italy, and the 
Netherlands. 
  Meanwhile, 400 Russian paratroopers and artillery forces 
were 
due to reach Sarajevo late Sunday morning for deployment in 
areas held by Bosnian Serb forces southeast of the capital, said 
Guy Vinnet, U.N. spokesman for the Sarajevo sector.
