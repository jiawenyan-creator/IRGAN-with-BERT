FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Haeco increases earnings 10.8%
to HKDollars 320.6m
HONG Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), the Swire Pacific group
company which holds a monopoly on commercial aircraft maintenance and
engineering in Hong Kong, recorded a 10.8 per cent increase in net profit in
1991 to HKDollars 320.6m (Dollars 41.36), up from HKDollars 289.4m in 1990.
Haeco achieved a 12.8 per cent improvement in turnover to HKDollars 1.806bn,
despite the weak traffic levels resulting from the Gulf war. However, profit
margins remained under pressure from the tight labour market.
Losses were suffered by the 29 per cent-owned associate Asta Aircraft
Services, an Australian aircraft maintenance company.
This was acquired in February 1991 to get around capacity constraints in
Hong Kong and cap the impact of the brain drain on ethnic Chinese
engineering staff, by providing emigration opportunities.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said big contracts had been awarded to Asta by All
Nippon Airways and British Airways, and a new hangar had been commissioned.
The company is expected to be marginally profitable in 1992.
Haeco's Hong Kong operations saw an increased level of line maintenance work
in 1991, while airframe maintenance benefited from the acquisition of five
Boeing 747-400's by Swire group airline Cathay Pacific last year.
Looking forward, Mr Sutch said the company's airframe maintenance facilities
were already fully committed for 1992, while overhaul work should remain at
'satisfactory' levels.
Haeco recommended a final dividend of 58 cents, representing a full-year
pay-out of 81 cents, compared with one of 76 cents in 1990.
