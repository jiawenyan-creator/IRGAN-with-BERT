  [Text] The PLO leadership has ordered that guns held by 
Palestinians in Gaza be collected, but only few heeded this 
order. This was reported at the cabinet's weekly session today. 
Our correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the ministers were 
also told that Fatah activists in the Gaza Strip have been 
criticizing the PLO leadership, claiming that it disregards them. 
  The cabinet was further told that Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] has been questioning the legitimacy of the PLO 
leadership and opposing the agreement. There is a fear that the 
economic deterioration in Gaza might be followed by a security 
deterioration. 
  The ministers were also told that the Palestinian Authority 
will take part in issuing working permits in Israel for 
Palestinian laborers.
