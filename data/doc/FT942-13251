FT  26 APR 94 / Observer: Dog eat dog
Has the search for Pooh, Prince Charle's runaway Jack Russell, extended to
Saltwood castle, home of diarist and former minister Alan Clark? The man
obviously has an affinity with royal Russells, for in his diary he records
meeting a 'pleasing pup, smooth-coated and self-assured' on his first visit
to dinner at Highgrove, HRH's country seat. 'Furtively I fed him titbits
under the table.' Indeed, AC was more taken with the mutt than with the
assembled captains of industry. 'All I got out of the whole experience was a
pleasing demonstration of what happens when you don't dock a Russell puppy's
tail,' he concludes.
