  [Text] A new round of negotiations on Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] will begin in New York 
between mediator Cyrus Vance, Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, 
the Greek Foreign Ministry secretary general, and Skopjean 
[FYROM] Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. 
  The new meetings and talks are expected to begin on Friday 
[13 May] or next Monday at Vance's office in Manhattan 
(Lexington Avenue), New York. 
  The Zakharakis-Vance meeting is being described as the 
continuation of the talks that began prior to the Greek prime 
minister's official visit to the United States. During that 
visit, Papandreou met UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
at UN Headquarters. 
  Commenting on the upcoming meetings on Skopje, diplomatic 
observers said the current climate is "more favorable" for the 
Greek side because U.S. President Bill Clinton's interest in a 
solution favors the Greek positions. 
  It is believed that in the new round of talks the two sides 
(Greece-Skopje) will "proceed with moves of goodwill and 
understanding" and should reach an agreement. 
  Reports from Skopje say that the Skopjean representative 
will 
show the "necessary willingness" so the talks do not lead 
(again) to a deadlock. This is the line that the Skopjean 
foreign minister has received from his government, which 
recently "received the U.S. messages."
