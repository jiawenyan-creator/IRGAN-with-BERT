  [Text] By order of FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA [Financial News], 
Andrey Sizov analyzes the production of industrial products for 
agriculture. 
  In 1993 there was an acceleration in the rate of reduction 
in 
the production of industrial products for agriculture. This 
applied to the production of mineral fertilizer and plant 
protection agents as well as to a majority of the various types 
of agricultural equipment. Moreover, the decline in these 
branches has continued since the middle of the 1980's (see Table 
1).

  Agricultural machine building: a crisis of the monopolists. 
Since autumn of last year, the production of agricultural 
equipment has declined rapidly, mainly as a result of a sharp 
decrease in demand. Many farms, as a result of untimely state 
payments for products delivered, have been forced to decline 
purchases of new agricultural machines. In particular, this has 
had an effect on enterprises which occupy a monopolistic 
position in agricultural machine building and which produce 
expensive and low quality products. Thus, in December and 
January the production of flax harvesting combines was halted 
completely at the Bezhetskselmash Plant, Russia's only producer 
of these machines. In December of last year, not one 
potato-harvesting combine was produced by the Ryazan Combine 
Plant, the only producer of such machines. Rostselmash and the 
Kirov Plant are tolerating an increasing number of stoppages in 
their operations. As a result, only 14 grain combines and 2,116 
tractors were produced in January of this year, compared to 
2,500 and 9,300 respectively in January 1993. 
  Russia is commencing its spring field operations with the 
smallest pool of agricultural machines and the lowest level of 
agricultural equipment readiness since 1986. Notwithstanding the 
sharp decline in the production and sale of agricultural 
equipment, the number of repaired grain combines and tractors 
fell last year by 40-41 percent and potato-harvesting combines 
-- by almost two thirds, since the production of spare parts is 
also declining rapidly. As a result, there has been an increase 
in the rate at which the pool of agricultural machines is 
declining in size. Overall, during the period from 1986 to 1993, 
the tractor pool decreased by 185,000 units, or by 13 percent, 
and that for grain combines -- by 145,000 (by 29 percent). 
Moreover, according to data supplied by Roskomstat, by early 
February one out of every four tractors and trucks and one third 
of the plows, sowing machines and cultivators were in a state of 
disrepair, compared to 15-20 percent on this same date at the 
beginning of the 1990's. 
  Mineral fertilizer: the acquisition of mineral 
fertilizer in agriculture is still declining more rapidly than 
its production. This is associated with the continuing and 
relatively high level of nitrogen and potassium fertilizer 
exports over the past two years. As a result, the deliveries to 
and accordingly the consumption by farms of mineral fertilizer 
are declining more rapidly than its production. According to 
preliminary data, from 1991 to 1993 the consumption of mineral 
fertilizer per hectare of arable land declined by a factor of 
2.5 (see Table 2).

  The decline in mineral fertilizer consumption is combined 
with reductions in applications of organic fertilizer (a decline 
of 15 percent in 1993) and lime-containing materials (down 18 
percent). This is lower by a factor of almost 2.5 than the 
consumption level called for in the state all-round program for 
improving soil fertility in Russia, as adopted in late 1992. 
  The significance for agricultural production in 1994: a 
reduction in the areas under crops and possibly a further 
reduction in cropping power. It is clear that under the 
conditions imposed by an increasing shortage of logistical 
resources this spring, it may not be possible to compensate for 
the undersowing of winter crops, which amounted to 20 percent, 
including winter wheat -- 12 percent. Moreover, the increasing 
shortage of agricultural machines and their low level of 
readiness for field work, combined with a considerable 
deterioration in farm support in the form of fuel and 
lubricating materials, will obviously produce a situation in 
which the areas set aside for spring crops will also decline 
compared to last year. 
  The hope that the reduction in crop areas may be partially 
compensated by an increase in cropping power is extremely 
unreal. The rapid reduction in mineral and organic fertilizer 
consumption will lead to a decline in soil fertility. In point 
of fact, agricultural production in recent years has been 
carried out to the detriment of the land's natural potential and 
in the absence of land restoration. Agricultural production is 
becoming more vulnerable to changing weather conditions and more 
unstable and difficult to forecast.
