FT  17 DEC 94 / Derbyshire police 'inefficient' again
Derbyshire's police force is set to be refused a certificate of efficiency
for a third time, Mr John Newing, chief constable, said yesterday. His force
remains the only one in the country to be declared inefficient.
Mr Newing said he had been told the refusal was because of continuing
finance problems with the Derbyshire force. Senior officers in the county
predict a gap in funding of about Pounds 10m.
