FT  28 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: DTB introduces Dax index
future option
THE Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German derivatives exchange, has
introduced an option on its Dax index future, its third product linked to
the Dax index of 30 German stocks.
An option on the index itself and a Dax future contract are already traded
on the exchange. Dealers said the option on the future will be more
attractive to institutions, because of its larger contract size (DM100 per
index point, like the future, compared with DM10 per point for the option on
the index) and lower fees.
In addition, the new options are American style, that is, they can be
exercised at any time.
The smaller option contract on the index is widely used by German retail
investors, with average daily volume of 38,000 contracts.
The option on the future traded 1,430 contracts in its first day of trading
on Friday, a rather slow day in the German stock market. Volume is expected
to pick up gradually, as fund managers get to grips with its more
complicated structure.
The future contract, also an institutional product, trades around 8,600
contracts a day.
