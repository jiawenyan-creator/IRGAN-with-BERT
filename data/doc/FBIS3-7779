<F P=106> [Report by Zoran Gurgurevic from Doboj] </F>
  [Text] All the fronts in the operative zone of the 
Operational Group Doboj are being exposed to a fierce Muslim 
offensive, in which the forces of the 2d and 3d Corps of the 
Muslim army are involved. The heaviest attacks against the army 
of the Srpska republic are under way on the fronts very close to 
Doboj, so the general alarm is in force in the town. 
  In an offensive that has apparently been prepared in detail, 
the Muslims are attempting to break through from several 
directions: from Zenica toward Zavidovici and Maglaj, from 
(Vracanica) toward Doboj, and from Tesanj and the Usora River 
valley toward Teslic and Doboj. 
  At the same time, and despite the signed cease-fire, the 
Muslim fanatics are attacking Croatian forces in Zepce. The 
Muslims are obviously trying to expand their territories by 
force before the peace talks. General Ratko Mladic and General 
Momir Talic are directing the defense operations of the Srpska 
republic army in the region.
