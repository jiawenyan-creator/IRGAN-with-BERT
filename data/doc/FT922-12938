FT  15 APR 92 / People: Greycoat
Geoffrey Wilson, one of London's best-known developers, has given up his
executive role at Greycoat, the company he founded 14 years ago.
Wilson says he wants to oversee the company's strategic direction; it is
increasingly accepted in business that executive and non-executive roles
should be separated, he says. 'I intend to be an active and committed
non-executive chairman. There is no question of my departure.'
Although Greycoat is widely admired for its buildings, it is vulnerable to
the severe downturn in the London office market. Its shares, which stood at
397p last year, are now 33p.
Wilson, 58, says his decision has not been influenced by recent heart
surgery, from which he has totally recovered.
He will become non-executive chairman from August 1. Richard Guignard, the
company's long-serving finance director, now becomes managing director,
finance, Peter Thornton, currently joint managing director, becomes managing
director, property, and Christopher Strickland, construction director,
becomes development director. These changes take effect immediately.
