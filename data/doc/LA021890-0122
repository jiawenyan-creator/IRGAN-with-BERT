PARKS PROPOSITION AND IRVINE'S FUTURE 
Something is happening on March 6 that will have a great impact on our city. 
Irvine voters will decide whether to add to the system of parks, recreational 
and cultural opportunities we now enjoy. 
In 1974, the voters of Irvine looked to the future. The two bond issues they 
passed, the Parks Bond by 73.8% and the Bike Trail Bond by 71.9%, created 
today's park and recreation facilities in Irvine. 
Thanks to these visionary voters, we now have parks, lighted ball fields, 
community centers, an Olympic Aquatic Complex, the Fine Arts Center and the 
soon-to-open Irvine Theatre. 
Now it is our turn to look to the future, just as Irvine's voters did in 1974. 
It's our turn to ensure that our parents, children and children's children will 
continue to be well-served by the city of Irvine. 
On March 6, we will be voting on "Proposition Parks," a ballot proposal that 
will authorize money to build new projects, enhance existing ones, and provide 
funds to maintain and operate the new facilities without need for any further 
tax increases. 
"Proposition Parks" is a comprehensive, full-spectrum proposal with a total of 
27 projects planned throughout Irvine. The cost to each Irvine household will 
be $10 per month, or about 33 cents per day, per household. This is a "total 
cost package" that includes all construction costs, maintenance costs and 
operational costs. It is a package that guarantees each project's quality. 
The choice is ours to make. For 33 cents a day we can buy a can of soda for our 
household, or we can add parks, biking/hiking/riding trails, cultural 
activities, more lighted athletic fields, and landscaped park areas for picnics 
and activities for all our citizens.
