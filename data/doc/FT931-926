FT  27 MAR 93 / Security high for Lesotho poll
Soldiers guarded shops and government buildings in Maseru yesterday amid
fears of violence on the eve of Lesotho's first general election in 23
years, Reuter reports from Maseru.
The military government declared a holiday, sent voters home to outlying
constituencies and tightened security before today's vote.
In Maseru, capital of the tiny mountain kingdom encircled by South Africa,
troops were on guard to prevent a repeat of the violence in the last
election in 1970 when about 500 people died in clashes between the two main
parties.
