METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN RAPED, LOCKED IN CAR TRUNK 
Two men were being held for questioning Monday in the kidnaping, beating and 
rape of a Downey woman who was attacked after her assailants deliberately 
rammed their car into hers to get her to pull off the freeway. 
The woman's ordeal, which began at 1:30 a.m. Saturday on the 605 Freeway in 
Norwalk, did not end until 4 p.m. Sunday, when she was found locked inside the 
trunk of a 1969 Ford Futura that the assailants had abandoned in Wilmington. 
She had been in the car trunk more than 30 hours, according to a sheriff's 
deputy, who said the woman's pounding on the trunk caught the attention of a 
passer-by. 
Information from an anonymous tipster to the Signal Hill Police Department led 
investigators Monday to the woman's car and the two suspects, Deputy Detta 
Roberts said. 
Roberts said the abduction occurred after the woman drove off the 605 Freeway 
at the Imperial Highway exit and got out of her car.
