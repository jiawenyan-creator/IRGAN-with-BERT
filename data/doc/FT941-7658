FT  24 FEB 94 / Unpaid miners threaten strike
Russian coal miners, many of them unpaid for months, are to demonstrate
outside government buildings, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Boris
Kravchenko, of the independent coal miners' union, said: 'If these measures
prove ineffective, then we'll stop all coal supplies. Then, if the
government still refuses to negotiate and to pay its debt, we'll raise the
question of declaring a general strike.' Miners are owed more than Dollars
300m, he said.
