  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Rakitic, 
head of the Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia] deputies group 
in the Citizens Chamber of the Federal Assembly, told 
journalists today that a group of 11 Depos deputies are forming 
a political party that will retain the name of this movement but 
will operate independently. 
  The Democratic Movement of Serbia expelled from its ranks 11 
Depos deputies in the Federal Assembly's Chamber of Citizens 
after the last elections. However, on the basis of legal 
regulations, up to now they have retained their mandates as 
deputies. 
  The nucleus of the new party, its "interim president" 
Rakitic 
said, is at this moment made up of 11 Depos deputies in the 
Citizens Chamber, coalition deputies from the previous Serbian 
Assembly, distinguished members of the Main Committee of the 
Serbian Renewal Movement that are no longer in this party, as 
well as numerous nonparty people. [passage omitted]
