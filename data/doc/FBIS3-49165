  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- Oil from Ukraine is 
flowing into Slovakia on the Latorica River, and the Slovak 
Accident Commission estimates that the flow is expected to 
continue for about two more days, Stanislav Vikartovsky, manager 
of the Kralovsky Chlmec (East Slovakia) Civil Defense 
Department, told CTK. 
  The site of the accident is about eighty kilometers from the 
Slovak border, near the city of Mukachevo in Sub-Carpathian Rus, 
where a pipeline has ruptured. 
  Vikartovsky refuted media reports that the river is covered 
by a layer of oil 20-25 centimeters deep. These reports are 
exaggerated, he said. He reported that three underwater walls 
have been built in the river in Slovakia to catch the oil. 
However, some of the polluted water is flowing into Hungary. 
  He also said that Slovakia is trying to obtain more 
information on the extent of the spill near Mukachevo, but very 
little information from Ukraine has been received so far. 
  Because the river has overflowed its banks, samples of well 
water are being tested in surrounding communities. So far no 
oil contamination has been found in well water, Vikartovsky said. 
  Last October, the East Slovak Uh River and its surroundings 
were polluted by an oil spill on the Ukrainian side. To this 
day, wells in the area are contaminated with oil, and 
inhabitants must get water from other sources. However, Ukraine 
did not inform Slovak authorities at all. The situation is 
complicated by the lack of a Slovak-Ukrainian agreement on 
common rivers, as exists between Slovakia and Hungary.
