  [Text] The threat of a countrywide police strike has been 
averted by a Transitional Executive Council agreement in 
principle on pay parity between all police forces in the country 
after the election. However, the South African Police Union is 
still negotiating with the TEC for a R61.50 [rand] daily 
election allowance in addition to a R21.50 a day police 
allowance.
