GOP SENATORS AGREE TO OFFER A NEW DRUG PLAN 
Republican senators, following six hours of negotiations with Democrats, agreed 
late Thursday to take a new plan for financing the war on drugs to the White 
House for consideration. 
Sources said the plan contained some of the selected cuts in spending the Bush 
Administration had wanted as a way to offset increases in the drug program as 
well as an across-the-board reduction in federal programs to raise the bulk of 
the money. 
Republicans said they would not consider the plan a tentative agreement without 
White House approval and they indicated that there was no rush on the part of 
the Administration to provide that. 
"We've been on the phone to (White House chief of staff John H.) Sununu all 
night," Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) said as he emerged from the negotiations 
along with other tired senators. 
Republicans said they would take the plan to the White House today and then 
reconvene their negotiations with the Democrats. Senators declined to comment 
on specifics of the plan.
