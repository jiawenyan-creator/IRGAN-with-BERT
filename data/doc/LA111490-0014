EL TORO KEYS ON STONE, BEATS THOUSAND OAKS TO ADVANCE IN PLAYOFFS 
It's not often a coach will attack one of the opposing team's best players. But 
that's exactly what El Toro assistant coach Kim Jagd suggested the Chargers do 
to Thousand Oaks' Aimee Stone. 
And it worked like a charm. 
El Toro (18-3) overcame an opening-game loss to the Lancers (18-4) and rallied 
to win 12-15, 15-5, 15-7, 15-10 and advance to the Southern Section 5A 
semifinals. 
"We were picking up what they did offensively and my wife (assistant coach Kim 
Jagd) figured out that No. 4 (Stone) had a lot of offensive responsibility," El 
Toro head coach Mike Jagd said. "So we served at her hoping making the passes 
and still hitting would put pressure on her.' 
It worked as Stone had trouble handling the serves, forced bad passes, and had 
trouble with kills as well. 
"It really takes me time to adjust to things," said Stone, who finished the 
game with 14 kills and five digs. "I'll hit 20 kills the same way before I 
adjust. I've got to, or should have learned that." 
The Chargers, ranked second in the final section poll, were led by Michelle 
Mauney, who had 14 kills, 10 blocks, 13 digs and four aces. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI
