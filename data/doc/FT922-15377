FT  01 APR 92 / Commercial users seen to gain from road pricing
COMMERCIAL transport operators stand to gain most from the introduction of
road pricing in the UK's towns and cities, according to a study published
yesterday by the Chartered Institute of Transport.
Car users at the upper and lower ends of the income ranges were more likely
to benefit from road pricing - charging motorists electronically for the
road space they use - than those in the middle income range.
The report is published as a three-year programme of research commissioned
by the government gets under way to see whether a road pricing scheme could
help in reducing urban congestion.
Although all vehicles would have to pay on urban roads, the cost for
lorries, vans and taxis would be balanced by savings from shorter journey
times, more predictable traffic conditions and easier kerbside loading and
unloading, the report says.
Institute figures suggest that half the benefits of road pricing in London
would accrue to commercial traffic, which would pay less than a third of the
charges.
For bus operators, the charges would be substantially less than the savings
from shorter running times, smaller fleets, greater reliability and
additional revenue from passengers who would leave their cars at home.
Wealthier individuals would be more willing to pay charges to benefit from
reduced congestion, it says. Low income families unable to afford cars could
benefit from improved public transport. The greatest inconvenience would be
to car owners unable to afford the road charges and who would have to change
their travel arrangements.
