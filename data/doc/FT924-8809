FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: International community must back Somalia relief
effort
Sir, Given the tense situation currently prevailing in Somalia, it is vital
to correct an inaccuracy in Julian Ozanne's report ('Somali gunmen hold aid
agencies to ransom as thousands starve to death', November 6). Only six of
Save the Children's feeding centres have been affected by the current strike
by feeding supervisors, not 12 as Mr Ozanne asserts.
Save the Children does not believe that this strike has been politically
inspired by General Aideed or by any other political leader. The strike is
over the level of incentives paid to the staff and is not related to threats
against the United Nations or other agencies.
Mr Ozanne is right to be alarmed about the increasing insecurity which
threatens the relief effort as a whole. World attention must not fall off at
this crucial time: indeed, authoritative leadership from the international
community is required now more than ever.
