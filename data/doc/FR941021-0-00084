SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background




On July 26, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget published revisions to OMB Circular A21 (58 FR 39996) which
include an increase in the period of time for which predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions
may be applicable. Pending revision of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to conform the language to the revised
OMB Circular, the Defense FAR Supplement is amended to permit use of predetermined indirect cost rates for educational
institutions for periods of up to four years.

The Director, Defense Procurement, issued this final DFARS rule by Departmental Letter 94018, October 18,
1994, to expedite DoD implementation of this revision.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



DoD certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the rule merely implements OMB Circular A21 as
it relates to predetermined indirect cost rates for educational institutions.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this final rule does not impose any new recordkeeping, information
collection requirements, or collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.
