Station Call Sign Administrators for Club and Military Recreation Stations




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action vacates the rule provisions that established private entity club call sign administrators and reinstates
prior rules. A new proposal regarding call signs will meet the need for persons interested in obtaining a club station
license. Hence, it is not necessary to retain the club call sign administrator rules adopted in an earlier action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order





1. On May 11, 1993, final rules were adopted that established call sign administrators for club and military recreation
stations in the amateur service. Subsequently, a petition for reconsideration was filed in which it was argued that
the establishment of such administrators was not minor and non-controversial and that a notice and comment proceeding
should have been held before final rules were adopted.


2. Further, the Commission is activating a new automated licensing system that will enable it to perform, with minimal
burden, the function that administrators in the private sector were going to perform without reimbursement. Also,
a new proposal by the Commission regarding call signs will meet the need of persons interested in obtaining a club station
license.


3. Because there appears to be merit in the argument that the establishment of administrators is controversial, and
because the new proposal will meet the need of persons interested in the club station licenses, the rule provisions
that established private entity club call sign administrators can be vacated.


4. Accordingly, by this action, the rules establishing administrators are vacated, the prior rules are reinstated,
and the petition for reconsideration is granted.

5. The amended rules are set forth at the end of this document.

6. The amended rules have been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 35013520,
and found to contain no new or modified form, information collection and/or record retention requirements, and will
not increase or decrease burden hours imposed on the public.

7. This Memorandum Opinion and Order and the rule amendments are issued under the authority of 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303(r),
and 405(a).
