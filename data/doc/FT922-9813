FT  06 MAY 92 / Letter: BT idea of level playing field a bar to new
competitors
Sir, While I support the recent call to Oftel from the National Consumer
Council and the Consumers' Association to impose a price cut on BT ('Oftel
is urged to order BT price cut', April 30), it raises a more fundamental
issue.
The Telecommunications Act 1984 places upon the secretary of state and the
director-general duties, among others, to 'promote the interest of
consumers' and 'to maintain and promote effective competition'.
As the director of a company that has recently submitted an application to
the Department of Trade and Industry for a public telecommunications licence
to operate in competition with BT, I too have an interest in seeing that BT
reduces its prices now.
Left to itself, BT will not do so until forced by competition. Not only is
such a delay against consumers' interests, but given BT's market dominance,
it will, by definition, have an impact on new competitors at the very point
when they are vulnerable to being still-born or ineffective in quickly
eroding market share.
For too long BT has argued that 'promotion of competition' involves the
creation of a level playing field on which it and new market entrants should
compete on equal terms. This is a beguiling but fallacious argument that has
permitted BT to pursue a corporate policy broadly aimed at preserving its
dominant position.
The director-general of Oftel should abandon his attempts to control the
increase in price of BT's services in favour of accelerating the
availability of services to consumers at reduced prices, from whatever
supplier. He should afford BT the opportunity of immediately increasing or
reducing the price of any of its services during this current price review,
but prohibit it from making any further price changes until it has lost a
substantial share of the relevant market sector.
