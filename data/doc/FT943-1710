FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Canal Plus shares fall sharply
after warning on second half
Shares in Canal Plus, the French media and pay-TV company, fell sharply
yesterday, losing FFr25 to FFr874, following a fall in first-half profits
and a warning on full-year results.
Mr Claude Ravilly, finance director, told a meeting of financial analysts
that full-year net profits would be in the region of FFr900m (Dollars
167.91m) compared with FFr1.2bn last year and original estimates of FFr1bn
for 1994.
His comments followed the announcement on Tuesday night of first-half
results, which showed a 25.6 per cent decline to FFr503m. Revenues rose from
FFr4.28bn to FFr4.58bn.
According to Canal Plus, the decline in profits reflected losses from
associated companies, a swing from net interest income to net interest costs
arising from depressed financial markets, and the impact of promotional
campaigns.
It said first-half trends in revenues, operating income and net income are
likely to remain in the second half. Net income will continue to be affected
by the cost of new projects, notably in Germany, where a major promotional
campaign, unforeseen at the start of the year, is under way.
According to Canal Plus, net income will also be affected if financial
markets maintain their current direction. A supplementary charge of about
FFr100m is also expected to be taken, partly to cover a rise in costs at the
company's Spanish channel, Canal Plus Espagne.
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, the recently merged French stores group, said
first-half net profit rose to FFr407m compared with FFr189m a year earlier,
agencies report from Paris.
The company added that it would sell 1.28m shares next week in a public sale
to part-finance the acquisition of a stake in FNAC, the French specialist
retailer. Pinault has had the shares on its books as treasury stock.
