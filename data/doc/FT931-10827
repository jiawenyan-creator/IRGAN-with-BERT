FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: SGS-Thomson returns to profit
SGS-THOMSON, the Franco-Italian state-owned semiconductor group, yesterday
revealed that it swung into a Dollars 3m net profit last year from a Dollars
102.6m loss in 1991, and forecast a substantial improvement in 1993.
Mr Pasquale Pistorio, group president, said the group, the world's
13th-largest chip maker, had increased its share of the global semiconductor
market slightly to 2.7 per cent from 2.5 per cent in 1991. The company,
which is in its fifth year, said it needed to nearly double that to ensure
long-term survival.
The world semiconductor market will nearly triple in size to Dollars 170bn
from Dollars 60bn over this period, the group estimated. That implied that
SGS-Thomson's sales needed to increase more than five-fold to Dollars 8.5bn
over the next seven years from last year's Dollars 1.6bn. Group sales rose
by 12 per cent last year, two points ahead of the market.
