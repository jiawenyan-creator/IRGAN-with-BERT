FT  20 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Labour backed over stance
on Post Office sell-off
Liberal Democrats pledged yesterday to join Labour in fighting the
government's plans for Post Office privatisation.
Delegates forecast a decisive role for the party's 23 MPs as Mr Nick Harvey,
MP for North Devon, said a growing number of Tory backbenchers representing
rural constituencies were in favour of keeping the Post Office in the public
sector.
He said: 'They realise that the government risks not only destroying the
Post Office but also any hopes they may have of holding their seats at the
next general election.'
A motion condemning the proposed privatisation and calling for the Post
Office to be given access to private-sector capital to fund new development
was approved unanimously. It advocated a more 'arm's length' relationship
between Royal Mail and the government, with the Treasury entitled to a
dividend on its shareholding.
Demands that the privatised water industry should be restored to public
control were defeated after a warning that the cost of compensating
shareholders could amount to Pounds 10bn.
Mr Matthew Taylor, MP for Truro and the party's environment spokesman, said
if such a large sum were available it ought to be spent on education, the
health service, housing the homeless or creating jobs for the unemployed.
The debate was dominated by protests about the substantial increases in
water charges since privatisation and the excessive salaries and share
options obtained by executives of the water companies.
Delegates approved a motion calling for a stricter regulatory regime to
reduce 'excessive profits', and for dividend restraint.
