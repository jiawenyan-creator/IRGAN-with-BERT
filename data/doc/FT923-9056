FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Bayerische Vereinsbank's profits
up 28 per cent
BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, one of Bavaria's two largest banks, yesterday
rounded off the German banks' half year reporting season by announcing a 28
per cent rise in partial operating profits, the biggest increase of any of
the country's big banks.
This figure, excluding any contribution from the bank's own account trading,
rose to DM681m from the DM534m a year earlier. It did not report total
operating profits.
The group balance sheet total grew by 5.6 per cent to DM239bn, reflecting
what it termed lively credit demand in normal banking and mortgage business.
An important factor was the growth of its activities in eastern Germany,
where it has 53 branches and granted credits of DM5.4bn.
Parent bank earnings on interest rose by 14.8 per cent to DM1.09bn compared
with half the figure for the whole of 1992, while fee income climbed 7.5 per
cent to DM253.5m.
