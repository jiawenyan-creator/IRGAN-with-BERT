FT  20 NOV 93 / Brussels fans the urge to converge
EU MEMBER states have laid strong foundations for economic and monetary
union, but further efforts will be needed to maintain the momentum of
convergence, according to the European Commission.
It calls for 'decisive action' to reduce budgetary imbalances, and urges
states to reject 'go-it-alone' economic, monetary or commercial policies
which might undermine the single market.
The Commission will present its report on convergence and the implementation
of the single market to EU finance ministers on Monday. The Maastricht
treaty, which came into force on November 1, requires Brussels to assess the
progress made in the first stage of Emu, before next January 1, when stage
two will begin.
The report contains a staunch defence of the single market programme, which
has been criticised for not delivering all the promised benefits. It claims
that legislative steps already taken 'will be sufficient to trigger the bulk
of the competitive and resource allocation gains which will flow from
internal market completion'.
However, the Commission concedes that those improvements have been obscured
by the effects of recession, which has led to increased unemployment and
stalled the process by which poorer countries are supposed to catch up with
the wealthier.
The report highlights continued difficulties in meeting Maastricht criteria
on public finances. It points out that only Ireland and Luxembourg are on
course to meet the 3 per cent target for budget deficit as a proportion of
gross domestic product by 1996. The EU average is 6.4 per cent, higher than
at the start of the decade.
The Commission also warns that if exchange rates are not managed carefully,
'sudden changes in relative competitiveness. . . . could generate demands
for safeguard restrictions on cross-border trade', undermining the single
market.
