  [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- A.D. Vengerovsky, 
vice-chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party and deputy speaker 
of the state Duma of the Federation Council of Russia, who had 
visited the DPRK gave his impressions of Korea at a press 
conference in Moscow on April 20. 
  He told newsmen Pyongyang is a clean, magnificent and 
beautiful city incomparable to any city in Europe. 
  "The monuments, cultural facilities, the metro, apartment 
houses and other architectures struck us with admiration," he 
said. 
  "Free medical service and free education are in force, no 
one 
knows what tax is like and the level of cultural development is 
fairly high in Korea," said the vice-chairman of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia. 
  "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea," he continued, 
"is advancing along the course of self-reliant development, and 
the chuche idea is a symbol of Korea." 
  He contended that Korea must be reunified not by means of 
war 
but in accordance with the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation for the reunification of the country put 
forward by President Kim Il-song. 
  He demanded the West renounce pressure on the DPRK over the 
"nuclear issue."
