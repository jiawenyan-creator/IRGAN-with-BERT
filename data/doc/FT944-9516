FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: News Corp 'lifts stake' in John
Fairfax
News Corp, Mr Rupert Murdoch's global media group, has lifted its stake in
John Fairfax Holdings to about 3 per cent, according to an article in the
Fairfax-owned Australian Financial Review newspaper, Reuter reports from
Sydney. The Financial Review said News Corp was understood to have bought
7.3m shares, representing about 1 per cent of Fairfax, earlier this month
for ADollars 23m (USDollars 17.3m).
In July, News Corp revealed it had bought a stake in Australia's oldest
newspaper publisher. The total stake is below the 5 per cent substantial
shareholder notice that has to be lodged with the Australian Stock Exchange.
Fairfax is 15 per cent owned by Mr Kerry Packer's Publishing and
Broadcasting and 25 per cent by Mr Conrad Black's The Telegraph group in the
UK.
