VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
SHAKE-ROOF HOUSE DESTROYED IN FIRE 
A Thousand Oaks couple in their early 70s lost most of their shake-roof home in 
a fire Friday night after a hose broke on their propane barbecue grill, 
officials said. 
Flames had consumed the home of Lowell and Bonnie Meachan at 3193 Camino 
Graciosa when firefighters arrived shortly after 6 p.m., said Alison Schember, 
spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department. Damage was estimated at 
$100,000 to the house and $35,000 to the contents, Schember said. 
A motor home was moved from the driveway without damage, she said. 
About 34 firefighters answered the call and extinguished the fire in about an 
hour, she said.
