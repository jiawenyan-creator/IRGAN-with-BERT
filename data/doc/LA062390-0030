DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BALBOA EXITS CLOSED THROUGH WEEKEND 
The Ventura Freeway eastbound and westbound off-ramps at Balboa Boulevard will 
be closed until 5 a.m. Monday, the state Department of Transportation has 
announced. 
The closings, which began at 10 p.m. Friday, will permit crews to replace 
asphalt on the ramps with concrete, a Caltrans spokesman said. 
In a $37-million project, the freeway is being widened to 10 lanes from 
Universal City to Woodland Hills. 
Completion is scheduled for early 1992.
