FT  28 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate comments keep
Paris in check
MOST Continental bourses will be closed today for the Ascension Day holiday.
Anticipation of that, and the end of the month left share prices with little
in the way of initiative yesterday, and weakness in Wall Street and Tokyo
overnight was another depressant, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was still affected by comments on Tuesday by the economics minister,
Mr Michel Sapin, suggesting that there would be no immediate cut in interest
rates. The CAC-40 index closed down 15.49 at 2,014.09 in turnover of
FFr2.2bn.
Among banks Societe Generale lost FFr14 to FFr519 while Paribas shed FFr6.0
to FFr409.9 as the chairman noted that the pace of economic recovery would
dictate the group's own performance this year.
Both Eurotunnel and Euro Disney had bad days, the former after comments on
Tuesday by one of its contractors that the project remained under financial
pressure and the latter on news that the theme park has been experiencing
fewer local visitors. Eurotunnel fell FFr1.90 to FFr35.95, and Euro Disney
by FFr2.80 to FFr123.5.
LVMH had another disappointing day, losing FFr76 to FFr4,009. However, Elf
bucked the trend, gaining FFr3.50 to FFr401.9, while Total advanced 10
centimes to FFr267.90 in heavy volume of more than 1m shares. Together the
two oil groups accounted for some 20 per cent of market volume.
Among pharmaceuticals Sanofi declined FFr39 or 3.4 per cent to FFr1,107 on
disappointing first quarter sales in the US of its Ticlid drug.
FRANKFURT eased for the second day running in a continuing consolidation. A
rumour from abroad that the German Chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl would resign -
denied by Bonn - also hit most blue chip stocks.
But there was little selling pressure as the DAX index closed 12.61 lower at
1,794.05 after a 6.44 fall to 718.82 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume fell
from DM7.6bn to DM5.7bn.
Below the top rank, the chemicals and basic materials group, Degussa, closed
DM8 lower at DM366, reflecting its lower first half sales rather than its
better than expected second quarter earnings. Retailers were generally
weaker than average, Horten falling DM4.50 to DM198 after a management board
member said that earnings and parent company sales had declined in the first
five months of this year.
In banks, Commerzbank closed DM2 lower at DM271 despite higher operating
profits for the first four months of 1992, and hopes of a higher dividend.
Among yesterday's few gainers the tyremaker, Continental, rose DM2.50 to
DM276 as the market waited for a Hanover judicial ruling, perhaps tomorrow,
on the validity of Conti's long-standing limitations on shareholder voting
rights.
ZURICH and STOCKHOLM both closed early ahead of today's holiday, and both
fell. Swiss shares closed broadly lower on quiet business, the SMI index
dropping 10.3 to 1,914.2, and although Swedish banks recovered a little the
Affarsvarlden General index ended 5.3 down at 985.9.
The Swiss cement producer, Holderbank, saw its bearers SFr210 higher at
SFr5,150, topping the active list after Tuesday's forecast of a substantial
upturn, and possibly a higher dividend for the current year.
AMSTERDAM was weaker, the CBS Tendency index finishing down 0.6 at 130.3.
Hoogovens slipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 58.00 on news that it is to cut raw iron and
steel output while Royal Dutch moved up Fl 1.20 to Fl 159.80. The chemical
groups, Akzo and DSM, were hit by the prospect of higher oil prices, losing
Fl 1.10 and 90 cents respectively to Fl 159.10 and Fl 114.90.
MADRID slipped in turnover of Pta10bn, the general index closing 0.89 lower
at 258.01. The half-day general strike set for today is expected to have
scant effect on the market, since the stoppage ends at noon and the Madrid
bourse opens daily at 11am.
BRUSSELS managed a rise in spite of an hour's interruption in trading
because of a bomb alert. The Bel-20 index closed up 3.03 at 1,230.80 in
turnover of BFr919m.
Delhaize was BFr10 higher at BFr8,990 ahead of reporting a rise in first
quarter earnings of 15 per cent while Petrofina eased BFr25 to BFr10,825.
COPENHAGEN's all-share index rose 2.40 to 341.74 on growing expectations
that Danes will vote to ratify the EC Maastricht treaty in their June 2
referendum.
The gains followed an opinion poll on Tuesday evening showing a swing to a
41-39 per cent majority backing the treaty, after a month with a majority of
No votes.
OSLO gained strength from higher oil prices and the all-share index closed
up 2.12 to 449.92 in turnover of NKr542.7m.
