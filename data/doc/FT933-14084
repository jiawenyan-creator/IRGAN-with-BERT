FT  16 JUL 93 / French Foreign Ministry's 'preferences' for Bosnia
The French Foreign Ministry yesterday expressed its 'preference' for the
United Nations to draw peacekeeping troops for Bosnia from countries 'which
already have experience of this kind of mission,' a definition that would
exclude Iran and some other Islamic states that have offered troops to
protect Moslems in the Balkan republic, writes David Buchan in Paris.
France yesterday also dispatched eight Jaguar ground attack jets to Italy,
where it has already based 10 air defence Mirages and five reconnaissance
Mirages for possible use in protecting French and other UN troops in Bosnia.
