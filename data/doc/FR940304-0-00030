SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 180.1(h) (40 CFR 180.1(h)) provides a listing of general commodity terms and listing of EPA's interpretation
of those terms as they apply to tolerances and exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for pesticide chemicals
under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a. General commodities are listed in column
A of 40 CFR 180.1(h), and the corresponding specific commodities, for which tolerances and exemptions from the requirement
of a tolerance established for the general commodity apply, are listed in column B. As noted in the proposal published
in the 

Federal Register

 of November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62074), the Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment
Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, requested that 40 CFR 180.1(h) be amended as follows:
(1) To add the commodity term ``sorghum (grain)'' to the general category of commodities in column A and to add the corresponding
specific commodities ``

Sorghum

 spp. [sorghum (grain), sundangrass (seed crop), and hybrids of these grown for its seed]'' to column B; and (2) to add
the commodity term ``sorghum (fodder, forage)'' to the general category of commodities in column A and to add the corresponding
specific commodities ``

Sorghum

 spp. [sorghum (fodder, forage), sudangrass, and hybrids of these grown for fodder and/or forage]'' to column B. 


There were no comments received in response to the proposed rule. 
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that it is appropriate to add definitions for the
commodity terms ``sorghum grain'' and ``sorghum fodder and forage'' in 40 CFR 180.1(h). Therefore, the added definitions
are established as set forth below.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
Although this regulation does not establish or raise a tolerance level or establish an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance, the impact of the regulation would be the same as establishing new tolerances or exemptions from the
requirement of a tolerance. Therefore, the Administrator concludes that this rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
