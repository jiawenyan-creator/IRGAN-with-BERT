BRIEFLY 
Graduates Urged to Consider Manufacturing Jobs: Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita 
told graduates of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School that 
manufacturing is the foundation of a nations's economy, and he urged them to 
consider jobs in that sector. "I am not a believer in the idea of a 
post-industrial society," said Morita. 
"For me, the very essence of business . . . is manufacturing." When Morita 
asked how many of the 840 recipients of Masters of Business Administration 
degrees from the prestigious business school planned to enter manufacturing, 
only about 50 raised their hands. "I would hope half of the MBA people would go 
into manufacturing," Morita told reporters at a news conference following his 
commencement address. Morita received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from 
the Ivy League university.
