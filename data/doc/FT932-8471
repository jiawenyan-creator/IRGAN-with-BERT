FT  19 MAY 93 / Faster electricity growth forecast
AN ACCELERATION in the growth of demand for electricity in England and Wales
over the rest of this decade is forecast by the electricity industry.
The National Grid Company's annual collation of forecasts by the regional
electricity companies yesterday pointed to an annual average increase of 1.6
per cent compared with the 1.1 per cent forecast in last year's report.
It says that a number of prospective power generation projects have been
cancelled. As a result the large surplus of generating capacity of 60 per
cent foreshadowed by last year's report has been cut.
The surplus now appears to peak at between 24 per cent and 37 per cent in
1995-96, depending on the scenarios used. The uncertainty depends to some
extent on whether the large number of gas-fired power stations on the
drawing board would actually go ahead. Also unknown is the number of
potential closures of ageing coal-fired and first generation nuclear power
stations.
Mr Eric Eunson, the general manager of power systems development, said that
there was still a shortage of power generation capacity in the south of
England, and this created bottlenecks in the grid.
The NGC has proposed ways of hedging against possible shortages to make the
grid more commercially sensitive to strains in the system.
