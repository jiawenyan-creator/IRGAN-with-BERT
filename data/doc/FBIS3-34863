  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--The security agencies have 
delivered a good preemptive strike at the elements of terrorism 
and subversion based on a security strategy of taking the 
initiative in all security operations, which has evolved into a 
pattern of dealing with fugitive terrorists to foil their 
criminal plots. 
  Yesterday's preemptive strike against a number of terrorists 
has confirmed that all branches of the security authorities are 
working within a framework of complete coordination and 
cooperation to confront these terrorists and place them under 
constant attack. The strike was also a message to other 
fugitive terrorists, warning them that any acts they might 
commit are doomed to fail, especially in light of the prevailing 
national unity and the complete popular support for the security 
agencies and all their actions. 
  This preemptive strike is the fourth of its kind to take 
place in the center of a heavily populated poor neighborhood, in 
which no citizen or policeman was hit. 
  The first blow was the arrest of nine terrorists who carried 
out the failed attempt to assassinate the prime minister on 25 
November, during which not a single shot was fired. They are 
currently being tried by a military tribunal. 
  The second blow was in the al-Ma'sarah incident during 
security sweeps in the area where two terrorists were killed and 
two others, one of whom was a Palestinian, were arrested. In 
this incident a dangerous terrorist named Tharwat Hajjaj managed 
to escape, only to meet his death yesterday along with two 
others in a clash in the al- Sayyidah Zaynab neighborhood. 
  The third blow was delivered in the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' 
area 
late in January against terrorist hideouts, in which seven 
dangerous terrorists, known as the Asyut group, were killed and 
no civilians or security men were hit.
