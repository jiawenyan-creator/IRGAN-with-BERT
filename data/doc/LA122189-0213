WORLD; 
MOST REFUSENIKS TO BE ALLOWED TO EMIGRATE, SOVIET DEPUTY SAYS 
Foreign Ministry officials today told American Jewish leaders attending the 
first national congress of Soviet Jews in nearly 70 years that most of the 
country's estimated 100 remaining refuseniks will be allowed to emigrate. 
Martin Wenick, executive director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, 
said the news about the refuseniks, Jews repeatedly refused permission to 
emigrate, came from Anatoly Adamishin, a deputy foreign minister. 
Adamishin told Wenick and other representatives of the American group that a 
"substantial" number of the refuseniks who had been barred from emigrating 
because of access to state secrets will soon be told they can leave. 
A Western diplomat who closely follows the refusenik issue said he heard the 
same report but cautioned that the Soviets had not officially notified the 
refuseniks. "We hope it's true, but let's wait and see," said the diplomat.
