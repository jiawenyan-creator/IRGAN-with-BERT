FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Carr's Milling exceeds Pounds
600,000
FIRST-HALF profits from Carr's Milling Industries outstripped the whole of
the previous year. Although there will be a slowdown in the second period,
the directors said the figure should comfortably exceed that of 1991-92.
In the six months ended February 27 1993 sales slipped Pounds 138,000 to
almost Pounds 35m, but pre-tax profit surged from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds
610,000. The second term of last year produced Pounds 152,000. Adjustment
has been made for sales of the discontinued egg activities.
The agriculture side increased sales and profits significantly with all
sectors trading ahead of last year.
Flour milling started well with price increases offsetting rising costs. But
effective devaluation of sterling and the CAP agrimonetary system had a
detrimental impact on raw material prices and will continue so in the second
half.
Intense competition on prices in the bread baking industry continued,
although cost cutting helped mitigate the effect. The engineering and
restaurant businesses produced satisfactory results.
Earnings per share came to 6.1p (1.2p), while the interim dividend is
unchanged at 1p.
