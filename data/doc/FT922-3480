FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Kredietbank expands overseas
KREDIETBANK, which usually presents itself as the most regional of the three
big Belgian banks, wants to put on a more international face, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
Announcing the opening of new branch offices in Manchester, Dublin,
Maastricht, Berlin, Paris and Moscow, Mr Marcel Cockaerts, chairman, said:
'We want to grow in concentric circles (around Belgium).'
Mr Cockaerts told the bank's annual press conference that a 'strong home
base is the point of departure for a growing international activity in a
unifying Europe'.
The bank wants to build a network of subsidiaries in neighbouring countries
and a presence in other countries if warranted.
The new policy is already reflected in the balance sheet: at the end of
March, 47.1 per cent of non-consolidated assets were foreign, up from 43 per
cent a year ago and 38 per cent in 1987.
'In volume, foreign transactions are now as important as domestic ones,' Mr
Cockaerts said.
He said domestic retail banking still accounted for two-thirds of the bank's
net profit, with the other one-third coming from banking abroad and
professional business.
However, slower earnings growth from domestic banking would hit
Kredietbank's 1992 profit growth, he said.
'The pressure on our Belgian francs interest rate margin has increased,' Mr
Cockaerts said. He said that, unlike last year, Kredietbank would not be
able to fully compensate the rising cost of client deposits with a higher
margin on lending rates.
He said net profits in 1992 would increase, but not by as much as the 21 per
cent jump to BFr7.4bn (Dollars 226m) in 1991-92.
The banks plans to change its financial year-end to December. This year's
accounting period will this run for nine months.
