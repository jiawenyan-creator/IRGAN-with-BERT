FT  10 MAR 93 / NatWest admits Visa bills errors
NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday admitted that thousands of payments on
its Visa credit cards had been switched among accounts. It said it was not
sure if it would be able to identify the errors unless each customer
complained.
The bank said it believed 'human error' was to blame for the application of
payments to the wrong accounts which had taken place in January. It was
correcting errors as customers complained about their accounts.
The mix-up follows mistakes over payments on credit cards from NatWest and
other banks in August. These occurred when First Data Resources, which
processes transactions on several banks' behalf, changed computer software.
National Westminster said it had not yet identified where the error had
taken place. Cheques to pay accounts are sent to its London cheque clearing
centre before information is passed on to First Data Resources for
processing.
The bank said the number of errors was in the 'low thousands'. They came to
light after complaints from customers who had received statements containing
wrongly applied payments.
NatWest said it was still investigating what had occurred.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association, said
the error showed that banks were failing to vet statements and relying on
customer complaints.
