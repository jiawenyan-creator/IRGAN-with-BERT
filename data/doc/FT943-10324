FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible sells Holt Lloyd
Morgan Crucible, the speciality materials group, will raise up to Pounds
63.5m from the long-awaited sale of its Holt Lloyd car care business to a
management buy-out.
Dr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the disposal would bring Morgan
Crucible's gearing down from about 66 per cent to 'the low thirties', but
the company plans to invest some Pounds 40m in the second half on bolt-on
acquisitions.
The car care business, which includes Turtle Wax polish and other consumer
products, was acquired in 1987, when Morgan Crucible bought Holt Lloyd
International for Pounds 85m.
Holt Lloyd's LPs and Kert industrial chemical businesses were subsequently
absorbed into Morgan Crucible, and are expected to make profits of about
Pounds 6.5m this year.
Dr Farmer said that 'if we'd been according to plan, (the car business)
would have been sold in 1990', but profits slumped during the recession.
However, profits doubled last year to Pounds 8.2m.
The buy-out was led by Electra, which provided Pounds 37m of equity. The
Bank of Scotland put together Pounds 26m of debt and a further Pounds 9m of
working capital facilities. The management will retain a 'significant'
stake.
Morgan Crucible will receive Pounds 60m cash, and a further Pounds 3.5m if
certain performance criteria are met. This compares with Holt Lloyd's asset
value of Pounds 18.1m. In addition, Morgan Crucible will receive Pounds 9.4m
through the repayment of Holt Lloyd's outstanding debt. Of this sum, Pounds
6m will be paid through a loan note.
Dr Farmer said Morgan Crucible had examined trade sales and flotations for
the company, but the MBO had offered the best return to shareholders.
The deal will result in an exceptional profit of approximately Pounds 3m,
under FRS 3 accounting policy.
