FT  14 JUL 92 / Observer: Play it again
The Bank of Boston is doing its bit to encourage more voters to register
their preferences in this year's presidential elections - and, incidentally,
to boost new business at the same time. Yesterday, it introduced a
certificate of deposit - imaginatively entitled the 'Washington CD' - that
will pay out a higher return to holders if election day voter turnout in the
state exceeds 1988 levels.
The CD, which will carry a 5.25 per cent interest rate in December, will pay
out 5.35 per cent if more than the 82 per cent of Massachusetts-registered
voters who turned out at the last election make it to the polling booths on
November 3.
