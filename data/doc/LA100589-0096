HISTORICAL DISTRICT IS NOT WARRANTED 
This is in regard to your Sept. 24 article, "Landmark List Grows Quickly as 
Long Beach Hails Heritage." 
The city of Long Beach has a tendency to embark on zoning changes when only a 
minority of residents have voted on a special issue. With only 43% of 
California Heights residents voting, Long Beach is considering designating my 
neighborhood a historical district. This "wholesale" designation of California 
Heights is not warranted. The homes here were built over the last 50 or more 
years and are not like the Carroll Park area where the architecture is 
distinct. 
Instead of designating the entire neighborhood, they should seriously consider 
doing it by structure as mentioned in your article. The historical district 
designation will only discriminate against homeowners who cannot keep their 
homes to the standards decided by the affluent members of the Cultural Heritage 
Commission. The new designation will act to keep out marginal homeowners and 
create a neighborhood where only the rich can live. Whatever happened to a 
democratic society where we do things for the good of the entire society and 
not for just a few rich ones?
