A CASE OF TWO PLAYERS IN THE WRONG PLACE WITH THE WRONG SKIN? 
I can't believe that Mal Florence and Bob Oates came up with racism as one of 
the possibilities for Rodney Peete being drafted so late. 
In a sport dominated by black players, what kind of sense does that make? It 
just may be that the people who pay out all those big bucks are better 
qualified to judge athletic ability than many sports writers.
