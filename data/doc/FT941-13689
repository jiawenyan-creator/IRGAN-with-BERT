FT  25 JAN 94 / Britain unites German parties
Left and right have joined forces across the German political spectrum in a
bid to abolish one of the few things which actually unites them - the
British budget rebate from the European Union.
The painful subject of the British rebate, successfully but bitterly
negotiated by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s, re-emerged yesterday
as a German election issue when the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD)
called for its cancellation. With all the political parties gearing up for a
tough European election campaign, followed by a full-scale general election,
the whole question of Germany's own soaring net contributions to the EU
budget looks like emerging as a main theme.
Bonn's failure to negotiate its own budget 'abatement', or at least an end
to the British deal, is now under attack from left and right.
Mrs Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, said
it was no longer justifiable for Germany to be paying DM1.5bn (Pounds 580m)
a year extra to Brussels in order to reduce UK contributions.
Germany's own net contribution is expected to total DM23.4bn for 1993,
including the extra payment for the British. It has risen sharply over the
past six years, from DM10.3bn in 1987, to a forecast DM25bn next year.
The demand for a renegotiation has also been made by the conservative
Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
Mr Thomas Goppel, the CSU European affairs minister for Bavaria, has called
for either a new German rebate, or for abolition of the British rebate.
The irony is that the CSU is led by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, and therefore the man most responsible for negotiating Bonn's EU
budget relations. He is now under pressure both from his own party, and the
SPD opposition, because of his failure to win a better deal in Brussels.
