FT  27 JAN 92 / Letter: Wasting time on languages
Sir, It is hard not to share Mr Calvert's surprise at the lack of interest
displayed by UK companies in employing UK nationals with a good command of
the Japanese language ('Does UK Industry speak the right language?' January
15).
No doubt he has taken at face value the repeated exhortations from the
leaders of British industry to master the languages of our chief trading
competitors. As usual, however, actions speak louder than words, as is
illustrated by a glance at the DTI's own publication, Opportunity Japan:
British Company Success Stories in Japan. From Sir Paul Girolami of Glaxo we
learn that '. . .Glaxo management and employees in Japan are all Japanese .
. .' while Richard Giordano of BOC inspires all budding linguists with the
observation that '. . . you must have people on the ground in Japan who
speak the language. You can do it with westerners but it is better to do it
with Japanese . . .'.
The message from British industry is loud and clear Mr Calvert - give up,
you're wasting your time.
