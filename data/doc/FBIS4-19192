After Uruguay Round"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Marrakech, Morocco, April 13 -- With the 
signing of the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) Thursday [14 April], Italy will have improved chances of 
penetrating new markets abroad, granting Italian producers and 
consumers increased benefits, according to Italian Foreign Trade 
Minister Paolo Baratta. 
  Baratta is here to attend Thursday's official ceremony in 
which the 117 nations involved in the seven-year-long Uruguay 
Round of GATT talks will sign the accords reached in December. 
  He compared the Uruguay Round to the Bretton Woods accords 
of 
1944, which led to the establishment of the International 
Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. The Uruguay Round accord allegedly makes a 
significant step toward the creation of a World Trade 
Organization, which was one of the original goals of GATT when 
it was founded in 1948. 
  Italy, Baratta said, was in danger of falling behind 
competitors on the global markets because its technological 
strength is limited to the textiles industry. The new accords, 
however, will force rich countries to reduce trade barriers and 
will favor development of poor countries, allowing more room for 
Italian exports to both, according to Baratta. 
  The greatest weakness of Italian businesses, Baratta said, 
is 
that they do not have sufficient capital to plan "aggressive" 
investments abroad, investments which Baratta said may not yield 
returns in the short term but allow companies to plant a foot 
solidly inside future markets. Italian companies are mostly 
small- and medium-sized ones, they are flexible and good at 
marketing, but they can only "follow" market trends rather than 
setting them, Baratta added.
