<F P=106> [Article by D.J. Ammar: "Secret Dialogue and the FIS </F>
(Islamic Salvation Front)"] 
  [Text] In his speech to the nation, Mr. Zeroual reaffirmed 
his commitment to a "nonexclusive" national dialogue. 
  Although the president, who categorically rejects violence, 
has discouraged speculation about contacts with the armed 
groups, those groups that have not committed "irreparable acts" 
are being urged to come to reason. But no one is saying what 
constitutes "irreparable." 
  One may thus assume contacts with the political wing of the 
FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] are continuing and perhaps 
intensifying; this may explain recent statements by the party's 
overseas spokesmen. 
  It is very likely that the FIS's overseas delegation--and 
Anwar Haddam (in Washington) in particular--have been contacted 
by important regime figures as part of the search for 
representative interlocutors of the movement. 
  This is what generally reliable sources are saying, and what 
seems to be behind the surprising statement made by Anwar 
Haddam, in the United States, calling for cessation of terrorist 
attacks and condemning violence. 
  Earlier, feelers regarding dialogue had been put out to Mr. 
Haddam, and he was not the only target. It has been learned that 
all the "shuyukh" of the FIS's "Majlis al-Shura" have been at 
least approached by high-level officials. 
  It is expected that four interlocutors eventually will be 
chosen, beginning with Ali Djeddi, who is currently in detention 
in Blida and considered to be Abassi Madani's "gray eminence." 
  There have been many rumors about the possibility of FIS 
being represented by its principal leaders, Abassi Madani and 
Ali Benhadj, both currently in prison. According to our sources, 
they have indeed been contacted. 
  In substance, Abassi Madani is supposed to have told the men 
who urged him to enter into talks: "Release me. I will give a 
sermon at the Es Sunna mosque, then I will organize a national 
march, to stop the violence..." Reportedly his interlocutors 
counterproposed, less generously, an estoppel of prosecution on 
charges pending against him, with a possible transfer to house 
arrest if he were to help bring about a solution to the crisis. 
  Madani reportedly also demanded resumption of the electoral 
process starting from the situation that prevailed at the time 
it was disrupted in January 1992. In other words, that the FIS 
keep the 188 seats it won in December 1991. 
  The initially uncooperative Ali Benhadj reportedly has now 
accepted the idea of FIS participation in dialogue. Thus, 
according to Mr. Youcef Khatib, president of the NDC [National 
Dialogue Commission], conversations with the FIS are now 
focusing on concrete details. It remains to be seen on what 
basis and within what framework the new dialogue will be 
situated. 
  It has also been learned that the FIS would get 40 seats on 
the National Transition Council. It seems that this number is 
now quite firm; barring last-minute coalitions, it would put all 
the other political parties in a minority position, since the 
political sector only gets 85 out of the 200 seats (another 85 
for associations and organizations, 30 for the state). 
  But that has not yet happened. As things stand now, the FIS 
is really in a position to throw a monkey wrench into the 
process.
