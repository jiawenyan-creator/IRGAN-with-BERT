FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Henry Boot bucks trend in building with
Pounds 2.4m
HENRY BOOT, the Sheffield-based construction and property company, continued
to defy its debilitated sector by lifting pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.21m
to Pounds 2.35m for the six months to June 30.
The shares, which have outperformed the construction sector since late 1989,
eased 1p to 269p, continuing a decline from their May peak of 283p.
Earnings per share climbed to 6.3p (5.7p). The board declared an interim
dividend of 1.7p (1.6p) on the strength of results so far, but said it saw
little evidence of recovery.
Mr Jamie Boot, managing director, warned the government not to cut public
spending in next month's budget: 'It is crucial for the industry not to
suffer a reduction in public expenditure on the infrastructure as the
private sector is still very uncertain.'
Turnover rose to Pounds 64.7m (Pounds 51.1m), reflecting improved volumes in
construction and housebuilding operations.
Pre-tax margins fell to 3.63 per cent (4.32 per cent). Mr Boot said the
increase in turnover had not been matched by price rises. Lower interest
rates meant a reduced return on cash balances of Pounds 14.5m (Pounds
11.4m). This had been offset by improved trading profits.
Mr Boot said housebuilding reservations and completions were up on the
previous half year and would remain buoyant in the full 12 months.
Civil engineering volumes were up by about 20 per cent on the previous half
year and would finish ahead of the previous full year in spite of an
expected weaker second half.
