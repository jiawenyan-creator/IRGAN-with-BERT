SOVIETS' 2ND CYCLING GOLD; GERMAN WINS SPRINT FINAL 
Michael Hubner of East Germany won the men's professional sprint finals at the 
World Cycling Championships Wednesday and Evgenii Berzin captured the second 
gold medal for the Soviet Union. 
Berzin won the men's amateur individual pursuit a day after Aleksandr 
Kirichenko won the men's amateur one-kilometer time trial. Valerii Baturo, 
another Soviet cyclist, was second. 
Berzin's winning time was 4-minutes, 33.015 seconds, almost 10 seconds ahead of 
Baturo. 
Mike McCarthy of New York took the bronze, the United States' first medal in 
the championships that began Monday. 
"I had expected to place in the top six, so I am happy," the 22-year-old 
McCarthy said.
