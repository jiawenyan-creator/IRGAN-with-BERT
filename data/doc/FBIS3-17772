  [Text] A Russian official has denied media reports saying 
that a number of islands on the Amur, Ussuri and Argun rivers 
have been ceded to China. 
  The question of border demarcation on the Bolshoy Ussuriy 
and 
Tarabarov Islands close to Khabarovsk and the Bolshoy Island on 
the Argun River is not yet on the agenda, Colonel Aleksandr 
Filonov of the joint commission for border delineation in the 
Far Eastern Border District told Interfax. 
  He said Russia and China had agreed on further discussion of 
the issue but that in the meantime, the disputed territory would 
remain under Russian jurisdiction.
