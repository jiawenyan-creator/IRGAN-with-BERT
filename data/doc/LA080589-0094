METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BATMAN IN TELEVISION SERIES FILES LAWSUIT 
Holy mirror image. Former Batman Adam West isn't doing battle with 
supervillains these days. He's fighting another Batman. 
West, who portrayed the Caped Crusader in the camp 1960s TV series, is asking 
for more than $9 million in damages from a group of advertising agencies that 
filmed television commercials with a non-West Batman. 
West claimed that the other Batman used West's "likeness, personality, voice 
and mannerisms" in a way that would make viewers believe they were watching 
West instead of an imposter. 
Attorneys for West and the agencies appeared before Burbank Superior Court 
Judge Stephen O'Neil on Friday. O'Neil denied a motion from the agencies' 
attorney to dismiss the case and ordered the two sides to appear for trial in 
November. 
The commercials depict the Batman and Robin characters shopping during the 
Christmas season at Zayer's, a chain of discount stores, Silcott said.
