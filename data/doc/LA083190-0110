PIRATES GET MARTINEZ FROM PHILLIES FOR TWO MINOR LEAGUERS IN MIXUP 
The Philadelphia Phillies sent outfielder-first baseman Carmelo Martinez to 
Pittsburgh on Thursday for two minor league outfielders who had been mistakenly 
placed on irrevocable waivers by the Pirates. 
The Phillies get Wes Chamberlain, 23, who was batting .250 at triple-A Buffalo, 
and Julio Peguero, 21, who was hitting .282 for double-A Harrisburg. 
Larry Doughty, the Pirates' general manager, said he was forced to place the 
two minor league players on waivers when he juggled his 40-man roster, but he 
thought he was placing them on procedural waivers that could be revoked if they 
were claimed. 
"It was a mistake. I misinterpreted the rules," he said. "We had to trade them 
or lose them, because we were going to lose them anyway. The waiver claims 
forced me to do something a little bigger than I planned to do, but I like the 
deal." 
The Phillies claimed the minor leaguers, triggering the deal, and also will get 
a player to be named.
