POP EYE: SEEING DOUBLE: 
Could this be a trend in the making? First we hear that ivory-tickling sex 
symbol Harry Connick Jr. is readying (count 'em) two albums for simultaneous 
release this summer (one's a trio album, the other a big band record). . . . 
Speaking of twin billing: Andrew (Dice) Clay's new double album, "The Day the 
Laughter Died," is so chock-full of shock-comedy that Geffen Records, which 
distributes Dice's Def-America label, has quietly taken its name off the album, 
which only features the Def-America logo. . . . And Columbia and Epic Records 
have teamed up to release an alternative music sampler called "Theodore." 
Budget-priced at $4.98, the 16-song cassette version of the compilation 
features a host of live tracks (including Living Colour's version of Tracy 
Chapman's "Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution") unreleased oddities (Big Audio 
Dynamite's "If I Were John Carpenter") and tracks from adventuresome up 'n 
comers like 3rd Bass, Poi Dog Pondering, Toad the Wet Sprocket and Prong.
