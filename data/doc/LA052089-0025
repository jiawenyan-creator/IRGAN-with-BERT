TRACEY ULLMAN PUTS HER BEST SKETCHES FORWARD 
Tracey Ullman fans will have a pleasant time with her one-hour special on 
Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 11 and 6, a compilation of what she considers her 
best sketches over the past year. Tracey Ullman detractors -- that is, those 
who find themselves driven inexplicably morose in the face of excess cute -- 
won't have much to complain about either: The show is varied, well-paced, 
bright and weightless enough to seem mercifully brief. 
Ullman is not the subtlest of performers, and there is lacquered hardness about 
her that thwarts her occasional attempts at pathos. But she's a keen observer 
with a good ear, a comedian with exceptional performing skills, and a generous 
ensemble player. (She gets a lot of help from Dan Castellaneta in a variety of 
roles.) 
Sketches include Ullman as a Valley Girl stopped by the CHP for drunk driving; 
a singles type infatuated with a ventriloquist dummy; a nightclub singer, part 
of an Edie-and-Steve-style sweetheart duo who travels to Japan with her husband 
to meet up unexpectedly with his illegitimate son; a horny prison inmate who 
wants to get it on with her pen-pal husband during a conjugal visit; and part 
of a trio of brown-nosing executive trainees competing for a job. 
Ullman is a dexterous and versatile entertainer. All she needs is a tough, 
astute director to teach her change of pace and the capacity for thought. The 
show highlights her skills without severely exposing her weaknesses. LAWRENCE
