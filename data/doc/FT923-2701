FT  16 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses backtrack after
reappraisal
SECOND thoughts about the ERM realignment and the Bundesbank's interest rate
cuts weakened bourses progressively yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff,
with the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index losing just over one-half of the previous
day's gains.
MILAN seemed to get progressively worse. At the official close the Comit
index was 5.90, or 1.6 per cent down at 373.14, on a weak lira and worries
about Sunday's referendum in France.
After hours, computer trading was showing a 2.7 per cent loss after a
rumour, subsequently denied, that the Italian prime minister, Mr Giuliano
Amato, had resigned; but this was mild compared with the 7.5 per cent drop,
in lira terms, in the Italian component of the FT-Actuaries World Index at
3.30pm, London time.
The London prices were measured from Monday's 3.30 close, reflecting an
extension of early enthusiasm after a rousing start on Wall Street. So the
falls were more severe. Among market leaders, Ferruzzi dropped by 9.9 per
cent on this basis, Mediobanca by 9.5, Olivetti by 9.1 and Fiat by 8 per
cent.
The worst fall of the day, again in London, was in Credito Italiano, one of
the market's privatisation prospects and down 13 per cent after a 29 per
cent gain on the Milan kerb on Monday. Nuovo Pignone, the other
privatisation prospect, was fixed locally at L5,000 after a Monday quote of
L3,410.
PARIS took profits as turnover retreated a little to FFr2.4bn. The CAC-40
index closed 37.45, or 2 per cent lower at 1,836.15 after an earlier high of
1,869.21.
Saint Louis was in focus after Arjo Wiggins of the UK, in which it holds a
39 per cent stake, said it was cutting its dividend. It fell FFr95, or 7.9
per cent to FFr1,109.
Financial sector stocks, which had been in the vanguard of Monday's rises,
shed much of those gains: Suez wasdown FFr11.20 at FFr256.80, and Societe
Generale by FFr20 at FFr541.
FRANKFURT consolidated after Monday's 4.4 per cent gain, the DAX index
closing 7.49 lower at 1,587.55 although there were indications of a fall of
more than 1 per cent overall in the London post bourse.
Turnover fell from DM7.4bn to DM5.4bn. London prices had the big three
chemicals around 1 1/2 per cent lower but a more distinctive approach to the
carmakers, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen, down 0.6, 1.4 and 2.1 per cent
respectively, VW, perhaps, reflecting the earnings downgrade imposed on it
by Morgan Stanley less than two weeks ago.
ZURICH saw the blue-chip SMI index fall 20.3 to 1,851.4 as the city came
back from a day's holiday. On Monday the SMI gained 3.3 per cent in Basle
trading.
Activity centred on Nestle, major banks and chemicals. The improving Nestle
topped the active list, its registered shares closing a token SFr2 higher at
SFr977.
BRUSSELS closed lower although the metals sector managed gains. The Bel-20
index fell 12.29 or 1.1 per cent to 1,107.96 in turnover of BFr1bn. In
metals, Arbed gained BFr85 to BFr3,245, Clabecq BFr18 to BFr938 and Bekaert
BFr200 to BFr12,125 after announcing an increase in first half profits after
the close on Monday.
Union Miniere, due to release first half earnings after today's close,
slipped BFr85 or 4 per cent to BFr2,005.
AMSTERDAM fell in line with neighbouring markets as the 1993 budget
announcement generaly left investors unmoved. The CBS Tendency index shed
0.8 to 112.3.
Hoogovens lost a further Fl 3.10 to Fl 37.60 after announcing job cuts on
Monday while Philips bucked the trend with a 30 cents gain to Fl 24.50.
STOCKHOLM fell in heavy trading as investors took profits. The Affarsvarlden
index lost 14.8 to 745.1 in turnover of SKr599m.
Increases in money market rates contributed to nervousness while there was
renewed speculation about the stability of the coalition government.
Trading in Asea shares accounted for SKr162m of volume and its B shares
closed up SKr5 at SKr325.
OSLO fell 2.9 per cent after one-month money market rates were raised from
17 to 20.5 per cent. The all-share index fell 9.57 to 320.98 in turnover of
NKr157m. Norsk Hydro fell NKr4.5 to NKr138.5. HELSINKI saw bank shares
depressed on news that Unitas faced substantial credit losses from an
associated investment company. The HEX Index lost 3.22 to 586.15. Unitas
free shares fell 50 penni to FM2.9.
VIENNA took a 4.84 point loss on the ATX index to 799.20, off the intraday
high of 809.42. The insurer Erste Allgemeine, which forecast a good second
half, went against the trend, rising Sch45 to Sch1,770.
ISTANBUL eased by 1.7 per cent as investors took profits. The 75-share index
closed down 76.35 at 4,437.89 but off the day's low of 4,421. Turnover rose
to TL370.2bn from TL328.5bn.
