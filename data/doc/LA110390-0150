HERNANDEZ'S KICK ENDS BREA'S SEVEN-YEAR HEX 
Football games like this are usually measured in yards. But you could size up 
Brea-Olinda High School's 23-21 victory over host Valencia Friday night in the 
width of the smile Brea kicker Marco Hernandez was wearing afterward. 
Hernandez's 25-yard field goal sailed straight and true with 42 seconds left 
and gave Brea Coach John Looney his first victory over Valencia in seven years. 
"I told Marco to go out and win us the Orange League championship," Looney 
said. "Inside, I was just praying he'd make it." 
Hernandez's kick set off a wild celebration on the Brea sideline. And it gave 
the Wildcats (6-2-1, 3-0-1 in league) the inside track on the league 
championship. Brea can clinch the title with a victory at home next week 
against Western. 
The decisive field goal was set up on a 43-yard option pass play from Jamie 
Baraglia to Mike Ryan after a lateral from quarterback Jason Luevanos. 
Valencia (8-1, 3-1) took a 21-7 lead early in the third quarter on John 
Fewell's third touchdown run of the game. Fewell carried 16 times for 131 
yards. Brea's comeback started with Brook Coop's two-yard touchdown plunge in 
the third quarter. 
With 3:13 left after the second of three tough Brea defensive stands, Luevanos 
hit a sliding Rick Taylor in the end zone from 11 yards out to cut Valencia's 
lead to 21-20. But Luevanos' pass attempt on the two-point conversion was 
batted away by Korey Alexander. STUART MATTHEWS
