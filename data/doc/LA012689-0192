PUCKETT AGREES TO $2-MILLION PACT PLUS BONUSES; 
HOWELL, MILLER ALSO AVOID ARBITRATION BY REACHING AGREEMENTS WITH ANGELS 
The Angels resolved two more of their arbitration cases Wednesday, reaching 
1-year agreements with Jack Howell and Darrell Miller, but their terms paled 
compared to the agreement Kirby Puckett reached with the Minnesota Twins. 
Puckett, one of four players who filed for salary arbitration at $2 million or 
more, agreed to a 1989 contract calling for $2 million in salary and $200,000 
in award bonuses. Puckett, who earned $1.21 million in salary and award bonuses 
last season, when he batted .356 with 24 home runs and 121 runs batted in, had 
submitted an arbitration figure of $2,150,000, compared to the Twins' offer of 
$1.9 million. 
The agreement makes the 27-year-old center fielder reach $2 million in salary 
faster than any player in major league history. Puckett has 4 years 147 days of 
major league service. Don Mattingly of the New York Yankees had 4 years 163 
days last winter when he agreed to a 3-year, $6.7-million deal that paid him $2 
million in 1988. 
Puckett's 1988 batting average, second in the American League to Wade Boggs' 
.366, was the highest for a right-handed hitter since Joe DiMaggio batted .357 
in 1941, and he won a Gold Glove for the third straight year. His agent, Ron 
Shapiro, said that negotiations involving a multiyear contract are continuing 
with the Twins. 
Howell, the Angels' third baseman who made $200,000 while hitting 16 homers and 
driving in 63 runs in his second full season, agreed to an estimated $465,000 
after filing at $495,000. The Angels countered at $400,000. 
Miller, a reserve catcher who hit .221 in 70 games, got a $50,000 raise to 
$157,500. He filed at $187,500 compared to the Angels' offer of $107,500. 
The Angels still face the possibility of four arbitration cases, with hearings 
scheduled for relief pitcher Greg Minton Feb. 1, outfielder Chili Davis Feb. 3, 
first baseman Wally Joyner Feb. 6 and shortstop Dick Schofield Feb. 13. 
After some initial bitterness over what he termed a lack of meaningful 
negotiations with the Angels, Joyner's attorney, Barry Axelrod, said Wednesday 
that there has been improvement. 
"We seem to be on a better ground," he said. "I think everyone is attempting to 
be more constructive. I'm still assuming that we'll arbitrate, but I'm hopeful 
it might be otherwise." 
Six other players reached agreements Wednesday, reducing the number of players 
still headed for arbitration to 90. 
Relief pitcher Jeff Robinson, who made $475,000 last year, agreed to a 2-year 
contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates for $1.675 million. Pittsburgh first 
baseman Sid Bream agreed to a 1-year contract at $510,000, a raise of $150,000. 
Outfielder Oddibe McDowell and the Cleveland Indians agreed to a 1-year 
contract at $375,000, a $125,000 raise, and catcher Bob Melvin, traded by the 
San Francisco Giants to the Baltimore Orioles Tuesday, agreed to a 1-year 
contract at an estimated $215,000. The Oakland A's reached 1-year agreements 
with pitcher Curt Young and utility infielder Mike Gallego for undisclosed 
terms.
