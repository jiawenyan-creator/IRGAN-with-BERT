  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 21 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
and France Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding on 
cooperation in telecommunications and postal services. 
  Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister S. Samy Vellu 
signed the agreement with visiting French Minister of Industry, 
Posts and Telecommunications Gerard Longuet after two days of 
discussions. 
  Malaysia will start the general services mobile (GSM), a new 
cellular phone, by next May and France will be one of the 
operators of GSM which will cooperate with us, Samy told 
reporters after the signing ceremony at his office, here. 
  He said Malaysia needed the cooperation of other GSM 
operators in Europe to follow the European telecommunications 
standard to maintain direct connections and the cooperation 
provided by France was in the usage of the software system. 
  We also discussed on the fibre optic network and they are 
interested to set up a fibre optic factory in Malaysia for the 
export market, he said. 
  Samy Vellu also said that Telekom Malaysia was discussing 
with a French telecommunications company, Alcatel, to buy 
telecommunication switching equipment. [passage omitted]
