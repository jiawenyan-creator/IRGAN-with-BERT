FT  15 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weekend package receives
qualified approval
THE ERM realignment and the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts, welcome as they
were, were seen as only part of the prescription yesterday for keeping Italy
straight, and putting the D-Mark out of speculative reach, writes Our
Markets Staff.
Mr David Roche, global strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that the package
probably did enough for the US dollar. But in Europe, a French No vote on
Maastricht could revive monetary tensions, and there was still the
possibility of upward pressure on the D-Mark.
For equities, Mr David Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, was happy
but cautious. 'Bourses may find a new level because the news has changed,
but in the short term they are unlikely to head off into the blue on a new
bull tack,' he said.
Markets might now be on the lookout for more encouraging news, and to place
German economic slowdown in that category; but they also may have to face
more corporate earnings downgrades.
FRANKFURT decided that the Buba cuts were the beginning of an interest rate
downtrend, and the DAX index climbed 67.24 to 1,595.04 after a 23.07 rise to
623.34 in the FAZ at midsession.
Turnover more than doubled, from DM3.6bn to DM7.4bn. Within that, there was
a dive into the senior international blue chips, Deutsche Bank (interest
rate sensitive), Siemens and Daimler-Benz, an obvious dollar stock, turning
over more than DM1bn each as they rose DM35.80 to DM647.50, DM33.90 to
DM658.50 and DM23.20 to DM617.50 respectively.
Ms Barbara Altmann of B Metzler in Frankfurt said that the scale of the rise
in the DAX reflected the fact that traders were short of stock last week,
and nervous about the French Maastricht referendum.
Bund futures had stayed strong in the afternoon, following a drop of 20
basis points to 8.01 per cent in the Buba average bond yield yesterday;
this, and the strong opening on Wall Street were seen to bode well for
German equities today.
PARIS indicated its pleasure with a 71.61 rise in the CAC-40 to 1,873.60.
Volume was also strongly ahead at FFr4.7bn against Friday's FFr2.4bn.
However, the government reaffirmed that French interest rates will only be
cut if Sunday's Maastricht referendum shows a Yes vote.
The financial sector put up the day's best performance, with Bancaire
suspended limit up after gaining FFr35.10 or 10.3 per cent at FFr377.00.
Other performers included Suez, up FFr19 at FFr268 in heavy volume, Societe
Generale FFr27 higher at FFr561 and Paribas gaining FFr20.50 at FFr362.50.
MILAN responded to devaluation with an 11.95 rise in the Comit index to
379.04 in turnover substantially higher than Friday's L78.2bn. Profit-taking
after an early run-up pulled the market off its highs.
Credito Italiano, which resumed trade after being suspended last week after
plans for its privatisation were announced, was fixed at L1,600, up 15 per
cent. It then rose further on the kerb to L1,799, an overall gain of 29 per
cent.
Nuovo Pignone, halted for the same reason, was quoted L310, or 10 per cent
higher at L3,410. Other leading shares rose steeply. Fiat gained 6.3 per
cent, Mediobanca 6 per cent and Montedison 7 per cent.
BASLE and Geneva fielded the trading of Swiss shares with Zurich closed for
a local holiday. The SMI index closed 59.9 up at 1,871.1 as lower interest
rates lifted the market.
Interest rate and dollar sensitivity ranked highly, banks and insurers
making strong gains with CS Holding SFr95 higher at SFr1,815, and Ciba-Geigy
bearers SFr28 better at SFr646.
BRUSSELS was boosted by the German news and the Bel-20 index closed up 40.67
to 1,120.25. Companies which rely heavily on exports to the US performed
well with Delhaize rising BFr70 to BFr1,580 while Petrofina added BFr350 to
BFr8,590 and Solvay BFr375 to BFr12,100.
AMSTERDAM followed other markets higher after the Dutch central bank cut
three key interest rates. The CBS Tendency index closed 3.9 higher at 113.1
One of the main stories of the day was the decision by the steelmaker,
Hoogovens, to cut 2,300 jobs in a cost-cutting programme. The shares rose Fl
5.90 to the day's high of Fl 43.80 before slipping back to close up Fl 2.80
at Fl 40.70.
MADRID was helped not only by the general advance among senior European
markets but also positive August CPI data which was slightly better than
expected. The general index closed up 6.13 at 214.94 in good turnover of
Pta13bn.
The financial and construction sectors were among the day's best movers with
Popular up Pta350 at Pta9,900 and Valderrivas up Pta260 at Pta7,360.
STOCKHOLM reacted positively to news that the country's central bank was
reducing its key marginal lending rate, raised last Wednesday, from 75 per
cent to 20 per cent. The Affarsvarlden Index gained 39.6 to 759.9.
Volvo made one of the day's main advances, assisted by the stronger dollar.
Its B shares put on SKr40 or 15.6 per cent to SKr295. In the forestry sector
Stora B shares rose SKr14 to SKr206. HELSINKI's share prices were firmer and
the HEX index rose 15.38 to 589.37, mainly due to gains in the forestry
sector.
VIENNA rose strongly after the central bank cut its interest rates. The ATX
index rose 58.19 to 804.04, just below the day's high of 804.45.
In the financial sector, Erste Allgemeine, the insurer, rose by its daily
maximum, adding Sch247 to Sch2,717. OMV put on Sch67 to Sch739, and Lenzing,
the textile manufacturer, rose Sch59 to Sch654.
ISTANBUL saw its highest close for more than seven months as the 75-share
index advanced 192.14 to 4,514.24 in turnover of TL330bn. Some analysts said
that the rise was led by expectations of good third quarter earnings.
