  [Text] The Hague, April 17 (BTA) -- National Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, who is visiting the Netherlands, 
conferred with Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers who will visit 
Bulgaria shortly together with Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. 
They considered matters concerning bilateral relations, the 
situation in the Balkans and the Dutch assistance for Bulgaria's 
integration into European structures. 
  The same problems were on the agenda of a session with the 
President of the Second Chamber of the States-General, Mr. Wim 
Deetman. At a working lunch, MP's explained the forthcoming 
elections and the peculiarities of the Dutch parliamentary 
system, and especially proportional representation, the 
impossibility of any single party winning absolute majority and 
the need of a coalition government. 
  This afternoon Mr. Yordanov visited a plenary sitting of the 
Second Chamber, at which he was welcomed by the Dutch MP's, and 
then conferred with some floor leaders. At a news conference 
held at the Bulgarian Embassy, the National Assembly chairman 
fielded numerous questions from reporters of the leading Dutch 
dailies. 
  Before the end of his visit tomorrow, Mr. Yordanov is 
scheduled to meet Mrs. Van Rooy, the Dutch Minister for Foreign 
Trade.
