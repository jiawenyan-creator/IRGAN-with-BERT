  [Excerpt] As far as Israel and Washington are concerned, 
the importance of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, who was kidnapped 
by Israel from his home in Qasr Naba, is that he was the 
official in charge of Central Security in the Amal Movement 
before he left it in 1988 and joined the "Faithful Resistance" 
[al-muqawamah al-mu'minah]. 
  More specifically, he is important because the elements 
under 
his command were the ones who arrested Israeli pilot Ron Arad in 
1986 after his military aircraft was shot down during an air 
raid near Sidon. The pilot remained in al-Dirani's custody for 
a period of time. 
  According to informed sources, Washington had prior 
knowledge 
of the kidnapping operation and encouraged it, provided that it 
was a "clean operation." Washington is interested in al-Hajj 
al-Dirani for one reason: He is accused, while he was an Amal 
official, of smuggling in his car U.S. intelligence officer 
William Higgins after he was kidnapped on 17 February 1988 and 
handing him over to the party that announced his execution in 
1989, a few days after Israel carried out a commando operation 
in Jibshit in which it kidnapped Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd. 
(At that time AL-SHIRA' published information indicating that 
Higgins was dead before Hizballah announced that it had executed 
him.) [passage omitted]
