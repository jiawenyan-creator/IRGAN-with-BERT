FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Deere lifted by strong US sales
Fourth-quarter earnings at Deere and Company, the US agricultural,
industrial and lawn equipment manufacturer, jumped to Dollars 103.5m, or
Dollars 1.33 a share, before special accounting charges.
Deere said strong North American sales in all equipment lines lifted
profits.
Last year, the group recorded fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 4.2m, or 5
cents.
Before special charges, Deere posted full-year income of Dollars 286.3m, or
Dollars 3.70 a share, up from Dollars 37.4m, or 49 cents, a year ago.
Including the special charges, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 920.9m, or
Dollars 11.91, in fiscal 1993. Those charges included a one-time accounting
charge of Dollars 1.1bn for post-retirement employee benefits.
In spite of the Dollars 80m restructuring of its European operations,
announced in the second quarter, overseas agricultural equipment operations
incurred large operating losses in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 1993.
The full-year's losses 'substantially exceeded' last year's operating loss.
Deere's worldwide sales jumped 15 per cent to Dollars 2.18bn in the fourth
quarter, from Dollars 1.9bn in the same 1992 quarter. Production tonnage was
up 31 per cent from last year's fourth quarter.
