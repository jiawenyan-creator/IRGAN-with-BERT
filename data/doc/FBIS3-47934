  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- A top Japanese automobile 
industry leader expressed reservations Thursday [20 January] 
over calls to settle stalled Japan-U.S. talks on auto parts 
purchases before the bilateral summit in Washington next month. 
  Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, also told reporters there should be no 
misunderstanding on any agreement at the summit between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. 
  Kume recalled that the Japanese industry set a voluntary 
target for its auto parts imports during then President George 
Bush's Tokyo visit in 1992 but that the United States later 
characterized it as a "public pledge," which became a source of 
dispute. 
  He said such a situation must be avoided. 
  The U.S. is demanding in the talks that Japan set numerical 
targets for its auto parts imports.
