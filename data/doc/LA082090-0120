SHORT TAKES; 
NETWORK ADDS SAUDI WEATHER 
To satisfy surging interest in Saudi Arabian weather among family and friends 
of American soldiers, the Weather Channel cable network has added a focus 
report on the region to its regular coverage, a network official said. 
Reports on Persian Gulf weather will be given twice each hour. 
"These are tense times, and there's a lack of hard news coming out of the 
region. Providing a weather report obviously helps families and the nation as a 
whole feel closer to the men and women serving overseas," said Stan Hunter, 
vice president of programming. He said the reports will continue indefinitely.
