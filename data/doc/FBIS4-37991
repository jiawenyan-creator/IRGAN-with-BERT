  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 24 (AFP) -- A relentless northern 
Yemeni blitz on the city of Aden has killed 376 civilians and 
wounded 861 since June 11, according to a toll compiled by 
southern authorities and obtained Friday by AFP. 
  The toll by the interior ministry of the breakaway south 
covered the whole governorate of Aden, the city's suburbs and 
areas close to the frontlines about 20 kilometers (12 miles) 
from the southern stronghold. 
  Intense bombing of Aden started on June 11. The civil war 
erupted between rival northern and southern forces on May 5. 
  On Friday four civilians were killed and 32 wounded when 
rockets and shells fell on several districts of the besieged 
city, hospital officials said.
