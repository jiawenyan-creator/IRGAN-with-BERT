RAILS: The rail transit system opening today between Long Beach and L.A. (A3, 
E1) will someday have a line to Santa Ana, if planners have their way. . . . 
They already have a route selected -- the same right-of-way used three 
generations ago by the legendary Red Cars of the Pacific Electric. The 34-mile 
route from L.A. to Santa Ana opened in 1905. Six years later, peak-hour trains 
were making the 1-hour, 15-minute trip every half-hour. James S. Granelli and
