FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Gold Greenlees falls to Pounds 2.17m
Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising group, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits for the six months ended October 31 of Pounds 2.17m, down from
Pounds 2.49m last time before exceptional credits of Pounds 482,000.
Earnings per share were down 30 per cent at 8.2p (11.63p), but the interim
dividend is maintained at 3.3p.
Operating profits were Pounds 2.96m, down 9.9 per cent. However, with
turnover up by 1.8 per cent to Pounds 105m and revenue increased by 1.3 per
cent to Pounds 21.88m, the group showed some resilience, although it
suffered from depressed trading levels.
