METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 AGENTS CHARGED IN INSURANCE SCAM 
Two San Fernando Valley insurance agents have been charged with grand theft for 
allegedly bilking thousands of dollars from elderly victims by overcharging 
them for health insurance and persuading them to invest in a bogus company, 
investigators said Monday. 
The agents -- Eric P. Jacobs, 43, of Burbank, and Mitchell S. Horowitz, 39, of 
Northridge -- preyed on elderly, often frail and lonely women, investigators 
said. 
The yearlong investigation by state Department of Insurance investigators and 
the LAPD fraud unit indicates Jacobs and Horowitz may have bilked up to 
$400,000 from as many as nine clients over the last five years, investigators 
said. But some of the alleged victims have died, making it impossible to file 
charges in those cases. Jacobs has been charged with five counts of grand theft 
and Horowitz with four counts in connection with five victims who lost a total 
of about $80,000, said Dennis Ward, chief investigator for the state insurance 
department.
