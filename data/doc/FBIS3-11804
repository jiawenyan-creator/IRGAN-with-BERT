  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The Mexican financial sector 
has asked investors to remain calm and to trust the country's 
economic plan. Interviewed separately, Manuel Robleda, Antonio 
del Valle, and Roberto Hernandez have agreed Mexico's economic 
program is more viable now than ever. 
  Robleda, president of the Mexican Stock Market, has 
explained 
Mexican negotiable documents for sale on international markets 
over the past two days have received reactions which although 
not favorable were not negative; thus, he said, investors should 
maintain their usual calm. 
  Meanwhile, Antonio del Valle, director of the (?Premio 
International Group), has said this is not the time to 
speculate, but rather to work for the economy's success. 
  Roberto Hernandez, president of the Mexican Association of 
Banks, has urged everyone to remain calm, because Mexico's 
economic stability is real; thus, he said, investments should be 
made in pesos. [passage omitted] 
  Interviewed after the second confirmation of the economic 
pact, Hernandez, who is also a National Bank of Mexico board 
member, said Mexico's induction into the OECD clearly proves 
Mexico is considered a first world country.
