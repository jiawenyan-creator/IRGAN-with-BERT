FOR THE BEST MARKET VALUE 
How to get there: Granville Island Market is a short cab ride (about $5 
Canadian one way) from downtown Vancouver. Tiger Bus is a new shuttle that 
provides regular service between downtown hotels and the market. 
The fare, $7 Canadian round trip, includes a ride on a ferry across False 
Creek. City buses Nos. 50 and 51 go over the Burrard Bridge to the market. 
Hours: The market is open every day, May through September, but closed on 
Mondays, October through April, plus Christmas and New Year's. Most stalls are 
open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; coffee and breakfast stalls open at 8. 
Recommended: Bridges, Pelican Bay Restaurant, Granville Island Hotel and 
Isadora's, all on Granville Island. PAUL LASLEY and ELIZABETH HARRYMAN
