FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mexican firm buys control of
Rodman
ANACO Casa de Bolsa, the Mexican securities firm, has ended a year-long
debate over the future of Chicago-based regional brokerage firm Rodman &amp;
Renshaw Capital by agreeing to buy a majority interest in Rodman for around
Dollars 23m.
Analysts said that if the purchase cleared regulatory review, it would be
the first time that a Mexican financial company has acquired control of a US
securities firm.
Rodman is the only remaining publicly-traded securities firm in Chicago. It
began seeking buyers in September and had been expected to accept an offer
from the New York investment company Josephthal, Lyon, and Ross.
Abaco's bid, at Dollars 10.50 per share for 51 per cent of Rodman's 4.3m
outstanding common shares, is understood to be about Dollars 1 above the
Josephthal bid.
The purchase will give Abaco, the brokerage arm of Monterey-based financial
services company Abaco Grupo Financiero, an unusual presence in the US. It
has an office in New York.
Rodman has 500 employees.
