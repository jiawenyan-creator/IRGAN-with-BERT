MONTOYA DEAL WORTH $1.45 MILLION 
Did someone say Max Montoya's reported $650,000-a-year contract makes him the 
highest-paid Raider offensive lineman ever? 
Actually, he'll make more than that. 
A source familiar with the details of the contract said it's a two-year, 
$1.45-million deal, composed of: 
 -- A $50,000 "relocation" bonus. 
 -- A $550,000 salary plus a $100,000 reporting bonus this season. 
 -- A $650,000 salary plus a $100,000 reporting bonus in 1991. 
On an annual basis, Montoya's contract beats the three-year, $1.8-million 
package the 49ers gave Dave Waymer, the biggest Plan B total contract of this 
off-season. MARK HEISLER
