  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- Japan's imports of 
manufactured goods increased by a strong 7.0 percent in 1993 
from the previous year to 125.2 billion dollars, accounting for 
a record high 52 percent of total imports in the year, a 
semiofficial organization said Monday [4 April]. 
  The import value represents a strong recovery from a 2.8 
percent contraction in 1992 and a mere 2.0 percent rise in 1991, 
the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro) said. It 
attributed the recovery mainly to lower import prices due to the 
appreciation of the yen on foreign exchanges and increased 
consumer preference for low-priced goods amid the recession. 
  The organization said Japan's total imports in 1993 amounted 
to 240.7 billion dollars on a customs-cleared basis, up 3.3 
percent. 
  By item, imports increased strongly in telecommunication 
equipment, up 49.4 percent from the previous year, in electronic 
parts, up 33.0 percent, in office equipment, up 13.8 percent, 
and in precision instruments, up 11.4 percent. It also 
increased 15.9 percent in clothing, and almost doubled in 
plywoods, Jetro said. 
  On the other hand, imports declined in industrial machines, 
down 7.7 percent, and aircraft and related goods, down 3.7 
percent. 
  By country, manufactured goods imports from the United 
States 
increased 6.7 percent, compared with a year-on-year 5.3 percent 
contraction in the previous year, to 34.1 billion dollars. 
Those from China increased by 31.4 percent -- the third 
straight year with an increase of more than 30 percent -- to 
14.2 billion dollars. 
  Manufactured goods imports from the Association of South 
East 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) also increased 23.9 percent to 10.7 
billion dollars. Imports from European Union nations declined 
4.0 percent to 25.6 billion dollars, following a drop of 2.7 
percent in 1992 and a fall of 10.9 percent in 1991, Jetro added.
