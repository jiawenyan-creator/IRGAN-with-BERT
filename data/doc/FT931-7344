FT  25 FEB 93 / Thousands held as fears grow over BJP
NEW DELHI was braced last night for confrontation between the police and
militant Hindus planning to hold a banned rally in the capital.
The security forces detained thousands of supporters of the right-wing Hindu
Bharatiya Janata party, the main opposition group which is pressing ahead
with plans for a mass demonstration today in defiance of a government ban.
Police surrounded the city with checkpoints in an effort to stop
demonstrators flooding into Delhi and erected barbed wire around the fields
in which the BJP intends to stage the rally.
The BJP, whose supporters sparked nationwide inter-religious violence when
they stormed a mosque in Ayodhya, wants to press its demands for an early
general election.
Yesterday, BJP members disrupted parliament with angry condemnations of
alleged police 'atrocities' in arresting their supporters. The party claimed
more than 25,000 had been detained.
Mr Rajesh Pilot, a junior home affairs minister who is in charge of
security, pledged to maintain law and order 'at any cost'.
New Delhi police intend to deploy some 40,000 officers on rally duty, with
extra battalions sent from neighbouring states.
Some 8,000 paramilitary troops have been put on alert and the army has also
been put on standby, although it will only be used as a last resort.
Meanwhile, the government yesterday published its long-awaited white paper
on the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya on December 6.
Its publication fulfilled a pledge given by Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, in the hours after the attack on the mosque to give a full account
of the authorities' actions on the day, including the failure of the
security forces to protect the mosque.
The white paper absolves the central government from the failure and blames
the local provincial state government of Uttar Pradesh for refusing to
accede to Delhi's requests for the security forces to be sent into action.
