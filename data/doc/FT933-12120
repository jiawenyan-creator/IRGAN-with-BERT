FT  26 JUL 93 / France to retain protective share of Elf-Aquitaine
THE French government yesterday confirmed that it will retain a 'golden
share' in Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group, to protect the
company from the threat of a hostile takeover bid after its privatisation.
Mr Pascal Clement, minister in charge of the French parliament, said the
government would keep a golden share in Elf to prevent the risk of a foreign
investor 'taking control of the company' and to ensure that it did not 'pass
into foreign hands'.
The golden share is a common mechanism in privatisation programmes, in the
UK as well as France. It is a special class of share that enables the
government to override all other shareholders by blocking developments,
notably foreign takeovers, that it deems to be against the group's interest.
Elf was last week named as one of the four companies scheduled for sale in
the first phase of the new centre-right government's privatisation
programme.
The others are Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals concern, the Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP) and Banque Hervet, the banking groups.
Ministers have already made it clear that the sale of Elf was considered to
be the most complex of the early issues. Elf is not only the biggest of the
first four candidates - with an estimated market value of FFr100bn (Pounds
11.4bn) - but is also involved in the most sensitive sector.
Mr Edmond Alphandery who as economy minister is orchestrating the
privatisation drive, last week warned that the Elf sale may be divided into
different tranches.
Elf Aquitaine was earmarked for a golden share when originally targeted for
sale in 1986. But the 1986 golden shares expired after five years, whereas
the latest legislation allows them to last indefinitely.
