FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Making money with options - Heather
Farmbrough investigates their good points but finds some pitfalls, too
Over the past month, stockbrokers Fidelity and Wise Speke have launched
options-dealing services designed to attract private clients. Is this a sign
that the market is taking off?
Well, no. It seems more likely that trading has been quiet in the
derivatives market and brokers are trying to drum up business. Nevertheless,
it is well worth looking at options, particularly as the market does not
need to be rising for investors to make money.
Options often are marketed as a cheap and safe way into the stock market.
Paying 15p for an option might seem a small outlay compared with 800p for a
share in ICI. And, as Fidelity's Judith MacMichael says: 'They have some of
the characteristics of trading shares within the stock exchange account (no
longer possible since the introduction of rolling settlement). You don't
have to put up much money to make short-term gains and losses.'
Under the old stock exchange system of trading accounts, it was possible to
buy and sell equities over the 28-day account period without having to part
with any money apart from settling losses. Now that is no longer the case,
the two best ways of playing the market in the short term are either options
or margin trading.
The latter requires investors to arrange credit to pay for the majority of
the purchase cost of the shares on settlement day, but this can be
complicated and expensive. So, options seem likely to become the more
popular, particularly when the equity market settlement period is reduced to
five days next year.
With a call or put option, you buy the right to purchase or sell shares. But
as you are under no obligation to take up the option, your potential losses
are limited only to the premium paid to acquire the rights to the shares and
your dealing costs.
If you understand the markets, the low-cost, execution-only dealing services
offer good commission rates for private investors.
Three years ago, Sharelink shook the market by undercutting commission
rates, offering 1.5 per cent commission on opening and 1 per cent on closing
bargains. But Fidelity has just launched a new execution-only discount
dealing service which undercuts Sharelink by charging 1.25 per cent on
opening, although the closing commission is the same (see top table).
If you are a regular options trader who does not need advice and tends to
deal in small amounts, Sharelink is good value, especially as its contract
fee is smaller than that of Fidelity. But if you are dealing in larger
amounts, Fidelity's lower commissions may be better.
Advice costs more: commissions for Wise Speke's original advisory service
start at 2.5 per cent on opening bargains of up to Pounds 5,000, while
Albert E. Sharp charges 4 per cent.
There is no shortage of brokers offering an advisory service. Some offer
discretionary dealing services, too. The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) has a 15-page booklet crammed with the
names of private client brokers. It is worth shopping around as rates do
vary considerably (see table). Liffe also publishes several well-informed
booklets and organises regular seminars for investors.
Wise Speke's new specialist options guidance service is designed for the
investor who has decided which stock he wants but who wants guidance on the
best way to buy. But, you might ask: isn't an investor who knows which
options he wants better off paying less for a no-frills, execution-only
service?
Not so, says James Butcher at Wise Speke. 'People become obsessed with
commissions, but one of the problems in the options market is that you do
get a wide spread between bid and offer.'
He claims that because his dealers know the supply and demand in the market
for various stocks, and usually are dealing for several clients at a time,
they can offer better terms than clients may receive placing one-off
transactions elsewhere. As an example, he says the spread on Hanson or
British Gas February 220 calls is now 11-14 pence. By dealing in a larger
size, Butcher claims he is more likely to be able to buy the options for his
clients at 13p, saving 1p on each contract.
There are some brokers who will trade in options on a discretionary basis
(see bottom table). But others claim that most clients prefer execution-only
services. 'Options investors tend to tell us what to do - not the other way
round,' says Peter Loxton, of stockbroker Charles Stanley. But if you are
new to options, bear in mind that good advice can cost far less than the
losses from a poor investment decision.
If you write an option - that is, you receive the premium for an option and
agree to sell or buy the shares if required to by its holder  - the picture
is very different. Potential losses can be open-ended.
The London Stock Exchange's derivative instrument risks' warning states, in
bold type: 'You should not deal in derivatives unless you understand the
nature of the contracts you are entering into and the extent of your
exposure to risk.'
In other words, do not write options unless you have enough cash to buy the
underlying shares or you hold the required number of shares underlying the
option.
