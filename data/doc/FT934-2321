FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bombardier sees loss on Channel
project
Bombardier, the diversified Canadian transport group which is making the
Channel tunnel shuttle, expects to make a loss on its contract to supply
railcars, but hopes that the technical prestige of the contract will bring
future compensation and orders.
Mr Michel Lord, a vice-president of Bombardier, said that his company would
not have signed its CDollars 820m (USDollars 621.2m) contract in 1989 to
supply 254 railcars if it had known there was going to be an eventual
CDollars 450m cost over-run.
Bombardier said the over-run was almost entirely due to design changes
imposed on contractors by French and British government safety inspectors,
such as a 10cm widening of some doors, and demanded compensation.
In a deal reached earlier this month with Eurotunnel, the operator of the
undersea rail link, Bombardier settled for CDollars 157m in cash and up to
25m shares in Eurotunnel, which at their current valuation would bring the
compensation up to CDollars 375m.
'A speedy out-of-court settlement for less is far better than spending 10
years in court for more,' Mr Lord said. Bombardier, which in accepting the
shares has become Eurotunnel's largest single shareholder, hopes that in
other contracts it would be able to recoup losses it had made on the Channel
tunnel project and find a use for the technical lessons it had learnt.
'The Eurotunnel railcars are the most sophisticated product we have ever
made in this line,' said Mr Ward, because of their size - some are
double-decked to take cars - and because of the security equipment required
in the 50km tunnel.
Speaking at the French end of the tunnel which has now been handed over by
Trans Manche Link, the construction consortium, to Eurotunnel, the latter's
director-general, Mr Andre Bertrand, indicated yesterday it would still be
some time before Eurotunnel presented its final bill.
