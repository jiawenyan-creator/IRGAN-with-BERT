FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Benson makes Pounds 2.4m foam buy
Benson, the engineering group, is acquiring Designstart, which trades as
Stadex Industries, for Pounds 2.43m, from Thama Holdings.
The consideration will be met by the sale of Benson's agricultural vehicles
spares business to Thama for Pounds 1.36m and the issue of 12.6m new shares
to Thama. There is also a contingent consideration of up to Pounds 150,000
depending on the availability of tax losses.
Stadex, the largest maker of rubber latex foam in the EU, achieved pre-tax
profits of Pounds 67,000 in the 10 months to October 31, having been
lossmaking in the previous three years. Net assets at December 31 1993 were
Pounds 2.25m.
Benson also announced the sale and leaseback of two properties which
generated about Pounds 1.5m in cash, realising a profit of about Pounds
200,000.
The directors of Benson said it was their intention to increase the interim
dividend by 20 per cent to 0.12p as sales for the half year to November 30
were 'significantly ahead' across the group.
