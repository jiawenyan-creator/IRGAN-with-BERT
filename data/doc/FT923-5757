FT  28 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Speedy scanner devours
documents
Transferring mountains of paper on to a computer system so that they can be
indexed, filed and searched is a time-consuming and labour-intensive
process. Either the documents must be re-typed or slowly fed into an optical
scanner.
Software from Ymijs (pronounced images) Ltd makes the job faster and more
accurate. The intelligent character recognition system can process text at
less than three seconds per page. Thus documents can be fed through a
scanner non-stop.
With almost human cunning, the Iciris system can decipher text that is
skewed, enclosed in form-style boxes, shaded, inverse or imperfectly
printed. Ymijs Ltd: UK, 081 518 1414.
