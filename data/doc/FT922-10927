FT  28 APR 92 / Sumo star row grows
AMERICAN sumo star Konishiki, whose chances for promotion have been as
closely watched in Tokyo as Japan's trade balance, publicly denied yesterday
he told reporters racism had kept him from the Japanese sport's highest
rank, AP reports from Tokyo.
The comments attributed to Konishiki, who real name is Salevaa Atisanoe,
caused an uproar last week, prompting Japanese officials to stress no racism
was involved. Konishiki said he did not even know some Japanese words
attributed to him in one article and had not spoken to the reporter who
wrote another. 'I didn't say any such thing,' he said, referring to the term
'racial discrimination' attributed to him.
Japan's mass media weighed in after the New York Times ran a story
attributing similar remarks to the wrestler, based on a phone interview.
Konishiki denied he had spoken to the Times' reporter, saying another
wrestler had impersonated him on the phone. Nihon Keizai stands by its
story; the New York Times says it is unsure whom it interviewed.
