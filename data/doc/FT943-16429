FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan seeking air ventures
Taiwan, which has seen the collapse of planned aerospace ventures with
McDonnell-Douglas and British Aerospace, is exploring further possible
ventures, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei.
Taiwan's military-run Aero Development Centre and GE Aircraft Engines of the
US are discussing joining forces to produce CF34 engines for use in
Canadian-made regional jets, said Mr Jack Tang, deputy director of the
cabinet's committee for aviation and space industry development. A centre
spokesman said any co-operative venture would include technology transfer.
