FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Steel duties rejected
The Court of International Trade has rejected a Department of Commerce
ruling that imposed countervailing duties on privatised companies because
subsidies had been granted to their government-owned predecessors.
The CIT rejected the department's conclusion that subsidies, although they
may have been granted years before, 'travel with productive units to their
new home' in the private sector. Mr Sheldon Hochberg, lawyer for the UK's
United Engineering Steels, said the case would be 'a harbinger' for larger
steel import cases to come to the court on appeal.
United Engineering Steels was a private sector joint venture between British
Steel Corporation and the UK's Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds (GKN). BSC
contributed its specials steel business to the new company and GKN
contributed Bymbo Steel works.
The UK government provided subsidies to BSC from 1978 to 1986, when the
joint venture was launched.
'The Court concludes UES did not indirectly receive the benefit of BSC's
earlier subsidies,' said the judge.
