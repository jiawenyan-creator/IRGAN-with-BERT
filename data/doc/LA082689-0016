THE BLURRING OF REALITY 
The article "Viewers Found to Confuse TV Entertainment with News" (Part I, Aug. 
17) points out that TV, potentially the greatest educational tool available, is 
contributing to a confusion between entertainment and news, particularly in the 
minds of young people. When government confuses disinformation with 
information, television confuses entertainment with news, and advertising 
confuses style with substance, we no longer have education but diseducation. 
And the schools are expected to pick up the pieces!
