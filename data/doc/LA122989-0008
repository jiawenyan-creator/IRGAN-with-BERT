LOS ANGELES' 3RD AREA CODE 
The plan by the telephone companies to add a third area code to the Los Angeles 
area sparked controversy even before the ink was dry on the newspapers carrying 
the story (Part A, Dec. 13). Demographic problems by businesses, the needs to 
change stationery and other issues, many unknown at this time could give rise 
to actions including lawsuits by irate customers. 
Both telephone companies cite an expansion in services arising from 
high-technology advances as the cause. Consumer use of cellular telephones, fax 
machines, beepers and modems is involved, not to mention an increase in the 
population. 
While Pacific Bell and GTE may be correct in their assessment, there is an 
alternative to allay the fears of those affected and at the same time 
ameliorate the utilities' problems. Why not apply the 310 area code to the new 
high-tech users; cellular phones, beepers, faxes, etc. The logistics should be 
no worse than those of the 800, 900 and 976 area codes.
