Applicants' Representations



1. United of Omaha (formerly, United Benefit Life Insurance Company), is a stock life insurance company and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company.

2. Account B was established as a separate investment account by United of Omaha. A registration statement on Form
N4 to register Account B as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act, and to register the contracts under the
Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act'') has been filed with the Commission.

Account B will have a number of subaccounts, each of which will invest solely in a specific corresponding portfolio
of the American Odyssey Funds, Inc., or of such other registered investment companies as United of Omaha may make available
under the Contracts from time-to-time (each, a ``Fund'') or any combination thereof. Each Fund will be a diversified,
open-end management investment company, and may have a number of classes or series, in accordance with Rule 18f-2
of the 1940 Act.

3. The Contacts are group flexible payment variable deferred annuity policies and individual certificates of participation

the investment experience of the selected Subaccount(s). Prior to annuitization, all or a portion of a Certificate's
Cash Surrender Value may be transferred between Subaccounts. The Contracts will provide for a series of Annuity Payments

of: (a) Account Value (without deduction of the withdrawal charge), less any charge for applicable premium taxes
and any outstanding loans and loan interest; (b) Net Purchase Payments, less any partial withdrawals and any outstanding
