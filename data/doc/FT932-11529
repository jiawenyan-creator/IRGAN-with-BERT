FT  04 MAY 93 / Acquisitions 'suffer failure rate of 50%'
HALF OF all mergers and acquisitions fail, a study published today by
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, shows.
The study, compiled from interviews with 100 top companies covering 50
acquisitions worth a total of Pounds 13bn, suggests that there has been
little improvement over the past 20 years. Similar surveys, in 1973 and
1988, showed that about half the acquisitions were regarded by management as
unsuccessful.
Coopers said that many companies, particularly medium-sized groups, needed
to seek professional advice at an early stage.
Often acquiring companies had brought professionals in to do 'due diligence'
 -verifying that they were buying what they thought they were buying - only
long after deciding to make the acquisition.
Failure was most often blamed on management attitudes - differences in style
and resistance to change in the acquired company. The study also showed a
remarkable number of acquiring companies which admitted they did little or
no planning before the takeover for post-acquisition integration.
Lack of knowledge of the target company or the relevant industry was another
common cause of failure.
Mr John Stuttard, Coopers acquisitions partner, said the survey might mask
an improvement in the record of domestic acquisitions and might indicate an
increase in the number of cross-border acquisitions, which could be more
problematic.
Mr Richard Stone, head of corporate finance services at Coopers, said
companies frequently discovered too late that opposing cultures could not
easily be combined.
'You have a three-to-six-month window within which you can bring about
changes,' he said. 'After that there is a tendency to be an absentee
landlord or for the management to go native and be imbued with the same
culture (of the acquired company).'
