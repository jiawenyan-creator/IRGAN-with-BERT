DEL MAR TRAIN DEPOT 
Paul Frankel's article urging retention of the Del Mar Amtrak station, brags 
about 90 dedicated parking spaces and 128 adjacent spaces available to service 
travelers. But the city of Del Mar, in connection with Amtrak, sealed its own 
fate by authorizing the decades-old free parking to be $5 per partial day. That 
means that my late-evening trips to Los Angeles, for morning court appearances, 
with a return by 1 p.m., incur a $10 parking charge. My pleas to have the fee 
$5 per 24 hours are ignored. And I am tired of parking blocks away to avoid 
this. 
I'll welcome Solana Beach with its 400 free parking spaces. Kudos to Jim Mills 
for his work in arranging this new transportation center that will serve all of 
North County, including adjacent Del Mar.
