IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION 
DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
Rap Singer to Stop Using Skyywalker Name: The lead singer of 2 Live Crew, a rap 
group notorious for sexually explicit lyrics, was ordered by U.S. District 
Judge James Ideman Wednesday to stop using the name Luke Skyywalker on grounds 
that it could damage the image of its "Star Wars" namesake. Ideman issued a 
temporary restraining order banning the use of the name pending the outcome of 
a $200-million trademark infringement suit brought by director George Lucas, 
who owns the trademark "Luke Skywalker," the clean-cut hero in the film series.
