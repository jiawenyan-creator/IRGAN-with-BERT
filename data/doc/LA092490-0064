S.D. MAN RESCUED IN NATIONAL FOREST 
A 26-year-old San Diego man who was lost overnight in the Cleveland National 
Forest was rescued Sunday by a sheriff's helicopter crew. 
Fareed Harley Stevenson got separated from two other hikers Saturday evening. 
The two others found their way out and called Orange County sheriff's officials 
at about 1 a.m. 
The Sheriff's Department launched a helicopter search at daybreak, and rescuers 
spotted Stevenson at about 9:30 a.m. in a canyon near San Juan Hot Springs 
campground. The helicopter landed in a flat area nearby and Stevenson, who was 
uninjured, hiked to the helicopter and was airlifted out. 
Sheriff's officials said the hikers had not planned to stay overnight and did 
not have supplies.
