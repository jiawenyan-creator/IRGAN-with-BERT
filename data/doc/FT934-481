FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Five of six top bourses score
new highs
Five of the continent's six top bourses scored new highs yesterday as Milan,
which peaked back in August, eased on profit-taking, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT professionals went home with another 1 per cent gain on their
books, the DAX index closing 25.33 higher at a new high of 2,222.84.
Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank said that it was German institutional
investors who did the business, and that most of of that was done in the
first half hour. However, the Ibis indicated DAX held its gains in the
post-bourse, where it rose to 2,227.63.
Turnover rose from DM9.2bn to DM9.5bn. West German December inflation
figures showed a steady year-on-year rate and a slowing monthly figure.
Banks were strong, particularly Deutsche Bank which rose DM13 to DM888.50.
Siemens had another good day, up DM16 to DM786.50 for a two-day gain of
DM30. Siemens has been asked to rebid for a DM4bn, Korean high-speed rail
contract, said Mr Longley, which was won by GEC Alsthom, but which now
seemed to be open to negotiation once again.
PARIS was lifted past its old high by a strong French bond market and an
inflow from mutual funds, the CAC-40 approaching today's end of the December
account with a rise of 17.23 to 2,243.02 in turnover of FFr4.8bn,
Club Mediterranee regained some of its recent losses, rising FFr24 to FFr345
as short positions were bought back following the news of its FFr290m net
attributable loss for 1992/93. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe said that
there may also have been some bargain hunting, as the stock was viewed as
slightly oversold.
Among the cyclicals, rising on the dollar and the prospect of European
recovery, Alcatel Alsthom climbed by FFr16 to FFr841 and Schneider by
FFr20.20 to FFr459.20.
Credit Lyonnais certificates, up FFr21 at FFr729, offered a belated reaction
to the appointment of a new chairman, and the prospect that 1994 would be a
recovery year.
AMSTERDAM peaked, too, with the CBS General Shares Tendency index adding
1.20 to 147.90, supported by hopes of a continuing lower trend in interest
rates.
Aegon, however, shed Fl 4.70 to Fl 106.20 in a late burst of British selling
which more than wiped out the Fl 4.40 spurt made just before Wednesday's
close.
Stocks to hit new year-highs included Unilever, which closed up Fl 2.30 at
its session best of Fl 225.40 after its recent acquisitions, and Elsevier,
up Fl 3.90 at Fl 181.90.
ABN Amro shed 20 cents to Fl 71.10 after a low of Fl 70.90 in heavier than
normal volume after saying that it would buy a French subsidiary of CS
Holdings.
The fall was attributed to fears that the bank might be about to announce a
much more ambitious purchase, possibly involving a rights issue.
Publishers continued in favour. Wolters Kluwer ended at its 12-month high of
Fl 123.70, up Fl 1.50 while VNU added Fl 3.40 to Fl 166.50.
ZURICH was propelled to a fifth consecutive peak by continued high liquidity
and further hopes of lower rates in the new year. The SMI index added 23.9
to 2,966.3.
Nestle led the market higher with a SFr28 rise to SFr1,277. Zurich
Insurance, which has lagged behind its sector recently, saw its bearers rise
SFr24 to SFr1,499. CS Holding, the best performing bank, rose SFr30 to
SFr3,700.
Adia, the temporary employment group, rose SFr12 to SFr189 after the
announcement that practically all of its shareholders had subscribed to the
company's issue of new bearer shares.
Oerlikon-Buhrle, the arms-to-fashion group, rose SFr2.50 to SFr119.50 on as
it confirmed an earlier forecast of higher 1993 net profits.
MILAN turned lower after the recent rally which has seen the market rise by
6.2 per cent since December 10. The Comit index shed 5.01 to 614.45 in
subdued trading, with the Senate's approval of the budget already discounted
by the market.
Among exceptions to the downward drift, Nuovo Pignone climbed L406 or 6.5
per cent to L6,673, on news that a group of US companies led by General
Electric were taking a large stake.
By contrast, Fiat's Cogefar fell L162 or 5.6 percent to 2,747 after
announcing a L620bn rights issue ahead of merging its activities with three
other construction companies.
MADRID hit the level that most traders were looking for, the general index
closing 4.22 higher at a new high of 322.06 in turnover of Pta38bn.
Buying interest focused on electrical utilities. Iberdrola was up Pta26 at
Pta1,020, and Sevillana and Endesa by 3 per cent and 2.5 per cent
respectively.
OSLO added 1.7 per cent, taking its lead from the gains in the leading
European markets.
The all-share index climbed 9.93 to 596.68 in turnover of NKr929m as
shipping shares registered a broadly based advance.
VIENNA posted a new high as equities were helped up by a 10 basis point
easing in the Gomex money market rate to 5.6 per cent, the ATX index closing
23.85 higher at 1,100.95. Traders also acknowledged that the market had some
catching up to do on Germany.
