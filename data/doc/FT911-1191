FT  08 MAY 91 / Aegis unveils refinancing details
AEGIS, Europe's biggest media buying group, yesterday announced a
refinancing package including a Pounds 30m placing and the Pounds 23.4m
acquisition of the remaining shares in TMD, a leading UK media-buying
business.
Mr Peter Scott, chairman, said yesterday's deals 'strengthened' Aegis'
financial position and were an 'important step' in consolidating its
media-buying interests.
Aegis' shares rose 20p to 213p on the announcement. TMD, which is quoted on
the USM, saw its shares soar by 93p to 340p.
Aegis, which last year changed its name from the WCRS Group after
diversifying from its original advertising interests, has been expanding its
European media-buying interests through Carat, its Paris-based subsidiary.
It emerged as a minority investor in TMD two years ago and now owns 29.9 per
cent.
Aegis, advised by Salomon Brothers, is offering 330p cash for the remaining
TMD shares, or shares on a 33-for-19 basis. This values TMD, which made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m on turnover of Pounds 170m in the year to
August 31, at Pounds 33.4m.
Because TMD already operates as part of the Carat network, the deal should
make little difference in operational terms. However, it should be
financially beneficial by allowing Aegis to realise its UK tax losses.
The Pounds 30m placing of shares with Warburg Pincus, the US fund management
group, will be used to finance the TMD deal and reduce debt. Warburg Pincus
will increase its existing 7 per cent stake to up to 15 per cent.
Samuel Montagu, the London merchant bank, has underwritten a new FFr150m
(Pounds 14.84m) five-year term loan and FFr500m revolving credit facility
for Aegis.
As part of the refinancing Aegis has renegotiated the terms of its defered
payments for the purchase of Carat. Originally it was due to make two
payments of FFr125m in cash or shares in December 1991 and 1992. These
payments will now be met by the issue of 12.5m Aegis shares.
Aegis, which is fighting a Dollars 308m (Pounds 173m) law suit in the US,
still has to make a FFr125m payment in cash or shares in December 1993 and
to make future cash payments of up to Pounds 49m by 1995.
