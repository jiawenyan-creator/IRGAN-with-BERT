FT  10 NOV 93 / People: Knox coaxed over the fence
In the first week of October, Patricia Knox, assistant city editor of the
Evening Standard, published the results of a wide-ranging survey on what the
financial community felt about the stock exchange's future which began 'Down
but not out - that is the current condition of London's much-criticised
Stock Exchange'.
Shortly thereafter the headhunters were on the phone, and yesterday Knox was
appointed chief press officer of the stock exchange, a post that has been
vacant since Gill Ackers joined financial pr company Brunswick in early
August.
Knox, a 46-year-old Canadian with a degree in English and French from the
University of Minnesota, has spent the past 17 years at the Standard. 'At
least I know why the press has sometimes got cross or has misunderstood the
exchange,' she says of her move to the other side of the fence.
The stock exchange has had a turbulent year, coming in for fierce criticism
over the Taurus fiasco and losing its chief executive as a consequence. But
it has finally found a replacement for the latter, a City figure who will be
identified tomorrow . So does Knox know who her future boss will be? 'No,
that would be tempting the Chinese Walls a bit too much, wouldn't it?'
