FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Sterling left off Bank's EMS
grid
STERLING is a notable absentee from the statistical grid issued yesterday by
the Bank of England showing the new Exchange Rate Mechanism bands.
Although both the Italian lira and sterling were suspended from the ERM, the
lira is included in the grid. A Bank official said: 'The Italians insisted
that they remain in the grid at their old central rate.'
A footnote to the grid explains that the Italian monetary authorities are
ignoring the bands, in terms of their exchange rate intervention policy, for
the time being.
