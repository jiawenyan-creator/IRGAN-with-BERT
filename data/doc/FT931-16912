FT  04 JAN 93 / Gloomy builders seek loan rate cut
THE NEXT four weeks are expected to be crucial for the building industry as
potential homebuyers decide whether they feel confident enough about the the
economy to enter the market.
A cut of least 1 percentage point in interest rates would make an immediate
difference, according to Mr John Bagnall, chairman of the Building Employers
Confederation, and the last thing the industry wanted to see was tax
increases in the Budget.
He warned in a new-year message that the industry was still in the grip of
the worst recession since the 1930s and that worse was to come.
'The BEC will shortly be analysing the results of its winter state-of-trade
inquiry and I expect them to show a continuing decline in output and
employment which will take the construction jobless past the 450,000 mark,'
he said.
However, the latest forecast by the National Council of Building Material
Producers showed a marked lessening in the decline in the industry's output
 -expected to fall by 1.5 per cent during the year.
