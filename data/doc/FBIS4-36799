  [Excerpt] Kuwait, 13 Jun -- Canadian Defense Minister David 
Collenette said today that in his talks with Kuwaiti officials 
he had discussed the possibility of strengthening relations 
between the two countries in defense matters. 
  Speaking at a news conference at the end of his two-day 
visit 
to Kuwait, he said: "We hope to work together on defense 
matters and that some of our companies will carry out commercial 
operations with the Kuwaiti Government." He added: "We 
particularly hope that the Western Star truck model will receive 
every interest from the Kuwaiti Army and National Guard." 
  He indicated that the truck deal is at "a very advanced 
stage." The Kuwait Oil Company purchased 63 trucks of this type 
in 1991. 
  Collenette described his meetings with Kuwaiti officials as 
cordial, and said that the visits of Canadian officials to 
Kuwait "express our concern with the stability of Kuwait and the 
region as well as Kuwait's future safety." [passage omitted]
