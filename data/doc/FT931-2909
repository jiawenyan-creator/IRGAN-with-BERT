FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Campari shares dive on warning
SHARES IN Campari Inter-national plunged 61p to 230p yesterday after the
sporting leisurewear group warned that its 1992 profits would be below
market expectations, with a fall from Pounds 5.27m to 'not less than Pounds
1m'.
The company said that trading conditions had been particularly difficult
towards the end of 1992, while in addition, a decision to change the basis
of stock provisioning would give rise to a charge of some Pounds 1.5m in
excess of the previous year.
Despite the expected profits shortfall, Campari said it intended to maintain
the total dividend at 12p.
