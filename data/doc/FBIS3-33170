  [Text] The Haitian delegation that has been in Washington 
for more than a week now has been joined by other legislators. A 
number of deputies from the opposition National Front for Change 
and Democracy, FNCD, including three former presidents of the 
Chamber of Deputies, have joined the delegation, which is 
involved in a number of new negotiations with a view to solving 
the political crisis. 
  The Haitian legislators are in Washington at the invitation 
of the State Department. They are Antoine Joseph, Duly Brutus, 
and the legislators from the FNCD -- Edmond Mirold and 
Pierre-Canel Rindal. Two other deputies, Ernst Pedro Casseus and 
Antoine Medard, were due to join them. 
  Moreover, National Education Minister Victor Benoit and 
Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul are also supposed to go to 
Washington. 
  It appears that the U.S. State Department is in this way 
attempting to gather in Washington legislators of all leanings 
represented in the parliament, in order to prompt President 
Aristide to appoint a new prime minister.
