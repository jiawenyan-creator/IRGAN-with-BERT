GROWTH: DISEASE OR BLESSING? 
You sometimes get the idea that Los Angeles County Supervisors never met a 
building project they didn't like, no matter what damage it might do to the 
environment or to what extent it will cram more autos onto the roads. The board 
voted 4-1 this past week to permit the filling of another canyon on the Malibu 
coast, this time for a golf club, resort and exclusive homes. 
In stark contrast, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was providing the sort of 
leadership the region needs by trying to reduce the impact of a $2-billion 
project north of Chatsworth that involves 2,195 homes, 1,200 townhouses and 
nearly 6 million square feet of office space. Bradley threatened to veto the 
project unless the developer built homes that are affordable to less-affluent 
buyers, reduced parking space to encourage ride-sharing and transit facilities 
and provided a better mix of residential and commercial property. 
And when City Councilman Hal Bernson, the project's sponsor, modified the plan 
to get itthrough committee on a 2-1 vote, Bradley accurately labeled the 
alterations as cosmetic and said they do not change the fundamental problems of 
the massive development. The full council should reject the plan as currently 
proposed. If not, Bradley should veto it. 
At Malibu, the developer asserted that the resort was planned to protect the 
environment. That would be some trick: Approximately 5 million cubic yards of 
dirt would have to be moved to fill in the canyon. 
Southern California needs development -- and redevelopment -- that provides new 
jobs and affordable housing. But this surely does not mean filling canyons 
along the coast or building super-scale projects that will further overload 
highways and other public facilities. There must be limits, or else the 
cumulative impacts of growth will overwhelm the natural assets that made 
Southern California so attractive to newcomers in the first place.
