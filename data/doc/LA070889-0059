DE MITA'S BID FOR ITALY COALITION FAILS 
Prime Minister-designate Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democrat, gave up efforts 
to form Italy's 49th government since World War II. 
De Mita, whose government collapsed in May, told President Francesco Cossiga 
late Thursday that "political conditions were not present" to form a new 
coalition.
