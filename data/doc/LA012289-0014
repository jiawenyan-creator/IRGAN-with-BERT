A CHIP ON HER SHOULDER 
Why bother having Cynthia Parsons review former Secretary of Education William 
Bennett's "Back to Moral Basics" (Book Review, Dec. 25)? From the first to the 
last, her grousing reveals a consuming chip on her shoulder. Her readers 
receive hardly a glimpse of what the book is about, just how greatly Parsons 
disdains it and how quickly she dismisses it as so much conservative palavra. 
 Parsons derides Bennett for using the first person often in these speeches 
delivered when he was the head of the Department of Education (how dare he!) -- 
all while she interjects a personal anecdote and her own clairvoyant 
assessments of Bennett's motives for writing the book in the first place. 
That's consistent. 
Parsons states, "If . . . this is some 'last hurrah,' then only friends and 
fellow-believers need spend the time to read this volume." In other words, if 
you like Bennett, you'll like this book; if not, not. What does this review 
tell us except that Parsons belonged to the latter group -- before and after 
she read the book.
