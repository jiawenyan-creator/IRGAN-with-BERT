  [Text] Apia, June 20 (AFP) -- Western Samoa's ailing 
national carrier Polynesian Airlines (PAL) will receive another 
financial boost if government funds become available, Prime 
Minister Tofilau Eti Alesana has promised. 
  He told parliament on Monday the government had no intention 
of folding PAL and, pending approval of the government budget, 
it will receive 1.5 million tala (520,000 US dollars). 
  This would be the government's first direct cash injection 
for the airline that so far has been funded by 
government-guaranteed international loans. 
  In April Treasury Department financial secretary Sala Epa 
Tuioti said PAL had a debt equivalent to about 26 percent of the 
government's income, posing a threat to the state. 
  He estimated PAL's total debt to be 45.2 million tala. The 
size of the debt made it "highly unlikely that any commercial 
lender would offer to make PAL a loan" even with a government 
guarantee, he said. 
  PAL deputy general manager Muliagatele Gina Moore said 
Monday 
the April Treasury report had been a distortion. 
  "Unfortunately this leak has caused substantial damage to 
Polynesian's reputation at a time when substantial benefits to 
the economy from tourism and air cargo are just beginning to be 
felt," she said. 
  She said passenger levels from North American and Australia 
were at all time highs and its assets were substantial.
