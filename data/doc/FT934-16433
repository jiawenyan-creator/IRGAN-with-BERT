FT  06 OCT 93 / Observer: Fictional friends
If nothing else, John Major will one day leave behind him a lasting
curiosity; what on earth did he see in that dreary late Victorian novelist
Anthony Trollope?
But Trollope is a terrific cure for insomnia, so the prime minister has
probably packed some of his 50 or so novels to help him get a few good
nights' sleep in Blackpool this week.
It must be hoped, though, that Major's advisers will steer him clear of one
particular edition of The Prime Minister, Trollope's novel dealing with that
by-now probably extinct breed, the Liberal party prime minister.
For in the Oxford edition of 1973 the preface describes Trollope's prime
minister as having 'no clear idea what to do with himself and with his
colleagues'. The hero is delineated thus: 'A virtuous, dutiful, sensitive
type, easily offended as well as easily wounded. Above all, completely
without any ideas about policy . . .'
At least there's no mention of bastards.
