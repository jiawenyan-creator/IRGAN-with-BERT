LOCAL; 
GIRL'S CALL SAVES MOTHER, HERSELF 
a dramatic late-night rescue, police and neighbors helped save a Costa Mesa 
woman and her young daughter from a blazing, smoke-filled house, police said 
today. 
Nine-year-old April Thousand called 911 about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday and told 
dispatchers that her home was on fire, Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Tim Holbrook 
said. 
Three police officers, who were the first to arrive at the burning two-story 
house in the 300 block of 16th Place, heard cries for help from within the 
home. The officers broke down the door and two of them entered, Holbrook said. 
They crawled along a hallway and into a bedroom where they found Linda 
Thousand, 31, asleep in her bed. 
As the officers led Thousand out of the house, she screamed for her daughter, 
Holbrook said. The officers went back into the house to find April but by that 
time neighbors had used a ladder to rescue the girl from an upstairs bedroom, 
he said. 
Firefighters then arrived and put out the blaze, which authorities believe was 
caused by grease on the stove catching fire, the sergeant said. The first floor 
of the house was gutted.
