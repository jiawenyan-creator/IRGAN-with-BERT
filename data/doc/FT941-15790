FT  13 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a premium decision
Sir, There has been considerable criticism of the decision to increase
premium bond prizes to Pounds 1m and decrease the number of smaller prizes.
Perhaps of more concern are the reports that this decision was made on the
basis of 'gut feeling' by those responsible for the management of premium
bonds rather than on any market survey. If this is correct, it is a sad
indictment of the quality of management in what appears to be a substantial
business enterprise.
