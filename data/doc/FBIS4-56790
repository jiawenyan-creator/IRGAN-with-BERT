  [Text] The Cuban delegation to the Latin American seminar 
on communications media that is taking place in Chile has urged 
media from the continent to report truthfully on the Cuban 
situation. 
  The UPEC [Union of Cuban Journalists] members submitted a 
document to the participants, stating that the main cause of the 
distortion of our country's image is the result of 
miscommunication imposed from abroad. 
  Regarding that isolation policy, the document underscores 
violations in the issuance of visas to travel to the United 
States, which prevented Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina from 
attending a forum recently held by the CNN network in the City 
of Atlanta. 
  The document, submitted by UPEC vice president Jose dos 
Santos, includes an addendum of newspaper articles prepared by 
Cuban reporters from various media on freedom of expression and 
other subjects being discussed in the seminar in Chile.
