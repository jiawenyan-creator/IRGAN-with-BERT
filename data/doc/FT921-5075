FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: ABN Amro takes 90% of CME
ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, is to take a 90 per cent stake in Capital Markets
Equities (CME), the Spanish stockbroker, and inject about Fl 25m into the
company, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
ABN Amro said the sale price was in the area of 'tens of millions of
guilders'. It was delaying an official announcement until full approval was
received from the government, which is likely to act within a few weeks.
CME is a subsidiary of Capital Markets Holding, in which ABN Amro holds a 20
per cent stake. In 1991, CME booked net losses of Pta23m, while the previous
year it fell Pta79m into the red.
The deal follows the recent announcement that ABN Amro had agreed to buy
Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker.
