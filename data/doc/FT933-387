FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Ex-GWR chief plans comeback
MR DANIEL S Pena, the flam-boyant former chairman of Great Western Resources
who departed the company in a cloud of shareholder discontent two years ago,
is planning a comeback to the UK quoted sector following an award by a US
jury of Dollars 3.3m (Pounds 2.14m) plus costs for unfair dismissal.
Mr Pena said the jury's findings in his favour on all 32 counts, which
included absolving him of the obligation to repay Dollars 1.3m in company
loans, had vindicated his actions.
He had argued that he had only agreed to repay the money - expenses incurred
in moving from Los Angeles to Houston - if the company kept him on until his
contract ran out at the end of 1994. 'Would I give Dollars 1.3m back for
free? Am I crazy? Am I an idiot?' asked the outspoken Mr Pena.
Mr Howard Wolf, the chairman who replaced Mr Pena in 1991, said GWR strongly
contested the decision, particularly on the loan repayment. He did not hide
his disappointment at the jury's finding. 'Whatever we pay . . . will reduce
profits,' he said. GWR reported an interim loss of Dollars 2.03m in May,
compared with a Dollars 13.6m loss in the previous year.
Mr Wolf said the jury's award was not final. The judge's verdict would be
made after further presentations from both parties.
Mr Pena, meanwhile, plans to focus on his business seminars run from his
Scottish castle and return to London with a quoted vehicle within the next
12 months.
He also intends to write a book, 'which I expect will be a best-seller,
about how I built up GWR'.
