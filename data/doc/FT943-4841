FT  07 SEP 94 / Housing benefit cuts 'hit renting'
Cuts in housing benefit could halt the fragile recovery in the UK's private
rented housing sector, a government adviser warned yesterday.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, said on Monday that the
fast-growing housing benefit budget was a target for cost-cutting in the
autumn public spending round. The means-tested benefit pays some or all of
the rent for low-income households.
However, Professor Peter Kemp of York University told a conference organised
by Shelter, the housing charity, that cutting benefit levels would reduce
the demand for private rented housing and decrease the supply.
Prof Kemp has been commissioned by the Social Security Department to carry
out research into how other countries have contained the costs of subsidies
on rents.
The private rented sector has increased since 1988, Prof Kemp said, after
three-quarters of a century of almost continuous decline. However, some of
the increase had been caused by the decline in the housing market, which had
forced many homeowners to rent out homes they could not sell, and had
discouraged potential first-time buyers.
The return for landlords from letting residential property was already too
low in comparison with alternative investments such as commercial property,
he said. Without the underpinning on rents offered by housing benefit, some
would leave the market.
There would also be a reduction in the number of people prepared to pay the
higher rents common in the private sector without housing benefit.
The cost of housing benefit has risen from Pounds 3.75bn in 1988-89 to
Pounds 8.8bn in 1993-94, and is forecast to rise to more than Pounds 11bn by
1996-97. Ministers have been examining ways to cap the growth, which Mr
Aitken called 'exponential'.
