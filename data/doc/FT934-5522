FT  30 NOV 93 / Moldova brings in new currency
Moldova yesterday broke away from the Russian rouble zone and introduced its
own currency, the leu, as the centrepiece of the government's new shock
therapy reform programme, writes Jill Barshay in Kishinev.
Armoured trucks yesterday distributed 70m lei to Moldova's 4.3m citizens,
who are entitled to change up to 70,000 of Moldova's interim currency
coupons at 1,000 to the leu immediately. The rest will be converted later in
bank accounts.
