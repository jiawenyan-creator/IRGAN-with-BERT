  [Text] Groznyy January 16 TASS -- Yaragiy Mamodayev, head 
of the Chechen Government of popular confidence, called upon the 
republic's President Dzhokhar Dudayev to admit that his rule had 
no prospects, to immediately report back to his people and step 
down. Mamodayev's open letter with this appeal was published on 
Sunday by Chechnya's only independent newspaper "SPRAVEDLIVOST." 
  The opposition leader claimed that Dudayev's two-year rule 
had led the republic to a deadlock. But now, he said, "the 
people has begun to see clearly, it seeks to build a free state 
not to only shut itself off by borders and customs from the rest 
of the world. It does not want to quarell with its neighbours, 
both close and distant. It does not want to be treated with 
suspicion or estrangement." And if the present leaders cannot 
understand this, it is better for them to resign, Mamodayev 
stressed. 
  The more so, that neither Dzhokhar Dudayev nor the Chechen 
people brought to the verge of national disaster have much time 
left, the head of the government of popular confidence.
