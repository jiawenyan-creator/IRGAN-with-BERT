WESTSIDE DIGEST: WESTWOOD; 
RHOADS SCHOLARSHIP FUND 
A scholarship fund in memory of Randy Rhoads, a rock guitarist for the Ozzy 
Ozbourne band who died in a plane crash in 1982, has been established at the 
UCLA College of Fine Arts for the study of classical guitar, according to J. 
Bernard Kester, dean of the college. 
The $50,000 gift for the scholarship came from a trust fund of Rhoads' career 
earnings. 
Rhoads was a classical music devotee and had planned to enter the guitar 
performance program at UCLA, said his mother, Delores Rhoads, a music teacher 
and owner of the Musonia School in North Hollywood.
