  [Text] [Timor resistance representative] Ramos Horta 
revealed that last night the Timorese resistance carried out a 
strong military offensive on the capital, Dili. This is the 
first resistance attack for many years. The only targets of the 
attack were Indonesian military installations, according to 
Ramos Horta. 
  [Begin Horta recording] There was a very well planned, 
organized, resistance attack on a number of military units in 
the outskirts of Dili. It led to strong retaliation from the 
Indonesians. The shooting went on for several hours. A Chinese 
was killed with a bayonet by the Indonesian forces -- he was 
stabbed in the head with it. 
  We are trying to find out more details of the guerrilla's 
operation, but there is not doubt that it was a major offensive.

  Ramos Horta also revealed that the Timorese resistance is 
forming a shadow cabinet to take over the future of East Timor 
at a moment's notice.
