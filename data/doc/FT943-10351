FT  05 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Zeneca in shape
When the plan to split ICI was announced two years ago, the decision to
combine pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialty chemicals in a demerged
company raised a few eyebrows. While the synergies between the businesses
remain a matter for debate, Zeneca's portfolio is proving its worth in
financial terms. The drugs business is going through a relatively lean
patch, but agrochemicals and specialties are showing strong recoveries.
Yesterday's 31 per cent rise in pre-tax profits before exceptional items was
more than the market anticipated.
The worry is that the chemicals side of the business may have to provide the
pep to profits for some time to come. Drugs sales increased by a relatively
modest 6 per cent in the first half, and fell for the second period running
in the US. Underlying growth may be slightly better than this suggests -
destocking of Zestril, Zeneca's biggest drug, depressed the overall rate of
growth - but the competitive climate in the US is not getting easier.
Zeneca's promising selection of new drugs is still some years from making a
big impact on profits.
With a fair wind - literally, given the impact of the weather on
agrochemicals profits - Zeneca should still be able to deliver the kind of
earnings growth shareholders are expecting. By topping up its stock of
provisions the company has carefully created room for additional
cost-savings. With gearing of around 18 per cent and falling, Zeneca could
also afford to buy additional growth. If the squeeze in pharmaceuticals gets
worse, it may have to.
