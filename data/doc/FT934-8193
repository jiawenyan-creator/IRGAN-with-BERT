FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Vietnam contract for Laing
JOHN LAING, the British construction group, has won a contract to design,
construct and operate a new Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m) international
passenger terminal at the Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi, subject to a feasibility
study which should be completed this year.
John Laing International is the first British company to win a licence for
construction since the late 1980s. The terminal will be built in conjunction
with the Northern Airports Region of Vietnam.
The terminal, which would be ready in two years, could handle 2.5m
international passengers, against a current traffic of 500,000.
It will apparently be based on Birmingham International Airport's Eurohub
terminal, built by Laing Midlands.
The contract was initialled last summer following a visit to Britain of Mr
Vo Van Kiet, Vietnamese prime minister.
Mr Bruce Boys, managing director of John Laing International, said: 'We are
obviously pleased to be one of the first British companies to be involved in
Vietnam's expansion. We feel there will be huge investment in Vietnam in the
next few years.'
