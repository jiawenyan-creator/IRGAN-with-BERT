FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: BCE turns in Pounds 0.8m deficit after
exceptionals
BCE Holdings, the USM-traded distributor of snooker and pool products and
amusement arcade operator, reported a deficit of Pounds 796,000 before and
after tax for the 12 months to March 31.
The outcome, on turnover of Pounds 3.73m, took in exceptional charges
totalling Pounds 203,000, largely comprising a capital loss on the disposal
of four amusement arcades in the Bristol area last December.
The group made stock provisions of Pounds 200,000. Mr John Roberts,
appointed chairman at the end of last year, stressed that the figures were
not comparable with the previous year when losses amounted to Pounds 56,000
on turnover of Pounds 4.27m.
Losses per share emerged at 2.9p (0.2p). Following the capital
reorganisation, directors intend to declare a dividend for the current year;
the last distribution was in 1989.
