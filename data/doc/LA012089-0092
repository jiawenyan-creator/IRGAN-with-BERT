METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
 SLUMLORD PAYS FINES, TO BEGIN JAIL TERM 
After rejection of his appeal, convicted slumlord William H. Burkhalter Jr. has 
paid $18,700 in fines and penalties and been ordered to surrender Feb. 23 to 
begin serving a 45-day jail sentence. 
Burkhalter, 56, was convicted by a Los Angeles Municipal Court jury on Feb. 24, 
1987, of 22 violations of fire, safety and health codes at a 63-unit apartment 
building at 1723 W. 9th St. He was sentenced by Judge Suzanne Person on March 
3, 1987. 
Person also ordered him to perform 250 hours of community service at County-USC 
Medical Center and 750 hours at the U.S. Mission. In addition, he was placed on 
36 months of summary probation. 
Deputy Los Angeles City Atty. Richard Robb said Burkhalter, who no longer owns 
the now-vacant building, appealed to Superior Court, contending that the 
sentence was excessive. But the higher court's appellate department rejected 
the appeal. 
Person told Burkhalter to report to her Sept. 28 on his progress in completing 
the community service.
