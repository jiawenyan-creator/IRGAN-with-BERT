Section 682.410Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement Requirements 
Section 682.410General 




Comments:

 A few commenters noted that on-going negotiated rulemaking sessions are addressing matters covered in this section
of the regulations. The commenters suggested that it would be inappropriate for final rules to be issued in light of
the negotiations underway. Commenters recommended that the Department should propose regulations for issues related
to this section later through an NPRM and final rules process devoted solely to these issues. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary notes that these regulations are directly related to the 1992 Amendments and were developed under the
negotiated rulemaking sessions required by the 1992 Amendments. The provisions of the 1992 Amendments that were
not changed by OBRA are reflected in these final regulations. The Secretary intends to propose rules to implement
the provisions of OBRA related to guaranty agency reserves soon after the conclusion of current negotiated rulemaking
sessions on this subject. In addition, the Secretary intends to have final regulations implementing both the 1992
Amendments and OBRA go into effect at the same time on July 1, 1995. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.410(a)(1)(vii) 




Comments:

 Commenters recommended that funds collected by the guaranty agency, included under 682.410(a)(1)(vii)
as reserve fund assets, should include only funds collected on FFELP loans held by that agency or FFELP loans for which
the agency paid a claim. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that clarification is necessary. 


Changes:

 The final regulations have been revised to clarify that only funds collected on FFELP loans on which a claim has been
paid are included in 682.410(a)(1)(vii). 


Section 682.410(a)(3) 




Comments:

 Commenters objected to 682.410(a)(3), Special rule for use of certain reserve fund assets, as redundant and
confusing. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that 682.410(a)(3) is unnecessary. 


Changes:

 The language in 682.410(a)(3) has been simplified and merged into 682.410(a)(2). 


Section 682.410(a)(6) 




Comments:

 A commenter urged that the Secretary consider provisions for further review and due process in connection with the
requirements of 682.410(a)(6), minimum reserve fund level. 


Discussion:

 Section 682.410(a)(6) simply states the statutory requirements for minimum reserve levels. This paragraph specifies
no action by the Department requiring review or due process. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.410(a)(7) 




Comments:

 A commenter suggested that the calculation of the guaranty agency ``Reserve fund level'' include receivables from
ED and exclude payables to ED. The commenter argued that acknowledgment of those amounts is essential for an accurate
determination of a guarantor's financial status. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary is interested in determining the amount of assets in a guaranty agency's reserve fund at a point in time.
The Secretary acknowledges that the reserve fund level as defined in this paragraph does not accurately reflect the
overall financial condition of the guaranty agency. However, the Secretary also believes that including receivables
from ED and deducting payables to ED would also not result in an accurate calculation of the agency's financial condition
since agencies have receivables from and payables to parties other than ED. The Secretary agrees that if an agency's
reserve fund level, calculated in accordance with this section, is less than the minimum specified in 682.410(a)(6),
the guaranty agency will be provided with the opportunity to submit information concerning its accounts payable
and accounts receivable in extenuation of its reserve level. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B) 




Comments:

 A commenter recommended removing loan guarantees transferred to another agency pursuant to a plan of the Secretary
in response to the insolvency of the agency as an exclusion from loan guarantees transferred to another agency in 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B).



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the reference to those loans should be removed from 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B) because
it is duplicative of 34 CFR 682.410(a)(8)(i)(B) which already provides for this exclusion. 


Changes:

 Section 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B) has been revised to delete the reference to loans transferred because of insolvency.



Section 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(E) 




Comments:

 Some commenters recommended that all loans for which a claim has been paid be subtracted from the total loans guaranteed
in calculating loans outstanding in 682.410(a)(8), definition of amount of loans outstanding. One commenter
recommended subtracting from the amount of loans for which a 
claim has been paid only those loans for which claims were paid at the direction of the Secretary. 


Discussion:

 The proposed rule would have subtracted loans for which claims are paid under 682.412(e) on ineligible loans,
under 682.509(a)(1) because of school closing, or at the direction of the Secretary, from total loans for which
a claim has been paid. The Secretary agrees that loans for which claims have been paid are not outstanding. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to remove the three exclusions. 


Section 682.410(a)(8) 




Comments:

 A commenter recommended adding to 682.410(a)(8), amount of loans outstanding, a new paragraph (iii) to subtract
the principal amount of loans not disbursed because the loan guarantee was partially canceled. 


Discussion:

 Reporting requirements for Form 1130 provide detailed definitions for the items listed in 682.410(a)(8).
Partially canceled loans are one of the categories reported under cancelled loan guarantees and are therefore included
in 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(A). 


Changes:

 None.
