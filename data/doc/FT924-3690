FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: Historic Van Gogh - Saleroom
ONE OF Van Gogh's very last paintings, 'Jardin a Auvers' which has not been
seen in public since the war, goes on display today in Paris's Drouot sale
rooms and tomorrow night becomes the first ever historic monument to be put
up for auction in France.
Auctioneer Jean-Claude Binoche has put an estimate of between Fr50-80m
(around Pounds 602,000 to Pounds 960,000) on the work which he thinks could
have fetched up to Fr300m (Pounds 3,610,000) if its peculiar status did not
prevent it leaving the country. Made an historic monument in 1988 because of
the scarcity of works by Van Gogh in France's public collections - there are
25 in all - 'Jardin a Auvers', even with its modest estimate, would easily
gobble up the entire annual purchasing budget of French Museums. Paris's
Musee d'Orsay, the keenest candidate for the canvas, is praying that
whichever French collector does buy the painting will make it into a
'dation' - a work of art offered to the state in lieu of death duties.
'Jardin a Auvers' was painted in July 1890 just days before Van Gogh killed
himself while staying at Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris with Dr Paul-Ferdinand
Gachet. It is the first major work by Van Gogh to come up for sale since his
painting of his host and physician 'Portrait du Dr Gachet', executed June
3-5, 1890, broke all auction house records by fetching Dollars 82,500,000
(Pounds 43,107,142) at Christie's New York in May 1990 - just before the art
market bubble burst.
Measuring 64 by 80cm 'Jardin a Auvers' was probably painted in two sessions.
It depicts a corner of a very formal French garden, without horizon or sky,
given dizzying bright movement by a variety of brush strokes with which Van
Gogh was experimenting at the time. Last exhibited in 1945 at the Stedelijk
Museum in Amsterdam, it was sold to its present owner, French collector
Jacques Walter in 1954 from the collection of Mrs Alice Kurtz.
