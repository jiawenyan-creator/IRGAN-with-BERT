  [Text] Israel has become the first country to officially 
lift its arms embargo against South Africa. This follows the 
United Nations Security Council's resolution last month to 
cancel the military embargo and other restrictions it had 
imposed in the past. There had been speculation that the two 
countries were cooperating on nuclear weapons and ballistic 
missile research until Israel stopped signing arms contracts 
with South Africa in 1987.
