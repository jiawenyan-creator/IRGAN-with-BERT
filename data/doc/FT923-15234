FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Dauphins' seek NEC seats
MR Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the twin dauphins of the Labour party,
are to run for the national executive committee - their first electoral test
in the party's national arena.
With nominations for the national executive elections closing today, their
decision to run - undoubtedly taken jointly - will prove an intriguing
measure of their popularity in the country at large and the mood of
activists in the party.
Both men are regularly named as the two shadow cabinet members most likely
to become the next Labour leader but one.
Both too will present themselves as stalwart allies of Mr John Smith and
champions of a thorough modernisation of the party.
As candidates for the NEC's seven-strong constituency section, their rivals
include a strong field of party heavyweights with Mr Neil Kinnock, the
outgoing leader, also contesting a place.
At present there is only one known 'vacancy' following the decision of Mr
Gerald Kaufman not to seek re-election for the NEC or the shadow cabinet.
Under a rule-change introduced last year, constituency Labour parties are
now obliged to ballot all their members on the principle of one member, one
vote.
That change was said to have contributed to Mr Kaufman's victory last year
and the fall in the vote for Mr Tony Benn, the veteran leftwinger.
In Labour's parliamentary elections yesterday, Mr Derek Foster, the chief
whip, comfortably saw off a challenge from Mr John Evans, an NEC member and
MP for St Helens North, by 158 votes to 90.
The first round in the contest for the chairmanship of the Parliamentary
Labour Party saw Mr Douglas Hoyle, a veteran leftwinger, top the poll with
85 votes.
Insiders believe, however, that Mr Ernie Ross, with 62 votes his nearest
rival in the five-horse race, will come through when exhaustive balloting is
completed.
