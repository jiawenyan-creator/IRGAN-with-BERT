  [Text] The National Committee for Order and Public Safety, 
which met at the Interior Ministry today, has decided on the 
immediate deployment of a further 350 troops in the province of 
Reggio Calabria, not counting the 250 stationed in Catanzaro, 
the 100 stationed in the province of Cosenza, and the 5,200 in 
Sicily. It was also decided that security measures for judges at 
risk should be stepped up and the area more closely controlled. 
  Interior Minister Mancino commented: "The latest criminal 
acts are part of the increased violence by the 'Ndrangheta 
[Calabria Mafia], which is reacting indiscriminately or 
symbolically against the state's increasingly forceful 
offensive."
