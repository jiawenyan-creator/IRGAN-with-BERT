 

3. Provided, that the liability of the Principal and Surety hereunder to the Government shall be subject to the same
limitations and defenses as may be available to them against a claim hereunder by the Owner, provided, however, that
the Government may, at its option, perform any obligations of the Owner required by the contract. 

4. It is expressly agreed that this bond shall be deemed amended automatically and immediately, without formal and
separate amendments hereto, upon any amendment to the Construction Contract, so as to bind the Principal and the Surety
to the full and faithful performance of the Construction Contract as so amended, provided only that the total amount
of all increases in the cost of construction shall not exceed 20 percent of the amount of the maximum price set forth
in the Construction Contract. The term ``Amendment,'' wherever used in this bond, and whether referring to this bond,
the Construction Contract or the Loan Contract shall include any alteration, addition, extension, modification,
amendment, rescission, waiver, release or annulment, of any character whatsoever. 

5. It is expressly agreed that any amendment which may be made by agreement or otherwise between the Principal and the
Owner in the terms, provisions, covenants and conditions of the Construction Contract, or in the terms, provisions,
covenants and conditions of the Loan Contract (including, without limitation, the granting by the Administrator
to the Owner of any extension of time for the performance of the obligations of the Owner under the Loan Contract or the
granting by the Administrator or the Owner to the Principal of any extension of time for the performance of the obligations
of the Principal under the Construction Contract, or the failure or refusal of the Administrator or the Owner to take
any action, proceeding or step to enforce any remedy or exercise any right under either the Construction Contract
or the Loan Contract, or the taking of any action, proceeding or step by the Administrator or the Owner, acting in good
faith upon the belief that the same is permitted by the provisions of the Construction Contract or the Loan Contract)
shall not in any way release the Principal and the Surety, or either of them or their respective executors, administrators,
successors or assigns, from liability hereunder. The Surety hereby acknowledges receipt of notice of any amendment,
indulgence or forbearance, made, granted or permitted. 

6. This bond is made for the benefit of all persons, firms and corporations who or which may furnish any materials or
perform any labor for or on account of the construction to be performed under the Construction Contract and any amendments
thereto. Provided, that beneficiaries or claimants hereunder shall be limited to the subcontractors, and persons,
firms and corporations having a direct contract with the Principal or its subcontractors. 

7. Provided, further, that no suit or action shall be commenced hereunder by any person, firm, or corporation who performed
work or labor or who furnished materials for the project: (a) Unless such person, firm, or corporation, other one having
a direct contract with the Principal (or with the Government in the event the Government is performing the obligation
of the Owner), shall have given detailed written notice of claim to: The Principal, and the Owner, within ninety (90)
days after such person, firm, or corporation did or performed the last of the work or labor, or furnished the last of
the materials for which such claim is made. (b) After the expiration of one (1) year following the date on which Principal
ceased work on said contract, it being understood, however, that if any limitation embodied in the Bond is prohibited
by any law controlling the construction hereof, such limitation shall be deemed to be amended so as to equal to the minimum
period of limitation permitted by such law. 

In witness whereof, the undersigned have caused this instrument to be executed and their respective corporate seals
