FT  10 DEC 94 / Clinton fires surgeon-general
President Bill Clinton yesterday fired his top public health official over
comments she made advocating the teaching of masturbation in schools. White
House chief-of-staff Leon Panetta said the comment by Surgeon-General
Jocelyn Elders 'was just one too many' controversial remarks and that Mr
Clinton had demanded she resign. According to the US magazine News and World
Report, Dr Elders had finished a speech on Aids at the United Nations in New
York when a man asked whether she would support promoting masturbation to
discourage school-age children from trying riskier forms of sexual activity.
'With regard to masturbation, I think that is something that is a part of
human sexuality and a part of something that perhaps should be taught,' she
replied.
