FT  09 APR 94 / How to Spend it: The wealth of the world
Wealth of Nations is a small mail order company purveying traditional
garments from around the world. Almost every culture had evolved some
classic garments that would have a universal appeal, reasoned Julia
Woodham-Smith, the company's founder and owner. Her tastes run to the
hand-made and the natural so her catalogue focuses on these.
The first catalogue offered wedding shirts from Mexico, creamy cotton smocks
from rural Hungary, work shirts from Ireland. Since then it has expanded.
There are linen shirts from Croatia, cowhide navvies belts, Chinese work
suits and work shirts from Brittany.
Newest of all is the range for children. Some are simply scaled down
versions of the adult designs - the Hungarian shirt, the Csikosok waistcoat,
the Indian gingham shirt and the Camargue shirt. Others have been specially
made - the little shepherd's smock is made from cotton calico from the Styal
water mill in Cheshire. As Woodham-Smith points out, real shepherd's smocks
were designed to keep out the wind and the wet but today, they have been
revived as partywear.
Because of the quality of the materials and the amount of handwork, prices
are not low. The shepherd's smock, for instance, is Pounds 30.
The children's clothes can be bought from The Conran Shop, 81 Fulham Road,
London SW3 as well as by mail. For a brochure write to: Wealth of Nations,
