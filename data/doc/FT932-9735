FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: The Equitable back in black with
Dollars 31.8m in first term
THE EQUITABLE, the US life insurer in which France's Axa group holds a 49
per cent equity stake, yesterday reported an after-tax profit of Dollars
31.8m for the three months to end-March. This compared with a loss of
Dollars 3.7m in the same period of 1992, before one-off items.
The insurer said the first-quarter figure included Dollars 7.3m of
investment gains and restructuring charges of Dollars 3.9m. Last time, the
net loss stemmed partly from the inclusion of Dollars 24.3m of investment
losses and restructuring charges of Dollars 1.9m.
The net profit would have been higher but for continued losses from the
disability income business. This produced a net loss of Dollars 31.6m in the
1993 quarter, compared with a deficit of Dollars 4.5m in the same period of
1992.
The insurer said its core insurance business - after taking out disability
income losses and investment transaction gains - made a net profit of
Dollars 21m. On a similar basis, the comparable 1992 figure would have been
a Dollars 4.8m profit.
Equitable's 'investment services' operations, which include the Alliance
Capital fund management operation and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
brokerage, recorded an after-tax profit of Dollars 46.4m, slightly down on
the Dollars 49.3m in the same period of 1992.
On the investment side, The Equitable said it had stepped up the income
yield on its main general account portfolio to 7.74 per cent, compared with
7.44 per cent a year ago. It attributed the improvement to a shift to
longer-term fixed maturity investments, and better returns for
property-related holdings. 'Problem' commercial mortgages totalled Dollars
299.1m at the end of the first quarter, against Dollars 388.4m at the end of
1992.
