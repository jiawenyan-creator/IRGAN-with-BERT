SHEVARDNADZE'S RESIGNATION 
The Times presented verbatim highlights of Shevardnadze's speech in which he 
clearly states that he is still a Communist (Part A, Dec. 21). Anyone who ever 
studied Communism must know that it is a doctrine that advocates the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. So, how can Shevardnadze resign his post 
because of a threat of a dictatorship? Or perhaps, is it just a dictatorship 
not to his liking?
