FT  04 JUL 94 / Catholic training body faces closure
Members of Cathedral Employment Enterprise, one of the biggest providers of
employment training in London, are meeting tomorrow to discuss winding up
the organisation, which is run by the Roman Catholic Church.
The group says falling government funding, partly due to a move towards
'payment by results', and restrictive and nonsensical regulations, are
making it impossible for it to operate.
The organisation employs 150 staff in 50 centres across London, running
about 80 courses for 1,400 people.
Cathedral's annual turnover is Pounds 3m. About Pounds 120,000 came from the
Catholic Church last year, out of a total of Pounds 400,000 from external
sources, with the government providing the rest.
Father Hugh Bridge, company secretary, said government funding of some
courses had fallen from more than 95 per cent to 70 per cent, putting
increasing pressure on the Church and other sources to come up with the
money. The Church, however, has refused to increase its contribution, or
Cathedral's borrowing powers.
Mr Bridge said it may be right that employer-run training courses, designed
to equip trainees to work for that employer, should not be totally funded by
the state. But for groups such as Cathedral, which devoted much of their
efforts to teaching basic skills to illiterate and innumerate people, there
was little alternative to public funding.
As an example of 'bureaucracy gone mad', Mr Bridge quoted a project in north
London teaching care-in-the-community skills.
Cathedral had a contract with North West London Training and Enterprise
Council, which disburses money on behalf of the government, to train 60
adults to level one of the National Vocational Qualifications. When able
members passed level two as well, the Tec refused to pay for it as the
contract specified level one only.
