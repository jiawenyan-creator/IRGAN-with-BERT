KOCH SLEEPS IN -- TILL 6 A.M. 
After 12 years as mayor, Ed Koch slept in on his first day as Citizen Koch -- 
until 6 a.m. 
Koch, whose reign as mayor ended Monday, gave himself an extra hour to sleep 
Tuesday, then worked out at a gym and arrived at his new law office by 8 a.m. 
"I was the first one into the office," crowed Koch, now a partner at Robinson, 
Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn &amp; Berman. 
He also recorded a three-minute commentary for a New York radio station on 
Tuesday morning, met his new co-workers, set up lunch dates with potential 
clients and then went off to lunch with officials at the television station on 
which he will appear in a weekly show. 
"I'm having a ball," he said.
