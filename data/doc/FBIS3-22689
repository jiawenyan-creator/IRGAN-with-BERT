Estonian Swine -- Over 200 Carcasses in Quarantine, No Danger to 
Humans From the Disease"] 
  [Text] The swine disease ravaging one farm in Valuste in 
the Jarvenmaa region of Estonia has been confirmed to be swine 
fever in an analysis conducted in a laboratory in Tartu. The 
disease has caused more damage than feared, since over 1,000 
swine have died of it. Animals that may have been carrying swine 
fever have also been sent to be slaughtered. 
  At the Rakvere meat combine there are 207 swine carcasses in 
quarantine that are to be inspected before use to prevent the 
spread of swine fever. 
  Swine fever does not present any danger to humans or house 
pets, but both may be carriers of the dangerous disease. The 
origin of the swine fever in Valuste is not known. One 
hypothesis is that it came from Poland, where the disease is 
prevalent. In Estonia it occurred a previous time in 1962. 
  It is reported from the large farm in Valuste, which is 
organized in the form of a corporation, that the disease 
symptoms were discovered back at the beginning of December, but 
it was not possible at that time to determine that it was swine 
fever. 
  Suspicions were aroused when the swine began to die. At the 
beginning of December there were about 2,200 swine, and on 
Thursday [27 January] only 360 [figures as published] were left. 
Of course, part of the swine had been sold. On Wednesday [26 
January] 15 swine died and were buried using a power shovel. 
  The Estonians fear that swine fever may spread. Pork is 
continually sold by the farm to persons residing in the region. 
The farm is a former collective farm, and its employees also 
have their own swine, which are obviously in danger of contagion. 
  Fresh meat may not be imported into Finland from Estonia, 
but 
at the Tallinn market, at least, a lot of it is sold to Finns. 
Sausage that is not fully cooked may also contain pathogenic 
agents, since eliminating them from the meat requires boiling 
for two hours.
