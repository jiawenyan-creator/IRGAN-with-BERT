 

(3) In the event that the District is unwilling or unable to enforce a provision of this delegation with respect to a
source subject to the OCS air regulations, the District will immediately notify the EPA Region 9 Regional Administrator.
Failure to notify the Regional Administrator does not preclude EPA from exercising its enforcement authority.

(4) EPA shall retain authority to implement and enforce all requirements for OCS sources located beyond 25 miles from
states' seaward boundaries.

(5) This delegation may be amended at any time by the formal written agreement of both the VCAPCD and the U.S. EPA including
amendments to add, change, or remove conditions or terms of this agreement.

(6) If VCAPCD adopts revisions to the District regulations reviewed by EPA and found to meet the requirements set forth
at 40 CFR 55.11 for delegation, the parties may amend the agreement pursuant to condition 5 above, or EPA may take steps
to revoke the delegation in whole or in part pursuant to condition 7 below. Any amendments to regulations submitted
by the District to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 55.11 shall not be applied under this agreement until EPA has reviewed
such amendments and determined that they are still adequate to implement and enforce the delegable portions of 40
CFR part 55.

(7) If the U.S. EPA determines that: (a) The requirements of the OCS air regulations are not being adequately implemented
or enforced by VCAPCD; or (b) VCAPCD no longer has adequate regulations as required by 40 CFR 55.11(b) in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this delegation, the requirements of 40 CFR part 55, or the Clean Air Act, this delegation,
after consultation with the VCAPCD, may be revoked in whole or in part. Any such revocation shall be effective as of
the date specified in a Notice of Revocation to the VCAPCD.

(8) This delegation of authority becomes effective upon the date of the signature of both parties to this Agreement.

(9) A notice of this delegated authority will be published in the 

Federal Register
