FT  29 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trader calls for rise in US
wheat area
JUST AS the EC is preparing to boost land set-asides in a reformed Common
Agriculture Policy, Cargill, the giant US grain exporter, is urging the US
government to end acreage reduction for wheat and to even to put some of the
land in the US conservation reserve back into production.
'The US wheat industry is showing all the signs of an industry in trouble,'
Cargill said, in its company bulletin. 'It is evident in the dwindling share
of world wheat markets - down to levels rarely seen since the United States
became a commercial exporter of wheat 30 years ago.'
According to Cargill, the Conservation Reserve Program has taken 11m acres
of formerly productive wheat acreage out of production. With these
constraints full US production is 400m bushels - less than full production
at the start of the 1980s - at a time when world grain usage has grown by
about 3bn bushels in the last 10 years.
'The US simply cannot hold its own by producing less when the world is
consuming more,' said Cargill.
The US Department of Agriculture says non-US wheat and wheat flour
production grew steadily from 1988-89 until last year - from 59.7m tonnes to
71.2m tonnes. The most recent estimates indicate a reduction of wheat
production for 1992-93 from non-US sources to 69.6m tonnes.
Meanwhile, US wheat production has varied over the past four years from
37.6m tonnes to 33.5m tonnes to 28.3m tonnes to 35.7m tonnes. The most
recent US grain report predicted a 32.5m output for the US this year.
Most of American wheat exports over the past six years have been subsidised,
according to Cargill. This has led to 'scrambled market signals' and
confused producers. 'US wheat prices are lower than they would be in an open
market, given that carryover stocks are at their lowest point in decades,'
said the Cargill bulletin.
