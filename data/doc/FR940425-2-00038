Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing
of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From Bard Manufacturing Company

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Bard Manufacturing Company (Bard) from the existing
Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's DCC and DCL series central
furnaces.






Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Bard. Bard's Petition for Waiver requests DOE to grant
relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Bard seeks to test using
a blower delay time of 60 seconds for its DCC and DCL series central furnaces instead of the specified 1.5 minute delay
between burner on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting
the Petition for Waiver.

<DATE>
DATES: 

DOE will accept comments, data, and information not later than May 25, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 10012, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100357, and the Energy policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, Subpart
B.





The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.



The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedures amendments become effective, resolving the problem that
is the subject of the waiver.
