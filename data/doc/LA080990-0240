WORLD; 
COSMONAUTS LAND WITH CRYSTALS 
Two cosmonauts whose mission was plagued by technical problems and a perilous 
spacewalk returned to Earth today with a multimillion-ruble payload of 
space-grown crystals. 
The Soyuz TM-9 capsule carrying Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin landed 
on the Central Asian steppes at 11:34 a.m., one minute ahead of schedule. 
The landing was not broadcast live on Soviet television. But the midday 
"Vremya" TV news program showed the cosmonauts waving goodby to their 
replacement crew before leaving the orbiting space station Mir. 
"Back in the landing spaceship, we felt the slightly bitter smell of absinthe 
in the Kazakh steppe," Solovyev told reporters after landing and ending his 
six-month stay in space. "I also dreamed that my wife would bring me fresh, 
delicious apples when I was back on Earth," he said.
