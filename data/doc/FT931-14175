FT  20 JAN 93 / Sultans lose vote on immunity
MALAYSIA'S parliament yesterday approved constitutional amendments to strip
the country's nine hereditary rulers of their immunity from the law, Reuter
reports from Kuala Lumpur.
At a special sitting, 133 members voted in favour of the bill, with 16
abstentions. No one opposed the bill, proposed by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on Monday.
This may provoke a constitutional crisis, as the sultans can delay, but not
block, legislation for 30 days. But the constitution also says no amendments
can be made on matters affecting the rulers' position without their consent.
The sultans, who take turns to be king for five years under Malaysia's
constitutional monarchy, had rejected the proposals on Monday.
The amendments divest the nine sultans of their legal immunity and their
power to pardon family members of criminal charges.
