  [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- "The documents on 
unification of Russian and Belarusian monetary systems signed 
here today are primarily important for the two peoples, we 
removed many obstacles that hampered bilateral relations," 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told correspondents 
here today upon the completion of the document signing ceremony. 
  He said this is the first time two Commonwealth states 
reached such a high decree of integration. 
  In his turn, Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
said 
the document on unification of monetary systems was signed by 
the Russian and Belarusian premiers, as well as the chairman of 
the Russian Central Bank. In his words, the chairman of the 
Belarusian National Bank did not sign the treaty as, in his 
opinion, an article of the document runs counter to the national 
legislation. 
  "Belarus is to make the last step -- to introduce 
corresponding changes in the current constitution and other 
legislative acts," said Kebich. The Belarusian prime minister 
stressed the document will start working already now despite the 
fact changes have not been introduced in the legislation. 
  In his opinion, changes can be introduced in the Belarusian 
constitution through a plebiscite or a referendum. He said 
there are no other obstacles on the way of the document. 
  Kebich stressed the two premiers signed the "document on an 
equal basis and proved Belarus do not want to live at somebody's 
expense". 
  Asked about the functioning of the Belarusian National Bank 
and the Russian Central Bank, Chernomyrdin said the documents 
provide for regulation of all credit-monetary policy on the 
common Russian-Belarusian financial space by the only body of 
the Russian Central Bank.
