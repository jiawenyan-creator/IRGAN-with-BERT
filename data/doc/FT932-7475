FT  24 MAY 93 / European industrial output 'to fall 3.9%'
EUROPEAN industrial output will fall by 3.9 per cent this year as a mood of
pessimism sweeps the continent's big economies, according to a report
published today.
The production decline in Germany, France and Italy will be even sharper
than the average as UK output will rise, says a review from DRI-McGraw Hill,
a forecasting company. Even when growth returns it will average only 2.1 per
cent over the next five years, compared with 3.6 per cent in 1986-1990.
Some sectors will do well. Communications services will grow 4.7 per cent a
year, with financial services and pharmaceuticals on 3.9 and 3.7 per cent
respectively.
But caution and tough competition in world markets means that 'many
investment decisions have either been postponed or cancelled, seriously
affecting the level of demand for capital goods'.
A slowdown in construction will stifle growth in metals, cement, glass and
ceramics.
Meanwhile, overcapacity will see iron and steel output growing by just 0.8
per cent a year over the next five years.
DRI-McGraw Hill cut its forecast for growth in sectors where Europe excels,
such as electrical equipment for industry and mechanical engineering. Their
annual growth projection over the next five years is 2.1 per cent, against a
forecast a year ago of 3.8 per cent. Aerospace equipment is also expected to
decline.
