  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- The People's Movement 
of Ukraine [RUKh] circulated an appeal to the Council for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and the UN Security Council 
  "Events that have recently taken place in the Crimean 
autonomous republic, which is an inalienable and constituent 
part of the Ukrainian state, are testimony of the real 
possibility of the region turning into a zone of permanent 
threat to peace and stability in Europe," the document says. 
The authors of the appeal note that "flagrant violations of 
Ukraine's constitution based on including on the agenda for a 
session of the Supreme Council of Crimea issues on the creation 
of Crimea's own armed forces, the introduction of dual 
citizenship, completely ignoring the interests of the indigenous 
Crimean Tatar and the Ukrainian population, and the redeployment 
of military formations from the territory of Russia to the 
Crimean peninsula, are acts aimed at violating civic peace on 
the territory of Crimea thus creating the grounds for the 
emergence of an armed conflict." 
  In RUKh's view, the situation arose as a result of direct 
and 
permanent interference by state officials of the Russian 
Federation in the affairs of a neighboring state. The Black Sea 
Fleet is being used by Russia as an instrument of forced 
pressure. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil, who signed the appeal, stressed that 
under these conditions the "process of the further withdrawal of 
nuclear warheads from Ukraine in accordance with the trilateral 
agreement should be suspended." 
  RUKh appeals to the Council for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and the UN Security Council since, in RUKh's view, "only 
the intervention of institutions that are called on to maintain 
security in Europe can defend peace in the region and prevent 
the creation of a new zone of international tension."
