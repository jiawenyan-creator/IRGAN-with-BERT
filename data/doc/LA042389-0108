PATRICK KENNEDY DENIES PLANS FOR CONGRESS RACE 
Freshman state Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy on Saturday surprised political experts 
by declaring his interest in seeking reelection in Rhode Island rather than 
turning his sights on Congress when he reaches the minimum age of 25 in 1992. 
The son of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who won his Rhode Island House 
seat in an expensive campaign last year, had been widely expected to challenge 
for one of the state's two Republican-held U.S. House seats.
