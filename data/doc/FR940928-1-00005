to a request from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) to allow additional time for specific comments

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:



Ms. Ellen Crum, Air Traffic Rules Branch (ATP230), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division,

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 25, 1994, the FAA published Notice No. 9428, ``Suspension of Certain Aircraft Operations From the
Transponder With Automatic Pressure Altitude Reporting Capability Requirement.'' This notice invites comments
on issues related to the reinstatement and modification of the expired Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)
No. 62, which suspended certain provisions of the regulations that require the installation of use of automatic altitude
reporting (Mode C) transponders.





Because the comment period originally established in Notice 9428 would not provide sufficient time for AOPA
to notify its members before the close of the comment period, AOPA forwarded a written request to the FAA for a 45-day
extension of the comment period. This extension would provide the required 45-day lead time for AOPA to publish this
information in its magazine and provide sufficient time for the submission of meaningful comments from its members.


In order to give all interested persons additional time to be notified of the issues, and submit their specific comments,
the FAA finds that it is in the public interest to extend the comment period. Accordingly, the comment period for Notice
No. 9428 is extended to November 25, 1994.





Issued in Washington, DC on September 23, 1994.
