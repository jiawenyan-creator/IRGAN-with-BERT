FT  07 MAY 92 / Business park planned in N Wales
A business park on the edge of the Snowdonia national park in north Wales is
to be developed in a Pounds 15m joint operation between the Development
Board for Rural Wales and the Royal Institute of British Architects, Anthony
Moreton writes.
The 300,000 sq ft park at Penrhyndeudraeth will create 750 jobs over the
next five to 10 years, Mr Glyn Davies, chairman of the board, said.
The board's annual report showed it paid Pounds 1.5m in grants during the
year to support almost 1,000 jobs. It has budgeted to spend Pounds 2.3m this
year.
