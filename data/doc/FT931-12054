FT  30 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace
Given near-universal scepticism, Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive,
deserves some credit for sticking to his prediction that the company would
land an order for Tornado fighters from Saudi Arabia. Following the
resuscitation of the European Fighter Aircraft project, the Saudi deal goes
a long way to securing BAe's revenue line. And the joint venture in regional
jets with Taiwan has plugged the main hole leaking cash. After the shock of
last September's interim figures and the Pounds 1bn-worth of provisions, the
company has regained an even keel.
The market has responded to the new management's sense of purpose and an
increasing belief in the company's recovery. Enthusiasm may well pull the
shares higher still. Yet while some big issues have been settled,
improvements in profitability from now on will be steady rather than
spectacular. Costs will come out of the business, but margins on the Pounds
10bn turnover will remain thin for some years.
The share rating, while not expensive, reflects the recent good news. There
is also a lingering cloud over Airbus. With the market weak, more orders may
be cancelled. The consortium's progress to positive cash flow has been
slowed once more.
The board has delivered on its promises. While it would not do to be
churlish, that success must not distract the directors from tackling the
endemic inefficiencies which have dogged the company for years.
