NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
BAKKER COHORT ASKS LENIENCY 
A judge known as "Maximum Bob" is considering former PTL executive Richard 
Dortch's tearful plea to have his eight-year prison sentence reduced. 
Dortch on Thursday asked U.S. District Judge Robert Potter to reduce his 
sentence because of his cooperation with the government in the trial of his 
former boss at the PTL television ministry, Jim Bakker. 
"I'm very, very sorry," Dortch, 58, told the judge. "Once again, I ask to be 
forgiven and for your mercy." 
Potter, known for his stiff sentences, said: "I'm cognizant of the fact that 
this is Rev. Dortch's last chance. I don't take it lightly, and I'm not going 
to rule on it today." He said it could be up to two weeks before he reports a 
decision. 
Dortch was indicted in 1988 with Bakker on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
for soliciting $158 million from PTL supporters in exchange for free lodging at 
the ministry's Christian retreat near Charlotte.
