  [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- A planned police raid 
on the African National Congress [ANC] headquarters at Shell 
House in Johannesburg on Tuesday [29 March] morning was 
cancelled by the government, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
Transvaal director Themba Khoza claimed. In a statement, Mr 
Khoza said the reason given to police officers who were to 
conduct the raid was that a search of Shell House could have 
damaging repercussions because it would harm "the political 
relationship between the government and the ANC". 
  However, police were told raids on hostels were to go ahead, 
Mr Khoza said. 
  "The Transvaal IFP leadership wish to express their shock 
that the community service expected from the police force is 
clearly dependent on the political relationship of the 
government and the ANC." 
  Witwatersrand police spokesman Lt Jan Combrink said he had 
no 
comment on Mr Khoza's claim. 
  Mr Khoza added: "Today's revelation provides damning and 
irrefutable proof of the level and extent of National Party 
government/ANC/South African Communist Party [SACP] collusion. 
"It provides final vindication of the widely-held belief that 
State President F W de Klerk is a `lame duck' president who 
takes his instructions from the ANC/SACP alliance."
