FT  05 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow advances on positive jobs
data
Wall Street
US share prices edged higher across the board following the publication of
jobs data that provided more positive news on the economy, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.15 at 3,288.68, more
than 10 points below its highs for the day. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 2.17 at 432.08, an all-time high, while
the Amex composite added 1.27 to 394.95 and the Nasdaq composite put on 5.24
to 661.60, another new record close. Turnover on the NYSE was 228m shares,
and rises outpaced declines by 991 to 759.
The November employment report proved better than expected, with the labor
department announcing that non-farm payrolls climbed 105,000 last month and
that the national unemployment rate dropped from 7.4 per cent to 7.2 per
cent. Although the figures came with some qualifications - non-farm
payrolls, for example, were boosted by 45,000 temporary government jobs
related to the election - the underlying employment picture shows that
labour market conditions are improving.
Investors were initially reluctant to embrace the data wholeheartedly,
primarily because of concerns that the combination of a reviving business
cycle and aggressive fiscal stimuli from President-elect Bill Clinton could
lead to an overheated economy, rising inflation and high interest rates.
Consequently, buying was restricted to growth stocks in the secondary
market. By early afternoon, however, demand for blue chips had begun to pick
up, with sentiment aided by a surprisingly positive reaction to the economic
news from the Treasury market, where bond prices rose.
Among individual stocks, General Motors climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33
7/8 in turnover of 3.7m shares as investors continued to welcome its
cost-cutting measures and massive corporate restructuring. GM announced
plans to close nine plants on Thursday and cut 18,000 jobs, news which
overshadowed the day's car sales data which showed GM's market share
slipping. The rest of the sector was also firmer, with Chrysler up Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 31 5/8 and Ford Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 43.
Dayton Hudson dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 as selling continued
in the wake of the retailer's recent poor November same-store sales figures.
Other retailers were in mixed form because of the sales data, with Gap
Stores down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 33 7/8 , Kmart up Dollars  3/8 at
Dollars 26 1/4 and Woolworth up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 33.
On the Nasdaq market, Intelligent Electronics jumped Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 11 5/8 on the news that a unit of K Mart is to buy the company's
Bizmart subsidiary for Dollars 270m.

points.
