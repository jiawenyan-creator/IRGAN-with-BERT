FT  02 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Investors move as Asia gets on the phone -
Opportunities abound as telecommunications catch up with region's economic
growth
A telecommunications revolution is sweeping the Asia-Pacific region. It is
not just new technology: the region's industry is being liberalised and
privatised at a pace breathtaking to observers of Europe's state-owned phone
monopolies.
Opportunities for overseas companies are manifold. Cable and Wireless, the
UK group, is exploring the ground for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) joint
venture to engineer a huge expansion of the Philippines' fixed-line system;
it already has a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecom, plus ventures in
Australia, Pakistan, Japan and Thailand.
Most of Asia-Pacific's economies outgrew their telephone systems years ago.
Governments now realise that only a massive injection of overseas expertise
and investment will give them the infrastructure they need to sustain
current growth rates.
'Over the next 20 years, the region will need about 500m telephone lines,
currently valued at Dollars 750bn,' according to Mr Arnold Djiwatampu, a
senior official of the International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency.
With 60 per cent of the world's population, and more than a quarter of its
output, the region has barely 17 per cent of the world's telephone lines. If
line growth continues at the current rate of about 10 per cent a year, the
number of main lines would reach nearly 5 per 100 people by the year 2000,
more than doubling the current telephone facility and representing a total
investment of at least Dollars 60bn.
Mr Andrew Harrington, regional telecommunications analyst at Salomon
Brothers Hong Kong, says: 'Asia-Pacific's telecoms sector is about to become
a powerful magnet for investment funds both from established companies and
diversified investors. In the next three years alone, there will be total
equity flotations of around Dollars 10bn. Direct investment by international
telecoms companies is likely to match that figure.'
Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong already have modern systems
and a high ratio of lines to population. The priority in those countries is
lower prices and more services through a variable combination of
privatisation of fixed-line networks, liberalisation, and rapid progress in
developing the mobile and value-added sectors.
Both Australia and New Zealand have licensed competitors to their former
state monopolies. Three years ago, New Zealand sold off 100 per cent of its
state carrier to a consortium led by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US;
C&amp;W has a 24.7 per cent stake in Optus, the main competitor to Telstra, the
former Australian monopoly carrier, with whom it is now working on the
Philippines feasibility study.
'A main thrust behind Australia's reforms was to make our industry more
competitive so that it has a sharper competitive edge in the region as a
whole,' says Mr Robin Davey, chairman of Austel, Australia's
telecommunications regulator.
Australian operators have responded on cue. 'Our ambition is to become a
premier regional carrier,' says Mr Peter Shore, managing director of
Telstra's international business division. The company has projects in eight
countries across the region.
'But,' says Mr Shore, 'as far as our industry is concerned, 'trade' is a
relatively new concept'. Debate about the best way to proceed - through
alliances with local carriers, by buying stakes in foreign companies or by
competing with them - is raging. Much will depend on the stance of
regulators, country by country.
Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea are taking tentative steps down the
liberalisation road. Of the region's more advanced economies, only Singapore
is holding out against competition, though Singapore Telecom is keen to
exploit overseas opportunities and already has mobile and data
communications joint ventures in nine countries.
In Malaysia and the Philippines, full market competition has been encouraged
with the former monopolies subjected to tariff restrictions and strong
competitive pressures.
Indonesia and Thailand's governments place less emphasis on competition,
which is largely restricted to non-basic services. Instead, various forms of
private sector partnership with existing operators are being encouraged.
Pakistan is contemplating the sale overseas of a large slice of its
telecommunications corporation.
In Thailand, Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has stake in Thai
Telephone and Telecom, a private company, which has a 'build, operate and
transfer' (BOT) franchise to install 1m lines in the provinces. TelecomAsia,
a consortium in which Nynex, the US operator, holds a 15 per cent stake, has
a BOT franchise to build 2m lines in Bangkok.
India, which is looking to increase its number of lines from 7m to 20m by
2000, is also after joint ventures to boost investment. The equipment and
mobile markets have already been partly liberalised, and the fixed-line
network is expected to follow. The goal is to provide each of India's
570,000 villages with a public pay phone; at present only 100,000 have one.
In telecommunications as in other sectors, China is the land of dreams. Mr
Yan Xianzu, Beijing's vice-minister of posts and telecommunications, was
reported to have told the Asia Telecom trade show recently that China was
aiming to nearly double its telephone capacity over the next two years, and
is looking to install about 70m new lines by 2000.
