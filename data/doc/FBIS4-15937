<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kholodov report: "What Did You Bargain For After </F>
All, Men? Baykonur in Prostration Again"] 
  [Text] Presidents Yeltsin's and Nazarbayev's signatures had 
hardly dried on the Baykonur treaty when Kazakhstan Vice Premier 
Galym Abelsiitov stated: The $115 million mentioned as the rent 
to be paid for the space center is payable by Russia on a 
monthly basis. In the interpretation of the Kazakh leaders, 
this is implied in Article 4, Item 2 of the Treaty: "The 
Russian Federation shall pay to the Republic of Kazakhstan rent 
for the use of Baykonur totaling $115 million. Part of the rent 
can be paid annually on a compensation basis subject to 
agreement by the governments of the two sides." In Moscow they 
are making a helpless gesture -- we thought we were agreeing to 
pay on an annual basis! The Russian annual budget, too, calls 
only for 135 billion rubles (about $80 million). 
  It appears that the high contracting parties were only 
trying 
to agree on the sum. The basis on which it is to be paid has 
yet to be "finalized." 
  In the meantime, tomorrow is the launch, "according to the 
new rules," of the first "Proton" rocket carrying three 
satellites of the GLONASS navigation system adopted by Russia on 
24 September 1993, which enables orientation with an accuracy of 
100 meters.
