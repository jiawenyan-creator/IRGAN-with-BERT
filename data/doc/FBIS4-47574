  [Abstract] The Novosibirsk Oblast Fund for Compulsory 
Medical Insurance was created on August 15, 1992, in response to 
national and regional legislative measures intended to provide 
compulsory medical insurance in the Russian Federation. The 
system has been created to ensure that for-profit and nonprofit 
employees make health insurance deposits in the fund equivalent 
to 11.8% of wages. Contributions for farmers have been 
set at 
3% of earnings and for the otherwise self-employed at 
8%. In 
adddition, supportive voluntary contributions to the fund from 
various other domestic and foreign sources are encouraged. A 
governing board of 22 members has been established to administer 
the fund. Until all of the administrative and organizational 
components are in place and functioning, licenses for temporary 
administration of the insurance program have been granted to 
selected insurance companies as an interim solution. Figures 1.
