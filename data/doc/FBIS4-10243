  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Apr (NA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has addressed a letter to his Argentine colleague, 
Carlos Menem, in which he expresses interest in Menem's proposal 
to create a UN corps of "white helmets." 
  Yeltsin also invited Menem to meet with him to evaluate the 
viability of the proposal. 
  This was revealed today by the Argentine chief of state 
himself, who indicated that he had received the Russian leader's 
letter on 7 March. 
  In remarks to a radio station Menem today explained that his 
proposal "is in keeping with the Church's social doctrine," and 
indicated that "I am trying to find answers as quickly as 
possible to the tremendous problems that are produced by the 
huge numbers of very poor people existing in the world." 
  "I received a letter from President Yeltsin on 7 April in 
which he expresses interest in the topic, and he has invited me 
to a summit between Argentina and Russia to exchange opinions on 
the matter," he revealed. 
  Menem said that "poverty has made impressive advances during 
the past few years, but in addition to poverty characterized by 
a lack of sustenance, we are mostly concerned with the poverty 
of scarce knowledge."
