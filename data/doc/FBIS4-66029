  Text] Reports that the Malaysian Government was set to end 
its ban on public contracts for British businesses were welcomed 
by the Foreign Office today. "We shall be delighted if these 
reports prove to be true," a spokesman said. 
  This followed a reported meeting between Richard Needham, 
the 
British Trade Minister, with his counterpart Rafidah Aziz in 
Kuala Lumpur. Mr Aziz was quoted as saying: "I am confident 
that it will be lifted, but as for the timing, we cannot say." 
  The row blew up after the Sunday Times printed a story in 
February claiming a British construction company was prepared to 
offer Malaysian Premier Mohamad Mahathir a 35,000 pounds 
sterling bribe to secure a building contract. 
  This was fiercely denied by Mr Mahathir at a time when a 
controversy was raging over 234 million pounds sterling British 
aid for the Pergau dam, and claims that this was, wrongly, 
linked to Britain's hopes of securing a 1 billion pounds 
sterling arms deal with Malaysia. 
  Downing Street today denied a report that Mr Needham had 
handed Mr Mahathir a letter from Prime Minister John Major. 
"There was no such letter," a spokesman for No. 10 [Downing 
St.] said, "although Mr Major's office and the Malaysian Prime 
Minister's office have kept in close touch." 
  Mr Needham is expected back in Britain some time tomorrow. 
  Malaysia imposed its damaging ban some three months ago 
after 
British newspaper reports that trade between the two countries 
was tainted by corruption. However, there were promising signs 
over the weekend when Mr Mahathir said that British media 
reporting on Malaysia had "improved". 
  "We are encouraged to see these reports coming out of 
Malaysia," the Foreign Office spokesman added. 
  There is no doubt that British business has been hit hard by 
this ban. The British Government has always said that it has no 
control over what appears in British newspapers.
