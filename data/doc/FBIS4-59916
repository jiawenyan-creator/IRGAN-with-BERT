  [Text] Detained extremists who have declared their 
repentance and given up their extremist ideas were released 
today. Thirty-eight members of various extremist groups were 
released. This move came after Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi's decision to implement the Interior Ministry's policy 
of releasing those detainees who have declare their repentance 
and recanted their ideas. After leaving the prison of Mazra'at 
Tura today, those released affirmed to correspondents of 
international news agencies and newspapers their rejection of 
extremist ideas. They condemned recent terrorist operations and 
all extremist ideas. They added that having declared their 
repentance, they will now campaign for condemnation of extremist 
ideas. They will warn the youth not to join any group, and tell 
them to adhere to the teachings of the true religion. 
  A security source also stated that during the coming days, 
another batch of repentant extremists will be released.
