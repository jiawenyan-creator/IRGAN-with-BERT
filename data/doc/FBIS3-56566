  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze says the 
process of resolving the conflict in Abkhazia can be fastened if 
the United Nations succeeds in implementing its policy at 
regional peace in full. He was commenting on the outcome of 
last week's talks in Geneva between Georgia and Abkhazia. 
  He spoke of negotiations being at a stage leading to peace 
calling for firm guarantees that what had been achieved was not 
wasted. Shevardnadze also called to speed up the sending of 
U.N. peacekeepers and observers to the region to become 
guarantors of security for tens of thousands of Georgian 
refugees returning to their homes in Abkhazia. 
  Shevardnadze pointed to the positive role that Russia had 
played in resolving the conflict.
