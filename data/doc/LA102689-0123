NUCLEAR MISSILE REPORTED IN WORKS 
Israel has secretly joined a partnership to produce a nuclear-tipped missile 
for South Africa, NBC News reported. The partnership reportedly has enabled 
Israel to gain access to a long-range missile site near Overberg, South Africa, 
and to acquire uranium for nuclear warheads. In exchange, Israel reportedly has 
shared missile technology with South Africa that will enable it to become a 
nuclear power.
