FT  14 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Genscher warns Japan on Uruguay Round
MR Hans-Dietrich Genscher (right), the German foreign minister, warned
during talks in Japan yesterday that the two countries have a special
responsibility to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round of multilateral
trade negotiations, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo.
In an apparent hint to Japanese leaders that they should open the rice
market, Mr Genscher said that Japan and Germany have a competitive edge in
industrial exports, but that international markets for those products would
be threatened by protectionism if the Uruguay Round collapses over the
agriculture issue. Tokyo indicated this week that it may not put rice on a
list of food items and suggested tariffs due to be submitted by March 1
under a proposal to replace existing trade barriers with a tariff regime. Mr
Genscher, ending a three-day visit, said the Uruguay Round 'must not be
permitted to fail'.
