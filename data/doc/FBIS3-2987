  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (AFP) -- China said Wednesday it 
was "disappointed" with the results of the recent visit by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher that focused on a row over 
renewal of Beijing's MFN status. 
  "I am also somewhat disappointed," Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen told journalists, referring to comments Monday by U.S. 
President Clinton expressing disappointment in the results of 
the four-day visit, which ended Monday. "My talks with 
Christopher have not produced as many results as previously 
expected," said Qian without elaborating. 
  However, the foreign minister once again appeared to put the 
blame for the failure of the talks on a meeting just ahead of 
Christopher's arrival between U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
for Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck and China's most famous 
dissident Wei Jingsheng. "We thought that the two sides would 
be able to reach agreements to further develop bilateral 
relations, but before the visit some things occurred and we were 
disappointed," Qian said. 
  Despite China's disappointment, Qian said the two sides were 
"making efforts to avoid the deterioration of relations." 
Clinton has made June's renewal of China's most-favoured-nation 
(MFN) trade status conditional on significant progress in 
improving human rights. While Qian was unable to say whether he 
would meet again with Christopher before June, he added that "we 
continue to maintain contacts." "I don't think that the 
differences on the concept of human rights have been reduced, 
but we have reduced differences on specific matters" during 
Christopher' visit, he said.
