FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Correction
Yesterday's review of Venus Observed wrongly attributed the parts of
Perpetua and Rosabel to Heather Stannard and Valerie Taylor. It was they who
played in the original production. At Chichester the parts are played by
Susannah Harker and Kate O'Mara. I apologise for the error. The compliments
stand. MR.
