  [Text] Belgrade, 8 Feb (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb assembly 
speaker Momcilo Krajisnik has said that the republic of Srpska 
cannot accept the plan on the cantonization of Bosnia that was 
initiated afresh by the Muslim government in Sarajevo last night. 
  "The extremist Muslim leadership must understand that Bosnia 
has been divided and that it would take a great war to reunify 
the disunited Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik told Politika TV 
this evening. 
  He added that the cochairmen of the conference on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have been clearly told that the Serb side 
will accept only "the results already achieved at the 
conference." This means, Krajisnik said, acknowledging the fact 
that "there already are three states in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and a revival of a quasi-state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be advocated." 
  Krajisnik said that "this means that in no way can we accept 
the plan, for that would mean returning to the Vance-Owen, which 
was flatly rejected by our assembly." 
  Speaking on the demilitarization of Sarajevo, Krajisnik said 
he is convinced "solutions can be found which would satisfy Serb 
interests." "In that case we would not have anything against 
the demilitarization of Sarajevo and the establishment of a UN 
protectorate," Krajisnik said.
