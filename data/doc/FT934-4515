FT  03 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cutting the price of
videoconferencing
The advantages of videoconferencing as a replacement for international
travel have long been recognised, but the cost of buying equipment has often
deterred the smaller company.
Nuts Technologies, of Hong Kong, has now developed a desk-top
videoconferencing system based on an Apple Macintosh for Pounds 3,499.
The video image is displayed in a small window on the screen while the rest
of the screen can display high-quality graphics. The two callers can discuss
the displayed graphics and alter them if required. The caller at the other
end would be able to see the updated graphics immediately.
The Connect 918 can send the data along the latest ISDN digital telephone
lines, around a local area network or even over an ordinary telephone line
using a modem. Nuts Technologies: Hong Kong: 881 6360.
