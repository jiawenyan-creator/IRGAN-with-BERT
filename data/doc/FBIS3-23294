  [Text] Exchanges of gunfire are currently taking place in 
south Lebanon between terrorists, the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces], and the SLA [South Lebanese Army] after the terrorists 
killed three SLA soldiers this morning, kidnapped two, and 
killed the wife of another soldier in several separate raids.

announced that it is holding the two captured SLA soldiers.
