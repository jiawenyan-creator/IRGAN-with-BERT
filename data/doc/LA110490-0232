LISTEN AND COMPARE 
I regret that The Times staff writer Mayerene Barker did not interview me 
before writing her profile on the 21st Congressional District race. If she had, 
I could have prevented her from making some totally erroneous assumptions 
concerning my campaign. 
I am not at all "complacent" about my reelection campaign -- I am well aware 
that the voters of my district have the final say in who will represent them. 
The reason I have been unable to mount an aggressive campaign is that until the 
current budget debate and other important legislative business is resolved, my 
primary responsibility is to remain in Washington to represent my constituents. 
My job requires me to vote against plans to raise taxes on working Americans 
and senior citizens, to vote for tough anti-crime legislation and to vote for 
funding for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and for the 
important Calleguas Creek flood control project. 
Had I missed those votes, there's no question in my mind that my opponent -- 
and some in the press -- would have been charging me with neglecting my 
responsibilities. 
ELTON GALLEGLY, Simi Valley. Gallegly is the congressional representative for 
the 21st District.
