  [Text] Fuzhou, February 22 (XINHUA) -- South-east China's 
Fujian Province plans this year to lease out the rights to use 
300 hectares of land valued at 4 billion yuan (459 million U.S. 
dollars). 
  One of China's provinces piloting in the reform of the land 
use system, Fujian leased out the rights to use 450 plots of 
land with a combined area of more than 600 hectares, which were 
valued at 5.5 billion yuan (632 million U.S. dollars). 
  According to Ye Wenjian, director of the provincial land 
administration, the prices for land-leasing are becoming more 
and more scientific and rational; and the transactions of 
land-use rights are being undertaken according to law. 
  Ye noted that Fujian will adopt a series of measures to 
standardize the land property market this year. 
  The province will form a fair market competition mechanism 
to 
change the conventional government allocation of land to the 
paid transfer of land-use rights through bidding and auction.
