BUSH, QUAYLE HAVE AGREED ON DETAILS FOR A SUCCESSION 
President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle reached an agreement at a private 
meeting earlier this month on conditions under which the vice president would 
become acting President if Bush became incapacitated, White House Press 
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Friday. 
Fitzwater said Bush was in "excellent health," and "there is no expectation of 
having to use these procedures." But he said the issue of succession was raised 
"to make sure all those involved in this process are aware of the procedures, 
and that everyone was aware of the consultations that would have to be made." 
He said the President and vice president were joined by First Lady Barbara 
Bush, White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, White House counsel C. Boyden 
Gray and Burton Lee II, the President's physician. A representative of the 
Secret Service and Susan Porter Rose, Mrs. Bush's chief of staff, also 
attended, Fitzwater said. 
The 30-minute meeting, which was kept off Bush's public schedule, was held on 
April 18, he said. The existence of the meeting was disclosed in a Washington 
Post story Friday. 
The procedure for determining when a vice president should step in for an 
incapacitated President is addressed in the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which was ratified in 1967. But there has been concern about gray areas, 
illustrated by Woodrow Wilson's continued service after he was incapacitated by 
a stroke in the final year of his presidency, and the confusion that enveloped 
the White House immediately after President Ronald Reagan was shot eight years 
ago. 
Fitzwater said the meeting resulted in "no document, no guidelines, no 
implementation orders of any kind," and that no special agreement was reached 
between the President and vice president. Rather, Bush, Quayle and the others 
reviewed the procedures that would be followed -- "who had to do what" -- 
should Bush become incapacitated and unable to instruct Quayle to take over as 
acting President. 
The 25th Amendment specifies that in such circumstances, the vice president and 
a majority of the Cabinet would declare in writing that the President is unable 
to carry out his duties, and the vice president would become acting President.
