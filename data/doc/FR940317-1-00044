SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 17, 1992, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule (57 FR 27094) amending regulations
pertaining to the humane and healthful transport of wild mammals and birds to the United States. That rule became effective
September 15, 1992. That rule, 50 CFR part 14 subpart J, incorporates by reference the 18th edition of the Live Animal
Regulations (LAR) of the International Air Transport Association, such that all primary enclosures used to transport
live wild mammals or birds to the United States are required to comply with the Container Requirements of the 18th LAR.
Since the publication of the final rule, IATA has published the 20th edition of the LAR, effective October 1, 1993.
The 20th LAR contains no major substantive differences from the 18th LAR, but does clarify some of the Container Requirements.
When the public orders the LAR from IATA, they can only obtain the 20th edition. If the public complies with the 20th
LAR, they will satisfy all of the requirements of the final rule for the Humane and Healthful Transport of Wild Mammals
and Birds (50 CFR part 14). This proposal to incorporate by reference the 20th edition of the LAR is therefore for the
convenience of the public and in order to facilitate consistency and enforceability.
