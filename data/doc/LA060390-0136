THE MATURE TRAVELER: AIRLINE OFFERS A PRICE BREAK ON MEXICO FLIGHTS 
Mexicana Airlines is offering a 1O% discount for mature travelers, both for 
travel from the United States to Mexico and for domestic travel within Mexico. 
Some restrictions do apply, however. 
On international travel, for example, the 1O% discount applies to anyone over 
age 62 flying into Mexico, but will not be valid over the Christmas and New 
Year holiday period, Dec. 15 to Jan. 10. The discount can also apply to one 
traveling companion of any age. 
For domestic travel within Mexico, the minimum age is also 62, and a travel 
companion of any age can also be included. Reservations may be confirmed in 
advance, except for July and August and between Dec. 15 and Jan. 10. 
During those periods, passengers may obtain space on standby and the discount 
will apply. Proof of age will be required in advance. 
For Mexicana Airlines information and reservations in Los Angeles, call (213) 
646-9500. From other areas, call (800) 531-7921. Or contact any travel agent.

The Swiss National Tourist Office is offering a free booklet entitled "Season 
for Seniors," published by the Swiss Hotel Assn. The brochure lists off-season 
special prices for seniors in Swiss hotels as well as many year-round 
reductions. 
Most major Swiss cities offer several choices of inns or hotels with senior 
discounts, while almost every town or village lists at least one. Prices, which 
are quoted in Swiss francs, include room, breakfast, service charges and taxes, 
and where applicable, heating. 
The booklet lists rates for both single and double rooms, with and without bath 
or shower, extra costs for full or half board, and the time periods when the 
senior discounts apply. Minimum age limit for men is 65 and for women 62. 
However, in the case of couples, only one person need meet the age requirement. 
Tourist office spokesmen say that in addition to the "Season for Seniors" 
booklet, they will also send brochures on the Swiss Boat Pass, special events 
in Switzerland 1990, and a booklet on Swiss towns. 
To obtain this material, write to the Swiss National Tourist Office, 222 N. 
Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 1570, El Segundo 90245, or call (213) 335-5980.
