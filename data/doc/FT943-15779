FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: BZ Bank down 70% at halfway
BZ Bank, the Zurich securities house controlled by Mr Martin Ebner, has
reported a 70 per cent slide in net income to SFr15.1m (Dollars 11m) for the
first half of 1994.
The decline was due mainly to write-downs on the value of securities,
reflecting the 7.4 per cent decline in the Swiss market during the period.
Write-offs and provisions jumped from SFr29.5m to SFr90.5m.
However, commission income doubled to SFr112.9m, indicating the bank's
ability to generate trading activity even in what it described as a 'rough
environment'.
Mr Ebner said trading activity had remained strong throughout the first half
until late June. The bank also gained commission income from substantial
new-issue activity and from a fast growing custody service.
At the end of June, it held SFr29bn worth of securities in custody, compared
with only SFr10bn at the end of 1992, he said.
Interest income at SFr13.1m exceeded interest charges of SFr10.9m for the
first time, reflecting the growth of short-term lending to clients for their
securities purchases.
Mr Ebner was optimistic about the second half, anticipating a recovery in
Swiss equity markets.
