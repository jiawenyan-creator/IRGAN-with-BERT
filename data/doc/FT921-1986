FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rosehaugh banks extend loans
Rosehaugh, the property company with borrowings of Pounds 310m, yesterday
announced that its 26 banks had extended their loans until January 1994.
The debt restructuring followed the breach of its banking covenants at the
end of last year. The standstill agreement reached by the banks had to be
extended at the end of January.
The refinancing package has consolidated the existing facilities into one
master facility, to which Barclays Bank will be agent.
The company said it believed that the agreement represented a satisfactory
conclusion to the talks which began in late 1991.
Rosehaugh's shares rose from 6 3/4 p to 9 1/2 p after the announcement. The
share price of Stanhope, which has a joint venture with Rosehaugh rose from
24p to 27p. Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments, the joint venture, was not part
of the refinancing agreement.
Last December, Rosehaugh announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 227m for the
year to June 30.
