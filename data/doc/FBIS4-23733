  [Excerpts] Harare June 10 SAPA -- The Zimbabwean Government 
has confiscated 17 commercial farms in terms of its 
controversial land acquisition act to redistribute land to black 
peasants. No arrangements for compensating the owners has been 
made, officials of the Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU) said on 
Friday [10 June]. They said government officials had since 
mid-May been posting or hand- delivering letters to farmers 
stating: "The president has acquired this land." The farms 
became the property of the state on March 16 and the owners were 
given three months to leave. "In other words, the owners have 
been farming on property not belonging to them for three 
months," CFU Director David Hasluck said. [passage omitted] 
  A few of the 17 farmers have had government valuers on their 
properties, but the government committee dealing with 
compensation had not yet convened, CFU officials said.
