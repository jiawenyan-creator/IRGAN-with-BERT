ACTION:

 Notice of intent to amend Source Material License SUA56 to modify the erosion protection design of the plan
for reclamation of the Split Rock Mill disposal area which is located in Fremont County, Wyoming, and Notice of Opportunity
to request a hearing.





1. Proposed Action



By letters dated October 29, 1993, and February 7, 1994, Western Nuclear Incorporated (WNI), holder of Source Material
License SUA56 for the Split Rock Mill in Wyoming, requested an amendment to revise the approved reclamation
plan for the Split Rock Mill disposal area. Proposed revisions included a new radon attenuation barrier design and
minor changes to the flood protection design.



2. Reason for Request to Amend License



WNI proposes to revise the design of the radon attenuation barrier by using clay soil from an offsite source instead
of the onsite soil previously proposed. In addition, the alignment of the diversion ditches is being altered slightly
based on actual field surveys.

The proposed revisions will not significantly change the approved reclamation plan. The tailing will still be reclaimed
in place by covering them with a clay layer protected by a layer of rock. Runoff originating in areas adjacent to the
tailings will still be diverted around the pile as was originally proposed. The only notable change in the proposal
is that the clay to be used for the radon attenuation barrier will be obtained from an offsite source instead of the onsite
borrow areas originally proposed. An environmental assessment of this action is not required as the Bureau of Land
Management has already issued a ``Decision of Record and Finding of No Significant Impact'' for the soil borrow area.
The date of that decision was September 29, 1993. In conjunction, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality
issued Small Mining Permit No. 694 on December 13, 1993, for this action.

Paragraph (c)(11) of 10 CFR 51.22, categorically excludes the requirement for an environmental assessment for this
licensing action. That paragraph states that the categorical exclusion applies to the issuance of amendments to
licenses for uranium mills provided that : (1) There is no significant change in the types or significant increase
in the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite, (2) there is no significant increase in individual or
cumulative occupational radiation exposure, (3) there is no significant construction impact, and (4) there is no
significant increase in the potential for or consequences from radiological accidents.

The licensing action meets these criteria as the proposed amendment involves only minor changes in the erosion protection
and radon attenuation barrier designs and in the source of soil borrow. An environmental report is not required from
the licensee since the amendment does not meet the criteria of 10 CFR 51.60(b)(2).



3. Notice of Opportunity to Request Hearing



In accordance with title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, part 2 (10 CFR 2), paragraph 2.1205(c)(1), interested parties
are hereby notified that they may request a hearing pursuant to the procedures set forth in 10 CFR 2.1205 within thirty
( 3) days of the publication of this notice.




Signed in Denver, Colorado this 8th day of March 1994.
