  [Text] The minister of safety and security, Mr. Sydney 
Mufamadi, and his deputy, Mr. Joe Matthews, say stability in the 
country is among their priorities as social development will 
depend on personal security and law and order to attract foreign 
investment. The two men were addressing a news conference in 
Pretoria after talks with the commissioner of Police, General 
Johan van der Merwe. Mr. Mufamadi and Mr. Matthews are to hold 
talks later this week with all police generals and former 
homeland police commanders.
