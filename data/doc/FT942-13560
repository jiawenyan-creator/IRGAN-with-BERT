FT  25 APR 94 / Threat of power cuts hangs over Poles
Poland faces the prospect of widespread power cuts today as a result of
strikes by miners in four opencast lignite mines, affecting one-third of the
country's generating capacity.
The strike, which started last Thursday, comes amid a national campaign by
the Solidarity trade union to have state sector wage controls replaced with
a system of collective bargaining. The union also wants assurances from the
government over policies designed to boost real wages this year to reverse
the income falls of the past four years.
The challenge to the left-of-centre government follows last week's agreement
between the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), a senior coalition partner, and
President Lech Walesa to work together to find a candidate for the vacant
post of finance minister. Mr Walesa had vetoed Mr Dariusz Rosati, the SLD's
candidate, while the coalition responded by moving to limit the president's
veto powers in a threat which has since been dropped.
The 36,000 workers at the four mines which supply lignite directly to the
power stations at Belchatow, Konin, Adamow and Turow are demanding that the
government drop restructuring plans which could lead to 30 per cent job cuts
in the industry.
At the weekend Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, sacked Mr Eugeniusz
Morawski, the deputy minister responsible for mining and the power sector
and the government pledged to suspend the restructuring plans. However,
Solidarity's national leadership which saw patchy support for the first
phase of its national protest campaign, has decided to use the miners'
action to step up pressure on the government.
The strike comes as parliament passed a new wage control law on Friday which
Solidarity has bitterly opposed.
The Democratic Union (UD) led by former prime minister Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki
and the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD), a free market grouping, merged to
form the Freedom Union, a pro-market reform party.
