  [Excerpts] Jagodina, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, stated today that he supports the idea of 
holding a U.S.-Russia-EU [European Union] summit on the Bosnian 
crisis. "As far as we are concerned, the summit can be held 
immediately, but I doubt that the Muslims' protectors wish the 
same," Krajisnik told Jagodina radio. The republic of Srpska 
assembly speaker said the new U.S. plan for Bosnia as presented 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton last night, if implemented, would 
mean "a catastrophe not only for this region, but also for the 
whole of Europe." Krajisnik said he hopes the international 
community will display enough wisdom and political 
resourcefulness, and will not allow these threats to 
materialize. [passage omitted] 
  According to Krajisnik, by his statement Clinton has 
announced a total war and a crisis that would certainly spill 
over the borders of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.
