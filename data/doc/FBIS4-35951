  [Text] The vice president of the Presidential Council, 
brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, made a telephone call this 
evening to brother Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's 
envoy to Yemen. He explained to him the developments of the 
situation and the persistence of Sanaa's regime to reject 
commitment to international legitimacy, its indiscriminate 
shelling of peaceful citizens and the Aden oil refinery, and its 
barbaric acts against civilians which proved (?beyond a doubt) 
that Sanaa's regime did not seek unity, as it claimed, but 
sought occupation and control of the land of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen after destroying its villages, towns, and 
vital installations. 
  In his conversation with Brahimi, brother al-Jifri urged 
the United Nations to shoulder its responsibility and pressure 
the aggressor to comply with the international legitimacy. 
  He made clear that our Army and people will continue 
defending their destiny, land, and honor [words indistinct] 
regardless of the might of the aggressor. 
  On his part, brother Brahimi, the figure internationally 
well- known for his struggle, affirmed that he would made 
contacts and efforts to put an end to this unjust aggression and 
to implement the UN Security Council Resolution No. 924. He 
expressed eagerness for Yemen's sons and their destiny. 
  Meanwhile, brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'al-Jifri, vice president 
of the Presidential Council, affirmed to Yemeni and the Arab 
people [words indistinct] that we would struggle and resist 
[words indistinct] till we achieve [words indistinct].
