FT  16 FEB 93 / Observer: Inflated price
Meanwhile, news that the Bank of England's brand new inflation report will
be on sale at all 'good' bookshops from 5.30 tonight raises some interesting
possibilities. Presumably, someone at the Bank has done a little bit of
retail price maintenance research to make sure that if the Pounds 4 tome
does get transferred to the remaindered pile, its price is not quickly
devalued. What chance of Norman Lamont signing a few celebrity copies?
