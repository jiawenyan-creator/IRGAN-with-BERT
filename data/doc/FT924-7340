FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet's drinks side takes 30% of
Gonzalez Byass
INTERNATIONAL Distillers &amp; Vintners, the drinks arm of Grand Metropolitan,
is to take a 30 per cent stake in Gonzalez Byass, the Spanish sherry and
brandy company.
It is understood the stake will cost about Pounds 40m, valuing Gonzalez at
more than Pounds 120m.
The deal gives IDV access to some of Spain's best known brands, including
Tio Pepe sherry. Gonzalez's fino sherry business also ties with IDV's Croft
Original pale cream sherry. 'There is almost a perfect fit,' according to Mr
Edwin Beckett, director of IDV corporate affairs.
Under the agreement, which is due to be completed later this month, IDV will
use its international distribution network to gradually start distributing
Gonzalez's main brands in markets outside Spain. Gonzalez will take over the
Spanish distribution of Cinzano, the Italian vermouth and wines company
where IDV took full control in January.
The distribution agreement does not include Japan and Switzerland, where
Gonzalez will retain its existing distributors. IDV is also unlikely to
assume UK distribution in the 'immediate' future.
Links between the two companies go back to earlier this century when two
members of the Gilbey family, former owner of IDV's Gilbey's gin, married
members of the Gonzalez family.
Gonzalez reported sales of Pta20bn (Pounds 116m) last year. Annual sales of
Soberano and Tio Pepe total 1.6m and 650,000 cases respectively.
Mr Beckett said Gonzalez wanted IDV to help build its brands into
international names. IDV would consider lifting its stake in Gonzalez if the
partnership worked.
IDV will appoint two directors to Gonzalez's board while Mr Carlos Gonzalez,
chairman, will join the board of IDV Europe.
