TIME TO WAKE UP 
Mary Kay Blakely went into a coma, and that entitles her to make sweeping 
generalizations about the plight of women in America? Wait, I forgot -- she's 
involved in the women's movement. Well, those are certainly credentials enough 
for me. ("To the Edge and Back" by Elizabeth Mehren, July 31). 
Could you please try to feature people who can talk about something else 
besides themselves (or their gender, their group, their life style) and how 
hard their life is?
