FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Sagging Dow mirrors lower
trend in bonds
Wall Street
US stocks finished with moderate losses as share prices mirrored a downward
drift by bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 19.00 lower at 3,674.26
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.78 at 447.10.
The American SE composite eased 0.55 to 441.21, while the Nasdaq composite
showed a 6.46 decline to 748.71.
The relative calm which prevailed since mid-week carried over into yesterday
morning. The Dow industrials strayed only a few points of their opening
values in thin morning activity, despite weakness in the bond market.
But as the session wore on, the benchmark 30-year government bond steadily
extended its early losses. Sell programs were triggered which dragged the
blue chips to 35 points down within a half hour.
A contributing factor was remarks by two Federal Reserve governors, who
suggested that pressures in the labor market and in production capacity
could soon trigger higher inflation.
Late in the session, the Dow recovered some lost ground, and the midday
volatility proved fleeting.
A trio of cyclical stocks helped limit the damage to the blue chip index. 3M
was Dollars 2 3/8 better at Dollars 102 1/4 , Goodyear added Dollars 1 at
Dollars 41 5/8 and DuPont jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 .
On the losing side, Caterpillar slumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 117 1/8 ,
Alcoa dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 1/4 and Philip Morris lost Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 49 1/8 .
General Motors, off Dollars 2 3/8 &gt; to Dollars 57 5/8 , led the motor
vehicle makers in retreat. Ford dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 58 3/8 and
Chrysler plunged Dollars 3 to Dollars 50 7/8 , hurt by disclosure of a third
problem in its new Neon model.
Tandy, up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 34 1/8 , retraced some of its heavy
losses from the previous day, when the electronics retailer said
first-quarter earnings would come in at the low end of estimates.
Canada
Toronto closed mixed in light trading, turning downward in the afternoon as
the Canadian dollar lost ground. The TSE-300 composite index fell 11.66
points, or 0.27 per cent, to close at 4,327.41, but advancing issues
outnumbered declines 429 to 353.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo retreated from earlier highs to end up 4.24 per cent.
The Bovespa index of 54 most-traded stocks ended at 15,374 points, up 625
points on the day. At the Rio de Janeiro exchange prices rose 4.3 per cent
at 62,067 points. Traded volume was of CR242.7bn (Dollars 241.6m). Brokers
said volume dropped during the afternoon session in mostly speculative
trading previous to the index expiration date next week.
