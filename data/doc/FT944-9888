FT  14 NOV 94 / Apec urged to broaden global trade role
The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum should work towards the launch
of a new multilateral round of trade liberalisation negotiations to follow
the Uruguay Round, Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy foreign
minister, said in Jakarta.
His remarks are one early sign that Apec could lead ultimately to the
inauguration of a new round of multilateral trade talks and that some
governments in the region are keen to resist pressure to turn Apec into a
regional trading bloc.
'Then we can have Apec playing a pivotal role in global trade
liberalisation,' Mr Supachai said. His proposal, made informally at the Apec
ministerial meeting, drew support from Malaysia.
But the proposal also reflects the inability of Apec trade and foreign
ministers to agree a definition for regional free trade in the run-up to
tomorrow's summit. Several Asian countries argue that Apec should be
concerned with principles, leaving the actual mechanism for trade
liberalisation to be decided separately.
Mr Supachai said the proposal by Apec's eminent persons group for full trade
liberalisation by 2020 contained 'a lot of hidden suggestions and nuances'
and the possible consequences had not been fully thought through.
Delegates said Apec would almost certainly have to defer until next year any
decision on the tricky but fundamental question of how far Apec was to
develop into a formal free trade area with common barriers to the rest of
the world that could then be dropped in return for reciprocal concessions.
Though the Apec leaders will be left to deal simply with an outline vision
tomorrow, it would take what one official called 'heroic political
decisions' to agree even a broad and non-binding timetable for trade
liberalisation.
