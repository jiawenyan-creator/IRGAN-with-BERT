METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM WILL BE EXPANDED 
An anti-drug education program taught by Los Angeles police officers at public 
schools has been expanded to include 10 private and parochial schools, and by 
next year as many as 70,000 students in the city's non-public schools could 
participate, officials said. 
Mayor Tom Bradley, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and Archbishop Roger M. Mahony 
announced the expansion of the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program at 
Normandie Christian School before an auditorium full of fifth- and 
sixth-graders who have attended DARE classes for nine weeks. 
Officials said they will offer the program next year to every private and 
parochial school in the city with more than 200 students. The new focus is not 
the result of specific drug problems in the schools, they said, but because 
students from all schools face pressures and temptations that can draw them 
into drug abuse. "Drug abuse is simply nonsectarian," Mahony said. 
The city, along with private and corporate backers of the DARE program, will 
pay for the expansion. The cost will be about $250,000 for five additional 
full-time officers needed next year to teach the program in as many as 162 
private schools.
