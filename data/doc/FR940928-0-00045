 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to amend the regulations that govern fishing by vessels of the United States in certain
waters of the Caribbean Sea covered by a treaty between the United States and the Government of Colombia (GOC). This
rule requires that such vessels in treaty waters display their official numbers and that fish and lobster traps used
in treaty waters have degradable panels. The intended effect of this rule is to implement conservation and management
measures agreed to in consultations between the United States and the GOC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Fishing by vessels of the United States in certain waters of the Caribbean Sea is governed under the Treaty Between
the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Colombia Concerning the Status
of Quita Sueno, Roncador and Serrana (treaty). Under the terms of the treaty, vessels of the United States may fish
in the waters of Quita Sueno, Roncador, and Serrana (treaty waters), but are subject to reasonable conservation measures
applied by the GOC, provided that such measures are nondiscriminatory and no more restrictive than those applied
to Colombian or other fishermen. 


NMFS published proposed and final rules on September 18, 1990 (55 FR 38365) and January 4, 1991 (56 FR 377), respectively,
that implemented regulations for treaty waters. Included in the proposed rule were requirements that (1) U.S. vessels
display their official numbers when in treaty waters, and (2) nonwooden fish and lobster traps in treaty waters have
degradable panels. These requirements were not included in the final rule because a necessary exchange of notes between
the United States and the GOC regarding the requirements had not occurred. Such exchange of notes was made at a meeting
of representatives of the two governments on May 1718, 1994, at Cartagena, Colombia. Accordingly, the requirements
are added to the regulations. Rationale for the requirements was included in the proposed rule and is not repeated
here. 
This final rule also corrects the address of the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS (``Regional Director''); and adds
a prohibition on making a false statement to an authorized officer concerning the taking, catching, harvesting,
landing, purchase, sale, possession, or transfer of fish. The added prohibition is necessary for effective enforcement
and conforms the regulations to current standards. 


Changes From the Proposed Rule 


Minor language changes are made to clarify the regulations and conform them to current standards. 


Classification 


This rule is necessary to implement agreements between the United States and the GOC. Because it pertains to a foreign
affairs function of the United States, it is exempt from the provisions of E.O. 12866, and from the requirement to provide
notice and an opportunity for public comment pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).
