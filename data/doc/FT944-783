FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Axa unit divests Banque d'Orsay
to German bank
Groupe Axa, the French insurance group, said its Cie Financiere de Paris
unit was selling Banque d'Orsay to Westdeutsche Landesbank for about FFr450m
(Dollars 83m), agencies report.
Axa said the divestiture, which must be approved by French banking
authorities, was in line with its policy of selling off non-core assets.
Banque d'Orsay was formed in 1990 from the merger of Deltabanque and MR
Finance, a unit of the Meeschaert Rousselle brokerage. It specialises in
arbitrage in the equity and bond markets and manages investment portfolios
totalling nearly FFr10bn. It reported a net profit of FFr60.5m in 1993.
