  [Text] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs, has stated that following the ugly Israeli massacre in 
the holy Ibrahimi Mosque during Friday's dawn prayers, the Arab 
parties participating in the current bilateral negotiations in 
Washington held intensive contacts with one another and with the 
heads of their delegations to the negotiations and decided not 
to attend the remaining meetings in these negotiations. 
  A senior PLO official said today that the peace talks with 
Israel have been suspended and no decision to resume them in 
Washington or elsewhere has been made. PLO Executive Committee 
member Samir Ghawshah said after a Palestinian leadership 
meeting last night that the Palestinian side has recalled all 
its negotiating teams. He added that, in his opinion, the talks 
have been suspended. 
  Another PLO official today said the PLO decided to send a 
special envoy to Washington within 24 hours for talks with the 
American officials on the terms for resuming the peace talks 
with Israel. He said the PLO agreed in principle to resume 
talks, but this does not mean they will be held next week.
