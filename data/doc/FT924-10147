FT  02 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Spanish airport expansion
A project management contract has been awarded to the P&amp;O Group company
BOVIS INTERNACIONAL DE ESPANA for a Pounds 100m extension programme at
Spain's Palma de Mallorca Airport.
The 36-month first phase includes the construction of a 200,000 sq metre
terminal building, 40,000 sq metres of aircraft concourse and boarding
gates, together with associated car parking, access routes and landscaping.
Palma de Mallorca is Spain's second busiest airport and the expansion
programme is needed to cope with the rapid increase in both international
and domestic traffic anticipated over the next decade and beyond.
Engineered by the Spanish company Initec, the new terminal building will be
six storeys high. The ground floor will accommodate the arrivals hall,
arrivals concourse and baggage handling areas, together with parking for 154
coaches, 56 micro buses, taxis and private cars.
Level 2 is intended primarily for services and baggage handling. The
departures concourse is to be located on level 3, together with the check-in
area. At this level there will also be parking for 40 coaches, as well as
parking for taxis and private cars.
The departures lounge and restaurant facilities will be located on level 4,
together with extensive retail and duty free shops. Levels 5 and 6 will be
used for office accommodation and services.
The boarding gates and two existing terminal buildings will be reached from
the new terminal by way of high level access 'fingers'.
