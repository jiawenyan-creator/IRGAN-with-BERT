  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 12 Mar (DPA) -- Colombian 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff today confirmed the 
surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola, a leader of the Cali cocaine 
cartel, in Palmira, a city in western Colombia. 
  Prosecutor General De Greiff told the privately owned 
"Caracol" radio station in Santa Fe de Bogota that 27-year-old 
Urdinola is charged with drug trafficking, illegal enrichment, 
and conspiracy. 
  De Greiff said Urdinola was accompanied by one person, not 
two as was reported earlier. The prosecutor general said he did 
not know who Urdinola's companion was. 
  The prosecutor general added that Urdinola's lawyer said 
that 
the mafioso will confess to his crimes. De Greiff did not say 
where Urdinola is being held, but it is believed that he is at 
the Palmira maximum security prison. 
  The prosecutor general said he has no information regarding 
the imminent surrender of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, alleged 
head of the Cali cartel, whose lawyers have been discussing his 
surrender with judicial authorities.
