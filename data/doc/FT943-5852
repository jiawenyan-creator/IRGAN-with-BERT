FT  01 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris volatile after rises in
lending rates
Bourses took little interest in today's Bundesbank meeting, with 19 of 20
European economists telling Reuter that there would be no change in German
key interest rates today, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was volatile, the CAC 40 index hitting an early low of 2,038.44 after
Wednesday's post-bourse rises in French banks' base lending rates; in the
end, the key index managed to shrug off a drop in bond futures and closed
8.71 to the good at 2,069.08.
Turnover rose from FFr1.96bn to FFr3.5bn. Alcatel, already depressed by
recurring allegations of over-billing, fell FFr6 to FFr599 on an item in the
Canard Enchaine weekly which covered similar ground. Once again, the company
denied the allegations.
AGF, the insurance company, produced lower first-half profits as expected
and, again as predicted, forecast higher profits for the year. The shares
fell FFr2.20 to FFr228.10. But some financials benefited from the rise in
bank base rates, Societe Generale putting on FFr7 at FFr582 and BNP FFr3.40
at FFr250.50.
FRANKFURT saw corporate influences in the morning, and derivatives pressure
in the afternoon as the Dax rose 2.00 to 2,212.85 on the session, and
subsided to 2,207.09 at the post-bourse close. Turnover rose from DM7.6bn to
DM8.3bn.
On the session, a DM9.70 rise to DM837.50 in Daimler, which reported
US-style net profits of DM369m for the first half against a comparable loss
of DM949m, was offset by general weakness in the automotive sector and, in
particular, a DM6.50 fall to DM498.50 at Volkswagen.
Rumours of a VW rights issue were denied by the company but a fall of DM6.50
to DM498.50 on the session was extended after hours, leaving the stock at
DM493.20. Brokers said a fall in the Dax future brought share prices down in
the afternoon.
ZURICH saw further strong demand for banking and insurance stocks lift the
SMI index 9.9 to 2,645.6, and above the 2,640 resistance level.
Among the recently underperforming banks, UBS bearers rose SFr7 to SFr1,174
and CS Holding by SFr8 to SFr552. SBC gained SFr1 at SFr380 on its plan to
buy Brinson, a US asset manager, for the equivalent of Dollars 750m, which
will be paid over seven years, and some of it in SBC shares.
Ciba bearers dropped SFr18, or 2.2 per cent, to SFr808 in response to its
flat first-half results, which were hit by turbulent financial markets
earlier in the year and the strength of the franc.
Roche certificates picked up SFr130 to SFr6,100, with US and British
investors said to be switching from Ciba. Sandoz, which reports interim
figures today, saw its bearers advance SFr8 to SFr730.
MILAN's early attempts at a rally ran out of steam as a 5 per cent fall in
Olivetti soured the mood. The Comit index finished 1.71 higher at 690.53 in
very thin trade.
Olivetti fell L112 to L2,123 and its industrial holding company, Cir,
finished L82, or 3.6 per cent, down at L2,219.
Mr Andrew Haskins at James Capel noted that the fall came after some weeks
of volatility in the Olivetti price.
He said three factors had weighed on the shares. Most relevant were worries
about possible provisioning against currency losses and losses on bond
holdings.
The sale by DEC, of the US, of its 8 per cent stake had also prompted some
concern, and there
was also the spectre of a renewed round of price-cutting in the pc markets;
but Mr Haskins noted that Olivetti's market share had already grown and
lower prices were likely to lead to a larger global market.
AMSTERDAM was depressed by an unexpected downturn in first-half net profits
at Bolswessanen, the drinks group.
The AEX index fell 1.56 to 419.44 as Bolswessanen dropped Fl 4.10, or 10 per
cent, to Fl 36.90. The group announced an 8 per cent decline in net profits,
compared with expectations of a rise, and analysts downgraded full-year
forecasts.
Among publishers continuing to benefit from a switch to defensive stocks,
Wolters Kluwer rose a further 80 cents to Fl 122.10, and VNU was 90 cents
higher at Fl 186.40 ahead of its six-month figures which came after the
market closed. In the event, the group's 32 per cent profits rise proved to
be at the lower end of expectations.
MADRID stayed in the doldrums, turnover falling from Pta15.7bn to Pta13.3bn
as the general index closed 1.16 lower at 312.02. Brokers blamed the weaker
dollar and losses in the debt markets as a result of higher French rates.
Fans of Acerinox, the stainless steels producer, were consoled by a 58 per
cent rise in profits and a share price Pta280 higher at Pta15,530.
ISTANBUL lost nearly 4 per cent, the composite index ending 1,039.12 off at
25,282.43, with many investors sidelined by money market fluctuations.
WARSAW fell 4.4 per cent in light volume, with buying discouraged by
negative technical signals, the Wig index closing 517.4 down at 11,181.4 as
turnover dropped by 20 per cent to 622.0bn zlotys.
