  [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis returned 
from Washington at 1300 today. His visit to the U.S. capital is 
described as particularly successful. During his contacts with 
the U.S. Departments of State and Defense, he had the 
opportunity to refer extensively to the Greek positions on our 
national issues, especially on the situation in our greater area.
