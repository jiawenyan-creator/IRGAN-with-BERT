FT  22 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK generators
PowerGen has firmly established itself as the shareholders' darling among
Britain's generators. Though its shares and National Power's were sold at
the same price in 1991, PowerGen's are now trading at a 15 per cent premium.
Only last April, its larger rival held a slight edge.
National Power seeks to blame the discrepancy on the companies' different
starting points at privatisation. Differences there undoubtedly were -
PowerGen has, for example, had to spend less than expected on cleaning up
its coal-fired stations.
But it would be hard to attribute all or even most of the share price
divergence to something that dates back so long. A better explanation is
that National Power has worried shareholders with its ambitions for
investing Pounds 1bn in overseas power stations.
There is nothing wrong with National Power's global strategy per se. In
fact, it is easier to see what value National Power adds to generating
projects in the developing world than what PowerGen brings to its
investments in North Sea gas. The snag is that the strategy will take a long
time to develop and, in the meantime, National Power is generating cash at a
prodigious rate. The danger is that, with so much cash coming in, management
will adopt a less discriminating approach to foreign investment.
Shareholders would feel more comfortable if the company followed PowerGen's
recent example of buying back its own shares. National Power would still
have no trouble financing worthwhile projects and should see the gap between
its share price and PowerGen's narrowing.
