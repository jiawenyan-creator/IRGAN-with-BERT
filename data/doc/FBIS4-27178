  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japan will send a government 
team to Canada on Saturday to explore the possibility of 
Japanese participation in U.N. peacekeeping efforts on the Golan 
Heights, officials said Tuesday [31 May]. 
  The move came in response to an unofficial request from the 
United Nations to send personnel and assist Canadian 
peacekeepers in charge of logistics in the Middle East, the 
officials said. 
  The delegation, consisting of five officials from the 
Defense 
Agency and one from the Foreign Ministry, will return home on 
June 10 or 11 after meeting with Canadian Government officials, 
they said. 
  The government will study the possibility of Japan sending 
peacekeepers to the Golan Heights upon receiving a report from 
the team, the officials said. 
  The Golan Heights has been occupied by Israel since it 
seized 
the territory from Syria in 1967. 
  A total of 1,036 troops of the U.N. Disengagement Observer 
Force monitor the cease-fire between Israel and Syria in an area 
determined by a May 1974 accord on disengagement. 
  The U.N. force comprises 464 peacekeepers from Austria, 215 
from Canada and 357 from Poland.
