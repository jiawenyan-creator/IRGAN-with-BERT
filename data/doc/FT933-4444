FT  09 SEP 93 / Norway's Labour party well ahead
NORWAY'S ruling Labour party has widened its lead over its rivals and is set
to remain in power after next Monday's general election, according to an
opinion poll published today.
The poll, published in Aftenposten, Norway's leading daily newspaper,
suggested that support for Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's Labour
party had surged three points to 37.4 per cent compared with a week ago.
The main opposition Conservative party slipped for the second week in
succession, this time by 0.6 points to 19.4 per cent.
Labour's gains appeared to be at the expense of the Socialist Left (SV)
party, with which it has agreed to co-operate after the election on most
issues, except the Europe Community. The SV's support fell by 2.5 points to
10.3 per cent.
Political analysts said the Labour party's strategy to play down the issue
of Norway's application to join the EC appeared to be paying off. Labour
party policy supports the application but membership is opposed by most
Norwegians, according to polls.
Today's poll was taken after Mrs Brundtland had campaigned in the staunchly
anti-EC north of the country where she told fishermen that a vote for Labour
did not mean an endorsement of EC membership. She said the issue would be
decided in a referendum to be held by 1995.
Her approach seemed to have blunted the attraction of the anti-EC SV, which
has made the issue of membership a key part of its campaign.
The anti-EC Centre party, heavily supported by Norway's highly subsidised
farmers, managed to progress in the poll by 1.1 points to 11.7 per cent,
almost double its vote in the 1989 election.
The right-wing Progress party, meanwhile, continued its poor showing in the
polls, shedding 1.1 points. Its support now stands at only 6.6 per cent of
the electorate.
