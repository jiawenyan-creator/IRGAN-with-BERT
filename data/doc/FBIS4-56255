  [Text] The U.S. Government suspects there will be at least 
one chair empty at the Americas summit scheduled to take place 
in Miami in December. That which is meant for President Itamar 
Franco. 
  The White House has already received some signals that the 
Brazilian president is not willing to attend the summit 
organized by President Bill Clinton, with the participation of 
the chiefs of state of the entire hemisphere, except Cuba. 
  The fact that Brazil will have a newly-elected president by 
that date serves as an excuse for Franco's lack of interest in 
attending the summit, the intention of which is to implement a 
political and trade integration project for the three Americas. 
The reason for Franco's absence, however, goes beyond the date 
issue. 
  According to a small circle of friends close to Planalto 
Palace, he simply does not like Clinton. Franco, who is a simple 
and frank man who appreciates a good piece of coconut-baked 
pork, dislikes the president of the most powerful country in the 
world. It is a personal matter. What can be done? It must be a 
chemical thing.
