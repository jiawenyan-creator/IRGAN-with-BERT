The Anaheim city council approved final agreements with a New York developer 
for construction of a 19,500-seat indoor sports arena. 
The proposed $100-million arena, tentatively scheduled to be completed by 
September of 1992, is the second major indoor sports facility planned for 
Orange County, following the Santa Ana city council's previous approval of a 
privately owned and operated 20,000-seat facility.
