FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: EC cash sought for Swan Hunter
A TRADE and industry minister yesterday promised to go to Brussels if
necessary to plead Swan Hunter's case for eligibility for EC shipbuilding
intervention funds.
Mr Tim Sainsbury told MPs he had already approached the European Commission
to ask that the Tyneside shipbuilder be given access to the subsidy. He said
he believed that circumstances had changed sufficiently to justify the move.
Swan Hunter, which is in receivership, does not qualify for the 9 per cent
subsidy for merchant shipbuilding orders because it has been classified
since its 1986 privatisation as a warship yard. It has since built two
non-naval vessels.
North Tyneside council argued to the EC competition directorate that Swan
could be redesignated a 'mixed' yard, qualifying for the subsidy, without
setting a precedent.
