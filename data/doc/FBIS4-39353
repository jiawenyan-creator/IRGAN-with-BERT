President for Money"] 
  [Text] Tamara Zlotnikova, deputy chairman of the Russian 
State Duma Committee for Ecology, has yet again urged the 
president to intervene personally in the state's ecological 
policy. "For the first time men's life expectancy has dropped 
below pension age, deformed children are being born, and 
Russians are on the threshold of irreversible changes beyond 
which the collapse of the state and the death of the peoples are 
possible," Zlotnikova wrote in her letter to Yeltsin. 
  Less than 0.6 percent of the expenditure section of the 
budget, or 0.15 percent of the gross domestic product, is 
earmarked for ecological programs. That has never happened in a 
single civilized or even not very civilized country, although 
the troubled and in places catastrophic nature of the ecological 
situation is obliging people to increase financing for 
environmental conservation at least to some extent. According 
to some figures, the ecological damage throughout the country in 
1993 totaled 15 trillion rubles, and this year it is forecast at 
43 trillion, which is over 40 times the expenditure envisaged on 
ecology in the budget.
