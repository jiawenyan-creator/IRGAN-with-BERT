FT  08 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: CIBC prunes payroll by 2,500
CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce has warned it will reduce staff across
the board, by 2,500 or 2.5 per cent, over the next 12 months, spotlighting
serious overcapacity in the financial services industry.
Most of the big Canadian banks have been pruning payrolls during 1992
because of intense cost pressures, but Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
has clearly indicated it plans to reduce operations because of slow economic
recovery and the impact of further automation.
Mr Al Flood, CIBC chairman, said the cutbacks were designed to raise
productivity. 'We are responding to business realities of the '90s. It is
very different from the high growth and high inflation economy of the
1980s.'
CIBC has 48,000 employees, including 35,000 full-time and half the cutback
will be achieved through redundancies and early retirement.
