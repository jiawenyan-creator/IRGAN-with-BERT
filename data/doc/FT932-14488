FT  19 APR 93 / RMT to discuss its next move
THE EXECUTIVE committee of the RMT, the main rail union, meets today to
decide its next move in its dispute with British Rail which has already
resulted in two one-day strikes which paralysed the network.
There had been speculation that the RMT would switch the strike day from
Friday to midweek, but Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary, has stressed that
no decision on further action has yet been taken.
The prospects of an early settlement improved over the weekend after the
union leadership said it had detected signs of a change in BR's bargaining
stance over compulsory redundancies and the use of contract labour.
It wants a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies for its
members and a moratorium on the further use of contract labour.
It is possible that BR will now be able to accept a form of words that will
satisfy the union on those two controversial issues without denying
management some room for manoeuvre in the future.
BR has started to stress that it does not envisage any need for compulsory
redundancies over the next couple of years in the approach to privatisation,
or for a greater use of contract labour in track and signal maintenance
work.
Today, Aslef, the drivers' union, is due to meet BR to try to resolve their
specific differences over the future of the drivers' national agreement. The
two sides reported progress had been made at the end of last week.
Aslef took part in the second one-day strike last week. Nearly three
quarters of pay settlements made so far this year have resulted in rises of
between 2 per cent and 4.9 per cent, new figures show.
The latest pay survey from Incomes Data Services says that negotiators in
the private sector have responded to lower inflation while the government's
1.5 per cent pay limit in the public sector is hold-ing.
Since the start of the year the level of wage settlements has fallen, with
half those concluded so far between 2 per cent and 3.9 per cent.
