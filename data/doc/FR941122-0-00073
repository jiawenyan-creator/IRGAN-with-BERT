 

In 1990, Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of three Federal, three State, and
four interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration in the Park and central Idaho (Pub. L.
101512). That committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991. Among
the measures recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves in the Park, and possibly
central Idaho, as special nonessential experimental populations with flexible management practices by agencies
and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates would be intensively managed by the States with
Federal funding; thus, implementation was expected to be costly. Congress took no action on the committee's recommendation
which would have required an amendment to the Act. 

In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service
and Forest Service, to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to consider a broad range of alternatives
on wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102381), Congress
directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated the preferred alternative should be consistent
with existing law. 

The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. The team participants were the National Park
Service; Forest Service; States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana; USDA Animal Damage Control; and Wind River and Nez
Perce Tribes. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, the news media and
nearly 2,500 groups/individuals interested in wolves were contacted to publicize the EIS process. 

In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, as well as 7 other
locations throughout the United States. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people, and thousands of brochures
were distributed. In total, nearly 4,000 people gave comments on EIS issues. In July 1992, a report narrating the public
comments was mailed to 16,000 people. 

In August 1992, 27 additional ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 additional hearings were held in Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. Hearings were also held in Seattle, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Washington, DC. Two
major newspapers with circulation in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000) distributed
a copy of the alternative scoping brochure in the Sunday edition. Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings, and nearly
5,000 comments were received on methods for managing reintroduced wolves. Public comments typified the strong polarization
of concerns regarding wolf management. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people
in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the
EIS, provided factual information on wolves, and requested the public to report wolf observations in the northern
Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 interested individuals residing in all 50 States and over 40 foreign
countries. 

The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published
on July 16. The DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, interested groups,
and anyone who requested a copy. Additionally, a flyer containing the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 public hearings,
and a request to report wolf sightings was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers (combined circulation
of about 280,000) in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. In mid-June 1993, the Service mailed a letter to over 300 groups,
primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, offering a presentation on the DEIS. This resulted in 31 presentations
to about 1,000 people during the comment period. 

During the DEIS public review period (July 1 to November 26, 1993) over 160,200 individuals, organizations, and government
agencies commented. The magnitude of the response shows the strong interest people have in wolf management. In early
March 1994, a summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS mailing list. 


The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and the notice of availability was
published on May 9, 1994. The EIS considered five alternatives (1) Reintroduction of Experimental Wolves (2) Natural
Recovery (No action), (3) No Wolves, (4) Wolf Management Committee Recommendations, and (5) Reintroduction of Nonexperimental
Wolves. After careful review, the Service's proposed action was to reintroduce gray wolves designated as nonessential
experimental into the Park and central Idaho.
