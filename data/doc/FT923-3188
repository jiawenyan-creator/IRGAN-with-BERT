FT  14 SEP 92 / Minister to quiz Brazil bankers over funds claim
THE Brazilian economy minister is to demand explanations from the heads of
the country's two largest state banks over allegations that they are using
government funds to persuade congressmen to vote against the impeachment of
President Fernando Collor.
The move follows publication in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper of a list
of 190 congressmen who were said to have been promised, or already given,
funds for projects such as roads, bridges, dams and hospitals in their areas
to help elect their candidates in next month's municipal elections. In
return they are expected to support Mr Collor.
The money is allegedly being released by Mr Lafaiette Coutinho, president of
Banco do Brasil, Mr Alvaro Mendonca, head of the Federal Savings Bank, and
Mr Ricardo Fiuza, the social action minister and political co-ordinator.
Known as the 'shock brigade', these three are now Mr Collor's main political
advisers.
Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, said he did not believe
the charges but would today call in the two bank presidents to discuss it.
Mr Moreira is anxious to prevent spending which could compromise his
austerity policy, particularly as inflation is increasing.
There is no doubt, however, that a flurry of projects is suddenly being
approved. In Friday's official Daily Gazette alone there were four pages of
new projects by the Social Action Ministry totalling Cr10.6bn (Pounds 1m).
