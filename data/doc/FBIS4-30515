  [Text] Fiji's prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, has moved to 
allay opposition's doubts about his commitment to a review of 
the country's racially-based Constitution. In Parliament, Mr. 
Rabuka moved that a joint select committee be set up to assist 
the planned commission to review the Constitution by 1997. He 
said the joint committee would comprise 55 percent Fijian, 
Rotuman, and general or mixed-race members of Parliament and 45 
percent Indians. Mr. Rabuka said he was bringing forward his 
motion to allay fears and remove doubts about the government's 
commitment to the constitutional review. The prime minister's 
motion was supported by both sides of the House. 
  The move came one week after the opposition leader, Jai Ram 
Reddy, expressed doubts about Mr. Rabuka's sincerity after an 
outburst in Parliament by the prime minister. Mr. Rabuka, who 
led two coups against the Indian-dominated government elected in 
1987, said he could not guarantee there would not be another 
coup if indigenous Fijians continue to feel disadvantaged.
