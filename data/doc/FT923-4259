FT  08 SEP 92 / Letter: Not a good attitude on education
Sir, What sort of world does your leader writer live in, or want to live in,
if he cannot contemplate the relatively small redistribution of wealth
involved in the state properly funding the higher education system ('College
for all', September 1)?
It reminds me of what the late A H Broderick wrote in the 1940s: when
universal free education was introduced in France in the 19th century it was
because it was the entitlement of every citizen; when it was introduced in
England it was because employers no longer wanted a wholly illiterate
workforce.
This attitude has not done us much good over the years.
