MORNING REPORT: STAGE 
"Miss Saigon," an updated version of Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" set in 
Vietnam as the Americans are fleeing Saigon, opens at London's Theatre Royal 
Drury Lane on Wednesday. It's the new show from the French team that reworked 
Victor Hugo into the theatrical hit "Les Miserables," librettist Alain Boublil 
and composer Claude-Michel Schonberg. Comforted by a hefty $7.5-million advance 
sale, Boublil and Schonberg now await the judgment of the critics. "Naturally, 
we are nervous," Schonberg confesses. "Miss Saigon" marks the first time the 
two have written in English. In the story, "Miss Saigon" is a teen-age 
prostitute who falls in love with an American G.I, has his child, ends up 
working in a Bangkok nightclub and commits suicide to give her son a new life 
in the United States. Lea Salonga, 18, a child star in the Philippines with 
extensive experience in musicals, plays the title role. ALEENE MacMINN
