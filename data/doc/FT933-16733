FT  02 JUL 93 / 2.1 per cent pay rise in manufacturing
PAY RISES in manufacturing averaged 2.1 per cent in the three months to the
end of April - the lowest figure recorded by the Confederation of British
Industry since its pay databank started in 1977.
One in six companies reviewing pay between February and April introduced
freezes for six months or longer, and a further one in six reported freezes
lasting for six months, the CBI said.
Manufacturers are expecting productivity over the next 12 months to outstrip
pay settlements, the survey found.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said the expected reduction in unit
labour costs was 'very encouraging'.
Service sector settlements are also falling sharply, according to the CBI:
the average was 2.5 per cent, compared with 4.1 per cent in the same period
last year.
