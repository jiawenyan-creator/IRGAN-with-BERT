  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 14 KYODO -- Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, the favorite to become next prime 
minister, suggested Thursday [14 April] the ruling coalition 
could forge ties with Michio Watanabe if the former foreign 
minister leaves the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  "There are no differences (with Watanabe) on major issues," 
Hata told reporters late Thursday night in Marrakech, Morocco 
where he is attending a ministerial meeting of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Hata, leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], cited 
Watanabe's resignation from the main opposition LDP and a pledge 
to pursue political reforms as preconditions for cooperation 
with the ruling seven-party coalition. 
  "There is room for negotiation on many points," Hata said. 
"I do not think Mr. Watanabe will oppose the reform path."
