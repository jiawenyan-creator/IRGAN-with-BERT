FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Catalogue sales push Penney
ahead
A surge in catalogue sales helped J C Penney, the US department store group,
report a 17 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 437m from Dollars
375m for the fourth quarter to January.
J C Penney, the biggest catalogue retailer in the US, saw a 23 per cent
increase in catalogue sales for the quarter, largely because the rival Sears
group pulled out of the business last year.
The profits rise in this quarter helped counter a decline in gross margins
at the department stores, which the group attributed to an intensely
competitive retail environment during the Christmas season.
Turnover for the quarter rose to Dollars 6.32bn from Dollars 6.09bn while
cost cutting reduced selling, general and administrative expenses from
Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 1.49bn. Fully-diluted earnings per share rose from
Dollars 1.42 to Dollars 1.64.
For the full year, net income rose by 21 per cent to Dollars 940m from
Dollars 777m, on turnover up from Dollars 18.01bn to Dollars 18.98bn.
Earnings per share were Dollars 3.53, against Dollars 2.95 last time.
Mr William Howell, chairman, said the group's collection of own-label brands
coupled with a good collection of national brands maximised its ability to
offer value to customers. Sales so far in 1994 indicated a healthy year, he
said.
