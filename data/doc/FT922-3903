FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Betterware cleans up with 75% improvement
BETTERWARE's advance on the doorsteps of the UK continued unabated last year
as the household goods company increased pre-tax profit by 75 per cent.
The figure rose from Pounds 4.02m to Pounds 7.04m, on sales up 44 per cent
to Pounds 41.7m, in the year to February 29. The Pounds 322,000 cost of
buying in franchises was treated as an exceptional item.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said growing sales had provided more
opportunities to make economies of scale. For instance, the catalogue cost
the same to print as it had five years ago, even though it had increased
from 64 to 108 pages.
The group was continuing to improve its coverage of the UK market. 'The
right mix would be to have one distributor for every 1,000 households. There
are 21m households, so there should be 21,000 distributors. At the moment we
have 7,000.'
In general, direct sales showed strong growth as a shopping medium in the
UK, where the average annual spend on this form of shopping was only Pounds
32 per household. This compared with Pounds 48 in France, Pounds 88 in
Germany, Pounds 93 in the US and Pounds 250 in Japan.
Betterware launched a French operation last September at a cost of Pounds
250,000. Sales were increasing, but it was not expected to contribute to
profit until next year.
Earnings per share rose to 12.2p (7p). A final dividend of 2.21p makes a
total of 3.06p (2.325p). A 3-for-2 scrip issue is proposed.
COMMENT
Betterware's system of delivering its expanding catalogue to more homes
every year is some way short of saturation in the UK. And the more sales it
gets, the better the deals it can do - especially during a recession - with
the printers of the catalogue and the makers of the goods. High unemployment
has also made it easier to recruit 'distributors' - the army of
self-employed people who do the door-to-door runs. The only capacity
constraint to emerge has been in the warehouse and Pounds 9m will be
invested over two years on a new one near Birmingham which will more than
double annual capital spending. Questions for the future include the
potential for overseas growth. France should break even this year, but it
will be some time before it becomes clear whether this operation has taken
off. Meanwhile, decisions will be made on whether to go into Italy, Germany
or Spain. Pre-tax profit is expected to grow by at least 40 per cent this
year to more than Pounds 10m. This gives a prospective p/e of more than 19
on yesterday's close of 336p. The share price has shot up from 54p two years
ago and 133p last June, but the stock is still worth holding. The scrip
issue and any reduction of the Cohen family's 60 per cent stake should
improve liquidity.
