FT  17 JUN 92 / World Trade News: East Europe accorded US concessions
PORK bellies and wines from Hungary, sleeping bags and pencils from
Czechoslovakia, and screws and bolts from Poland have been added to the list
of duty-free imports to the US as part of the Bush administration's efforts
to help democracies in central and eastern Europe, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
Eighty-nine products were added to the US Generalised System of Preferences
 -a programme for developing countries - after a special review of potential
imports from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.
The US did not add to the list Goya cheese from Hungary, after the
suggestion sparked a row with American dairy farmers.
