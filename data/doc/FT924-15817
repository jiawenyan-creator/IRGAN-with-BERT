FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Leadership under siege on
defence
THE PARTY leadership received its traditionally rough ride on defence last
night, as delegates rejected a request to postpone consideration of a call
to cut UK defence spending to the average level of other west European
countries.
A similar motion was carried convincingly - against the ruling national
executive committee's advice - at last year's pre-election conference. The
result of yesterday's formal card vote will be made known this morning.
Delegates also demanded a ballot on a motion opposed by the NEC urging a
Labour government to scrap the Trident nuclear submarine programme. Last
year, a call for 'immediate abandonment' of Trident was thrown out by a 3-2
margin.
Mr Tony Clarke of the NEC said in a conciliatory speech that the leadership
had requested postponement of the defence spending motion 'not because we
are hostile to it, but because of its vagueness'.
There was 'no detail' of the timescale involved for the cuts and the
countries whose defence spending constituted the average to which the UK
should aspire were not specified. The party's policy on Trident was to 'put
it into the strategic talks'.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, pledged to help combat defence
industry unemployment by formulating plans to set up a viable defence
diversification agency.
Earlier, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, attacked the
government for its failure to 'take any new initiative' during Britain's EC
presidency.
Supporting the deployment of British troops in the former Yugoslavia, he
said their task had been made harder by 'the failure . . to implement
effectively mandatory UN sanctions'.
