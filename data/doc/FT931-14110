FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional lifts A Lee to Pounds 3m
PRE-TAX profits at Arthur Lee &amp; Sons, the manufacturer of steel and plastic
products in which Carclo Engineering lifted its stake to 29.99 per cent in
October, advanced from Pounds 861,000 to Pounds 2.98m in the year to
September 30.
The pre-tax line was helped by a Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 146,000) exceptional
credit from the sale of the Warrington site and by a reduction in interest
payable to Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 1.48m).
Mr Peter Lee, chairman, said Carclo's stake was 'a worry' and 'not of our
choosing'. However, Mr Mike Thompson, corporate development manager at
Carclo, described the stake as 'a trade investment'.
Lee's operating profits grew to Pounds 2.56m (Pounds 2.2m), though the
contribution from continuing activities slipped to Pounds 3.53m (Pounds
3.71m).
Losses at Lee Bright Bars and Bell &amp; Harwood - sold in August to UES
Holdings for about Pounds 7.5m, thereby all but eliminating group borrowings
 -and Plutec were cut to Pounds 968,000 (Pounds 1.51m).
Group turnover was down at Pounds 101.6m (Pounds 105.6m) - a result of the
downward pressure on prices, said Mr Lee. Capital expenditure was Pounds
2.12m (Pounds 3.9m) and in the past five years totalled Pounds 23m, compared
with a depreciation charge of Pounds 12.5m.
In plastics, operating profits rose to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 835,000) on
turnover of Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 12.5m). Mr Lee said that the group would
like to be bigger in plastics, though it was on the look-out for
acquisitions in either plastics or steel.
The emphasis would be on acquiring products, rather than markets. In steel,
operating profits declined to Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 2.87m) on reduced
turnover of Pounds 61.5m (Pounds 64.9m).
Mr Graham Holland, finance director, said that if one stripped out all
management charges, only Stainless Steel Stockholders made a loss.
Mr Lee said there were now 'some signs of recovery in the UK and US
economies', especially in the manufacture and sale of cars, an important
market for Lee. Exports to the US were up by a quarter. He added, however,
that things were weaker in Europe.
The final dividend is held at 4.25p for a maintained 5.9p total, payable
from earnings of 7.32p (5.52p) per share.
