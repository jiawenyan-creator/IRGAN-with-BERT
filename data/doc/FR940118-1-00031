information:
(1) The full legal name of the person or entity claiming royalty fees.

or rural route, of the place of business of the person or entity.
(3) If the claim is a joint claim, a concise statement of the authorization for the filing of the joint claim. For this
purpose a performing rights society shall not be required to obtain from its members or affiliates separate authorizations,
apart from their standard agreements.


(4) A general statement of the nature of the claimant's copyrighted works and identification of at least one secondary
transmission by a cable system establishing a basis for the claim.
(b) Claims shall bear the original signature of the claimant or of a duly authorized representative of the claimant.


(c) In the event that the legal name and/or address of the claimant changes after the filing of the claim, the claimant
shall notify the Copyright Office of such change within 30 days of the change, or the claim may be subject to dismissal.

(d) In the event that, after filing an individual claim, a claimant chooses to negotiate a joint claim, either the particular
joint claimant or the individual claimant shall notify the Copyright Office of such change within 14 days from the
making of the agreement.




(e) All claimants filing a joint claim shall make available to the Copyright Office, other claimants, and, where applicable,
a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, a list of all individual claimants covered by the joint claim.

Compliance with statutory dates.





Claims filed with the Copyright Office shall be considered timely filed only if:







(a) They are received in the offices of the Copyright Office during normal business hours during the month of July,
or
(b) They are properly addressed to the Copyright Office, see 251.1, and they are deposited with sufficient
postage with the United States Postal Service and bear a July U.S. postmark. Claims dated only with a business meter
that are received after July 31 will not be accepted as having been filed during the month of July. No claim may be filed
by facsimile transmission.



252.5


Proof of fixation of works.



In any proceeding for the distribution of cable television royalty fees, the Copyright Office shall not require the
filing by claimants of tangible fixations of works in whole or in part. In the event of a controversy concerning the
actual fixation of a work in a tangible medium of expression as required by the Copyright Code, the Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panel conducting the distribution proceeding shall resolve such controversy on the basis of affidavits
by appropriate operational personnel and other appropriate documentary evidence, and such oral testimony as the
Panel may deem necessary. Affidavits submitted by claimants should establish that the work for which the claim is
submitted was fixed in its entirety, and should state the nature of the work, the title of the program, the duration
of the program, and the date of fixation. No such affidavits need be filed with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel
unless requested by that Panel.
