Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Industrial production in 1993 registered its highest level 
in 
the past 14 years, despite increases in the unemployment and 
underemployment rates. According to polls by the main economic 
consulting firms, industrial production in 1993 increased 2.7 
percent compared with 1992, and 1.4 percent compared with 1987. 
The high industrial production level is the result of the 
sustained levels of capital inflow, totalling $13 billion in 
1993. (Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 10 Jan 94 p 14) 
  The Association of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers has reported 
that automobile production registered the historical record of 
342,350 units in 1993, an increase of 30.7 percent compared with 
1992. Sales increased 31.4 percent. A total of 311,213 units 
were sold on the local market, and 29,976 sent abroad. (Buenos
