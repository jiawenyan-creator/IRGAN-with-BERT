  [Text] This evening talks were held in Simferopol between 
Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, acting 
prime minister of Ukraine. A noisy, rather unfriendly group of 
picketers met the Ukrainian delegation at the Supreme Council 
building, which is perhaps why the talks were held behind closed 
doors. However, at the news conference, journalists were 
assured that the range of questions were very much to do with 
day-to-day matters and that the conversation had been friendly. 
The sides discussed economic aid for Crimea, in particular for 
agriculture. 
  Journalists, alarmed by rumors that more Ukrainian troops 
were being sent to Crimea, that there was a threat of direct 
presidential rule over the peninsula, and that the presidential 
elections in Ukraine may be disrupted, asked how far all this 
was true. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy gave a short reply: It is all a 
provocation.
