FT  18 FEB 93 / Observer: Rankers ranked
As a riposte to newspapers' enthusiasm for publishing performance rankings
of educational establishments, the UK's most pukkah public schools have
turned the tables by producing a ranking of journalists who cover
educational matters.
The counterblast, appearing in the schools' trade magazine Conference and
Common Room, rates the press pundits on five criteria: accuracy, balance,
educational attitudes, delivery and enlightened reporting.
Oddly enough, not all of those named appreciate the results. One, for
example, rebutted the criteria as being too narrow, which, ironically, is a
criticism schools often make of newspaper tables in which they fare poorly.
The Financial Times - which pioneered such rankings in 1970 with its annual
table of university graduates' job-market performance - came in fifth.
