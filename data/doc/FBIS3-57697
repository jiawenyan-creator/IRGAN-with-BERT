  [Text] Tallinn -- A second consignment of Israeli weapons 
has arrived in Estonia for the use of the national defense 
forces. The sub-machine guns, pistols, and anti-aircraft guns 
and missiles in question cost Estonia $60 million. Israel has 
pledged to supply weapons until the end of 1995 and Estonia will 
pay for them before the year 2000. This deal once caused a 
scandal in parliament because the contract for the supply of 
such a costly consignment of weapons was kept secret. 
Government officials quickly came up with a justification: The 
accelerated withdrawal of the Russian troops was, it is claimed, 
linked specifically to the appearance of "Uzi" sub-machine guns 
in the Estonian army. Our lads took fright and left.
