<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Field Office, through the Dallas Support Office, announces, pursuant to
the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14(f), that DOE intends to award a grant to the Texas Engineering Experiment
Station at Prairie View AM University (PVAM), for the implementation of a collaborative program with the Energy
Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) at Texas AM University to provide the necessary training and support
for development of an EADC at PVAM.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DOE announces further that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), this discretionary financial assistance award to the
Texas Engineering Experiment Station at PVAM, would be based on the acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting
the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1). There are currently no Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)
participating in the EADC program. Texas AM University (TAMU) is one of only six EADC program participants that
have IAC qualifications to conduct the combined industrial assessment activities of energy efficiency improvement,
waste reduction/pollution prevention and productivity improvement. Of the six IACs, TAMU is the only institution
in close proximity to an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accredited HBCU. The proposed
project is deemed meritorious based on the general evaluation in accordance with DOE 600.14(d) and represents a unique
approach that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation.



The project period for the grant award is 12 months. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $62,000.00.
