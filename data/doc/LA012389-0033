THE NATION; 
BUNDY CONFESSES TO 10 MORE MURDERS 
Theodore Bundy took responsibility for two Idaho murders and as many as eight 
in Utah, continuing tearful 11th-hour confessions even though they failed to 
bring him a stay of execution, officials said. Utah authorities had suspected 
Bundy in the deaths of two women and the disappearances of three others in 1974 
and 1975. But in a 1 1/2-hour prison interview with a detective late Sunday, 
"there was one incident where he mentioned eight," Sheriff Pete Hayward said in 
Salt Lake City. Idaho state Atty. Gen. Jim Jones said his chief investigator 
had met with Bundy and the condemned prisoner described two murders he said he 
committed in 1974 or 1975 in Idaho. Bundy has been on Death Row at Florida 
State Prison in Starke since July, 1979, and Jones said he had not been 
suspected in any unsolved Idaho crimes. Bundy, 42, is scheduled to die at 7 
a.m. Tuesday.
