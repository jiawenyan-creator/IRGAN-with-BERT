BRIEFLY 
UAW Ratifies Chrysler-Mitsubishi Contract: The United Auto Workers ratified a 
three-year contract with Diamond-Star Motors, a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. 
and Mitsubishi. Exact vote totals were not released, but officials said the 
pact was approved Sunday by a margin of about 3-to-1. The agreement, worked out 
over five months of negotiations, covers 2,300 production and maintenance 
workers at the plant in Normal, Ill. The raises will bring salaries at the 
plant into line with wages of auto workers at other plants represented by the 
UAW. The $650-million Diamond-Star plant began production of the Plymouth Laser 
and Mitsubishi Eclipse about one year ago.
