FT  22 NOV 94 / Wakeham to lead press watchdog
Lord Wakeham, former government chief whip and leader of the Lords, was
yesterday confirmed as the new chairman of the Press Complaints Commission,
to succeed Lord McGregor on January 1.
'The task now is not simply to maintain self-regulation, but to strengthen
it - to put its survival beyond the bounds of reasonable political debate,'
Lord Wakeham said yesterday. 'That is vital not just for the sake of the
press but for the health of our democracy.'
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's heritage spokesman, said he doubted if Lord Wakeham
would have the 'robust independence' which was essential in the job. 'It is
another job for an ex-Conservative Minister. . . . what we need is someone
who holds the public's interest first and foremost.'
