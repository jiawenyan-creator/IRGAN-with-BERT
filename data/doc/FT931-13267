FT  25 JAN 93 / Mirror union seeks injunction
THE NUJ journalists union will today seek a High Court injunction to stop
the management of the Daily Mirror newspaper from introducing a five-night
shift for sub-editors, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Journalists say the change from four to five shifts a week was introduced
without proper warning or consultation. Department heads were told on Friday
that staff rotas introducing a five-shift week were to start yesterday.
Sub-editors, who can work as late as 3am, traditionally work a four-night
week. Reporters work a five-day week.
The change will not mean an increase in the number of hours worked. The
34-hour week specified in the union agreement will be spread over five
shifts.
Mr Peter Woods, of Stephens Innocent, the NUJ's legal representatives, said
it was possible to vary the terms of the agreement but not unilaterally and
without consultation.
The Mirror's management said the agreement provided for five-day working and
that four-day working had grown up 'almost without the management knowing
about it'.
Staff at the Daily Mirror were working normally yesterday but under protest
at the new shift pattern.
