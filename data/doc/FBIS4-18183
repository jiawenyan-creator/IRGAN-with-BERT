  [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- French prime minister 
Edouard Balladur has decided to withdraw the government's plan 
for a youth jobs plan based on hirings at less than the normal 
minimum wage, his office announced on Wednesday [30 March]. 
  The plan, known as the "professional insertion contract" 
(contrat d'insertion professionnelle, CIP), had aroused 
widespread opposition, particularly among young people 
themselves, who staged a number of demonstrations in various 
French cities against the plan. 
  The announcement said the decision to withdraw the measure 
was based on "the results of discussions" held since Monday with 
representatives of unions, young people and employers by the 
head of the National Employment Office, Michel Bon. 
  It added that government aid would be paid to any company 
hiring, for at least 18 months, "a young person who has not yet 
had a stable job." 
  The aid, 1,000 francs ($174 a month) will be paid for nine 
months, and "the aid will be doubled for any hiring before 
October 1."
