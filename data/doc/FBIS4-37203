  [Text] Officials in south Yemen have asked the Arab League 
to keep up efforts on all levels to implement the League's 7 May 
resolution on the Yemeni crisis by enforcing an immediate 
cease-fire and starting a dialogue between the two sides. This 
came in a message the League received today. It was delivered 
by Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the political bureau of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  Assistant Arab League Secretary General 'Adnan 'Imran told 
our correspondent that the League also received a copy of the 
message YSP Leader 'Ali Slaim al-Bid sent to UN Secretary 
General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, urging him to work toward an 
immediate cease-fire in implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolution 924. 
  'Imran added that the League is keeping up its good offices 
with the various Yemeni parties in the north and south, as well 
as with fraternal Arab states and the international community, 
to bring about a cease-fire. The League also wants to bring the 
two sides to the negotiating table to initiate a dialogue rather 
than fight. 
  He reiterated the League's stand on the Yemeni crisis and 
its 
call to end the fighting as soon as possible in order to enhance 
security and stability in Yemen.
