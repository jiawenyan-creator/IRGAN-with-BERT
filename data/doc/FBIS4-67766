  [Text] A North Korean military team left Iran a few days 
ago. The team, led by the Air Force commander and made up of 28 
military and nuclear experts, arrived in Tehran in the second 
week of last month. The team's mission was to put the final 
touches to the Nodong-2 missile, which the Koreans are 
developing for Tehran. This is a developed Scud version with a 
range of 900 km. U.S. information revealed that Tehran was 
planning to field test this missile, but decided to postpone 
that to some other time in order to avoid a confrontation with 
Washington, which has for months now been intensifying its spy 
satellite surveillance of the Iranian territories. This is the 
second postponement after last September's for the same reasons. 
However, the North Korean team returned with new agreements 
with Tehran to intensify bilateral military and nuclear 
cooperation. The U.S. intelligence estimates say that more than 
800 North Korean military experts and officers are in Iran. 
Meanwhile, more than 53 Iranian military men are working at the 
Iranian military attache's section in Pyongyang.
