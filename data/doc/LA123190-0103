ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 
DRIVER DIES AFTER HITTING SIGNAL POLE 
A Garden Grove woman died early Sunday when she apparently lost control of the 
car she was driving and hit a traffic signal pole on Beach Boulevard, police 
said. 
The victim, Deanna Pennington, 21, of Garden Grove, was alone in her 1987 
Toyota Corolla, driving north at 3:05 a.m., according to Westminster police. 
Witnesses told police that Pennington was swerving in the slow lane as she 
approached Trask Avenue. 
"The car jumped the curb at the intersection," Westminster Police Sgt. Russell 
Silva said. "Then she (crashed) into the signal pole." 
Damage to the car was extensive, and Pennington, who was not wearing a seat 
belt, had to be pried from the vehicle with a hydraulic device, Silva said. 
Pennington suffered head injuries and died at the scene. There were no other 
injuries. 
An investigation is continuing, Silva said. JIM NEWTON
