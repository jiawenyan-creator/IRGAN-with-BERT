FT  05 JUN 93 / SIB may never publish Maxwell report
THE SECURITIES and Invest-ments Board, the City's senior regulator, is
unlikely ever to publish the full report of its investigation into the
failure of regulation surrounding the Maxwell affair, it disclosed
yesterday.
The decision to withhold the highly critical report will make legal action
against the regulators difficult and may jeopardise similar action against
other individuals and organisations named in the report.
Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensions Action Group, said: 'This is
a cover-up. It shows the weakness of the City system of regulation. How can
we have faith in a self-regulatory system when it doesn't tell us what
happens when it goes wrong?'
The SIB report covers the relationship between the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation (Imro) and Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM)
and London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management (LBI) - both
Imro members - and Maxwell Central and East European Partners, an applicant
for membership.
The report was initially commissioned by Imro, but was then included in a
report by SIB. Some of its conclusions and recommendations were published
last July, but without the substance of its findings.
SIB said yesterday it had decided not to publish the report because it might
jeopardise civil and criminal action in connection with the Maxwell affair -
in which Pounds 440m was stolen from company pension funds - and because its
authority to publish documents under the Financial Services Act was limited.
Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead and chairman of the Commons social
security select committee, which has been examining the Maxwell affair, said
last night: 'On every ground this is unsatisfactory.'
