CITY SECTION CANCELS GRANT-RESEDA GAME IN WAKE OF BRAWL 
The City Section has canceled today's Valley Pac-8 Conference baseball game 
between Grant High and Reseda as a result of a bench-clearing brawl that ended 
Tuesday's game between the same teams in the fifth inning. 
In addition, the status of Tuesday's game, won by Grant, 13-1, in five innings, 
remains in doubt pending a decision by City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness. 
Under City Section rules, the game could be ruled a loss for both teams or be 
rescheduled. In addition, the City could suspend players who participated in 
the fight for the remainder of the season. Harkness declined comment Wednesday, 
saying he will rule after examining written reports submitted by both schools 
and the game umpires. 
The fight began at the conclusion of the fifth inning at Reseda after Grant's 
Stanley Spancer and Reseda's Rod Stricklin exchanged words. Grant is 11-4 
overall and 8-3 and tied for second place in the East Valley League with Poly, 
a game behind Sylmar. Reseda is 4-11, 1-10.
