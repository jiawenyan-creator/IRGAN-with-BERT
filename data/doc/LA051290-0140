ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 
3 WIN COMPETITION IN PUBLIC SPEAKING 
Three high school seniors on Friday were named winners of a Serafines de Orange 
County public speaking contest that asked contestants to address the importance 
of education in the Latino community. 
Tom Saenz, a senior at El Modena High School in Orange, won the first prize of 
$700. The $600 second prize went to Westminster High School senior Angelica 
Villicana. And Karen Wasinger, a senior at Savanna High School in Anaheim, won 
the third prize of $500. 
Serafines is a nonprofit organization formed by the California Angels to 
promote education for Latinos, said Manuel Esqueda, the organization's 
president. On Thursday night, 25 college-bound Latino students spoke on the 
issue, "What does education mean to the Latino family?"
