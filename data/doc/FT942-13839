FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia sale may face hurdles
Volvo's plans to sell a 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia will end an
involvement in the pharmaceutical industry which dates back to 1985.
Pharmacia is one of the world's top 20 drugs companies with 1993 sales of
SKr27bn (Dollars 3.4bn) - bigger than Astra, its main Swedish rival  - and
it has strong market positions in areas such as growth hormones, eye
surgery, and smoking cessation.
It will not be an easy shareholding for Volvo to offload and it has made the
government's task of selling a 46 per cent stake in Pharmacia this summer,
Sweden's biggest privatisation, more complex.
Volvo's stake will hang over the privatisation, even though it has a pact
with the government which prevents it from selling all but a small portion
of its holding before the end of next year. This means Volvo must sell in
1996 to comply with its own disposal timetable.
At today's price, Volvo would get SKr7.7bn from selling the Pharmacia stake,
against a SKr6.2bn book value. But the company will probably expect proceeds
to be higher, providing the privatisation proceeds smoothly and
pharmaceutical stocks come back into fashion.
For the moment, the sector is overshadowed by worldwide pressure on
healthcare spending.
Much will depend on how Pharmacia performs over the next two years. The
group will undergo restructuring following a period of rapid expansion and
last year's Dollars 1.3bn purchase of Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the Italian
pharmaceutical company.
Pharmacia does not have the volume growth of Astra, and it will be relying
on cost-cutting to lift profits.
The company has indicated it expects as much as half of its production
capacity - spread over 46 plants in 15 countries - to be closed in the next
four years.
At the moment, the most widely held view is that Volvo is most likely to
dispose of its stake through an institutional placing.
