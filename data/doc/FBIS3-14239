Security Situation in Baghdad"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The "Iraqi Dispatch Committee" 
belonging to the Unified Iraqi National Congress in Salah al-Din 
(Iraqi Kurdistan) has said that the security situation in 
Baghdad has deteriorated "dramatically." 
  A report from the committee, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has 
received, says that Iraqi authorities have confirmed this 
deterioration. The government-controlled newspaper 
AL-JUMHURIYAH published on 19 March a statement issued by the 
Interior Ministry, saying that death sentences had been passed 
against four people -- three are in prison and the fourth is at 
large -- for stealing a car and involvement in an armed clash 
with the traffic police in Baghdad. The ministry announced a 
reward of 1 million dinars ($3,152) for the fugitive's arrest. 
  The Dispatch Committee listed in its report several 
incidents 
which occurred in Baghdad during February and March: the theft 
of a car belonging to the British relief organization Oxfam (11 
March), an explosion near the Air Force Command premises (13 
March), another explosion near a statue of President Saddam 
Husayn in al-Zawra' park (2 March), a bomb explosion in Tunis 
Street (27 February), and a clash which occurred at night in 14 
Ramadan Street between an armed group and a police patrol. This 
clash resulted in the killing of an officer and a policeman (28 
February).
