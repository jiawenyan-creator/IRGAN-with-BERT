FT  08 OCT 92 / Europe adds a fiscal choke to monetary grip: David Marsh on
the dangers of widespread budget squeezing
ALL OVER Europe governments are mounting a determined attack on budget
deficits. They are trying to convince the foreign exchanges of their
financial rectitude and prepare the way for non-inflationary growth.
The 1993 budget plans drawn up or under discussion in most European
Community and Nordic countries aim to dole out further doses of painful
medicine. The problem is that, labouring in a phase of economic doldrums and
high interest rates, Europe's finance ministries may be collectively
applying the fiscal brakes in the wrong way and at the wrong time.
Many individual government decisions - such as Germany's efforts to restrain
spending to finance German unification, or Italy's attempts at thoroughgoing
budgetary reform - are plainly necessary.
However, the cumulative effect of the budget pruning, ranging from large
cuts in social security to reduction in investment programmes, may tip
Europe towards a further growth slowdown next year.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg in London, estimates
the net contractionary effect of combined budgetary plans in nine European
countries (see table) represents 1 1/4 per cent of these nations' gross
domestic product.
The bank's calculations apply only to the 'discretionary' measures taken by
governments to reduce deficits through revenue increases or spending cuts.
They exclude the automatic increases in deficits caused by the effect of a
slowdown in growth, which depresses tax revenues and boosts pay-outs on
social security and unemployment.
Even if not all the measures announced during the last few weeks are put
into effect - an outcome which seems especially likely in Italy - Mr Magnus
is concerned that governments may be indulging in 'fiscal overkill'.
He warns: 'If private sector activity is going to be depressed for some
time, this is the wrong time to cut back spending in public investment.'
Mr Jonathan Wilmot of Credit Suisse First Boston in London worries that
Europe may be fighting 'deflation with deflation'. Because of the impact of
high capital market interest rates, Mr Wilmot points out that individual
efforts to cut deficits are often being counteracted by rising debt service
costs.
Mr David Hale of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services says that
governments which inflated their budget deficits in the first half of the
year to compensate for over-tight monetary policies are now seeking a return
to fiscal orthodoxy.
'This (cuts in budget deficits) is all right if you do it over three years.
But if you do it during just one year, you deepen recession,' he says.
Mr Hale expects that the Bundesbank - which has already started making
significant reductions in its money market interest rates - will decide
further interest rate cuts by Christmas. This will take some pressure off
European economies - but a 'weak 1993' is unavoidable, he says.
Mr Hans-Peter Frohlich, international economist at Institut der deutschen
Wirtschaft in Cologne, a business-orientated research institute, says most
European countries are embroiled in some form of asset price deflation. With
the private sector heavily constrained, fiscal contraction is being decided
'at the worst possible moment', he says.
'What we want is expansionary policies and a return to international policy
co-operation.'
Mr Frohlich points to the fundamental problem posed by German interest
rates. While the Bundesbank's monetary stance has caused difficulties for
the rest of Europe, premature action to lower German interest rates would
damage the German central bank's anti-inflation credibility - and would lead
to higher rather than lower D-Mark interest rates on the capital market.
European governments face a collective dilemma of not knowing when the
long-awaited upturn in economic activity will eventually arrive, says one
top international policy-making official.
Pointing to the risks that government could be pressed at the wrong time
into expansionary budget measures, he says: 'We're at precisely the moment
in the past when we've panicked - and we've found out later that the
recovery has already started.'
Partly because of the trauma caused by the last few weeks' currency
turbulence, European countries are sticking to 'safety first' in their 1993
budgets.
But, in trying to win the favour of the foreign exchange markets,
governments clearly face the risk that they will be ploughing collectively
not into recovery - but into recession.
