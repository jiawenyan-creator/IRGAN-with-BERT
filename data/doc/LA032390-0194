STALKER SEEKS 2ND STRAIGHT VICTORY ON WAY TO DERBY 
Stalker, a late nominee for the Triple Crown races, will try for his second 
straight victory in a New York steppingstone to the Kentucky Derby when he 
meets six other 3-year-olds in the seven-furlong Bay Shore on Saturday at 
Aqueduct. 
Stalker won the six-furlong Swift on March 10. 
The other New York preps for the Derby are the one-mile Gotham on April 7 and 
the 1 1/8-mile Wood Memorial on April 21, both at Aqueduct. 
For Really, Richard R. and Cielo, who were second, third and fourth, 
respectively, in the Swift, also are in the field for the $100,000-added Bay 
Shore. All three are nominated to the Triple Crown races. 
Dangerous Dawn and Nymphist complete the field. They are not Triple Crown 
nominees. 
Stalker will carry 119 pounds. Richard R. will carry 117, and the others will 
tote 114 each.
