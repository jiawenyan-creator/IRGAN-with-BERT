FT  02 MAY 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week - Bergenia Cordifolia
This fine, hardy perennial has stout stems that creep along the surface and
cover themselves with large, more or less circular, thick-textured,
evergreen leaves. These are glossy and make fine ground cover. In late
winter and spring, the plant produces many stout branch stems bearing
closely-packed, bell-shaped pink flowers. There is an excellent variety
named Puppurea which has red stems and magenta flowers. Both are grown
easily in any reasonably fertile soil in full sun or in shade, but flowers
will be produced more freely with plenty of light.
