Coast Guard personnel and others rescued at least nine kayak riders who were 
dumped into chilly, rain-swept San Francisco Bay after their Polynesian-type 
outrigger boats swamped during a race, Golden Gate National Recreation Area 
police reported. A spokesperson said at least two of the outriggers racing from 
Sausalito and around Alcatraz "cut it too close" to the island in the middle of 
the bay and swamped, and that the riders were helped or made it themselves to 
Alcatraz where they were picked up. Ian Wilson of Sea Trek Ocean Kayaking 
Center was quoted as saying one boat filled with water during the paddle, but 
the center declined later to give details of the incident. An original report 
indicated about 25 people were involved in the ditching.
