Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule proposes to amend the NASA Federal Acquisition Regulation (NFS) to include coverage on evaluation of uncompensated
overtime. NASA's policy is to consider uncompensated overtime in the evaluation of proposals and professional compensation.
Contracting officers are required to conduct a risk assessment of proposals for technical and professional services
that include low labor rates and/or a high level of uncompensated overtime. A solicitation provision is prescribed
for use in solicitations for professional and technical services estimated at $500,000 or more. Use of the provision
is optional between $100,000 and $500,000. The provision requires offerors to identify uncompensated overtime
hours and the effective hourly rate for all Fair Labor Standards Act-exempt personnel included in their proposals
and subcontractor proposals.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The proposed coverage was generated in response to industry and internal NASA requests for a uniform uncompensated
overtime policy within the Agency. 



Impact



NASA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.). It requires offerors to identify
uncompensated overtime hours in their proposals, including their uncompensated overtime policy and the historical
basis for those hours. This information is in many cases already being provided by offerors for proposal evaluation
and is not required for lower dollar value procurements. NASA will request OMB approval of any reporting or recordkeeping
requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.
