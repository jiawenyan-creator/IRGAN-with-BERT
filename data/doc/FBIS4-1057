  [Text] Two of the six cabinet minister who had fled the 
country this week arrived in Maseru this morning. The principal 
secretary for information and broadcasting, Mr. Seeiso Serutla, 
said six cabinet ministers had fled the country after receiving 
rumors of threats to their lives. He said the rumors alleged 
that members of the Army would not accept their salary checks 
for this month and that the ministers would be killed. He said 
the situation was that the armed forces had accepted their 
checks and that allegations that ministers would be killed were 
not true. 
  Mr. Serutla said the Government of Lesotho has agreed with 
the leaders of the Army on some increase in the salaries of the 
armed forces and the increase will be reflected in their pay 
packets for May. Mr. Serutla further said it was true that some 
ministers were out of the country on official business and they 
are the ministers of foreign affairs, the minister of health, 
and that of labor and employment.
