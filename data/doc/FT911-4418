FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Telecoms groups plan private
Swedish network
KINNEVIK, the Swedish communications group, and Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK
will start a private telecommunications network to compete against Sweden's
national agency, Televerket.
The new network, Tele2, will be aimed initially at business customers.
Kinnevik last year sold 40 per cent of Tele2's predecessor Comvik Skyport to
Cable &amp; Wireless for SKr100m (Dollars 16.5m).
Tele2, which will start this autumn, has signed a 25-year agreement to use
fibre optical cable networks that have been laid alongside Sweden's main
railway lines.
But Tele2's access to households has been blocked since it has to rent use
of the system operated by Televerket, which is demanding a prohibitively
high fee, according to Mr David Johannesson, Kinnevik president.
Tele2 hopes for annual revenues of SKr1bn by the year 2000, which would
still make it much smaller than Televerket, which had sales of SKr31bn in
1990.
