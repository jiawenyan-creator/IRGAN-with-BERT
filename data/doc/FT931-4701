FT  10 MAR 93 / Reform to axe Arts Council
THE Arts Council of Great Britain is to disappear as a result of the
government's reform proposals for Scotland.
In future the funding of the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils will be the
direct responsibility of the respective secretaries of state. At the moment
they receive their annual grants through the ACGB according to an agreed
formula linked to their populations.
The Arts Council of Great Britain will become an Arts Council for England.
The change will enable arts organisations in Scotland and Wales to lobby
hard for extra cash in Edinburgh and Cardiff.
