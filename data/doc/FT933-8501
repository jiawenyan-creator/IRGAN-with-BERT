FT  14 AUG 93 / Libya threatened with tougher sanctions
LIBYA was threatened last night with tougher sanctions unless it hands over
the suspects in the Lockerbie airliner bombing by October 1, Agencies report
from New York.
The ultimatum was given by the US, Britain and France after the United
Nations Security Council renewed the existing sanctions against Libya.
The present sanctions, introduced 16 months ago, prevent the sale of arms to
Libya, ban aviation links, and call for a scaling down of diplomatic links.
The tough new sanctions would hit Libya in oil-related, financial and
technological fields, but it was not clear how significant they would be.
The UN imposed sanctions against Libya because of its refusal to hand over
the Lockerbie suspects for trial in the US or Britain. The two men are
suspected of planting a bomb which blew up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie
in Scotland in December 1988, killing all 259 people aboard as well as 11 on
the ground.
The existing sanctions have been extended by the UN five times, and pressure
for tougher measures has grown as the dispute has dragged on.
But there has been periodic speculation that Libya may be trying to reach
some arrangement with western nations to end the row and to avert further
sanctions.
Diplomats at the UN said that the US wanted to give Libya no more than 30
days to comply with the latest ultimatum, but agreed to allow a little more
time under French and British pressure. The proposed future sanctions might
encompass a ban on all Libyan oil sales, as well as a freeze on Libyan
financial assets, they said.
However, European nations that import Libyan oil, such as Italy, have been
opposed to expanding the sanctions to include an oil embargo.
