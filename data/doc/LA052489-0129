MEXICO TO SELL AIRLINE TO BOLSTER ECONOMY 
Mexicana Airlines will be sold to the private sector as part of President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari's plan for invigorating the nation's economy, the 
government said. 
The Treasury Department announced late Monday that the International Bank will 
coordinate the sale of the state-owned airline to the Mexican or foreign bidder 
who makes the most attractive offer. 
The other government-owned airline, Aeromexico, was sold to a consortium of 
Mexican investors in November.
