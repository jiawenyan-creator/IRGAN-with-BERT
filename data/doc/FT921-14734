FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ames reorganisation plan
AMES DEPARTMENT Stores, the US discount stores group which went into
bankruptcy almost two years ago, yesterday filed an 'all equity'
reorganisation plan, writes Nikki Tait.
The scheme envisages Ames' creditors would exchange their claims for Dollars
352.5m in cash, plus stock in the reorganised company. Unlike many bankrupt
companies, Ames does not plan to issue new debt securities as part of the
reorganisation attempt. Senior creditors will finish with about 47.1 per
cent of the equity, general unsecured creditors with around 45.7 per cent
and bondholders with 7.2 per cent.
Making various assumptions about the value of Ames' new shares, the scheme
is reckoned to give senior creditors about 64 cents on the dollar and
unsecured creditors about 39 cents on the dollar.
Total estimated claims against Ames, when the company filed for bankruptcy
in April 1990, were put at Dollars 1.6bn. Ames has already pruned its
operations sharply, closing over 300 outlets.
Ames' plan received a conditional endorsement from unsecured creditors. But,
the company added it was contingent on the successful negotiation of a new
Dollars 200m seasonal working capital facility, to replace a revolving
credit line currently provided by Chemical Bank.
