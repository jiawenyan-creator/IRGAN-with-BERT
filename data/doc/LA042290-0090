SKAGWAY, NOT SITKA 
Having had the opportunity to take several cruises to southeast Alaska, I can 
vouch for the many wonders about which Shirley Slater and Harry Basch 
accurately wrote ("A Couple of Ways to See Alaska From Sea Level," April 8). 
However, while it is true that in Sitka one can see many examples of Russian 
architecture, one cannot see the ghost of con man Soapy Smith still stalking 
the streets. 
To appreciate the lore and legend of Alaska's greatest confidence man, one must 
go to Skagway, walk the streets which Soapy walked during the gold rush days 
and visit Soapy's grave. Soapy lives on, but in Skagway, not in Sitka.
