  [Abstract] Failure to implement numerous suggestions to use 
biological entities, including mollusks, for assessing the 
man-caused contamination of the environment, became an impetus 
for describing the pattern of the Dnepr river basin area 
contamination with [.sup]90[/]Sr of the Chernobyl origin 
plotted on the basis of _b_-radioactivity measurements taken in 
fresh water mollusk shells. The study is based on a collection 
of 630 mollusk samples most of which were taken in 1990-1991 
from rivers in the Dnepr basin. Mostly fresh water mollusk of 
the Viviparus, Contectiana, Lymnaea s.str., Planorbarius, 
Unio, Anodonta, Colletopterum, and Dreissena 
genera were selected for the radiometry study, and 
Succinea, Bradybaena, Cepaea, and Helix 
land snails were used for comparison. A correction for natural 
activity of [.sup]40[/]K was made. The background 
_b_-radioactivity of mollusk shells from the collection 
gathered 
before the start of nuclear tests in the atmosphere and water 
was close to 50 Bq/kg due to 40K while more than 90% 
of _b_-activity in the shells collected in the Chernobyl 
fallout 
pattern can be attributed to [.sup]90[/]Sr. This is evident 
from the energy characteristics of the _b_-particle flux, a 
good 
correlation between the specific activity of shells from [.sup]90[/] 
Sr contaminated terrain or water, and differences 
in the _b_- and _g_-activity ratios in fallout patterns with 
different radionuclide compositions. On the other hand, the 
mollusks' individual variability and taxonomy differences make 
only a slight contribution to the spread of experimental data. 
The conclusion is drawn that snail and mollusk shells are a 
convenient biological indicator of man-caused contamination and 
water quality and should be used extensively in areas with 
operating nuclear power plants and other installations. It is 
noted, however, that the Kursk, Smolensk, Khmelnitskiy, Rovno, 
and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants are not causing detectable 
river contamination at this time. Figures 5; references 8: 5
