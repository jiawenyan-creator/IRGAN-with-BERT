WEATHERSPOON IS ARRESTED ON ASSAULT CHARGE 
Chuck Weatherspoon, University of Houston running back, is free on $500 bond 
after being charged with a misdemeanor in connection with the assault of 
another student Saturday. 
Richard Labs, 33, said he was attacked "out of the blue" and suffered a black 
eye. 
"I don't know what provoked him," Labs said. 
Weatherspoon, 22, a senior from La Habra, faces a court appearance Friday. 
Weatherspoon, who set an NCAA rushing record last season by averaging 9.6 yards 
per carry, was accused of being involved in an incident Saturday night at an 
apartment complex at the school. He was jailed, but was released after posting 
bond on Sunday. 
"We received a report that one of our football players was involved in an 
assault," school spokesman Eric Miller said. "We don't know why Weatherspoon 
and the other gentleman got into words, but they did. I have no details about 
who did what to whom."
