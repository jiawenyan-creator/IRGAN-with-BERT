FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: PosGold's Boddington deal goes
to court
The USDollars 116m deal for Reynolds Metals of the US to sell its 40 per
cent stake in the western Australian Boddington gold mine to Poseidon Gold
(PosGold) is to be challenged in the courts by Newcrest Mining, another
Boddington shareholder.
News of the challenge came as PosGold, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's
Normandy Poseidon group, announced that it had placed 23.5m new shares at
ADollars 3.40. The placement, mainly with existing institutional
shareholders, raised ADollars 80m (USDollars 57.5m).
The placement is designed to help PosGold - which is already in the throes
of a hostile takeover bid for Aztec Mining - to fund the Boddington purchase
for USDollars 116m plus delivery of 30,000 ounces of gold over seven years.
Yesterday, however, Newcrest, which has a 20 per cent interest in the
Boddington mine, said the joint venture agreement was governed by various
conditions, including certain pre-emption rights for existing partners if a
stake was divested.
Reynolds, it said, had begun court action to determine the applicability of
the joint venture agreement to the proposed PosGold sale. Newcrest said it
had joined the action 'with a view to determining the status of Reynolds'
obligations through the courts in due process'.
