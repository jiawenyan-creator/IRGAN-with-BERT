THE NATION; 
DEFICIT AS HIGH AS $141 BILLION PROJECTED 
The Congressional Budget Office disclosed that it expects the federal deficit 
for next year to be $141 billion if Congress does not approve any changes in 
current spending or tax policies. By comparison, the White House's Office of 
Management and Budget forecasts its "baseline" deficit at $127 billion for the 
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The difference between the two forecasts is 
mostly due to varying assumptions about how the economy will perform over the 
next year. The Gramm-Rudman budget law calls for lawmakers to cut the deficit 
to less than $110 billion next year, so the CBO report implies that Congress 
must find roughly $30 billion in spending cuts or tax increases, while the OMB 
projection suggests that only about $17 billion in deficit reductions are 
required. Both agencies are required to present more up-to-date estimates in 
August, closer to the Gramm-Rudman deadline in October, but only the OMB 
projections are used in the final determination of whether Congress has met the 
requirements of the budget law.
