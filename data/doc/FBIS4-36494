  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz affirmed to the 
editors' doyen, Milhim Karam, that Lebanon refuses to equate 
resistance operations and the occupier's acts of aggression. He 
noted that resistance leaders' maturity and wisdom have foiled 
the Israeli attempt to strike at the internal front. 
  Buwayz voiced his hope that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will come to the area with clear and new proposals.
