  [Text] Sources close to Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan] say that troops of the forces opposed to President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani of Afghanistan are tightening their siege on 
Kabul and on the forces loyal to Hezb-e Jam'iat-e Eslami 
[Islamic Society of Afghanistan] from the east, south, and north 
of the city. 
  Forces affiliated to Ahmed Shah Mas'ud have reported the 
arrest of 300 troops loyal to General Dostam. 
  The Afghan Embassy in Islamabad announced that heavy clashes 
have occurred between forces of Rabbani and General Dostam in 
Faryab and Sheberghan. 
  Meanwhile Hezb-e Wahhdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity Party of 
Afghanistan] announced that the experience of the war during the 
past 20 months has demonstrated that none of the warring sides 
will gain victory and that Hezb-e Wahhdat-e Eslami will not side 
with any of the warring factions, but will endeavor to terminate 
the war in which the people are suffering the most.
