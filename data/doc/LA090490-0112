CANADIAN SOLDIERS CLOSING IN ON DEFIANT MOHAWKS 
Heavily armed Canadian soldiers Monday tightened their perimeter around a group 
of armed and defiant Mohawk Indians who refused to surrender. 
Army spokeswoman Capt. Lynne Bermel said the army moved several hundred yards 
closer to "The Pines," an Indian alcohol and drug treatment center on the 
Kanesatake reserve, west of Montreal. 
Oneida Nation Chief Terry Doxtator told reporters outside the treatment center 
that the remaining Mohawk Warriors "will not lay down their arms if the army 
moves in." 
About two dozen members of the Mohawk Warriors and an unknown number of women 
and children were reportedly holed up in the treatment center. 
The dispute in Oka began several months ago over a proposed expansion of the 
town's golf course on land that Mohawks on the Kanesatake reserve claim is an 
ancient burial ground. It turned violent on July 11, when a provincial police 
officer was killed.
