FT  13 OCT 92 / Buyers are attracted by garden ornament auction: Saleroom
THE SALEROOMS are kept busy these days selling off the stock of dealers.
That is partly because of bankruptcies in the recession and partly - as in
the case of the long-established T. Crowther &amp; Sons, of Fulham, London -
through companies deciding to call it a day.
The Crowthers have long dominated the world of antique garden ornaments and
architectural furnishings and a cadet branch will continue to trade as
Crowthers of Syon Lodge.
About 1,500 items from stock are being auctioned over three days by
Christie's on the Crowther premises at 282 North End Road, and the first
morning brought a packed courtyard, with many new faces among more than 400
registered buyers. The opening session totalled Pounds 173,000, well over
the high estimate of Pounds 153,000, and was 98 per cent sold.
A Regency mahogany partner's library table, or large kneehole desk, was
within estimate at Pounds 17,600 and a Derbyshire Blue John urn, 20in high,
of the late 18th century, beat its forecast at Pounds 7,150.
A modern pine library bookcase in the style of George III more than doubled
its estimate at Pounds 6,820 and an inlaid mahogany dwarf sideboard of the
early 19th century realised Pounds 5,720.
The auction seems destined to prove that even in an art market recession
objects with a good provenance sell well.
Another market where demand remains good is the specialist field of
banknotes. Spinks sold the George Webber collection for more than Pounds
220,000. A specimen five shillings from an issue destroyed in November 1919,
believed to be unique, doubled its estimate at Pounds 12,980.
