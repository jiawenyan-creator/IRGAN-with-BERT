<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of letter by President Cesar Gaviria to </F>
Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango Mejia; date not 
given; from the "24 Hours" newscast--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Let me emphasize to you that in this case, as in any 
other, the government accepts and respects the decisions made by 
your institution with regard to the interpretation of the scope 
of the Constitution. This position, however, does not prevent me 
from advocating the alternatives I deem convenient within the 
judicial system. 
  I share with you the interest in preserving the separation 
of 
government branches, especially the autonomy of the judicial 
branch. This belief does not mean unanimity, nor does it 
obstruct the pursuit of legal or constitutional alternatives. 
  Rest assured that the government refuses to let this case be 
overblown.
