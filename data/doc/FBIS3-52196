  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 3, IRNA -- Two Iranian dailies Monday 
[3 January] commented in their editorials on the current clashes 
in Kabul and called for mediations to end the fighting which is 
going to root out the nation's properties. 
  The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' called for an immediate 
summit meeting of regional countries including Iran, Pakistan 
and some others with influence in Afghanistan. 
  It said that the meet would be aimed to "chalk out a plan 
for 
free and fair elections which is a must and that many believe 
can silence the guns." 
  The editorial considered as insufficient whatever the 
neighboring countries have done so far to bring peace to the 
country stressing that "a concrete step should be taken." 
  The Persian daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that impartial 
people who are trusted by the Afghan nation should enter the 
scene to narrow the gap in the viewpoints of the jihad groups 
and to extinguish the flames of wrath which would eliminate the 
properties of the Afghan nation. 
  It also expressed surprise that some of the jihad groups 
have 
shown such a strong will to remove their rivals.
