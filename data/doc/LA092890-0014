COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE; 
UCLA; 
REGGIE MOORE REVERTING TO '88 FORM 
Reggie Moore, UCLA's senior split end, caught only 12 passes for 181 yards and 
one touchdown last year after having caught 38 for 627 yards and six touchdowns 
in 1988. 
He is productive again, though. After three games, Moore has caught 15 passes 
for 265 yards, a 17.7 average, and two touchdowns. He ranks second in the 
Pacific 10 Conference in receiving yards per game, 88.3, and is fourth in 
receptions. 
Ball control has not been UCLA's strong point this season. The Bruins have 
maintained possession for 68 minutes 34 seconds in three games, compared to 
111:26 for their opponents. MAL FLORENCE
