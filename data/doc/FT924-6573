FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T to float 15% of its leasing
and finance unit
AT&amp;T, the US telecomm-unications company, announced yesterday that it was
planning to float 15 per cent of AT&amp;T Capital, its equipment leasing and
finance subsidiary, as part of a broader strategy to give the unit greater
financial independence from the parent group.
A new subsidiary, which will keep the name AT&amp;T Capital, will be established
to take over most of the unit's Dollars 7bn in assets, although it's
leverage lease and project finance assets will remain with AT&amp;T for tax
reasons. A public stock offering of about 15 per cent of the new unit is
planned for next year, depending on market conditions.
AT&amp;T said the changes, which have been under discussion for several months,
were designed to let AT&amp;T concentrate more on its core businesses of
communications and computing, yet still retain a substantial interest in
AT&amp;T Capital. The unit reported revenues of Dollars 1bn last year (out of
the total Dollars 63bn reported by AT&amp;T), and has 600,000 customer accounts
and 2,400 employees, making it one of the largest leasing and finance
companies in the US.
AT&amp;T said that the partial spin-off of the subsidiary would also give the
telecommunications company greater financing flexibility because future debt
issued by the new unit would not be supported by AT&amp;T. However, it would
continue to guarantee the unit's current outstanding debt, which included
Dollars 2.71bn of medium-term notes.
Mr Thomas Wajnert, AT&amp;T Capital's president and chief executive, said
yesterday: 'We will have greater control of our destiny, financing and the
markets we pursue. At the same time, we still maintain the AT&amp;T relationship
and brand name.'
AT&amp;T Capital was formed in 1985 to help market AT&amp;T's business systems. In
its present form the company is made up of 10 separate units that finance
both AT&amp;T and non-AT&amp;T equipment, including computer systems and cars and
telecommunications, office manufacturing and general business equipment.
News of the changes at AT&amp;T Capital helped lift AT&amp;T shares Dollars 1/4 to
Dollars 47 1/8 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
