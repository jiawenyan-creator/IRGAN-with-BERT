  [Text] Taipei, March 19 [date as received] (CNA) -- The 
Republic of China [ROC] will offer technical and consultative 
assistance to help Nigeria develop export processing zones, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday [19 May]. 
  The Executive Yuan gave the green light Thursday approving 
an 
agreement signed in April by ROC Economics Minister P.K. Chiang 
and his Nigerian counterpart Melford Okilo to cooperate in 
developing export processing zones in the Western African 
country. 
  According to the agreement, Taipei will take the initiative 
in establishing a number of joint-venture industries in Nigeria, 
will encourage Taiwan businesses to invest in the export 
processing zone Taipei is helping develop in Calabar, a port 
city in southeastern Nigeria, and will send technicians and 
management personnel to work at the Calabar Processing Zone. 
  Nigeria is rich in natural resources and has a large 
territory and population, making it an ideal partner for 
business cooperation, ministry officials said. 
  Taiwan and Nigeria maintain no diplomatic relations.
