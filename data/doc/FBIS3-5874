  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday boasted of his strengthened personal 
relations with U.S. President Bill Clinton despite the collapse 
of bilateral trade negotiations a month ago. 
  "I am not on bad terms with Mr. Clinton," a Foreign Ministry 
official quoted Hosokawa as saying in an interview with THE NEW 
YORK TIMES, which will be published in the spring issue of THE 
NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE. 
  "On the contrary, we are getting closer and closer," the 
prime minister reportedly said. "I really feel that way when I 
talk with Mr. Clinton." 
  The United States has been turning up the heat on Japan 
after 
Hosokawa and Clinton failed to strike a deal in a February 
summit in Washington on the penetration of more foreign goods 
into Japanese markets. 
  Hosokawa told the U.S. newspaper that the restructuring of 
the economy will be the top priority for the nation, the 
official said in a briefing to reporters. 
  Hosokawa, asked to comment on whether Japan is really 
changing, reportedly said the nation's political and cultural 
structures have yet to be mature enough but that signs of change 
are surely emerging.
