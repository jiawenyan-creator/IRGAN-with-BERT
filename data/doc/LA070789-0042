MUGGY, WARM: WEATHER IS IN MID-JULY FORM 
How predictable. How utterly old hat. As if following carefully drawn 
blueprints, the weekend weather is going to do exactly what it is supposed to 
do for mid-July. 
Muggy and warm are the weather watchwords for San Diego's second weekend in 
July. Near-seasonal temperatures will seem higher because of moist winds slowly 
creeping in from Mexico, the National Weather Service reported. 
Thunderstorms Possible 
A humidity level of 30% may bring thunderstorms by Sunday to such areas as 
Ramona, Alpine and Campo, forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. However, the rest 
of the county should experience a typical July. 
"Right now, it doesn't look like it will rain over the city, but it will be 
noticeably more humid," Shigehara said. "We have a real change with the winds 
coming from Mexico. Earlier this week, we were getting winds from the drier 
directions, Hawaii and Japan, but the winds are now subtly shifting." 
68 to 72 at the Beach 
After the morning low clouds burn off, highs at the beach are expected to range 
from 68 to 72. Afternoon skies should be hazy but fair, Shigehara said, adding 
that skies along the coast and inland will also be hazy to fair, with some 
straggling clouds from the south. Highs along the coast throughout the weekend 
will be from 71 to 81, with minor day-to-day fluctuation, according to the 
forecast. Overnight lows of 56 to 62 are predicted along the coast. 
The surf is at 3 feet. The ocean is 66 degrees. 
Inland temperatures will be slightly higher, ranging from 81 to 91 during the 
days and 56 to 62 at night. 
Mountain highs will be between 85 and 92, with overnight lows in the middle 
60s. Desert highs will range from 107 to 113, and overnight lows will be 77 to 
85.
