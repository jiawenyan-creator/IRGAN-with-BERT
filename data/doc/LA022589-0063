WCAC ROUNDUP; 
OVERTIME WIN GIVES ST. MARY'S THE TITLE 
Al Lewis scored 20 points, including two on foul shots with 13 seconds left in 
overtime, to lead 19th-ranked St. Mary's over Gonzaga, 67-63, at Spokane, 
Wash., and give the Gaels the West Coast Athletic Conference regular-season 
championship. 
St. Mary's, which this week moved into the top 20 for the first time in school 
history, improved to 23-3 overall and 11-2 in the conference. The victory, 
coupled with Pepperdine's loss to USF, assured that the Gaels will be seeded 
No. 1 for the WCAC tournament March 4-6 in USF Francisco. 
Gonzaga erased a nine-point deficit in the last 2:30 of regulation and tied the 
score, 57-57, with 31 seconds left on a three-point shot by Jim McPhee. He led 
the Bulldogs (13-13, 4-9) with 21 points. 
James Dailey's basket and two free throws by Robert Haugen put St. Mary's 
ahead, 61-57, in the first minute of overtime. 
McPhee made five straight free throws in the extra period before missing the 
back end of a one-and-one with 1:50 left that would have tied the score at 
63-63. 
Haugen scored on St. Mary's next possession, and Lewis' free throws sealed the 
outcome. 
U. San Diego 53, Portland 31 -- Danny Means scored 12 points to pace the 
Toreros (7-18, 2-11) to the win at Portland, Ore. 
Portland, which shot just 22% from the floor, is 2-24 and 2-11.
