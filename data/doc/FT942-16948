FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom holds up but
sees profits falling
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, yesterday confirmed his
forecast of a fall of between 10 and 20 per cent in net profits this year,
but said he was very optimistic for the medium and long term.
Announcing stable net profits of FFr7.06bn (Dollars 1.21bn) for 1993, Mr
Suard said that the French energy, telecommunications and transport group
had the necessary technological and international strength to resume profits
growth, although the timing of recovery would be determined by economic
conditions in its principal European markets.
'We are seeing the first encouraging signs arising from our technological
efforts,' said Mr Suard.
The Alcatel chairman said he was confident that a FFr15bn contract to supply
high-speed trains to South Korea would be finalised shortly. The group is
also expected to regain control of Framatome, the state-owned nuclear power
station group which is in the process of privatisation.
For 1994, however, Mr Suard forecast a difficult year.
Mr Suard described the 1993 performance as 'very favourable given the
economic environment.' Net debts were reduced to FFr7.25bn from FFr20.52bn,
largely as a result of cash flow of FFr16.61bn.
Sales during the year slipped to FFr156.33bn from FFr161.68bn. Europe
remained the biggest market, accounting for 72 per cent of sales, while Asia
accounted for 11 per cent of turnover. All of the group's divisions suffered
a decline in sales, with the exception of the batteries division.
Operating profits also declined in most activities, falling from FFr9.5bn to
FFr8.37bn in the telecommunications division and from FFr2.67bn to FFr2.25bn
in the cable operations. GEC-Alsthom, however, the transport and engineering
company which is jointly owned with GEC of the UK, raised operating profits
from FFr3.58bn to FFr4.17bn.
Net income was also constrained by a FFr2.5bn restructuring charge, compared
with a FFr3.2bn charge taken in 1992. Mr Suard said that the board was
proposing an increased dividend of FFr15 per share, compared with FFr14.50
for 1992.
