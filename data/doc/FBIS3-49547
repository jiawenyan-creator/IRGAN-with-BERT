<F P=106> [Article by (sim) and CTK: "The Slovaks Have Repaid Their </F>
Dollar Debt"] 
  [Text] Prague--By repaying $40 million yesterday, Slovakia 
settled the debt it incurred in mutual trade with the Czech 
Republic when it overdrew its permitted credit margin. However, 
Slovakia is still some 4.5 billion korunas in debt in the mutual 
clearing account and, at the moment, is again exceeding the 
agreed margin. "This tendency is continuing in January; Slovakia 
is again drawing above the credit margin," said Ota Kaftan, of 
the Czech National Bank [CNB]. Despite these problems, the 
clearing method of settling accounts in mutual trade is 
maintainable for the foreseeable future, and the CNB is taking 
this into consideration.
