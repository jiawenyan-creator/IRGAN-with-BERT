FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Haynes Publishing shows 40% rise
Mr Max Pearce, chief executive of Haynes Publishing Group, said that the
company's profits for the six months to November 30 marked the
near-completion of the turnaround in its fortunes following a difficult few
years.
Pre-tax profits of the publisher of car and motorcycle maintenance manuals
advanced 40 per cent from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2.11m pre-tax on turnover
up 12 per cent at Pounds 12.4m, against Pounds 11.1m. Earnings per share
rose from a restated 5.9p to 8.1p and the directors declared an interim
dividend of 4p (2.3p restated for November's 1-for-2 scrip).
The improved profits performance derived equally from UK and US operations.
The UK trading companies saw operating profits rise 34 per cent to Pounds
1.11m on turnover up just 2 per cent to Pounds 6.47m. Mr Pearce said
substantial efficiency gains and continuing retrenchment in lossmaking
general publishing activities had helped profitability. In the past three
years the company's payroll has fallen by a third to 200.
US sales continued to grow and, at Pounds 5.94m (Pounds 4.77m), now account
for nearly half the company's total. Higher turnover represented both
improved trading conditions and continuing gains in market share. US
operating profits - at Pounds 1.61m (Pounds 1.23m) - rose 13 per cent in
dollar terms but were 30 per cent higher when measured in sterling owing to
favourable exchange rate movements. Mr Pearce said that the completion in
November of a new printing facility would yield further advances in the US.
The company's cash position also improved sharply. Borrowings were
eliminated in August, having peaked at Pounds 5.2m in December 1990. By
November 30 the company had Pounds 2.4m on deposit.
Mr John Haynes, chairman, said the company's fortunes were closely linked to
new car sales, and the recent upturn in the US and UK would further assist
recovery. The shares closed down 8p at 490p.
