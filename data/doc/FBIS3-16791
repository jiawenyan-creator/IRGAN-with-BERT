  [Text] Saturday night the residence of Chechen President 
Dzokhar Dudayev came under fire. A spokesman for the law and 
order authorities has declined comment. Forces protecting the 
president's palace in Groznyy have, nonetheless, told an IF 
correspondent that around 22:00 a seeker head rocket was fired 
on the palace. There were no casualties, although several 9th 
story windows were broken and the roof's eaves suffered damage. 
Dudayev had by that time left the palace. 
  The republic's Security Department has opened a legal 
inquiry 
into what it sees as a terrorist act.
