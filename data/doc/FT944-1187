FT  21 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ apple growers have bumper
year in spite of storms
The New Zealand apple industry overcame severe storm damage and intense
competition from rival producers to earn NZDollars 603m (Pounds 247m) from
its fresh fruit and commercial activities in the year to September 30, one
of the best returns on record.
A year earlier, returns were hit by a global glut of fruit, and profits fell
to NZDollars 571m.
Mr John McCliskie, chairman of the Apple and Pear Board, said that pipfruit
export payments to orchardists averaged NZDollars 16.70 a carton, a 54 per
cent increase on the 1993 year.
The board exported 11.6m cartons of fruit to 60 countries, worth NZDollars
455m.
New Zealand was the first country apart from South Korea to break into the
Japanese market. Other new markets were Northern China, Vietnam, Somalia and
Sri Lanka. Premium prices were obtained in a number of markets including the
UK where prices were 29 per cent higher than the market average.
