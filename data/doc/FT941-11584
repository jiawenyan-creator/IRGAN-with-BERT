FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Jump in profits at Electrolux
Electrolux, the Swedish white goods manufacturer, saw its shares rise by 7
per cent yesterday after it doubled profits in the fourth quarter of 1993.
The advance reflected strong demand in north America, an improvement in
Europe, and the benefits of a group restructuring programme.
Profit after financial items rose to SKr589m (Dollars 75m) in the fourth
quarter from SKr280m in the same 1992 period, taking profits for the full
year to SKr1.55bn, up 53 per cent.
The group is maintaining its dividend at SKr6.25 per share. Last year the
pay-out was halved from SKr12.50.
The weak Swedish krona and cost-cutting helped the group compensate for
falling demand in key European markets.
Double-digit growth in all business areas pushed full-year sales up 24 per
cent to SKr100.1bn. Excluding currency effects, sales were only 4 per cent
higher. The group said demand fell by between 3 and 6 per cent in Europe
last year, but it noted higher demand for its products in north America.
Household appliances, Electrolux's biggest division, was the only unit to
report lower operating income. This is partly because the group took a
SKr250m restructuring provision in the final quarter and partly because
problems in North America and Spain wiped SKr500m off operating profits
early in the year.
By contrast, the group saw a strong improvement in operating income in its
outdoor products and industrial products divisions, and some improvement for
commercial appliances. All four divisions reported increased income in the
fourth quarter.
