  [Text] Guangzhou, 15 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--On 3 
March, personnel of the Jiazi Town Public Security Department in 
Lufeng County, Guangdong Province, impounded 10 barges 
manufactured in a local port, thus crushing some smugglers' 
attempt to carry out smuggling on barges. 
  Jiazi Town is located in the southeastern coast of Lufeng 
County, bordering on Hong Kong and Macao. During this year's 
Spring Festival, some smugglers, taking advantage of the festive 
occasion, covertly employed some workers from outside the 
province to manufacture barges in an attempt to "enliven" the 
already-halted smuggling activities. Upon receipt of crime 
reports by some people, the town antismuggling group immediately 
organized personnel, and on 27 February it impounded 10 barges 
being manufactured in the local port and arrested 18 law 
breakers involved in manufacturing the barges. Now this case is 
under further investigation.
