FT  09 NOV 92 / People: New finance director for L&amp;M
London &amp; Manchester, the Exeter-based life insurance company recently fined
Pounds 80,000 by Lautro for breaches of sales regulations, has appointed a
new group finance director.
The job will entail having to cope with many changes over the next few
years.
Martin Jackson, 44, the new incumbent, is a chartered accountant who has
been with L&amp;M for the past four years. His work as an accountant took him
from Peat Marwick, where he worked for nine years from 1971 to 1980, to
Touche Ross.
Then he had rather more exotic work in internal audit in the Gulf for the
Emirates International Bank and advising the government of the Sultanate of
Oman.
The stresses and strains currently afflicting the UK's life industry should
give him plenty more work in the years ahead.
Apart from the current controversy over how the industry should be
regulated, Jackson also points to the introduction of accruals accounting,
announced this week by the Prudential, and to the criticism the industry has
received for high front-end charges on its products.
He said: 'Inevitably as a public quoted company we are bound to go the
accruals accounting route in the next few years, unless it fails miserably
with the companies which do introduce it.' The question of when L&amp;M times
its move, however, could be much more complicated.
On the broader problems for the industry, he believes that L&amp;M should not
keep its 'head in the sand', but stand up and be counted. He also believes
that technological advances, and the use of computers in the field, could
engineer a lot of change for the industry.
