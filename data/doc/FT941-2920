FT  18 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malaysia - EU should unite against
threat (2)
Sir, Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad's letter did Britain a service in challenging
the public to stop buying papers which pander to our belief in our own
self-righteousness and subtly appealing to xenophobia. His brilliant letter
also deflected attention from a more serious matter.
Good government must create, operate within and uphold a framework of
justice, a constraint which the press does not share. Penalising UK
companies for the perceived sins of the London press is manifestly unjust,
and does much greater damage to the reputation of Malaysia than The Sunday
Times could ever achieve.
Dr Mahathir is a weighty word-smith. By all means take on our paper tigers
in a war of words, but the injustice done to UK industry will prove a
double-edged sword.
