  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin signed a decree on Friday lifting certain limitations 
earlier imposed by him on the activities of foreign banks in 
Russia. 
  Yeltsin made the announcement at a press conference on 
Friday 
admitting that the decree would cause sharp criticisms of 
Russian bankers who fear foreign banking giants can swallow them 
up. 
  He did not provide any details, but said it is necessary to 
ensure a gradual access of foreign banks to Russia in order to 
stimulate the necessary competition. 
  It is no longer possible to tolerate the 185 per cent 
discount rate offered by Russian banks, according to the 
president, who added that the presence of foreign banks would 
bring the rate down.
