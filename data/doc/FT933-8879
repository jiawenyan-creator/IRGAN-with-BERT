FT  13 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Romaero to make parts for Boeing
ROMAERO, a state-owned Romanian group, has signed a letter of intent with
Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, to produce parts for both the Boeing
737 and the new 777 model, a 600-seater, twin-jet aircraft, Romaero said
yesterday, Virginia Marsh writes from Bucharest.
Romaero said the two companies were still discussing what would be produced
in Romania but they hoped to conclude a Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) contract for
manufacturing parts up to sub-assembly shortly.
Romaero also said it hoped to continue talks with British Aerospace over the
modernisation of the BAC 1-11 jet next month. The company has produced BAC
1-11s under licence since 1982 but the agreement was frozen last month by
BAe due to non-payment of some Dollars 10m in technical assistance and
licensing fees from the Romanians.
Romaero said it was trying to raise financing from US banks on the basis
that it had an order worth Dollars 250m for 11 upgraded BAC 1-11s from Kiwi
International, a new US airline.
