FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (4):
Scottish 'Higher' system offers students greater flexibility than English
A-levels
The Scottish examination system differs radically from the one used south of
the border.
At 16, Scottish pupils usually take Standard grade exams, rather than the
GCSEs offered in England and Wales. Studies in the Scots' fifth and sixth
years  - lower and upper sixth in England  - offer more variety than
A-levels.
Usually, public exams are taken at the end of both years. In either year,
pupils can take Scottish Certificate of Education Higher Grade exams
('Highers'). Typically, pupils will attempt four or five subjects in the
fifth year, which will form the backbone of their university applications.
It is also possible to attempt Highers over two years, taking them in the
sixth year, or to take extra subjects in that year. Alternatively, students
can take the Scottish Certificate of Sixth Year Studies, more specialised
and intended as a bridge to higher education  - figures for this
qualification are not included here.
Finally, several institutions  - mostly boarding schools  - offer A-levels
and Scottish qualifications.
For each qualification, a school is excluded from the table if it has made
fewer than 10 entries. In each case, we print the number of entries made,
and the number resulting in the top A- and B-grades.
