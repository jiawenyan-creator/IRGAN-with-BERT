Occidental Petroleum Corp. has had offers to buy its Libyan oil interests, but 
Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Kadafi, has urged the company not to sell out, 
Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer said. "We have had offers to buy our position 
in Libya -- real good offers," Hammer told securities analysts at a meeting in 
New York. But "Kadafi said, 'Please don't leave,' and he offered us better 
terms if we stayed," Hammer said. Together with Du Pont's Conoco Inc., USX 
Corp.'s Marathon Oil Co., W. R. Grace &amp; Co. and Amerada Hess Corp., 
Occidental owns a 49% stake in Libyan National Oil Co. Hammer also said the 
company's 1988 earnings, which are expected to be reported later this week, 
would be up sharply from the $240 million recorded in 1987. Hammer also 
disclosed that relatives of the 167 victims of July's explosion of a company 
oil rig in the North Sea have been offered a total of $187 million in 
compensation payment and added that he believed most of the families would 
accept them.
