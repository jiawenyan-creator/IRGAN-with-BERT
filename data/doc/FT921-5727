FT  03 MAR 92 / Most customers find water metering satisfactory in trials
NEARLY three quarters of customers interviewed in a survey of water metering
trials throughout England have said that metering is a satisfactory method
of paying for water.
The survey covered 1,031 customers of the 57,000 households involved in
national metering trials in 12 areas over the past three years. It was
conducted by WS Atkins, the firm of management consultants, for Ofwat, the
industry's economic regulator.
Water companies need to adopt a new method of charging by the end of the
decade as the present method based on rateable values must cease by then.
Alternatives are a flat-rate licence fee or a charge based on the banding of
property by size or value.
The survey found that most customers were broadly satisfied with the way in
which the trials had been carried out. But there were some aspects they felt
could be improved, including meter location and installation.
Four out of five were satisfied with the location but would have preferred
some choice and a chance to discuss positioning with the water company.
Almost one in five households had experienced a problem with meter
operation.
One in seven households was critical of the way installation or
reinstatement work was done.
The main criticisms involved poor workmanship, delays in finishing the work
and inadequate tidying up.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said: 'The survey has enabled me to
develop a better understanding of the viewpoint of customers who are
experiencing metering.
'The information will help me assess the water companies' detailed proposals
on arrangements for metering, including optional metering.'
