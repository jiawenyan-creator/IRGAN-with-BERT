FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Asarco joins Coeur in silver
mines venture
Asarco, the US mines group, and Coeur d'Alene Mines, the second-largest US
silver producer, are forming a new company, Silver Resources, Reuter reports
from New York.
The new venture will consist of the fully developed Coeur and Galena silver
mines near Wallace, Idaho, as well as the adjoining Caladay, an advanced
silver exploration property.
Asarco and Coeur will each hold a 50 per cent interest in Silver Resources.
The Coeur and Galena mines have been on standby and have not been operating
during the past three years because of low silver prices. Historically, the
two mines have produced more than 160m total ounces of silver.
Asarco has been managing the Galena and Coeur properties under a lease
agreement with Coeur d'Alene.
In forming the new company, both Asarco and Coeur will contribute their
interests in the Galena and the Coeur mines, as well as other assets,
including Coeur's Caladay mine and waive certain cash flow entitlements at
the Galena Mine.
Asarco is contributing the leases it holds in the two mines as well as
buildings and adjacent properties.
Coeur d'Alene Mines will contribute ownership and lease interests in the two
mines as well as the Caladay and other adjacent properties.
