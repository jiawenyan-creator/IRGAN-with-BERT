SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery
effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States.
Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for
the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures
needed.

The Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act as amended in 1988 requires that public notice and an opportunity for
public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during the public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. Substantive technical
comments will result in changes to the plans. Substantive comments regarding recovery plan implementation may not
necessarily result in changes to the recovery plans, but will be forwarded to appropriate Federal or other entities
so that they can take these comments into account during the course of implementing recovery actions. Individualized
responses to comments will not be provided.
