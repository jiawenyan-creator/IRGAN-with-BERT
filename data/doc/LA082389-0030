CUCCIA NEEDS SCHOOL DISTRICT'S OK TO SECURE JOB AS POLY FOOTBALL COACH 
Poly High Principal Virginia Holt will hire Fred Cuccia as the school's 
football coach if he gains Los Angeles Unified School District approval as a 
teacher. Cuccia is a physical education and English teacher. 
Holt met Tuesday with Cuccia, who was recommended for the job by George 
Tideback, the school's athletic director. Tideback said that district approval 
in this case was merely a formality. 
Cuccia, 44, formerly coached at La Puente, Hoover and South Pasadena highs 
before moving north last year to coach California High in Sam Ramon for one 
season. 
Kevin Kennedy, Poly's coach for three years, resigned last week to become an 
assistant coach at L. A. Southwest College.
