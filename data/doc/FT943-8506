FT  17 AUG 94 / Brussels denies claim on disabled workers
A fresh row over the UK's priority supplier scheme to help disabled workers
blew up between London and Brussels yesterday after the European Commission
denied British claims that it had questioned the legality of the scheme last
week.
British officials said on Monday that Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry
commissioner, had written to Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to inform
the UK government that the Commission was investigating the legality of the
scheme.
The disclosure was intended to undermine claims by the Commission that it
was unaware of legal problems caused by an EU directive on public
procurement which took effect in June.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, withdrew government departments
from the scheme last week, after receiving legal advice that it was
incompatible with the directive.
Commission officials conceded that Mr Bangemann had written to Mr Hurd, but
denied that the letter was connected to the furore over the priority scheme,
which allows companies employing mainly disabled workers a chance to make a
second bid for government contracts to match the winning tender.
The letter 'has nothing to do with this case,' the Commission said.
However, the Foreign Office said Mr Bangemann had specifically confirmed the
Commission's doubts about the legality of the scheme.
The letter, signed by Mr Bangemann on Friday, is mainly concerned with the
Commission's dismissal of a complaint under EU competition legislation
against a company which lost a government contract to Remploy, one of the
biggest employers of disabled workers.
But it continues: 'The Commission would draw your attention to the fact that
this decision does not prejudice its position regarding the priority
supplier status granted to Remploy by the UK authorities, which it is
currently examining to establish whether it is compatible with the rules
relating to public procurement.'
