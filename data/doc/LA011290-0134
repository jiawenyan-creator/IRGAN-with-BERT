2 GROUPS RIP CABLE ROLE FOR PHONE FIRMS 
Allowing local phone companies to provide cable television and computerized 
information services could stifle development of the unfolding information age 
while depriving low-income, disabled, elderly and rural customers of services 
they need, a coalition of consumer groups argued Thursday. 
A report prepared for the Consumer Federation of America and the American Assn. 
of Retired Persons disputes phone company arguments that federal rules and 
regulations should be eased to let them become the single electronic doorway 
into households -- carrying not only conversations and computer data but new 
video information services and cable television as well. 
The report marks an opening shot in what many observers believe will develop 
into a major political and consumer battle. The seven regional Bell telephone 
companies, which include San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, are prodding 
Congress to free them from restrictions of the agreement that broke up the old 
Bell System and from strictures in the 1984 Cable Act that prevent them from 
owning cable TV systems. 
Congress is expected to consider removing the restrictions this year. 
But the consumer report argues against "centralizing" information power in 
huge, computerized switches owned by local phone companies instead of 
maintaining a "decentralized" system in which they serve as conduits for phone 
and computer services. The report claimed that a centralized, single-wire 
system would inflate, not reduce, costs; stifle entrepreneurial innovation, and 
benefit chiefly those best able to pay higher prices. One result would be to 
create information "have-nots," including low-income people, the elderly and 
rural residents, the report claimed. 
A Bell Atlantic spokesman disputed the validity of the report's "either-or" 
depiction.
