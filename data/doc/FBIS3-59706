<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The fuel cell is a highly efficient and clean power 
generation technology which does not cause any environmental 
problems such as SOx and NOx emissions, noise or hot drained 
water. Therefore, Japan is greatly interested in the development 
and practical use of this technology. In Japan, a fuel cell R/D 
national project was started in 1981 sponsored by the Agency of 
Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI). And from 1991, a new 
field-test project as well as a demonstration project for 
promoting PAFC systems was started sponsored by the Agency of 
National Resources and Energy (ANRE) of MITI. 
  NEDO, a semi-governmental organization founded in 1980 to 
promote national R/D projects on oil-alternative energy 
technology, has managed Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC), Molten 
Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC), Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and 
Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) type of projects. 
<H5>  1. PAFC Project </H5>
  The timetable of NEDO's PAFC projects is shown in Figure 1. 



<H5>  1.1 R/D Project </H5>
  NEDO completed the R/D activities on PAFC under the AIST 
project. In this project, 1MW pressurized type plants for power 
utility use and 200kW atmospheric pressure type plants for 
on-site use were developed in fiscal 1990. 
<H5>  1.2 Demonstration Project </H5>
  After the success of the PAFC R/D projects under AIST, NEDO 
started a new demonstration projects for promoting the 
commercialization of PAFC in 1991 under the ANRE. In this 
project, a 5MW pressurized type plant in power utility and a 1MW 
atmospheric pressure type in the commercial sector are to be 
developed and demonstrated by fiscal 1996. 
<H5>  5MW Plant Project </H5>
  The target of this project is to develop a 5MW pressurized 
plant with net generation efficiency of more than 42&percnt; 
(HHV). 
Through the priority of system design is to get as highly 
generation efficiency as possible. Other targets are hot steam 
of about 170&deg;C and hot water of about 80&deg;C to be 
recovered and utilized near the site, and high temperature off 
gas to be utilized for a gas turbine generator. 
  The plant will be fabricated by Fuji Electric Co. Ltd. and 
installed at Amagasaki Technoland of Kansai Electric Power 
Company in the end of fiscal 1993. 
<H5>  1MW Plant Project </H5>
  The target of this project is to develop a 1MW unpressurized 
plant to supply steam with the temperature level of 170&deg;C as 
well as electric power. This system's priorities are recovered 
steam utilized as a heat source of double effect absorption type 
of a chiller for an air conditioner, and compactness. 
  The plant will be fabricated by Toshiba Corporation and 
installed at the Tokyo Gas Company in fiscal 1994. 
<H5>  1.3 Field Test Project </H5>
  Fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1994, install PAFC systems project is 
started for acquired operation and maintenance records of the 
system. 
  The cost is shared between NEDO and participants of the 
project such as hotels, restaurants, offices and so on. 
  A capacity ranging 50-500kW of about 15 PAFC systems are 
operated and 15 systems will be operated in this project. 
<H5>  2. MCFC Project </H5>
  MCFC project started in fiscal 1981 under the AIST project, 
and NEDO has been its main implementing agency of the project 
since fiscal 1984. At present, 100kW class stacks by external 
reforming type of cells are developed and assessed by fiscal 
1993. Then, the fabrication of a 1,000kW pilot plant will 
immediately start and operation tests will be completed by 
fiscal 1997. 
  The timetable of NEDO's MCFC projects is shown in Figure 2. 



<H5>  2.1 R/D for Large Capacity Cell Stack </H5>
<H5>  Multiple Type of Cell and Stack </H5>
  The multiple large capacity type of cell has an almost 
square 
1.2m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  total effective electrode area consisting of 4 
small unit cells with internal manifolds and cross gas flow. The 
stack was fabricated by Hitachi Ltd. 
  In fiscal 1990, a 25kW stack with 22 cells was developed. 
The 
stack has been tested 5,700 hours under pressurized conditions. 
  After the above mentioned results, a 100kW stack consisting 
of two 50kW class modules with 44 cells and an intermediate gas 
header was fabricated. From April of 1993, the stack was 
installed and tested at Akagi Stack and System Square (ASSS), 
which was opened in autumn of 1990 to perform the demonstration 
test on stacks as well as peripheral equipment development by 
this project. The results of maximum power of this test is 113kW. 
  In addition to this work, the research for high performance 
and long life are being performed. And endurance tests of 
lab-scale single cell test were started at the Government 
Industrial Research Institute, Osaka (GIRIO) where target 
operation time is more than 15,000 hours. 
<H5>  Rectangular Type of Cell and Stack </H5>
  The rectangular large capacity type of cell has 560mm x 
1800mm of almost 1m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  total effective electrode area 
with internal manifolds and parallel gas flow. The stack was 
fabricated by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. 
(IHI). 
  In fiscal 1991, a 50kW stack with 50 cells was developed. 
The 
stack has been tested for more than 2,500 hours under 
pressurized conditions. 
  After the above mentioned results, a 100kW stack with 102 
cells was fabricated. From August of 1993, the stack was 
installed and tested at ASSS. The results of maximum power of 
this test is 129kW. 
  In addition to this work, the research for high performance 
and long life are being performed. And endurance tests of 
lab-scale single cell test were also started at GIRIO. 
<H5>  Internal Reforming Type of Cell and Stack </H5>
  An internal reforming type of cell is a cell which generates 
electricity by effectively using heat and steam generated 
through cell reaction and by reforming fuel such as natural gas 
inside the cell. 
  In fiscal 1989, a 5kW stack with 10 cells, each cell's 
effective electrode area is 5000cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  was developed. 
The stack has been tested for more than 10,000 hours under 
atmospheric pressure of stack conditions. The stack was 
fabricated by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MEC). 
  After the above mentioned results, a 30kW stack with 57 
cells 
was fabricated. From July of 1993, the stack was installed and 
tested at MEC. The results of maximum power of this test is 33kW. 
  In addition to this work, the research for high performance 
and long life are being performed. Endurance tests of lab-scale 
single cell test were also started at GIRIO. 
<H5>  2.2 Development of Balance of Plant Technology </H5>
  The development of BOP technology use for the 1MW class 
pilot 
plant is being researched and developed at ASSS by dividing the 
overall plant except the fuel cell stack into the following 
subsystem. 
<H5>  Control Subsystem </H5>
  For the study of control technology, a dummy stack plant 
consisting of actual peripheral equipment with the same system 
configuration as a 1000kW pilot plant was developed and 
installed at ASSS. With this model plant, start-up and shut-down 
tests, dynamic response tests, load following tests, minimum 
load tests and so on were demonstrated. 
<H5>  Stack Peripheral Subsystem </H5>
  Instrumentation and control technology for recycling and 
reutilization of exhaust fuel gas and air are studied to operate 
the power plant effectively and stably. The equipment for 
recycling such as an MC scrubber and high temperature blower and 
others is also developed. 
<H5>  Fuel Processing Subsystem </H5>
  A heat exchange type and a two-state catalytic combustion 
type reformer are developed to effectively obtain hydrogen gas 
of good quality even from the combustion flow-caloric exhaust 
gas.
