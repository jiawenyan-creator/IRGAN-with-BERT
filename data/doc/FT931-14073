FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak to shed 2,000
workers
EASTMAN KODAK, the photographic products company which has recently unveiled
steps to improve its lacklustre earnings record, yesterday announced further
action in its core imaging business which will lead to the loss of some
2,000 jobs.
Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said this was part of a plan for the group's
three business groups - imaging, health and chemicals - which was designed
to deliver 'positive cash flow and a solid increase in operating income' in
1993.
The most urgent action would be in imaging, where 1992 operating earnings
would fall short of plan, and would include cancellation of some research
and development projects; a reduction in infrastructure costs; and scrutiny
of capital spending.
Equipment manufacturing operations in Germany would be consolidated and the
company would study its manufacturing sides around its headquarters.
The job cuts will be concentrated in Rochester and will be largely
compulsory. The company employs 133,000 people worldwide, of whom around
77,000 are in the US.
Mr Whitmore said the costs associated with the job cuts would be more than
made up by the end of this year, and the overall programme would lower net
costs by more than Dollars 200m in 1993.
In a letter to shareholders, he said 1992 earnings per share were expected
to show a moderate increase over 1991, with restructuring charges removed
from both years, and cash-flow would be strongly positive.
However, earnings would be helped by one-time gains from asset sales and 'on
an operating basis, our performance in 1992 was not satisfactory.'
