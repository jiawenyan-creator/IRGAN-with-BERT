FT  01 SEP 93 / Silicon in water may cut senility
INCREASING ONE'S intake of silicon could be influential in preventing
Alzheimer's disease, according to Professor Derek Birchall, professor of
inorganic chemistry at Keele University.
He said it had been suggested that water which was high in silicon could
prevent the absorption of aluminium through the stomach and intestines, and
recent tests had confirmed that blood plasma levels of the metal - which is
linked to Alzheimer's - were reduced by silicon's presence.
If aluminium's link with Alzheimer's was confirmed, water would need to be
treated to raise silicon levels, he added.
