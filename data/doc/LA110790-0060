VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
HOMELESS SHELTER LOSES U.S. FUNDS 
About 40 people from Zoe Christian Center protested the County Board of 
Supervisors' decision Tuesday to withdraw $75,000 in federal funds earmarked 
for the homeless shelter. 
The staff and the homeless men, women and children from the Oxnard center 
staged a silent protest after the decision. They stood in the hearing room for 
less than an hour while the supervisors conducted other business. 
The financially plagued center was in line for $75,000 in Community Development 
Block Grant funds to help pay for and renovate the women's shelter at 104 N. 
Hayes St. 
However, just before the deal was finalized, county officials learned that 
there were two liens totaling $118,000 on the property. Because of the liens, 
the federal funds were withdrawn. 
"At the last minute we found out the county was not going to do it," said the 
Rev. Jim Gilmer, executive director of the center. "We were depending on it." 
Gilmer said in a letter to county officials that one of the liens has been paid 
off and the other, filed by the Internal Revenue Service, is being taken care 
of. 
"I really feel that if county staff would have worked more closely with us on 
this matter that the project could have been completed," he said. Now the 
property is in foreclosure and the center must get a loan to replace the money 
that was withdrawn, he said. 
Marty Shaw-Halloway, manager of special projects for the county, said the liens 
made it imprudent to give the money to the center because of the possibility 
the property could be taken over by creditors. The liens plus the mortgage 
equal more than the value of the property, she said. 
"I feel badly for Zoe. We all do," she said. 
The center, which opened 15 years ago, provides shelter and counseling for 
about 150 people a day. In 1986, the women's shelter opened with space for 15.
