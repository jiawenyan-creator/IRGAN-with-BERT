  [Text] Shenyang, June 17 (XINHUA) -- An export commodity 
trade fair will be held from July 1 to 10 in Dalian, a coastal 
open city in north-east China's Liaoning Province. 
  More than 3,000 overseas business people from over 50 
countries and regions are expected to take part in the fair 
where a vast range of export commodities will be on display. 
  Jointly sponsored by eight north-eastern provinces and 
cities, including Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces and 
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the fair will be the 
biggest of the sort staged so far in China, according to an 
official leading the Liaoning trade delegation. 
  The three provinces in northeast China and the Inner 
Mongolia 
have jointly staged seven such fairs since 1987, with a total 
trade volume of about 3.3 billion U.S. dollars and cooperative 
projects signed worth about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Commodities to be on show include products of grain and 
edible oil, hardware, minerals, garments, textiles, special 
local products, arts and crafts, machinery, electronics, autos, 
medical and health equipment, and non-metal products. 
  Products from many foreign-funded joint ventures will also 
be 
on display. 
  A large number of projects in energy resources, transport 
and 
traffic, telecommunications, real estate, business, finance and 
banking, tourism and joint development of industrial parks, will 
be ready for cooperation with overseas investors. 
  The '94 Liaoning Trade Fair for Foreign Economic and 
Technological Cooperation will be held at the same time. 
  According to a Taiwan affairs official of Liaoning 
provincial 
government, the local government will give preferential 
treatment to business people from Taiwan since they have shown 
special interests in investment in northeast China in the past 
few years.
