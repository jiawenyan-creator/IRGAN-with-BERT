THE SIDELINES; 
RAIN POSTPONES INSURANCE OPEN 
P. H. Horgan III, who shot a 6-under par 66 before rain postponed Thursday's 
first round of the Independent Insurance Agent Open, retained his lead today 
after the second round was postponed until Saturday because of rain and 
lightning. 
The tournament was cut to 54 holes, lopping off one round. PGA Tournament 
Director Mike Shea said 15 players still had not completed the first round when 
play stopped and would try to finish later today. 
Horgan led a group of seven players who were one shot off the pace with 5-under 
par 67s over the par 72, 7,042-yard course.
