  [Text] The national institutions in Gaza Strip today urged 
citizens to hand over their weapons to the Palestinian National 
Authority. In a statement, the national institutions have urged 
anyone with weapons in their possession to hand them over to the 
Palestinian authority in order to safeguard the Palestinian 
people's higher interests, to consecrate the principle of the 
rule of law, to make citizens feel safe and secure, and to 
prevent the use of such weapons by the sons of the people for 
the sake of the people's national unity.
