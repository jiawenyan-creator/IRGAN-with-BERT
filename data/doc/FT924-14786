FT  08 OCT 92 / Companies urged on community
COMPANIES need to develop new measures to assess their ability to meet and
manage demands of all 'stakeholders' or those affected by their operations,
a conference of the Royal Society of Arts in London was told yesterday.
A series of speakers stressed the importance of measures assessing the
satisfaction of customers, suppliers, employees and the wider community as
well as shareholders.
They were addressing a seminar which is part of the RSA's three-year
research project into the role of business in a changing world. This is
designed to lead to a 'scoreboard' of measures which could be included in
companies' annual reports in the future.
Mr Roger Stubbs, deputy managing director of market research company Mori,
revealed a poll showing that 80 per cent of the public and 42 per cent of
analysts believe British companies do not pay enough attention to their
treatment of the environ-ment.
Protection of the environment is seen as the most important corporate social
responsibility by institutional investors, followed by employee welfare,
employee rewards and service to the community.
