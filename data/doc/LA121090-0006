ANTI-SEMITISM IN POLAND 
Piotr Pacewicz writes in "The 'Other Poland' Votes for a Miracle" (Opinion, 
Dec. 2) that Polish television "gave equal free time for all candidates' 
campaigns." Imagine what would have happened here in the United States November 
if we had such a democracy! In our "free elections" the media are available 
only to those candidates with enough money to buy them.
