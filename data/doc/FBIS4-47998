  [Text] Durban May 6 SAPA -- The defeated African National 
Congress premier candidate for KwaZulu/Natal on Friday [6 May] 
said while he considered elections in his province fraudulent, 
the "judge's decision is final". Interviewed at Durban's Louis 
Botha Airport on Friday night, Jacob Zuma said without 
irregularities in the election process his party would have won 
in KwaZulu/Natal. 
  While ANC supporters would find it difficult to accept the 
result, he thought they would in the interests of peace. 
  Mr Zuma told journalists it was time to open a new chapter 
in 
the province where people could join hands to bring about peace 
and stability. 
  He indicated he accepted Independent Electoral Commission 
Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler's announcement that the 
election in all nine provinces had been free and fair.
