FT  14 JUL 93 / Terms for panel agreed at Lloyd's
LLOYD'S OF London announced last night that lossmaking Names and their
agents had agreed terms of reference for a legal panel which is attempting
to negotiate an out-of-court settlement. The panel was set up last month.
Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - and lawyers acting
for the errors and omissions insurers, which cover agents against negligence
awards and would fund a settlement, had been at odds about the status of any
conclusions reached by the panel.
Lloyd's said that although the panel's legal evaluation would not be
binding, it would be able to make a settlement offer.
Solicitor Mr Harold Weston, who faced bankruptcy after incurring losses on
the Lloyd's market, hanged himself in despair in April, an inquest at
Hornsey, north London, heard yesterday.
A verdict of suicide was recorded on Mr Weston, 51, of Cricklewood, north
Lon-don.
