<DOCTITLE>United States v. S.C. Johnson  Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G.; Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)(h), that a proposed
Final Judgment, Stipulation, and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois at Rockford in United States v. S.C. Johnson  Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G., Civil
No. 94 C 50249, as to both defendants.
The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by entering into an agreement by which
Bayer licensed S.C. Johnson to use Cyfluthrin in household insecticides in the United States, refrained from licensing
other firms to use Cyfluthrin, and ended its own plans to compete with S.C. Johnson in the sale of household insecticides
in the United States. S.C. Johnson is the country's largest maker of household insecticides with total sales between
4560% of the market.
The proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants from entering into any agreement to allocate markets for the sale
of household insecticides, and it requires them to license others, on reasonable terms, to use or sell Cyfluthrin.
The judgment also enjoins defendants from entering into any exclusive license for any active ingredient, if the license
agreement has been disapproved by the United States, and it requires S.C. Johnson to provide the government prior
notice of any such exclusive license with any person other than Bayer.
Household insecticides are chemical products sold in a wide variety of forms (

e.g. 

aerosols, bait traps) for use by consumers to kill ants, roaches, and other insects that infest dwellings. 
Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments
and responses thereto will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Gail Kursh, Chief Professions and Intellectual Property
Section, Room 9903, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001
[(telephone: 202) 3075799)].
