FT  03 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat accord wins approval
Canada and the US yesterday agreed the terms of a one-year peace pact over
wheat trade, setting new temporary tariffs on some of Canada's wheat exports
to the US.
The agreement ends, for now, a threatened trade war. Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, and Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, said the
new tariffs were necessary to protect US farmers against a 'precipitous'
surge of Canadian durum and feed wheat imports.
Mr Kantor said there were no losers in the deal, and Canadian officials
seemed to agree that they, at least, had won the negotiations. They said the
pact still permitted the shipment of 2m tonnes of wheat to the US, which
exceeds the recent three-year annual average of Canadian wheat exports to
the US.
The new one-year tariff schedule would impose Dollars 50 per tonne tariffs
on all wheat, except durum, after 1.05m tonnes are imported. On durum wheat,
Dollars 23 per tonne tariffs will be imposed after 300,000 tonnes are
imported. That will be raised to Dollars 50 per tonne once Canadian imports
hit 450,000.
The new temporary US tariff schedule does not apply to wheat grown outside
the Canadian Wheat Board area.
