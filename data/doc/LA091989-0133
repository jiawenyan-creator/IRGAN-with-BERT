BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY 
MAI Basic Four Inc. said a partnership controlled by New York investor Bennett 
S. LeBow has completed its previously announced plan to invest $55 million in 
MAI Basic Four, a financially strapped Tustin computer maker. LeBow is chairman 
of MAI. 
Under the plan, Brooke Partners LP will give MAI $30 million in cash and will 
invest another $25 million in a new class of MAI stock with restricted voting 
rights. Additionally, Brooke has agreed to guarantee some loan payments for MAI 
through Sept. 30, 1990. 
In exchange for the investment, Brooke will get new common stock that will give 
it 54% of MAI's shares outstanding. 
MAI said that in order to allow shareholders to preserve their equity 
positions, it intends to offer non-transferable rights to purchase, on a 
pro-rated basis, 17.5 million common shares at $3.54 a share. MAI said it 
expects to hold the offering by March 30, 1990. 
MAI reported a loss of $46.2 million and a 23% decline in revenue, to $86 
million, for its third quarter ended June 30. The company attributed $25 
million of that loss to expenses related to its unsuccessful bid to acquire 
Prime Computer Inc., a Natick, Mass., firm, in a protracted takeover battle 
that ended in August. Compiled by David Olmos, Times staff writer
