  [Text] This morning, the chairman of the Jordanian state 
bank board of directors attended the opening ceremony of the 
bank's Nabulus branch, which came in the footsteps of the first 
branch opened in Ramallah some time ago. Our correspondent Moti 
Amir reports that the Bank of Jordan's [preceding three words in 
English] Nabulus branch employs 40 people, and it will trade in 
shekels, dinars, and foreign currency, under Bank of Israel 
supervision for the time being.
