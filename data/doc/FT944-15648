FT  18 OCT 94 / US and N Korea reach deal on nuclear programme
The US last night announced that it had reached a framework agreement with
North Korea to resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme which
had threatened to destabilise the Korean peninsular.
Mr Robert Gallucci, head of the US delegation at the Geneva talks, said that
subject to approval by both governments, he and Mr Kang Sok-ju, his North
Korean counterpart, would return to Geneva on Friday to sign the 'framework
document'. Mr Gallucci said he was recommending that Washington sign the
deal.
Mr Gallucci gave no details of the document's contents but said it addressed
concerns about North Korea's past, present and future nuclear activ-ities.
'It's a good agreement,' he said. It served the interests of the US, South
Korea, Japan and other countries in the region and he believed the accord
would be broadly supported.
Under an outline accord reached in August, the US offered to help North
Korea switch from graphite-moderated to light-water nuclear reactors which
produce less plutonium, and to establish diplomatic ties, provided North
Korea agreed to freeze its current nuclear programme and accept full
international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
This included inspection of two undeclared suspect nuclear waste dumps which
could provide clues on whether Pyongyang has diverted plutonium to make one
or two atomic bombs. North Korea, which denies having a nuclear weapons
programme, has so far consistently rej-ected inspection of these sites.
Other key issues in the talks, which began on September 23, included the
financing and organisation of the light-water reactor programme, what to do
about 8,000 spent fuel rods corroding in a holding pond at the Yongbyon
nuclear complex north of Pyongyang, and the resumption of high-level talks
between North and South Korea.
Mr Gallucci admitted the deal was 'fairly complex'.
