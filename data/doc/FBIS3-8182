  [Text] At the Democratic Union [UD] special congress that 
ended today, the delegates decided to merge with the Liberal 
Democratic Congress [KLD] and set up a new party. 
  The UD congress adopted several resolutions. The issue of 
strikes announced by Solidarity gave rise to controversies. In 
the end, a resolution was adopted saying that this action would 
not bring the public lasting benefits but could lead to 
destabilization of the economy. 
  In another resolution, the UD congress objected to the 
policy 
pursued by Waldemar Pawlak's government of centralizing 
administration and restricting the sovereignty of local 
self-government. 
  The congress protested against actions that strike at the 
independence of the National Broadcasting and Television 
Council. Tadeusz Mazowiecki remains leader of UD. He will 
probably also be the leader of the new group.
