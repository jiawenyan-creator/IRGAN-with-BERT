 

Economic Assessment and Certification


This proposed regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does
not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted
from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the
regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.


Collection of Information


This proposed regulation will impose no collection information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act,
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.


List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 100
