FT  04 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Washington's Japan policy under fire
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday rounded on US trade policy towards Japan, lambasting
the managed trade approach as 'misguided and dangerous' and accusing
Washington of putting the multilateral trading system at risk.
'A new outbreak of bilateral trade tensions is putting the achievements of
the Uruguay Round to the test even before they are fully operational,' he
said in remarks for delivery yesterday lunchtime at the Swedish-American
Chamber of Commerce in New York. The Uruguay Round trade accords, to be
signed by ministers next month, are due to come into force in 1995.
Mr Sutherland said 'when any country privileges the bilateral approach over
the principles of the multilateral system it runs the risk of weakening that
system and the improvements in it just painstakingly negotiated'.
The US has been pushing Japan to agree bilateral accords which would open
its markets to more foreign-made goods, with the use of numerical indicators
to check on progress. Japan, fearing these indicators could become
obligatory targets, says it will not be a party to managed trade deals.
Backing Japan's case, Mr Sutherland said managed trade was damaging for the
countries concerned - because bureaucrats were more likely to make misguided
decisions than businesses - and for the multilateral system. Agreements
could only be enforced by the threat of trade sanctions, often illegal under
Gatt.
It was also very difficult to operate quantitative numerical targets for
market share of foreign producers in a way that gave equal opportunities to
all trading partners, as required under Gatt's most-favoured-nation
principle.
Mr Sutherland said completion of the Uruguay Round showed that countries
wanted to strengthen the multilateral system. 'The top priority on the world
economic agenda' was for countries quickly to ratify the Uruguay Round.
