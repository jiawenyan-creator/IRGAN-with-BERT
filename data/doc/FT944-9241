FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Fall in loan losses obscures
poor result at Swedish bank
A big fall in loan losses enabled Svenska Handelsbanken, one of Sweden's
leading commercial banks, to boost profits to SKr3.18bn (Dollars 438m) from
SKr1.28bn in the first nine months.
However, the 148 per cent improvement obscured a poorer performance in the
bank's underlying results, in the face of weak loan demand and narrower
margins.
Its result before loan losses was down 19 per cent at SKr5.3bn, largely
because net interest income was 14 per cent lower at SKr6.45bn.
The main feature of the results was a SKr3.1bn fall in loan losses to
SKr2.14bn. The recovery in the Swedish economy on the back of lower interest
rates has led to a sharp improvement in the business climate, to the benefit
of all the country's banks.
Even so, Handelsbanken's loan losses as a percentage of total lending still
amount to 1 per cent - four times the level in the late 1980s. Mr Arne
Martensson, chief executive, believes the figure could fall to 0.5 per cent
next year.
Mr Martensson was also optimistic about underlying prospects, saying the
third quarter had shown the first clear signs of a rise in loan demand for
more than two years. He expects the momentum to be maintained following
Sweden's endorsement of EU membership in Sunday's referendum.
He said the bank had ploughed much of its surplus liquidity into bonds,
expanding its portfolio to SKr103bn from SKr64bn in the last year. 'These
funds are only being parked until loan demand rises,' he stressed.
The bank made a nine-month profit on bond trading activities, despite the
turbulence in money markets. The result, however, was much lower than a year
ago. A SKr3.5bn unrealised deficit in its bond investment portfolio has hit
the bank's equity, but not the profit and loss account.
Problem loans were SKr7.36bn at the end of September, down 41 per cent from
the last year.
