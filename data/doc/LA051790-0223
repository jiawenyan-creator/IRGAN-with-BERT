FOR THE RECORD 
Chocolate Contest -- A caption appearing in the May 3 Food section incorrectly 
named the winners of a truffle contest held during the Chocolate Weekend at Le 
Meridien in Newport Beach. According to Josseline Tamers of the hotel: "The 
confection picturing Newport Beach Marina is the work of Yvan Valentin of 
L'Orangerie in Los Angeles. The French chef received the top prize of $300 
along with Russell Armstrong of Trees restaurant in Corona del Mar, who also 
won first place for his truffle presentation."
