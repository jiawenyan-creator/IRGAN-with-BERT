FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: UPF trebles to Pounds 4.11m
Pre-tax profits almost trebled at UPF Group in the vehicle chassis
producer's first annual results since it floated in June.
The share price rose 5p to 161p yesterday as the group announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4.11m (Pounds 1.46m) for 12 months to August 31. It said
the figures were marginally ahead of directors' forecasts.
UPF floated at 108p. Its expected value was cut by a third owing to the weak
new issues market.
Operating profit rose 29 per cent to Pounds 5.45m (Pounds 4.21m) on turnover
of Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 35.3m), reflecting growth of the core 4x4 chassis
frame business.
UPF primarily supplies chassis for the Land Rover Discovery and
Vauxhall/Opel Frontera. The 4x4 market accounts for 70 per cent of turnover,
although the group also manufactures pressings for the car and domestic
appliances industries.
Mr Keith Evans, chairman, said: 'The prospects for organic growth in our
core business remain good, particularly given the continued forecast growth
of the 4x4 off-road vehicle market.'
Further sales increases are expected after BMW's acquisition of Rover, as
Land-Rover takes advantage of BMW's distribution network in Germany and
North America.
Profits were underpinned by a 51 per cent reduction in interest costs to
Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 2.75m), following debt repayments helped by the
flotation. Mr Evans said those costs would be reduced by a further Pounds 1m
this year.
Gearing stood at 33 per cent at the end of the year.
UPF was bought from the receivers to the collapsed Parkfield group in 1990,
in a Pounds 30m management buy-out. It was forced to refinance in 1992
because of bad debts and problems with a new production line.
Earnings per share increased to 12.6p (4.86p) - or 12.19p (5.96p) on a pro
forma basis - and the board proposes a final dividend of 1p.
