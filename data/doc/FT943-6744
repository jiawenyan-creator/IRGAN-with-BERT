FT  27 AUG 94 / Growth in GDP allays US concerns
The US economy grew slightly more rapidly than originally estimated in the
second quarter of this year, but not as fast as some analysts had feared.
The US Commerce Department announced an upward revision of second-quarter
real gross domestic product, the output of goods and services in the US, to
3.8 per cent, from its initial estimate of 3.7 per cent.
The increase in GDP between April and June, measured at seasonally adjusted
annualised rates, follows a 3.3 per cent rise in the first quarter of 1994
and a 6.3 per cent increase in last year's final period.
Analysts had expected an upward revision to as much as 4.2 per cent, which
would have raised concerns that the economy was growing too rapidly.
Financial markets yesterday appeared to interpret the moderate increase on
the original estimate as a sign that the Federal Reserve's pre-emptive
tightening of monetary policy to head off inflation was having the desired
effect.
The Commerce Department further damped down fears of over-heating with its
explanation that the higher growth in the second quarter was largely
attributable to a build-up in unsold business inventories, which increased
by Dollars 30.9bn. This was the biggest gain in six years.
The government also reported that after-tax profits of US corporations rose
7.4 per cent in the second quarter in a sharp reversal of the 3.5 per cent
drop in the first period of this year.
The rise in consumer spending in the second quarter was less than the
increase in the opening period.
The rate of growth in housing construction also shrank, to post a 7.3 per
cent rise in the second quarter after a 10 per cent increase in the first
three months of 1994.
