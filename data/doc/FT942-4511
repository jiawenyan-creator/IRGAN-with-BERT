FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Racal dives but bullish on outlook
Racal Electronics, the data communications, radio and network services
group, yesterday reported an expected sharp decline in full year pre-tax
profits, but promised 'a very substantial' improvement in performance this
year.
The bullish comments about the outlook prompted a 10p rise in the share
price to 248p.
Racal also announced the sale of the remainder of the Racal-Redac
computer-aided design business to Japan's Zuken for Pounds 13m in cash.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 fell by 44.7 per cent, from Pounds
47.7m to Pounds 26.4m, after Pounds 19.6m of previously disclosed losses on
the disposal or closure of operations and acquisition goodwill written off.
Earnings per share fell to 5.47p (10.24p) and a proposed final dividend of
2.75p makes an unchanged 4.25p total.
Turnover from continuing operations slipped to Pounds 887m (Pounds 908.9m)
and discontinued operations contributed a further Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 38m).
Trading profits from continuing operations declined to Pounds 50.1m (Pounds
54.3m).
Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman, said the data communications business had
been badly affected by the recession in continental Europe and by the late
availability of new products from the US operations. Data communications'
operating profits fell to Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 12.6m) on turnover of Pounds
373.8m (Pounds 370.6m).
However, Sir Ernest predicted that recent events in the division, including
the appointment of Mr Martin Richardson to take charge of the business,
would improve results.
Specifically, he forecast that in the current year the data communications
division would achieve profit margins of 'well over 5 per cent on sales of
over Pounds 400m,' and he said margins the following year should increase to
more than 7.5 per cent with further revenue growth.
'With this significantly higher profit contribution from data communications
coupled with improved performances by radio communications, specialised
businesses and defence radar and avionics, the results for the year 1994-95
will show a very substantial improvement.'
COMMENT
Once again Racal is promising jam tomorrow. Delivering on the promises
depends mostly on revitalising the core data communications business. Mr
Richardson plans to cull the product line and identified Pounds 10m of
savings. Meanwhile, the networks businesses will benefit from the National
Lottery traffic even though the real gains from being part of the Camelot
consortium will not come through until 1995-96. Racal should report pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 70m this year, equivalent to earnings of about
15.9p. After yesterday's rise the stock is trading on a prospective p/e of
15.6. Hold.
