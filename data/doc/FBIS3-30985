  [Excerpt] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman tonight 
received in the presidential palace a delegation from the 
Republic of Croatia and a delegation from the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. They held talks on the normalization of 
Croatian-Serbian relations. The Croatian delegation was led by 
Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and minister for foreign 
affairs. Zeljko Simic led the delegation from the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  The two delegations told President Tudjman of the results of 
their talks, which can be regarded as the first successful step 
toward the normalization of relations. A joint commission for 
missing persons, refugees, and displaced persons, as well as 
other humanitarian issues, was created. Liaison offices in the 
capitals of both countries will be set up soon. President 
Tudjman pointed out the need for the normalization of relations 
between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia as well as for mutual diplomatic recognition, which 
would create conditions for introducing good-neighborly 
relations and the opening up of possibilities for economic 
cooperation. 
  Despite everything that has taken place over the past few 
years, two countries that share a border cannot exist in a state 
of hostilities forever. Therefore, it is in the interest of 
both the Croatian and Serbian people that peace reigns in 
future, something that will gradually lead to the restoration of 
normal life. This is what we should aspire to by investing our 
every day efforts in this direction--sincerely and without 
second thoughts--President Tudjman said. [passage omitted]
