FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Brierley sells gas utility
holding
BRIERLEY Investments has sold its remaining 50.3 per cent shareholding in
Enerco, a New Zealand gas utility, for NZDollars 58.6m (USDollars 32.2m).
Brierley sold a 30 per cent stake for NZDollars 35.2m to a number of
institutions and is selling the remaining 20.3 per cent to Natural Gas
Corporation, the New Zealand utility, for NZDollars 23.4m.
The shares are changing hands for NZDollars 2.09, compared with a current
market price of NZDollars 2.25.
Enerco was publicly floated last year when Brierley sold a 30.4 per cent
shareholding at NZDollars 1.35 a share. A further placement of 19.2 per cent
was made this March.
Mr Paul Collins, Brierley chief executive, said the sale of Enerco shares
was in accordance with forecasts made in the Enerco flotation prospectus.
Telecom Corporation, New Zealand's biggest company, yesterday had its credit
rating downgraded to AA1 by Moody's Investment Services, the US credit
rating agency.
Moody's said the downgrading was due to Telecom's announcement earlier this
year that it intended lowering its cost of capital by reducing the number of
shares on issue and moving to a higher debt gearing ratio.
Mr Jeff White, Telecom chief financial officer, said the company's new debt
ratio of around 40 per cent would still be conservative.
Telecom is 60 per cent owned by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US.
New Zealand's Bancorp Holdings has bought Australian investment bank
International Pacific Securities, which specialises in takeover and
corporate advisory operations.
The new acquisition's operations dovetail with those of Bancorp's in the
area of treasury and financial market advisory services, Bancorp said.
Bancorp is 47 per cent-owned by Public Bank Berhad, the Malaysian investment
bank.
