  [Text] In Afghanistan in 1982 a pilot was unable to pull 
out from an attack and the Su-25 "disappeared" into the ground 
although it had not come under fire. The onboard recorder showed 
a control system jam caused by high flight speed. The attack 
aircraft usually attacks from a dive at a 35-40 degree angle, 
which takes a rather long time since it is necessary not only to 
impose the sight's center dot on the target, but also get the 
device to "calm down." Thus, if the attack is entered at a speed 
of 550-600 km/hr, the aircraft may have accelerated to 850-900 
km/hr at the end of the attack. There was not enough aileron at 
high speeds. 
  In an attack, in order to prevent the roll which arises with 
one-sided separation of a bomb (from one wing), the requirement 
was introduced for a symmetrical drop of the load in pairs from 
underwing points (simultaneously from the second and ninth 
points, third and eighth points and so on). But in Afghanistan 
every bomb was worth its weight in gold and was expended very 
economically. The dead pilot also dropped just one. He tried to 
parry the roll that arose by moving the ailerons, but at high 
speed they went to the stops because the balancing tabs operated. 
  After this crash, hydraulic boosters were placed in the 
transverse channel. Despite fears, it was learned that aircraft 
survivability essentially did not suffer: When the wing with 
booster was fired on at the range, it took 23 23-mm rounds to 
disable the hydraulic booster. 
  Boosters began to be installed on newly built series attack 
aircraft in 1984, which permitted increasing maximum permissible 
flight speed. 
  In addition, the brake flaps on wingtip pods were modified 
to 
stabilize a high-angle dive without exceeding a speed of 700 
km/hr. Additional deflectable surfaces were installed on them 
that were kinematically connected with their main surface. This 
considerably increased the effectiveness of these flaps (by 60 
percent) without increasing their area, and speed was stabilized 
at the level of 650-680 km/hr. 
  The Su-25T variant (Su-34) intended for operations against 
moving targets, above all tanks, is equipped with the I-251 
aiming system developed by the Krasnogorsk Zenit OMZ [Optical 
Equipment Plant]. According to some assessments, the system is 
5-6 years ahead of similar ones abroad. 
  The system is intended for automatic identification and 
tracking of small mobile targets (tanks, motor vehicles, small 
craft and so on), target designation, automatic missile 
guidance, and also for supporting the fire of free-flight 
rockets and the gun. The system includes the Shkval day 
opto-electronic system, which is accommodated in the aircraft 
nose and which includes a television channel with wide field of 
view (27x36 degrees), a television channel with narrow 
("needle") field of view (0.7x0.9 degrees) and 23X 
magnification, and a laser rangefinder/target designator. Shkval 
system sensors are mounted on a unified platform stabilized in 
pitch, yaw and roll and can be deflected in the range from +15 
degrees "over themselves" to -80 degrees "beneath themselves" 
and from +35 to -35 degrees in heading. The day-channel target 
acquisition and lockon range is 12 km. Its video data are sent 
to a monochromatic CRT mounted in the upper right of the cockpit 
instrument panel. 
  A basic element of the Shkval system is a target image 
tracking unit with accuracy to 0.5 m. Operation of the automatic 
telecontrol was checked by tracking the flight of birds such as 
crows, which change their flight path in a random manner, and 
the movement of real targets. High accuracy permitted selecting 
even specific areas of a tracked target for tracking. 
  In control tracking of a Tu-16 on the range, the marker was 
placed on the bomber engine area; the automatic telecontrol 
reliably "held" this image and the guided missile "stuck" 
precisely into the engine from a distance of 4 km. 
  Range tests during operations against ground targets using 
the Vikhr ATGM also produced high results: A tank turret was 
"blown off" from a distance of 10 km. 
  The Shkval system's high characteristics were confirmed in 
1989 during a tactical exercise near Lvov in which 96 pieces of 
armored equipment and 10 Tor SAM systems took part. 
  For night operations the I-251 system can be supplemented by 
the Merkuriy thermal imaging system mounted in a suspended pod 
installed on a belly station. The pod cross-section is nearly 
rectangular and its front part is closed by a cover which 
protects the optics during takeoff and landing. The television 
system has a lens with broad and narrow (5.5x7.3 degrees) fields 
of view. The night-channel optical system is not stabilized. 
Target acquisition and lockon range by the thermal imaging 
system is somewhat less than 10 km. Night-channel video data 
with narrow field of view are displayed on a monochromatic CRT 
also connected with the day television channel, and the image 
from the night channel with wide field of view is sent to the 
instrument landing system. 
  It is common knowledge that peak losses of military pilots 
fall in their first several dozen combat sorties. Only after 
flying 30-40 of them do they gain necessary experience 
permitting them to get their bearings rapidly and confidently 
and find the optimum way out of difficult situations. To help in 
adaptation, in 1987 designers developed the SAU-8, an automated 
control system for the Su-25T. It operates together with the 
aircraft aiming and navigation system, simplifies pilot actions 
to the maximum, and supports an automatic target approach with 
high accuracy. 
  The presumed target coordinates and coordinates to 12 
enroute 
waypoints are loaded into the system on the ground before 
takeoff. After the pilot takes off and presses the 
"Navigation-SAU [Automated Control System]" button, the aircraft 
proceeds in an automatic mode. The scanning mode of the 
optical-television system's narrow channel switches on in the 
presumed target area 12 km from the target. On detecting the 
target, the pilot frames the target image on the CRT and presses 
the "Fix" button. After this it is as if aircraft and target are 
linked by an invisible thread; the target is tracked 
automatically even in inverted flight and there is no break off 
even if the target has stopped or briefly entered a shadow. The 
system automatically turns the aircraft toward the target and 
launches missiles or releases bombs after the ordnance release 
button is pressed. 
  Bombing accuracy usually is 35-40 m on strike aircraft, but 
it is 2-5 m on the Su-25T. After the first pass the aircraft can 
make a repeat pass in the automatic mode at the pilot's command. 
  The pilot takes over control only just before landing. 
  Over 500 Su-25 attack aircraft had been produced by the fall 
of 1992, including over 250 delivered [to] CIS countries and the 
rest to other countries. The Su-25T is the most advanced of 
presently developed versions. It has not been placed into series 
production and prospects for its production are problematical. 
Talks have been held with 60 agents from 25 countries, but no 
specific agreements have been reached. Nevertheless, the OKB 
[Special Design Bureau] is working to perfect the aircraft. It 
is planned to increase operating altitude from 7 to 10 km and 
range by 30 percent. One potential client (Philippine Air Force) 
took an interest in a multipurpose version of the aircraft with 
an air-to-air combat capability. The OKB is studying that 
project, assuming that because of the basic Su-25 aircraft's 
high maneuver characteristics (limit load factor 6.5, unit wing 
load with normal takeoff weight 433 kg/m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; , 
thrust-to-weight ratio with normal takeoff weight 0.62), its 
multipurpose version will be able to fight on equal terms with 
many modern fighters. Demonstration flights of the "Sky Hussars" 
aerobatics team serve to confirm this. 
  The Su-25 was created with a small displacement in time 
periods relative to the U.S. A-10 attack aircraft, design 
studies on which began in 1966 (Su-25 in 1968) and the first 
flight of the first experimental aircraft was in May 1972 (Su-25 
in February 1975). U.S. and Russian designers proceeded from 
experience of the very same conflicts (Vietnam, Korea and the 
Near East), which predetermined approximately the very same 
missions (a low-altitude, subsonic, highly maneuverable, 
low-vulnerability aircraft for direct support of ground troops) 
and in a number of cases similar design solutions such as the 
armored "tub" for the pilot (which, by the way, was realized for 
the first time in the Il-2 attack aircraft) and the almost 
straight wing. But the OKB imeni P. Sukhoy took its own path in 
shaping the Su-25's appearance. Originality of appearance is 
apparent not only in the already noted fundamental 
configurational and dimensional distinctions of the Su-25 and 
A-10, but also in characteristics. The A-10, for example, has a 
lower thrust-to-weight ratio (0.54 compared with 0.62 in the 
Su-25 with normal takeoff weight), which degrades the A-10's 
maneuverability in the vertical plane. The A-10 also has less 
unit wing load (322 kg/m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  as against 433, also with 
normal takeoff weight). This indicates somewhat better 
horizontal maneuverability of the A-10, but also lesser accuracy 
of fire as a result of the aircraft's increased buffeting under 
conditions of turbulent atmosphere near the earth. The A-10's 
flight speed is substantially lower (maximum near the ground 706 
km/hr as against 950-975 for the Su-25). This has been the cause 
of serious criticism of the A-10 abroad of late, since speed is 
one element for reducing aircraft vulnerability, and with a slow 
flight speed even the A-10's increased armoring does not save it 
(overall weight of means of protection exceeds 8.5 percent of 
normal takeoff weight compared with 7.5 percent for the Su-25). 
  One more fundamental difference of the A-10 and Su-25 lies 
in 
a different approach to onboard gear and munitions to be 
expended. The Americans adopted the concept of cheap onboard 
gear and complex, expensive missiles; the pilot aims through the 
homing head of the AGM-65 Maverick missile using an instrument 
panel indicator. It is the reverse approach on the Su-25: 
Powerful onboard gear in combination with "obtuse" missiles, 
which appears considerably more rational under the 
cost-effectiveness criterion. 
  The emphasis on different kinds of weapons also is 
important. 
In developing the A-10 it was assumed that the GAU-8/A cannon 
"around" which it was designed would be the basic means of 
combating tanks, but according to the U.S. Air Force, use of 
Maverick missiles and not the cannon turned out to be more 
successful during the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Su-25 designers 
departed from the doctrine of operating against tanks with 
cannon fire back in the stage when the aircraft's appearance was 
being shaped. It was then they concluded that the cannon was 
becoming a "historical relic," for it is effective only at short 
ranges, while in a relatively high-speed jet aircraft the pilot 
already has to pull back on the stick to recover about 800 
meters from the target. This leaves him little time for aimed 
fire and it is too far for unequivocal destruction of a target 
with powerful armor. On the Su-25 the cannon is used basically 
for engaging weakly armored targets of the APC type. 
  A 45-mm cannon of nontraditional design based on a 
rocket-assisted principle with a rate of fire of 1,250 rounds 
per minute was studied for the Su-25T version. The length of the 
projectile fitted with a rocket motor was 250 mm and it had a 
shaped-charge warhead with 200 mm of armor penetration. The idea 
of employing such a cannon arose when the task was assigned to 
increase hit probability with the first pass, for a situation 
often takes shape where the target is detected too late and a 
repeat pass must be made. The rocket-assisted cannon had to be 
fired backward after passing over the target. In tests it 
succeeded in "sticking" up to 6-8 rounds into a tank, and at an 
angle up to 60 degrees, which increased armor penetration. But 
development of this cannon was suspended for reasons of a 
nontechnical nature. 
  Su-25TK armament includes Kh-29T air to surface missiles 
with 
TV [not further expanded, possibly thermal imaging] or Kh-29L 
laser-guided air to surface missiles intended for engaging 
relatively invulnerable ground targets (reinforced concrete 
shelters, concrete runways, large railroad and highway bridges). 
They are equipped with a high-explosive penetrating warhead 
weighing 320 kg. Kh-58 antiradar guided missiles also are 
mounted, and outfitting with the more powerful Kh-31P antiradar 
missile is proposed in the future. This is connected with the 
desire to improve the attack aircraft's autonomy in operations. 
In an actual combat situation it is difficult to count on 
receiving required support from interworking aircraft in time. 
Therefore, in V. P. Babak's opinion, as a front line aircraft 
the attack aircraft should be capable of "punching" a road for 
itself extending up to 150 km beyond the front line.

  The foreign press reports that the new Su-37 strike aircraft 
being designed under Babak's direction has even more difficult 
missions to perform. Its appearance is determined by the 
assigned task of ensuring full autonomy, also including the 
capability of successfully conducting defensive air-to-air 
combat against modern fighters. In addition to high combat 
survivability, it also must possess increased flight speed 
(1,400-1,500 km/hr). 
  Babak believes that advanced cluster weapons with 
individually guided submunitions intended to be launched from 
multirole aircraft at a great distance from targets do not 
represent a serious alternative to attack aircraft. In his 
opinion, there are two basic premises for successful performance 
of strike operations: First of all, the target must be visible; 
and secondly, low-powered submunitions ("peas") are not suited 
for engaging heavily armored targets--a "serious weapon" is 
needed here, which can be carried only by a battlefield aircraft 
optimized for strike operations.
