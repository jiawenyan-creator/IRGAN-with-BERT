</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is approving, with certain exceptions and additional requirements, a proposed amendment to the Utah regulatory
program and abandoned mine plan (hereinafter, the ``Utah program'' and Utah plan'') under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Utah proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act pertaining
to hearings and appeals, civil and criminal penalties, recovery of costs for reclaimed abandoned mine land, liens
against reclaimed abandoned mine lands, and certification of completion of abandoned coal mine reclamation. The
amendment is intended to incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by SMCRA, clarify ambiguities, and improve
operational efficiency.
