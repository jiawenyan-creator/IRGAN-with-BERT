FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Oriel losses at Pounds 28,000
ORIEL GROUP, the USM-quoted insurance broker, reported pre-tax losses of
Pounds 28,000 in the half year to the end of June, against profits of Pounds
1.2m.
The result was in line with expectations set out in the chairman's statement
with the 1992 report and accounts. A loss of Pounds 1.28m in the second half
left annual pre-tax losses at Pounds 74,000.
Income for the first half of 1993 was Pounds 4.65m, including Pounds 364,000
from acquisitions, against Pounds 6.66m. Towards the end of the period the
company bought Warranty Holdings and figures for three weeks are included.
Losses per share came out at 1.15p (earnings 5.27p) but the interim dividend
is maintained at 2p. Mr Nigel Cayzer, chairman, said the move reflected the
underlying profitability.
