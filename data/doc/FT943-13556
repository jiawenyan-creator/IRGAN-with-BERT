FT  19 JUL 94 / Observer: Tea interval
A recent FT report on Everton football club obviously touched a sore spot.
The item suggested the club betrayed a mean streak by not offering
shareholders even a cup of tea at its annual general meeting.
Now it's not just tea, but gin 'n T. At last week's shareholders meeting -
to discuss the club's rights issue - chairman David Marsh said the Goodison
Park bar would be open afterwards for free drinks 'as a result of adverse
publicity in the Financial Times'.
If only other bars were so easily prised open . . .
