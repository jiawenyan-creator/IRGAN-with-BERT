FT  17 NOV 93 / Insurers to crack down on fraud
INSURERS yesterday launched a computerised register of claims as part of a
crackdown on fraud which is estimated to cost the industry Pounds 400m a
year.
The Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, known as Clue, will contain
details of all individual claims. Insurers will be able to check details of
proposal forms and claims against the data.
Mr Bob Scott, an insurance executive who will chair Insurance Database
Services, the company being established to oversee the project, said: 'Clue
will deliver the knockout blow to fraudsters.
'I issue a warning now to all fraudsters and potential fraudsters - you will
be caught and insurers will encourage prosecutions and insist on restitution
of any payments made.'
Seventy insurance companies, whose annual premium income amounts to Pounds
13bn, have agreed to support the first register. It will collect household
insurance claims and will come into operation next year. The 70 include the
biggest UK composite companies.
The registers will contain information from the past three years and will
have an immediate impact, Mr Scott said. The system will help insurers to
clamp down on so-called 'multiple claims', when people claim for a single
loss on policies held with different companies.
Most insurance companies are expected to back the project, which is based on
a similar service in the US. Equifax, a leading supplier of risk assessment
and database systems, will provide technical specifications for the
database.
An opinion poll commissioned by the Association of British Insurers in the
past three days has confirmed widespread public suspicion of insurance
fraud. According to the survey, carried out by BMRB, the public believes 35
out of every 100 insurance claims are 'completely false and untrue'.
