SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2799), EPA proposed to revoke tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the herbicide alachlor (2-chloro-2',6'-diethyl-

N

-(methoxymethyl)acetanilide) and its metabolites in or on the following raw agricultural commmodities listed
in 40 CFR 180.249: Cotton forage, cottonseed, sunflower seed, pea forage, pea hay, peas with pods removed, and potatoes.



By March 1988, the product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as amended, for the pesticide products containing the herbicide alachlor were canceled for the above-mentioned
raw agricultural commodities. Based on the fact that alachlor is no longer domestically registered for use on these
food crops and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for the particular
food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.249 for residues of alachlor in or on these commodities.
Since the product registrations were canceled more than 5 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated,
domestically produced or imported commodities. These tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations.

The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances because sufficient
time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate, and EPA does not expect a residue problem due to environmental
contamination. 
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance revocation will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance revocation is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
