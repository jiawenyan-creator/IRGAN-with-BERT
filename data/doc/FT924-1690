FT  17 DEC 92 / Assembly for Bahrain
THE EMIR of Bahrain is to set up a consultative assembly to give people a
greater say in the running of the Gulf island state, Reuter reports from
Bahrain.
The Bahraini announcement is the latest move by conservative Gulf states to
involve citizens more directly in the running of their countries.
It follows similar moves by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states but falls
short of allowing a full-fledged elected parliament as Kuwait did earlier
this year.
Speaking on Bahrain's National Day, Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa said:
'Bahrain's government and people are adapting to the new era of changes,
just as they did under more difficult circumstances in the past.'
