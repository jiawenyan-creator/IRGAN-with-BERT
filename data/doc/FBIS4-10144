  [Text] The Giron-94 exercise of the Unified Vigilance and 
Protection System [SUVP], which began on 5 April in Havana City, 
is an important tool in confronting crime and antisocial 
behavior. Jorge Lezcano, first secretary of the Communist Party 
of Cuba in Havana City, underscored the preventive nature of 
these tasks which are aimed at fighting social indiscipline and 
crime. In the 15 municipalities, the provincial commission of 
the SUVP will inspect marketplaces, supermarkets, hospitals, 
childcare centers, food warehouses, cold storage centers, and 
factories to learn how theft and embezzlement are being fought 
in those centers. 
  Giron-94 will be held in Havana throughout the week and 
includes energetic actions against clandestine restaurants, 
whorehouses [candongas], and those who rent cars to foreigners 
around tourist facilities, among other illegal activities.
