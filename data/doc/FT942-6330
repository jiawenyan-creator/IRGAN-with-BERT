FT  31 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Cable TV
UK cable companies plan to return to the flotation trail when market
conditions improve. But it would be a mistake to think that better equity
prices, on their own, will do the trick. The rot started when Comcast UK
Partners failed to sell shares at even 15 per cent below the mid-point of
its initial target range.
One can argue that Comcast was foolish to seek a flotation in the US. The US
cable bubble was punctured earlier this year when regulators imposed tariff
cuts. One can also argue that the other cable companies - in particular
TeleWest - represent better investments than Comcast. They enjoy economies
of scale, have made bigger pushes into telephony and have developed their
networks faster.
Still, it will be hard to get the UK cable bandwagon rolling, even for
TeleWest. For a start, the group's financial backers will no longer be able
to tell UK investors that, if they do not pile in, the issue will snapped up
in the US. And while US regulations do not affect the UK industry directly,
it faces regulatory uncertainty of its own.
Investors are likely to be wary of valuations which seem expensive when
judged by the industry's own shorthand valuation yardstick - 'price per
home'. TeleWest's desired capitalisation of Pounds 1.7bn would have equated
to Pounds 500 for each home. Recent trade sales have occurred at much lower
prices.
The cable industry will also have to overcome suspicions of the discounted
cash flow calculations that underlie the industry's more elaborate
valuations. A comparison with Eurotunnel may be unduly pessimistic given
that cable companies are much nearer break-even than Eurotunnel was when
floated in 1987. But a comparison with Vodafone, the principal success of
the discounted cash flow method in UK flotations, goes too far in the other
direction: it was in the black when floated.
