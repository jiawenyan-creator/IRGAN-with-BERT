FT  07 APR 93 / Early start for business loan plan
THE revamped small business loan guarantee scheme will be ready this summer,
not in October as banks and civil servants have been telling potential
applicants, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday, Ian
Hamilton Fazey writes.
No firm date has been set but the DTI said the new scheme would be available
to business borrowers 'by July, and possibly earlier'.
Companies without security will be eligible to borrow up to Pounds 250,000
from participating banks or recognised small business funding bodies such as
enterprise agencies or venture funds. The present scheme's Pounds 100,000
ceiling will remain for start-ups.
The government will guarantee 85 per cent of the loan - up from 70 per cent
 -and the borrower will pay a 1.5 per cent premium for variable rate loans
or 0.5 per cent if loans are at a fixed rate.
