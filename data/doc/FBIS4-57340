  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 16 May (EFE) -- After approving a 
number of recent amendments, the Brazilian Senate today ratified 
the Tlatelolco Treaty, which proscribes the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry stated that with the 
ratification of the treaty and its amendments Brazil has 
completed a revision of its international nuclear policy, thus 
demonstrating its commitment to the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons. 
  The Tlatelolco Treaty, which was signed in Mexico City on 14 
February 1967, was designed to make Latin America the first 
region in the world to be free of nuclear weapons and to stop 
the arms race in the region. 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry added that the treaty's 
ratification "clearly demonstrates the high significance the 
country attaches to the treaty, which provides that all 
signatories are equals and have the same rights and obligations 
and requires safeguards from militarily armed countries."
