A follow-up checkup found former President Ronald Reagan in excellent condition 
after suffering slight bruises when he was thrown from a horse at a friend's 
Mexican ranch, a spokeswoman at Ft. Huachuca in Arizona said. Base spokeswoman 
Margaret Liebchen said Dr. Juan Lopez, the Army doctor who treated Reagan after 
the fall Tuesday, went by helicopter to Mexico to conduct the checkup as Reagan 
had decided to continue his vacation at friend William Wilson's ranch, where he 
planned to celebrate his wife Nancy's birthday today. Wire services had 
erroneously reported that Reagan was hurt during a hunting accident. The former 
President was injured when his horse began bucking wildly on a rocky downhill 
slope and stumbled.
