FT  25 AUG 94 / Labour attacks NHS 'lottery'
Some National Health Service trusts made annual surpluses of almost Pounds
4m in the first two years of operation, while others recorded losses of up
to Pounds 3.8m, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington, said an analysis of government figures
showed that the NHS had become 'a national lottery - producing losers as
well as winners.'
The health department said surpluses were used for patient care. It said
trusts were 'treating record numbers of patients to an ever higher quality
of care.'
