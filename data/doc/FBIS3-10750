  [Text] Guatemala City, 7 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today the 
Central American Parliament (Parlacen), asked the European Union 
(EU) to extend for an additional 10 years the special and 
temporary preferential tariffs for most products imported from 
the region. 
  The initiative was approved today by the Parlacen plenum 
presided over by Salvadoran Francisco Guerrero. Parlacen has 
representatives from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. 
  The regional political forum reported in a communique that 
the EU granted preferential access to its market to a broad 
range of Central American products, excluding bananas, but that 
the term will expire on 31 December. 
  Due to the "worrisome" situation in exports, it has been 
deemed convenient to ask the EU to renew this preferential 
treatment for 10 more years, the communique states. 
  The initiative will be passed on to regional presidents, who 
in turn will instruct their foreign and economy ministers to 
present this at the meeting of the San Jose 10, between Central 
America and Europe, slated for 28-29 March in Athens, Greece. 
  Parlacen also asked the European Parliament's support in 
obtaining more preferential tariffs.
