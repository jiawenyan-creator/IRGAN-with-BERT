FT  02 APR 94 / Workers' job anxieties reduced
Full-time and part-time workers were equally anxious in March about losing
their jobs, the latest MORI/IRS survey for the Financial Times shows.
Forty six per cent of full-time and part-time workers were either very or
fairly concerned about losing their jobs in the next 12 months.
The trend since the monthly series started last April has been for full-time
workers to be more anxious than part-time workers. Last month, however,
anxiety fell slightly among full-time workers and rose among part-timers.
Workers as a whole expressed more optimism about their job prospects.
Manual workers continue to be the most pessimistic although the percentage
of professional and senior managers who feel concern has climbed steadily.
Pessimism about job prospects increased consistently until July, since when
there has been much volatility.
Mr David Martin, editorial director of IRS, the independent research
organisation, said: 'Unemployment appears to be coming down, even though a
number of the jobs that are being created are part-time. However, at the
same time people hear from day to day of large-scale redundancies. This may
explain the volatility in terms of perceptions about job prospects.'
MORI had face-to-face interviews with 1,022 people aged 18 or more who work
full or part-time.
