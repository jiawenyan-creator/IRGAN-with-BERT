HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
ANTELOPE VALLEY REDISCOVERS TOUCH 
The Antelope Valley High boys' basketball team, a consensus preseason power and 
favorite to roll to the Golden League title, stumbled to a surprising 1-2 start 
before entering the Cerritos-Gahr tournament Wednesday. 
But with Thursday's 60-55 second-round win over La Mirada, the Antelopes (3-2) 
have won two in a row and are finally above .500. 
"We just couldn't get near the hoop in those games," Coach Skip Adams said of 
his team's start. 
Senior forward Chris Walters, who has signed to attend Texas El Paso next fall, 
scored a career-high 30 points to lead Antelope Valley. Junior Brock Chase 
chipped in a career-high 12 points off the bench.
