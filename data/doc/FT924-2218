FT  14 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Testing the gears
Last week's missive on capital instruments from the UK accounting standards
board is very much in the mould of Professor Tweedie's revolution. By making
clear distinctions between debt, equity and quasi-equity the proposed rules
will lead to a proliferation of categories on the face of the balance sheet.
The new shape of the profit and loss account has already muddied simple
measures of company performance such as earnings. The new rules will do much
the same job on gearing.
Financial engineers will doubtless feel deprived of the opportunity to dress
up debt as equity. The supply of convertible capital bonds, for example, has
notably dried up since the first tentative proposals for a tighter
definition of shareholders funds, but the investment bankers should not
protest too much. By creating a distinct home for non-equity shares on the
face of the balance sheet, the accountants may open other doors.
Companies may be encouraged to issue second tier equity instruments such as
preference shares. Banking regulators have long recognised prefs as a useful
shock-absorber if the issuer runs into trouble. Banks have duly made full
use of the opportunity. There is already evidence of interest among
insurance and oil companies. Since preference dividends are paid out ahead
of ordinary dividends, auditors are right to demand they are classified as a
separate tier. If that encourages the market to look at the economic
substance of instruments - rather than bald balance sheet ratios - so much
the better.
