  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 09, BNS -- 40 members of the ruling 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction have signed a petition 
demanding the resignation of Lithuanian Forestry Minister 
Gintautas Kovalcikas. 
  The campaign began earlier this year when ruling faction 
member Benas Rupeika alleged that the minister has relatives in 
some private timber export companies, which are granted 
considerable privileges compared to state-run timber exporters. 
Rupeika said there was no "adequate" reaction to his 
suppositions from the president and the premier. 
  The situation at the Ministry of Forestry and its branches 
was investigated by the State Control Department, which found a 
number of violations in state timber trade. 
  40 signatures are enough to include a vote of no confidence 
in the parliament's agenda. But observers suppose that 
Kovalcikas will resign before his case is discussed in 
parliament. 
  The minister earlier said he does not intend to give up his 
post and suspected attempts to defame him.
