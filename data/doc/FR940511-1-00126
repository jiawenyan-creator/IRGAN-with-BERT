 

(d) Rental fees, maintenance fees, location fees, or service charges made in duplicate for the same claim or site are
returnable or refundable. When the authorized officer receives a request for a return or refund of such fees or charges,
and unless otherwise jointly instructed in writing by the paying parties, the authorized officer will refund the
duplicate payment to the party submitting such duplicate payment. 

(e) Voluntary actions such as relinquishment of claims or sites, or payment of rental or maintenance fees by a qualified
small miner, shall not be a qualifying reason for obtaining a refund of such fees previously paid. 

31. Section 3833.23 is amended by revising the section heading and paragraphs (d) and (e) to read as follows:




3833.23 

Consistency between the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the General Mining Law of May 10, 1872, the Act of October
5, 1992, and the Act of August 10, 1993. 



* * * * * 



(d) The Acts of October 5, 1992 and August 10, 1993, do not affect the requirements to do assessment work in the assessment
year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1999, and ending at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 2000, or to make
annual filings on or before December 30, 2000, pursuant to 3833.2 and 3851.1. 

(e) For mining claims and sites located on or after September 1, 1998, and on or before September 30, 1998, and for which
the required $100 maintenance fee was paid at the time of recording pursuant to section 314(b) of FLPMA and 3833.12,
payment of the maintenance fee satisfies the requirements of 3833.2 for the 1999 calendar year. 

32. Section 3833.26 is revised to read as follows: 



3833.26 

When evidence or notice is not required. 



Evidence of annual assessment work performed or a notice of intention to hold a mining claim or mill site need not be
filed on unpatented mining claims or mill sites if mineral entry under a mineral patent application has been allowed.
The owner of that mining claim or mill site is exempt from the filing requirements of 3833.2 and the payment of
rental or maintenance fees under 3833.15 as of the date mineral entry is allowed. 

33. Section 3833.3 is amended by adding paragraph (c) to read as follows: 



3833.3 

Notice of transfer of interest. 



* * * * * 



(c) The filing of a transfer of interest, when properly executed and recorded under State law, is effective when recorded
with the proper BLM office. For BLM record title purposes, the transfer will be deemed to have taken place on its effective
date under State law. 

34. Section 3833.4 is amended by revising the heading and paragraphs (a) and (b), redesignating paragraphs (c) through
(e) as (d) through (f), respectively, and adding paragraph (c), to read as follows: 



3833.4 

Failure to file, or to pay rental, maintenance, or location fees. 



(a)(1)(i) The failure to make annual filings required by 3833.21 and 3833.22 on or before
the December 30 immediately following the August 31 by which the small miner filed for a waiver of payment of the rental
or maintenance fees, shall conclusively constitute a forfeiture of the lode or placer mining claim. 

(ii) Except for the filings required on or before December 30, 1992, beginning on October 5, 1992, the requirements
of 3833.21 through 3833.25 are modified by the requirements of the Acts of October 5, 1992,
and August 10, 1993, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and these statutory provisions are now implemented in 3833.15,
3833.16, and 3833.17. 

(2) Failure to record the notice or certificate of location required by 3833.12(a), 3734.1(a),
or 3821.2 of this title, or failure to pay the rental, maintenance, or location fees required by 3833.14,
3833.15, and 3833.17, or failure to file the documents required by 3833.17(b) through
(d) within the time periods prescribed therein for claimants who also fail to pay the maintenance fee, shall be deemed
conclusively to constitute a forfeiture of the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. 

(3) For claimants who also fail to pay the maintenance fee, failure by a claimant who has filed a waiver certification
under 3833.17 to perform the assessment work required by subpart 3851 of this title at the time of filing
the waiver certification, if the work was required under 3833.17(a) through (d), will result in the
affected mining claims being conclusively deemed forfeited by the owner or owners thereof. 

(4) Failure to list the 10 or fewer mining claims and/or sites for which the fee is waived on the applicable certification
document filed pursuant to 3833.16 or 3833.17 or to pay the required amount of maintenance
fees by the prescribed August 31 will result in the affected mining claims and/or sites being conclusively deemed
forfeited by the owner or owners thereof. 

(b) Failure to file the complete information required in 3833.12(b), 3833.17(d) through
(f), 3833.24(a), 3833.24(b), and 3833.25(c), when the document is otherwise filed on time,
shall not be conclusively deemed to constitute an abandonment or forfeiture of the claim or site, but such information
shall be submitted within 30 days of receipt of a notice from the authorized officer calling for such information.
Failure to submit the information requested by the decision of the authorized officer shall result in the mining claim,
mill site, or tunnel site being deemed abandoned by the owner and therefore forfeited. 

(c) Failure to record a transfer of interest under 3833.3 will result in the Bureau of Land Management refusing
to recognize the interest acquired by the transferee or to serve notice of any action, decision, or contest on the unrecorded
owner.
