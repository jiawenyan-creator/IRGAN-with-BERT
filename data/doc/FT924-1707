FT  17 DEC 92 / Deals put in doubt by Kenyan poll
ONE OF Kenya's main opposition parties warned yesterday that questionable
projects involving British and other foreign companies would be reappraised
if it won this month's general election.
The warning came as the political temperature of Kenya's tense election
campaign rose a further notch.
Police given orders to shoot to kill in the trouble-torn Rift Valley
Province, and election observers again criticised the for its conduct of the
election process.
In separate letters to the British High Commissioner and the Japanese
ambassador, Mr Robert Shaw, a senior official in the Ford (Kenya) party
listed five projects and a loan agreement involving state-owned
corporations.
Although this is not the first time some of the projects listed have been
the subject of speculation, the opposition claims to have gathered more
evidence.
In his letter to Sir Kieran Prendergast, the British high comissioner, Mr
Shaw stressed that a Ford (Kenya) government 'will honour all Kenya's
honestly incurred international obligations'.
But independent auditors would be asked to investigate alleged 'complicity
in corruption by external financiers as well as the executors of the
projects', the letter continued.
