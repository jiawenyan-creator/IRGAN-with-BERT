  [Text] Qom, Abrar Correspondent -- Ayatollah Javadi Amoli 
emphasized: If, God forbid, the people are not present on the 
scene and do not support the Islamic system, and if his holiness 
Imam 'Ali (peace be upon him) also be the spiritual leader of 
that system, then that system will be defeated. 
  Our correspondent reports that Ayatollah Javadi Amoli 
expressed this matter at the Friday prayer service held at 
Mosalla-ye Qods [a place for public prayer] in Qom. He said that 
the people must be present on the scene and the country's 
officials must direct their efforts toward solving the existing 
problems and inadequacies. 
  He glorified the Islamic Revolution of Iran and said that 
the 
revolution's slogans must be preserved. The temporary Friday 
imam of Qom, having mentioned the virtues and graces of this 
humanizing month of Ramadan, asked believers to get close to God 
by devoting themselves to self-making acts and behaviors.
