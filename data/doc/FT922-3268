FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: Cadbury: divisions over ownership and accountability
(2)
Sir, Sir Owen Green has nailed the central weakness in the Cadbury report.
The introduction of any formula which may lead to a 'them and us' atmosphere
in the board room is to be deplored. Such a proposal, apart from the
dangerous risk of wasting time, also may result in damaging the vital link
between the executive and non-executive - that of trust.
If Sir Adrian Cadbury is concerned lest members of a board become united or,
heaven forbid, even friends, then he may take comfort from the fact that
most of us are more likely to seek to avoid letting down our friends than
our enemies.
