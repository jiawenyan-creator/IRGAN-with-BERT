FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition behind 21% rise at ACT to
Pounds 11.5m
ACT, the Birmingham-based computer services company, saw steady progress in
the half year to September 30 with the figures boosted substantially by the
acquisition of the BIS Group in June.
Pre-tax profits rose 21 per cent from Pounds 9.54m to Pounds 11.5m. Turnover
advanced 49 per cent to Pounds 107.6m (Pounds 72.1m), of which Pounds 24.4m
related to the acquisition. Operating profits were Pounds 11.5m (Pounds
8.76m) helped by a Pounds 2.59m contribution from BIS.
Turnover from continuing operations rose 15 per cent while pre-tax profits
on continuing operations were flat.
The acquisition of BIS cost Pounds 93.5m. There was a net interest charge
this time of Pounds 9,000, compared with interest received of Pounds
788,000. However, the company retains positive net cash balances.
Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said he was satisfied with progress in a
difficult six months. Profits from continuing operations had been held back
by some reduction at ACT Kindle, part of the banking software activities.
Kindle's orders during the half year had grown 18 per cent, but the order
backlog was up 69 per cent costing the company sales and profits.
The banking side of BIS continued to show growth year on year of about 20
per cent, chiefly through the continued success of Midas, its branch banking
package, and DR1, an electronic dealing system.
The information systems side of BIS had underperformed, Mr Foster said, as
orders had slackened during the summer months. A new ACT Business Systems
company had been created from Logsys, ACT's systems company and the IS
division of BIS.
Mr Foster said he was confident about the second half, traditionally the
company's better six months, as activity in the banking sector intensified.
Earnings per share rose to 5.24p (5.01p). The interim dividend remains
unchanged at 1.75p.
