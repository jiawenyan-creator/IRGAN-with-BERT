  [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- The central 
government has over the past 10 years set aside huge amount of 
money to support Tibetan students to study in inland provinces, 
which has helped train a large group of capable personnel for 
the economic construction of the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
  So far more than 12,000 Tibetan children have been enrolled 
in 86 state-funded secondary schools or classes in 26 provinces 
and autonomous regions of the country, according to a deputy to 
the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress. 
  Yang Chuantang, vice-chairman of the Tibet autonomous 
regional government, said today that more than 1,000 graduates 
of such schools have returned to work in Tibet and have been 
playing an important role in the region's economic construction 
and some have become leaders at various government levels. 
  Moreover, Yang noted, some 500 graduates have been enrolled 
in universities both in Tibet and in inland areas. 
  Yang said that such a way to get more Tibetan children 
educated has also greatly eased educational problems in 
agricultural and pastoral areas of the region where children 
have difficulties to go to school.
