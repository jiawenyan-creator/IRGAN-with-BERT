  [Text] Upholding the party's trade-first policy, the 
Pyongyang Alcohol Plant has begun exporting its products. The 
plant's exports, comprising local specialities including 
Pyongyang soju, have attracted great interest and attention 
since their appearance in overseas markets. A publication in a 
certain Southeast Asian country introduced the plant's products 
as famous and popular. To meet the ever-increasing 
international demand, the plant reached its January export 
production goal ahead of schedule on 20 January, and it 
continues to accelerate production for export.
