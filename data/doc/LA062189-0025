SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CAMPO 
A 13-year-old boy was killed when a semiautomatic rifle accidentally fired 
Monday on the Campo Indian Reservation. 
Wayne Lee Haywood, of Church Road was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where 
he was pronounced dead, said Sgt. Danny Goodrich from the San Diego Sheriff's 
Department. 
Haywood was shot in the chest by a 13-year-old playmate, who was not 
identified, when Haywood kicked the other boy in the thigh and the rifle was 
accidentally fired, Goodrich said. 
Haywood had asked the other boy to make sure the rifle was unloaded, but the 
boy failed to see a round in the chamber, Goodrich said. 
The shooting was an accident, authorities said, and no arrests have been made. 
The case will be turned over to the district attorney.
