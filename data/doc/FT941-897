FT  28 MAR 94 / Observer: Silent mole
It's the stuff of a John Le Carre novel: who is the mole within that august
institution, the London Stock Exchange?
It's emerged that last December chairman Sir Andrew Hugh Smith - who steps
down on July 14 - found it necessary to hire those well-known sleuths, Kroll
Associates.
Their mission? To track down the source of a number of leaks to the press -
the FT included - about sensitive high-level appointments.
Kroll snooped around but to no avail it seems. Observer's man tells us that
Kroll's report does not point the finger at any individual: 'Kroll had an
open brief to investigate widely but found no single source. Something
happened, somebody talked, but who exactly, that's a different matter.'
That's the trouble with moles - never talking when you want them to.
