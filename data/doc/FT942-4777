FT  08 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television
The extent to which the BBC is still locked into the political fashions of
the 1960s can be judged from the fact that the Adam Smith Institute is
regarded as a suitable candidate for the access slot Open Space. Out in the
real world the political high ground has been held for 20 years by people
who argue that the cradle to grave welfare state was a fond but dangerous
idea, a pastel pink version of communism, which destroyed individual
initiative and created a dependency culture. But at the BBC such ideas are
still regarded as so quaint and novel that, even as late as 1994, it is felt
right to offer special space for these weird and wonderful notions to be
explained (7.00 BBC2).
It should be a good evening for drama. ITV's Peninsular War series, Sharpe,
has been swashing its buckle in a most satisfactory manner and today the
rough diamond rifleman falls for another beautiful woman: the Marquesa
Dorada, played by Alice Krige (8.00). BBC2's 'Screen Two' production is A
Landing On The Sun, adapted from a funny and gripping novel about the
oddness of civil service life, by Michael Frayn (9.00).
