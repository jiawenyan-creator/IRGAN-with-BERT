FT  14 MAY 93 / Argentina repeals controversial 'disobedience' law
ARGENTINA'S Congress has repealed a century-old 'disobedience' law used by
civilian and military governments - including the present government of
President Carlos Menem - to muzzle press criticism and intimidate public
opinion.
The Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to scrap the law. Mr Menem
formally proposed repealing it last July in response to attacks on his use
of the measure. The law's last victim was a woman arrested making an obscene
gesture at Mr Menem.
President Juan Peron greatly strengthened 19th-century statutes that made
insulting the dignity or decorum of an official a criminal offence. In 1950,
Peron extended the scope of disobedience, or desacato, to undermine
congressional immunities, close newspapers, and jail political opponents.
Although Argentina returned to civilian rule in 1983, the disobedience law
remained an obstacle to full press and political freedom.
Mr Menem's critics admit he never jailed an opponent or closed a newspaper,
but say he has used the threat of legal action as a form of intimidation. Mr
Menem has replied to these complaints by doing away with the law. However,
opponents are still not satisfied. They say Mr Menem and other politicians
abuse slander, libel and defamation laws to silence criticism.
Mr Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former federal prosecutor, says Mr Menem is
paradoxically introducing overdue reforms of the political and legal system
 -such as repealing the disobedience law - while concentrating power in his
hands and dismantling constitutional checks and balances on the government.
Mr Menem is to meet President Bill Clinton in Washington next month,
Argentina's Foreign Ministry has announced. The two presidents are to meet
on June 29 for talks on trade, security and bilateral issues.
