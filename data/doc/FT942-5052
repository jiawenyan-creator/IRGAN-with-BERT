FT  07 JUN 94 / People: Ladbroke
Christopher Andrews is resigning from the board of Ladbroke, the leisure and
property group, less than five months after giving up his responsibilities
as company secretary. Andrews, 54, has been with Ladbroke since 1972 and was
brought on to the board by former chief executive Cyril Stein as group
services director in 1986.
Described as 'very much the backroom boy' by former colleagues, Andrews was
responsible for head office operations. He was on a three-year rolling
contract and will receive a pay-off although this is believed to be
substantially less than the contractual entitlement.
