FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Oman-India gas link plan
OMAN and India have reached preliminary agreement to build an undersea gas
pipeline capable of delivering 50m cubic metres of Omani gas a day to
industries on India's west coast, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. Gulf oil
executives say the deal will be worth around Dollars 4.5bn and could be
completed within four years.
The two states have also agreed to build two 120,000 b/d oil refineries in
India, with the Omani government partnering India's Hindustan Petroleum and
Baharat Oil.
The Oman Oil Company, an arm of the country's oil and finance ministries, is
to conduct a feasibility study on the 900km pipeline, which would have to
pass over the continental shelf off Iran and Pakistan.
Oil industry officials said a substantial part of the deal was likely to be
financed by export credits. Oman has reportedly proposed a 40-year gas
supply contract.
