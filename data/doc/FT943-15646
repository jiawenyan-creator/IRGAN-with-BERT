FT  08 JUL 94 / BCCI chief to enter plea bargain
Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the former chief executive of BCCI, is to appear in a
Washington courtroom today to enter a plea bargain over charges of fraud at
the bank, Justice Department officials said yesterday.
The plea agreement could mean he avoids a long public trial and receives a
modest sentence in exchange for pleading guilty to lesser charges and
agreeing to co-operate with investigations into the bank. Mr Naqvi has so
far not given the government much help in unravelling the way the BCCI fraud
was perpetrated.
The department would not comment on the hearing yesterday.
BCCI was closed down three years ago after international regulators
unearthed one of the biggest banking frauds in history, totalling over
Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn). Investors and depositors are still seeking
redress.
A plea deal may come under fire from Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York
district attorney, who initiated the BCCI investigation. The district
attorney's office said yesterday it was waiting to see the shape of the
agreement with Mr Naqvi. However, it did not rule out the possibility of
pursuing separate charges against him in New York state.
