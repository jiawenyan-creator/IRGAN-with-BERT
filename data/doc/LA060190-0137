ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
JUST LIKE HOME: Although he's defending champion, Placentia's Michael Chang 
plays his first center court match today at the French Open tennis tournament 
(C1). He was consigned to secondary courts for his first two matches. . . . 
Chang has plenty of family support in Paris. His father, mother and brother not 
only sit courtside but are living with him in an apartment, rented so his 
mother can prepare his meals. He's been careful about his diet since his hip 
injury in December. . . . Early risers can see the match on ESPN at 6 a.m.
