FT  18 MAR 93 / Heavier pensions burden looms over taxpayers
GERMAN taxpayers are likely to face a new increase of at least 8 per cent in
their pensions contributions next year, putting them top of the league of
big industrialised states for direct payments to the public purse.
The warning on a probable pensions increase came as the Bundesbank published
a new survey, showing that France and Germany are now equally the
highest-taxed countries in the Group of Seven industrialised states. The
latest agreement on a solidarity pact to pay for German unification, with
the re-introduction of a 7.5 per cent surcharge on income tax from January 1
1995, will push the country further out in front.
The Bundesbank report warns that the tax and social insurance burden on both
individuals and employers in Germany stood at 43.7 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1992, its highest level since the war. It has risen
sharply since unification, including increases in unemployment insurance,
statutory health insurance and income taxes.
The latest warning on increased pensions contributions came from Mr Herbert
Rische, president of the federal insurance bureau for white-collar workers,
who said the current rate of 17.5 per cent on basic wages would have to rise
to between 18.9 and 19.1 per cent next year. A key reason was the decision
to keep rates down in the past in spite of rising pensions payments to a
steadily ageing population.
The demographic change is also a factor behind the government's announcement
that it will press ahead with legislation to finance a statutory residential
care programme before the summer break, despite strong business resistance.
The scheme is likely to add about 1.7 per cent to social insurance
contributions, but the employers' share is supposed to be compensated for:
one proposal is to cancel one statutory holiday; another is to reduce by one
day the number of days for which sick workers can claim wages.
Social insurance contributions currently add up to 38.8 per cent of monthly
wages, with employers making matching contributions.
