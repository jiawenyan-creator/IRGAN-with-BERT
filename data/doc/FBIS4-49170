both sides are determined to overcome the differences now 
existing between the two countries and enable the U.S.-China 
relations to develop steadily. 
  In reply, Zou Jiahua said that the Chinese side has always 
attached importance to the safeguarding and development of the 
Sino-U.S. relations and has the sincerity of resolving the 
issues now existing between the two countries. The Chinese side 
has done much in this regard and will continue to do so in the 
future, Zou stressed. 
  The Chinese side hopes that the U.S. side will take the same 
attitude and active actions to promote the restoration of the 
normal relations between the two countries at an earlier date, 
Zou said. 
  The Chinese vice-premier asked Talbott to convey his thanks 
and regards to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
