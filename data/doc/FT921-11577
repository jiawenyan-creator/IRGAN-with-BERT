FT  31 JAN 92 / Taiwan approves cable television
Taiwan's cabinet yesterday approved a proposed bill to legalise cable
television that would break the government's television monopoly on the
island, AP-DJ reports from Taipei.
Cable television operators said, however, the proposal has so many
restrictions that it fails to open up the market to free competition.
