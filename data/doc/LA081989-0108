WEYERHAEUSER TO SELL 4 NURSERY UNITS 
Weyerhaeuser Co. said it will put four of its nursery products businesses up 
for sale as part of its efforts to divest itself of a number of subsidiaries. 
President John Creighton Jr. said the four businesses have aggregate sales in 
excess of $280 million a year, adding that Weyerhaeuser's nursery and garden 
supply sales increased four-fold in the past five years. 
Earlier, the company said it would sell Weyerhaeuser Specialty Plants, which 
supplies specially dried flowers and plants to landscapers and interior 
designers.
