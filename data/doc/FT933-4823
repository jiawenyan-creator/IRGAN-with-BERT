FT  07 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Italy
Italy has lost the initiative since its privatisation plans were unveiled at
the end of last year. While government has been mired in corruption and
intrigue, privatisation has stalled. Modest trade sales by IRI, the
industrial holding company, mark the limit of success. The timetable now
envisages share offerings in three state-owned banks - Credito Italiano, BCI
and IMI - by the year-end. France will begin its own programme by offering
shares in BNP. So competition for international funds will be intense.
Since the banks need less by way of restructuring than industrial candidates
for privatisation, Italy has little option but to press ahead. The big
savings banks will also have to shepherd private investors out of government
bonds into equities if privatisation is to succeed. Without an established
system of private pension schemes, Italy cannot rely on institutional
investors alone. Fiscal incentives for equity investment might help the
migration of savings, but the process might lack credibility unless the
banks are in private hands.
Although the banks should also feel early benefit from any further cuts in
interest rates, the outlook is far from cloudless. The collapse of Ferruzzi
has raised questions about the credit controls applied by Italian banks. A
restructuring agreement for Ferruzzi would reassure that the banks' exposure
is now under control. An equitable solution might equally soothe nerves
among international investors about the kind of treatment shareholders in
privatised companies might expect.
