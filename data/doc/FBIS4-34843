Brasilia] 
  [Text] The Brazilian Government may import medicines from 
the PRC. This was discussed today by Chinese Public Health 
Minister Chen Minzhang and Brazilian Health Ministry officials. 
The Chinese guarantee that the medicines will arrive in Brazil 
at prices below domestic ones. Minister Chen says China 
produces medicines with lower costs because they are produced on 
a large scale and the raw materials are obtained through 
advanced technologies. Health Secretary Adney Moraes said the 
import of Chinese medicines is a way to solve the problem of 
high medicine prices in Brazil. The Brazilian Government will 
examine the feasibility of the Chinese proposal.
