<F P=106> [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA-INFORM report under the "Border" </F>
rubric: "Kurils Apparently Shoot Their Bolt"] 
  [Text] The report from Viktor Ilyukhin, chief of the State 
Duma Security Committee, about Yeltsin's directive to prepare a 
schedule for the withdrawal of Border Guard Troops from the 
territory of the South Kuril Islands has turned into a sensation 
through the military's efforts. The issue was clouded by the 
Russian General Staff Operations Directorate and Border Guard 
Troops High Command, which flatly denied the existence of such a 
directive, although the Far East Military District commander 
confirmed the report in a confidential conversation. 
  Our sources in the Defense Ministry did not deny the 
existence of the directive, but stressed that it is not a 
question of withdrawing Border Guard Troops but of preparing a 
schedule for withdrawing troops in the event of "unforeseen 
circumstances." The question of whether the decision to hand 
over the islands to Japan can be classed as "unforeseen 
circumstances" remained unanswered. It was approximately in this 
form that the "sensation" started making the rounds in the pages 
of the Western press. 
  Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma Defense 
Committee, has now officially confirmed Ilyukhin's report. 
Since Cold War times a machinegun-artillery division has been 
stationed on the South Kurils, and it is this to which the 
president's directive evidently refers. A scandalous 
interpretation could have been avoided had the directive been 
immediately followed by explanations. Although one can 
understand the Defense Ministry -- it is too "hot" a topic. The 
only deep-water strait which is a nuclear-powered submarine 
channel is located in the area of the South Kurils.
