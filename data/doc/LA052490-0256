WORLD; 
'LITTLE SHIPS' RETURN TO DUNKIRK 
Fifty years after defeat stared Britain in the face, the "Little Ships of 
Dunkirk" sailed again today, from the White Cliffs of Dover to the French 
Channel port where the civilian armada plucked a defeated army to safety and 
changed the course of World War II. 
Seventy-six veteran pleasure boats and cabin cruisers were going back to mark 
the 50th anniversary of what Winston Churchill called a miracle. 
Dover's white cliffs and harbor walls were lined with cheering spectators as 
the 76 surviving boats set sail. 
On Sunday, up to 7,000 Dunkirk veterans are expected to gather on the beaches 
near the port for a religious service to mark the anniversary. The little ships 
will form a circle offshore into which a memorial wreath will be dropped from a 
helicopter.
