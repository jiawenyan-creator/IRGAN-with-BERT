IS THE ART MUSEUM TRULY INDEPENDENT? 
Your reporter (Tracy) Wilkinson wrote an article about the criminal arraignment 
of a Santa Monica developer, Abby Sher, in connection with events surrounding 
her Edgemar museum-restaurant complex on Main Street. (Times, Jan. 15.) On Jan. 
29, you printed a letter from the museum director, Thomas Rhoads. Rhoads' 
letter attempted to "correct some factual errors" in the Wilkinson article, 
regarding the relationship between this developer, Edgemar and the museum. 
Rhoads went to some length to draw a distinction between Sher's business 
dealings and the operations of the museum, objecting to Wilkinson's use of the 
term "private museum," and commenting that "in fact, the museum is a separate 
entity from Edgemar." However, Rhoads neglected to inform the readers of the 
following: 
As late as Jan. 31, "Museum Director" Rhoads and "Founder/Vice President of 
SMMoA Board of Trustees" Sher shared the same business address (1333 Ocean 
Ave.), same mailbox slot, office space and staff (Janet Baetz). 
The "fact sheet" Edgemar handed out to interested parties gave the same phone 
number to contact for "information regarding Edgemar/Santa Monica Museum of 
Art." 
According to Sher at an open city meeting last spring, Rhoads is her employee 
under the terms of a personal-services employment contract. 
As an aside, various Edgemar press releases and news articles have referred to 
the museum's "board of directors." Rhoads mentioned "nine trustees" in his 
letter. It is unclear whether the museum has both directors and trustees, and 
whether both or either make policy or merely offer advice. 
Finally, the information above begs the question of whether the museum is truly 
independent from the developer, as Rhoads contends, or does one actually 
control the other?
