FT  25 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: London
After buoyant figures on the UK economy last week, the gilts market will be
watching today's numbers on first-quarter gross domestic product closely.
The consensus forecast is for 0.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth,
although Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi
International (Europe), is plumping for 0.6 per cent. However, his forecast
still means 'that the economy will be heading for 2.5 per cent plus growth
this year'.
Further evidence of the recovery's strength will be provided by tomorrow's
Industrial Trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry.
On Wednesday, the first auction of the 1994-95 financial year sees Pounds
2bn of 1999 stock on sale. Last week, figures confirmed that the
public-sector borrowing requirement was Pounds 4bn short of the official
forecast. According to NatWest Markets, net gilt sales in 1994-95 will be
less than half those needed in 1993-94.
Last week's statistics, which included a sharper-
than-expected jump in retail sales and a fall in unemployment, seem to have
dashed hopes of a rate cut in the near future. But gilts, helped by a rally
in US bonds, held up quite well. Mr Walton said: 'When long yields get close
to 8 per cent, the market seems to bounce off that level.'
