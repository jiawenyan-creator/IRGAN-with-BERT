FED UP OVER PORTER RANCH PROJECT 
I am a resident of the Porter Ranch area and I am appalled by the actions of 
our City Council. The council couldn't care less about the people of the San 
Fernando Valley. 
All they want is the tax revenue. 
They have given our land away to developers with complete disregard for the 
wishes of the public. Imagine if you can the beautiful rolling hills of 
Chatsworth leveled, and not only a Century City there, but also 3,400 
residential units. How much can you put into a 1,300-acre parcel of land? 
Many in the Chatsworth-Porter Ranch area are against this project and yet the 
City Council approved it. Is it any wonder the people of the Valley are fed up? 
They have our hands tied because we cannot incorporate as a city as the Santa 
Clarita Valley has done and Calabasas is voting to do. 
As far as Hal Bernson is concerned, I hope he has received his 30 pieces of 
silver. He has done his job for Nathan Shapell well.
