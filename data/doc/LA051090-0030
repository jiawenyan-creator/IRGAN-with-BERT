NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: CUT SALT INTAKE TO PREVENT HYPERTENSION LATER 
Hypertension experts gathered in Long Beach last week to present research that 
proves a link between sodium intake and high blood pressure for all Americans, 
despite claims that the relationship only affects a minority. 
Researchers at the Fifth International Interdisciplinary Conference on 
Hypertension in Blacks explained that hypertension, one of the major risk 
factors for coronary heart disease, is a "populationwide problem." It is not 
limited to those who are "salt-sensitive," they said, since all Americans are 
exposed to the same risk factors for hypertension -- smoking, obesity, 
alcoholism, excessive sodium intake and atherosclerosis. 
The current approach to reducing hypertension in the United States, said one of 
the leading experts, represents "partial and incomplete strategy," since there 
is no way to test for salt-sensitivity. 
Although it was reported that hypertension is more likely to occur in blacks 
than whites -- high blood pressure affects at least 67% of all black men 
between the ages of 65 and 74 and about 59% of white males the same age -- 
after age 35, at least 80% of the Americans will have a blood pressure that is 
"above optimal," said Dr. Jeremiah Stamler of Northwestern University in 
Chicago. 
"As seen with cholesterol, high blood pressure is a multifactorial problem, not 
just a black or white problem. It is a population-wide problem. 
"If the strategy remains the same and we wait for people to show the clinical 
signs of hypertension, we are guilty of neglect and (exposing people to) excess 
risk (for complications of hypertension)," Stamler said. 
Normal blood pressure is 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). This figure 
represents the force of blood as it pushes against the arteries when the heart 
pumps. It is a ratio of systolic over diastolic. 
Other than age and race, there are few confirmed causes for high blood 
pressure, which is measured at 140/90 mm Hg. Other risk factors are merely 
suspected. 
Instead of accepting that blood pressure will rise with age, Stamler hopes that 
intervention at an early age could eliminate the "abnormal" climb in blood 
pressure, he said. The age-induced increase, he said, is a direct result of a 
lifestyle and it is aggravated by a high sodium intake. 
"The 'normal' is for blood pressure to rise with age, but this rise is 
abnormal," said Stamler. "It is complicated by the American lifestyle. Smoking 
and high blood pressure are among the risk factors for heart disease, but high 
blood pressure is pivotal -- it aggravates the other risks. . . . With blood 
pressure, salt is the pivotal one (risk factor)." 
The average American consumer gets about 10% of his daily sodium intake from 
the natural salt that occurs in food. About 15% can be attributed to the 
addition of salt during cooking and at the table. The overwhelming majority is 
derived from salt added during processing and manufacturing of food -- about 
75%. 
Stamler said, if Americans in general, would cut back on the amount of 
processed food they eat, it could potentially reduce the occurance of 
hypertension in the nation. And he cited recommendations from the National 
Research Council's extensive "Diet and Health Report" and from the American 
Heart Assn. as support. They recommend that consumers reduce sodium intake from 
the current level of consumption to a "safe and adequate" level of 1,100 to 
3,300 milligrams daily. (One teaspoon contains 2,000 mg sodium.) 
Americans have a "clear opportunity" to change their life expectancy, Stamler 
said. By making changes in food selection, it could add three and a half years 
to the average life span -- especially for blacks who live six to seven years 
fewer than whites, according to government statistics. 
But there has been some controversy about this advice. Opponents believe that 
there are other risk factors that are more important than sodium intake. They 
are body weight and alcohol consumption. 
The question was raised after interpretation of the population study Intersalt, 
which surveyed and studied 24-hour urine samples of more than 10,000 men and 
women in 32 countries. Intersalt found that sodium intake has a role in raising 
risk for hypertension. It also showed that in some groups body weight and 
alcohol use can be greater predictors of blood pressure status than sodium 
intake. 
But Stamler emphasized the salt component is the most influential. He said that 
the data clearly indicates that eating less salt was of benefit: In all 
populations, the higher the sodium intake, the greater the increase in blood 
pressure with age. 
From this, he and his colleagues concluded that a lifetime of reduced salt 
intake, coupled with weight maintenance and conservative alcohol consumption, 
could lessen a person's chances of developing high blood pressure in old age. 
"What we learned from Intersalt," said Dr. Clarence E. Grim, of the Charles 
Drew Medical Center, Los Angeles, "is that in societies that eat very little 
salt, there is very little hypertension. Salt is the most critical indicator in 
blood pressure. We are currently eating 150 times what what we need."
