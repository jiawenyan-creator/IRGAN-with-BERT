FT  18 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region firmer as hopes
rise on N. Korea
Rising hopes over increasing dialogue between North Korea and the US, and
the weakening of the yen encouraged buying but selling around the 21,500
level stunted the day's rise, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 135.83 to 21,503.30, up 0.5 per cent on the
week, after a low of 21,398.68 and a high of 21,572.41 in the morning
session on arbitrage buying. Heavy selling by financial institutions
countered foreign and individual buying.
Volume rose to 500m shares from 381m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 7.00 to 1,705.53 and the Nikkei 300 1.08 to 309.63. Gainers
led losers by 683 to 342 with 158 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index rose 3.25 to 1399.87.
Analysts said that a further rise of the market depended on the
participation of private investors: a rise in individual favourites was an
encouraging sign, but retail investors tended to be short-term players.
Oki Electric Industry, the most active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y815 on
foreign and individual buying. Isuzu Motors also gained Y22 to Y559 on
retail support.
Financial institutions bought cheap laggard car stocks, with Fuji Heavy
Industries rising Y13 to Y500 and Mitsubishi Motors advancing Y26 to Y989.
Foreign investors picked up chemical and textile stocks, with Unitika, a
textile maker, up Y17 to Y405 and Nippon Zeon, in a synthetic rubber, by Y21
to Y575.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y3,000 to Y845,000 but East Japan
Railway gained Y5,000 to Y508,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 172.59 to 23,783.14 in volume of 72.5m
shares.
Roundup
Mixed fortunes affected the region's markets.
HONG KONG recovered most of Thursday's fall on a late round of bargain
hunting and arbitrage-related buying.
The Hang Seng index closed up 91.04 or 1 per cent at 9,113.96, barely
changed on the week, in turnover up from HKDollars 2.93bn to HKDollars
3.13bn. However, the key index did recover from a fall below the 9,000 level
just after the opening, and the June index futures contract closed 210
higher at 9,180.
Cheung Kong lost 25 cents to HKDollars 36.25, having reached a low of
HKDollars 35.25 earlier on fears that property sales would be affected by
the government campaign to cool down the overheated property market.
SEOUL moved strongly ahead on expectations that the North Korean nuclear
crisis would be resolved peacefully.
The composite index rose 17.46 to 918.54, up 1.9 per cent on the day and 1
per cent on the week.
Turnover was Won684.05bn after Thursday's Won565.29bn.
BOMBAY finished at a 26-month high as both domestic and foreign investors
came into the market on the first day of the new account. The BSE index rose
102.62 or 2.4 per cent to 4,290.37, barely changed on the week.
Brokers said that the rally was mainly led by buying in Reliance Industries
and Tata Iron and Steel, the former up Rp6.25 at Rp397.50 and the latter up
Rp3.75 at Rp300.
TAIPEI turned cautious after its recent volatility, the weighted index
rising 10.10 to 6,159.74, up 2.7 per cent on the week, as turnover fell to
TDollars 68.6bn from Thursday's TDollars 96.04bn.
Selected banking stocks with high profit expectations attracted buying:
China Trust, the day's second most active issue, rose TDollars 1.50 to
TDollars 72.
MANILA was depressed by a sharp drop in PLDT after analysts lowered their
earnings forecasts. The telephone group's shares lost 3.6 per cent to 1,735
pesos, pulling the composite index down 33.73 to 2,882.83.
The newly listed Megaworld Properties bucked the trend, rising 1.85 per cent
to 5.50 pesos. The debuts of the shipping group, Negros Navigation, and the
ice cream company, Selecta, were expected to give the market further
incentive next week.
Turnover was 707.9m pesos.
SYDNEY retreated slightly as activity was undermined by the continued
weakness in the bond market. The All Ordinaries index fell 4.8 to 2,051.2,
in turnover of ADollars 472.6m, off 0.8 per cent on the week.
