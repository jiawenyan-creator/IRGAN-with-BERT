FORBIDDEN TRASH, CREEPING FASCISM 
Though it may sound odd coming from the sleepy San Gabriel Valley, democracy 
seems willing to enlist just a little "fascism" to prevent the deteriorating 
"history and reputation" of local real estate ("Front yard faux pas," Times, 
Sept. 16), and contrary to the remark by Director Rick Cole ("Hopefully, we're 
not talking about crabgrass fascism here"), the property maintenance ordinances 
being deliberated by Pasadena city officials are the vehicles for this lively 
yet oppressive authoritarianism. 
The informative article written by Vicki Torres delivers a vivid image of 
"clothes drying (outside), cars on blocks, broken-down sofas, abandoned 
refrigerators and busted steps" scattered throughout Pasadena. 
Wow! That's enough filth to DEMAND city authorities use "health, safety and 
land-use codes" (which are already on the books) to purge the city. But Deputy 
City Atty. Carolyn Williams takes cover in a 1984 U.S. Supreme Court decision 
which, in her words, grants cities authority over the "spiritual" and 
"aesthetic" behavior of citizens -- areas in which only a despot can have an 
interest. 
Can't we lighten up a little? We know there are already laws in effect to 
handle forbidden trash; we've heard a serious official question the term 
"fascism," and in Torres' article it's admitted, "judges are often reluctant to 
levy heavy fines and penalties. . . ." With "conform or go to jail," how deeply 
do we nick our faith in the future of private property? Dare we prefer 
architectural bragging rights over the established principles of government? 
Without dipping into fascism, can we legislate the spiritual and aesthetic?
