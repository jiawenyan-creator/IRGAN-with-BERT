FT  16 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Giving credit where it is
not due - In a nutshell
Only 3 per cent of UK companies are paid by the date stipulated on their
invoices, according to a survey* by Trade Indemnity, a credit insurance
company.
Nearly 60 per cent of companies wait between 11 and 30 days after the due
date while 22 per cent wait longer than a month. On average, companies wait
an extra 27 days for payment and have 25 per cent of their invoices
outstanding for more than 30 days. The sectors which suffer most are
construction and engineering.
