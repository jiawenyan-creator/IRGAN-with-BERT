  [Text] Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky May 31 TASS -- The 
Kamchatka naval flotilla has begun to plant mines on unguarded 
approaches and terrotories adjacent to arms depots, a spokesman 
in the flotilla press group told ITAR-TASS. 
  This is being done on an instruction from the Russian 
defence 
minister and the commander-in-chief of the Navy to prevent 
thefts of weapons and ammunition, the spokesman said. 
  Last year, more than ten attempts to steal weapons from the 
flotilla's one facility alone were thwarted. The facility is 
located, incidentally, within the city boundaring of 
Petropavlovsk. In a half of cases, the arms theft attempts 
involved adolescents. 
  Warning signs will be set up near the mined places. The 
flotilla command cautioned all residents of the region against 
crossing the boundaries of mined territories.
