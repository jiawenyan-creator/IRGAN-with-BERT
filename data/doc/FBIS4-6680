  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- This was 
released by the leader of the Mongolian Bourgeois Party [MBP] 
and owner of a large private "Buyan" company B. Jargalsaihan. 
In his interview to the Mongolian television he defined the 
stand of his party regarding the tense situation shaped down in 
the country due to a political hunger strike by representatives 
of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA) a number of 
opposition forces of the country demanding for resignation of 
the incumbent government. 
  According to him, the government headed by P. Jasray is not 
to be blamed for all the economic and other hardships of the 
country. 
  We should remember of the state of the country at the moment 
of its forming as well as the state of the national economy. If 
the demands of those participating in the hunger strike are 
associated with some certain persons their cases should be 
solved within the frameworks of the law, he pointed out. 
  It is the conscious labour of every Mongolian, discipline, 
order and good arrangement and not empty words and mere 
declarations and political hunger strikes and chaos that will go 
out Mongolia from the economic crisis and destruction, considers 
B. Jargalsaihan. The leader of the MBP condemns the extremity 
of actions of the opposition forces arranging the current hunger 
strike.
