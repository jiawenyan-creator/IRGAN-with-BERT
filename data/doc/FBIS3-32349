  [Text] Senator Pedro Simon, government leader in the 
Senate, says his comments on what could happen if Congress does 
not approve the creation of the social emergency fund bill, 
necessary for the stabilization plan, were misinterpreted. 
  Sen. Simon said he never talked about shock measures: 
  [Begin recording] The plan will be approved because, 
although it was prepared by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, it now 
belongs to Congress, which fully altered and modified it. This 
is why I maintain that the plan will be approved. If not, I 
believe Fernando Henrique might resign, but I cannot say there 
will be shock measures because I have no clue about this. [end 
recording]
