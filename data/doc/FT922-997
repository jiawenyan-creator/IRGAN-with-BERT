FT  25 JUN 92 / Trade surplus to May best for 20 years
SUCCESS on industrial export markets helped France record a FFr4.5bn (Pounds
450m) trade surplus in May, bringing the surplus over the previous 12 months
to FFr9.4bn, the best result for 20 years.
This is the fifth monthly surplus in a row and puts the trade account on
track to break even or make a small surplus for the year, said Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, industry and foreign trade minister.
He attributed the turnround, from a FFr30bn deficit for the whole of last
year, to the fact that low French inflation had made French industrial goods
competitive on export markets.
France's export success was the main component in growth so far this year,
as investment and consumer demand in the domestic economy continued to
perform sluggishly, he said.
Last month's surplus is slightly smaller than the FFr7.57bn surplus recorded
in April and reflects a fall in both exports and imports. Exports declined
by 5.7 per cent to FFr103.4bn from April to May, while imports fell by 3.2
per cent to FFr98.9bn.
This bought the surplus for the first five months of the year to FFr17.9bn,
representing a FFr37bn turnround from the FFr19.01bn deficit in the same
period of last year. The industrial account represented the FFr30bn of this.
