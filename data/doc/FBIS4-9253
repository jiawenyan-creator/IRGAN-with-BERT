  [Text] Sarajevo, 7 April -- Slovenia is trying to evacuate 
another 200 citizens from Sarajevo. With this purpose in mind, 
officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of 
Labor, Family, and Social Welfare visited Sarajevo yesterday. 
  Representatives of some Slovene firms which would be able to 
participate in the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina or were 
already known in Bosnia-Herzegovina before the war were invited 
by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to a meeting in Ljubljana 
yesterday. Representatives of more than 30 firms attended the 
meeting, organized as a part of preparations for the visit of 
the Slovene Government delegation to Sarajevo. All the 
businessmen present emphasized their willingness to participate 
in the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Many Slovene 
enterprises used to have branches or subsidiaries there, some 
having left there all their equipment and full warehouses. 
Slovene construction firms also have several thousand employees 
from Bosnia-Herzegovina, who could serve as a link in bidding 
for reconstruction contracts. Since many industrial facilities 
and power plants in Bosnia-Herzegovina were built by Slovene 
firms, it would be easiest for those firms to rebuild them.
