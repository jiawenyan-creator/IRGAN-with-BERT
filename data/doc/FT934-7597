FT  19 NOV 93 / Israel agrees to pull back Gaza troops
ISRAEL has agreed to limit its military presence in the Gaza Strip to
positions inside Jewish settlements there, Mr Nabil Sha'ath, the chief PLO
delegate to autonomy negotiations with Israel, said in Cairo yesterday.
Speaking at the end of three days of intensive talks, Mr Sha'ath added that
he was optimistic that a detailed autonomy deal would be ready for signature
as scheduled by December 13, so that the Israeli military withdrawal from
the Gaza and Jericho areas could begin on that date.
Israel's minister of police, Moshe Shahal, visiting Egypt for a meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak, confirmed that he too expected the December 13
deadline to be met.
Mr Sha'ath said that, originally, Israel had wanted to maintain military
positions outside the Gaza settlements, but that the Israelis had backed
down. He added that initial agreement had also been reached on many aspects
of the transfer of civil authority to the Palestinians and on matters such
as fishing and aviation rights, and access to radio and television
frequencies. Mr Sha'ath also said that he expected PLO chairman Yassir
Arafat to move from PLO headquarters in Tunis to the territories in January.
The main sticking points now, he said, were the control of border crossings,
the size of the Jericho area to be transferred to Palestinian control, and
the release of Arab prisoners. While Israel is prepared to release the
majority of the 10,000-plus Palestinian prisoners it holds, it has so far
refused to consider freeing several hundred who have 'Israeli blood on their
hands.'
Mr Sha'ath said no deal would be signed 'without a scheduled and written
commitment for the release of prisoners. This is a long overdue issue. They
should be released now.'
The Israeli and PLO teams are to hold another three days of talks starting
next Monday, and might schedule longer sessions as the December 13 deadline
draws near.
