FT  29 JUN 92 / Building Contracts: Water treatment project in Southport
COSTAIN BUILDING &amp; CIVIL ENGINEERING has been awarded a contract, worth
Pounds 16.6m, to construct an interceptor tunnel at Southport for North West
Water.
The project involves the construction of a deep interceptor sewer, of 2.8
metres diameter, along the sea frontage to divert water from the existing
sea outfalls. The interceptor is designed to store storm water and transfer
it to treatment works, rather than allowing it to discharge into the sea.
The sewer will be constructed by soft ground tunnelling techniques in
water-bearing sand and glacial till. The overall length of the tunnel will
be five kilometres, requiring the construction of 10 acess shafts. The
contract period is about two and half years.
The tunnelling will be carried out using a Lovat full face tunnel boring
machine, in conjunction with compressed air in the tunnel to balance the
external ground pressure.
The tunnel will be lined with precast concrete segments designed and
manufactured by Costain Building Products.
The tunnel lining is 200mm thick to provide sufficient depth of concrete
over the steel reinforcement to resist anticipated corrosion for at least
100 years.
The circular shafts, which will vary in size between 6 metres and 7.62
metres in diameter, will be constructed with precast concrete segments, also
supplied by Costain Building Products.
