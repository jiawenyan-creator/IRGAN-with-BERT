METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING SET FOR BROTHERS IN MENENDEZ 
SLAYINGS 
A preliminary hearing for two brothers charged with killing their wealthy 
parents in Beverly Hills will be held in late May to allow resolution of a 
legal battle over tape-recorded evidence. 
Municipal Judge Charles Rubin scheduled the hearing for May 24, two days after 
a Santa Monica judge is to decide whether taped conversations between the 
defendants and their psychologist can be used at their trial. 
Erik Menendez, 19, and his brother, Lyle, 22, answered "Yes, your honor," when 
asked Monday if they would waive their right to a speedy hearing. The two, who 
appeared in dark business suits, are accused in the shotgun murders of their 
parents, Jose Menendez, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc., and his 
wife, Kitty, 44.
