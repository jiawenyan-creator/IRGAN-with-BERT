  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] received 
with surprise and regret the news of the evacuation from 
Belgrade of family members of diplomatic representatives of some 
European countries and the United States, as well as the news on 
advice not to travel to the FRY or to leave FRY territory, given 
to citizens of these countries, a Foreign Ministry statement 
says. 
  Similar hasty moves have been made before in order to put 
political and psychological pressure on the FRY and to inflict 
damage on its reputation. These moves are completely unfounded 
today, as they were in the past, and do not make any 
contribution toward creating an atmosphere needed for a 
successful completion of the peace negotiations. 
  The Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses that on 
the 
territory of the FRY, full personal safety and conditions for 
normal life and work are guaranteed for all diplomatic 
personnel, members of their families, and all foreigners. We 
therefore expect that these decisions will soon be reexamined 
and withdrawn, the statement says in conclusion.
