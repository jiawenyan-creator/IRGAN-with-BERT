FT  22 OCT 93 / Jump in cigarette tax proposed
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton confirmed yesterday that he would ask Congress to
increase the federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes by 75 cents (49p) to
help finance his healthcare reform programme.
He maintained in a wide-ranging speech on health and social policy issues
that this tax increase (from 24 cents a pack) plus fees from employers who
opt out of the proposed federal system and savings in Medicare and Medicaid
programmes for the elderly and indigent could make possible his goal of
national health insurance for all.
He offered no estimates of projected revenue but said later the healthcare
package had been revised to take account of a higher rate of inflation
because 'economic growth has come back'.
He implied that the budgeted costs of healthcare reform now assumed a 3.5
per cent rate of inflation over the next several years, up from the 2.7 per
cent first predicated and higher than the roughly 2.5 per cent current
annual increase in retail prices .
Tough opposition can be expected from the tobacco lobby in Congress, many of
them Democrats, though the anti-smoking mood of the country is a powerful
countervailing force.
