"Early Morning" newscast] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Jorge Carpizo's resignation, which was 
announced on Friday, was followed by reactions from the 
country's various social and political forces, which voiced 
their support for Carpizo to remain in his post, particularly in 
light of the coming elections. Immediate approvals also 
followed the announcement that Carpizo will continue as head of 
the Interior Secretariat. The Institutional Revolutionary Party 
[PRI] Executive Committee and PRI presidential candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo indicated that this decision strengthens the conditions 
of legality, transparency, and impartiality vis-a-vis the coming 
elections. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What do you think 
about Carpizo's decision to return? 
  [Zedillo] We are very pleased because it is on behalf of 
democracy. 
  [Reporter] How does the PRI view this decision? 
  [Zedillo] It is excellent. We expressed our discontent 
immediately after the announcement of his resignation and asked 
both Carpizo and President Salinas to reconsider the matter. We 
are very pleased our request was heeded. [end recording] 
  [Friedman] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential 
candidate for the National Action Party, said that Jorge 
Carpizo's decision to remain as interior secretary is 
praiseworthy. He noted that upon his return, Carpizo will have 
increased moral strength and social support. Fernandez added 
that his return will benefit democracy because Carpizo is an 
honest and highly respected man who enjoys considerable support. 
  [Rodriguez] Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate 
for 
the Mexican Green Ecologist Party, stated that any changes made 
with regard to the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] would crush 
whatever democratic achievements have been made. Carpizo's 
decision to remain in his post is, therefore, timely and very 
significant for Mexican politics. 
  [Friedman] Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate for 
the National Opposition Union, stated that Jorge Carpizo is a 
positive element and that his work in the IFE leadership as 
interior secretary should not remain unfinished. 
  [Rodriguez] Cecilia Soto, presidential candidate for the 
Labor Party, noted that Carpizo's decision is a sign of 
confidence for the citizens and the political parties. She 
added that Carpizo's resignation would have thwarted the 
electoral reform implemented thus far and would have been a 
difficult mistake to mend. 
  [Friedman] The Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction 
Party [PFCRN], meanwhile, praised Carpizo's decision to remain 
in his post. PFCRN presidential candidate Rafael Aguilar 
Talamantes indicated that Carpizo's change of heart shows great 
patriotism, wisdom, and dignity. 
  [Rodriguez] In the meantime, the National Brotherhood of 
Christian Evangelical Churches made a respectful request for 
Carpizo to publicly denounce Mexico's enemies and those sectors 
of the party that hinder Mexico's political evolution. They 
also conveyed to Carpizo their admiration and support for him to 
remain in charge of the Interior Secretariat and the IFE.
