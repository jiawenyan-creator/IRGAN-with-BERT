  [Excerpt] Ten members of the Front for the Liberation of 
the Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] have turned themselves in to Cabinda 
Province authorities. They are youngsters whose ages vary from 
20 to 24 years old and served with FLEC-Renovated [R] and 
FLEC-Cabinda Armed Forces [FAC]. They turned themselves in to 
government forces in the (Mituma Quilundo) and (Cuanda) regions 
a few days ago. Nine of them belonged to FLEC-R and one to 
FLEC-FAC. 
  (Faustino Umbake), 24, was in charge of FLEC-FAC operations 
and served in (Guengue), (Mbamba-Quiguenge), Miconje, and Necuto 
regions. Joao Mario Braz was section chief in FLEC-R and headed 
a group that ambushed and attacked government positions in the 
Belize region. They said they surrendered to government forces 
because they faced hardships in the bush, like famine and 
misery. [passage omitted]
