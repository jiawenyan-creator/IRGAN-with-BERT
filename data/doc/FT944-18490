FT  04 OCT 94 / Bonn to press for CO2 cuts
The current German presidency of the European Union will today try to push
for new cuts in carbon dioxide emissions running into the next century, even
though the Twelve have still to put in place measures sufficient to meet
existing targets on greenhouse gas reduction. Draft conclusions for today's
meeting of EU environment ministers in Luxembourg call on the European
Commission to set reduction targets for CO2 to 2005 and 2010. The Union is
committed to stabilising CO2 emissions at 1990 levels by 2000, under the Rio
Convention on Climate Change. The conclusions acknowledge that 'the measures
taken so far by individual member states and at European level will not
suffice' to meet this pledge, and call in addition for EU-wide taxation of
energy sources.  The nearly three-year-old Union plan for a mixed carbon and
energy tax of up to Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent - strongly
backed by Germany and northern states - now looks as though it will give way
to an aggregate of national taxes on fuel. 'The Germans are much more
flexible about what a tax instrument might be,' said one official from the
UK, which opposes the principle of an EU-level tax.
