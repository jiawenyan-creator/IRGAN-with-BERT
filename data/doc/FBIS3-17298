  [Text] The situation in connection with the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] nuclear inspection in the 
DPRK was aggravated yet again this week. The United States 
insists that the DPRK opposes full control. In this connection, 
the regular round of the Korean-American talks was disrupted and 
it is not ruled out that the "Team Spirit" exercises might be 
resumed, which is causing great concern in North Korea. The 
DPRK Foreign Ministry made a statement in this connection which 
describes the United States' actions as perfidious. 
  I have spoken to the DPRK ambassador Son Sung-pil. I asked 
him what importance in this connection North Korea was attaching 
to the Soviet-Korean friendship treaty, since Russia was the 
legal successor to such treaties, and under this treaty our 
state was supposed to support the DPRK in the event of an armed 
conflict. The ambassador replied: 
  [Begin Son recording, in Korean fading into Russian 
translation] Russia is the legal successor to all international 
treaties, and therefore in this sense Russia also inherited this 
treaty. The only problem is how each side will fulfill its 
obligations under the treaty. 
  Since there is as yet no military conflict, it is difficult 
to predict, and one should not predict what Russia is going to 
do in this case. When concrete actions or circumstances have 
taken place then, perhaps, Russia will demonstrate its position 
on the treaty. We can only wish that the Russian Government 
should understand correctly the essence and truth of this 
nuclear problem and should not create any obstacles on the way 
of a fair solution to the problem, and, on the contrary, should 
assist in resolving the problem objectively and fairly. [end

  It seems to me that for the time being the Russian position 
with regard to this incident is very restrained.
