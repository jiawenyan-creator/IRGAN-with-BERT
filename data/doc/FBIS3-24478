  [Abstract] Activation of chemical reactions in the liquid 
phase with UHF-radiation has recently attracted the interest of 
researchers. It has been observed that organic compounds 
irradiated with UHF-energy in the presence of a sensitizer 
results in reactions giving products analogous to those of high 
temperature cracking (pyrolysis), and thus this process may be 
termed UHF-cracking. In the present work some results are 
presented on the UHF-cracking of liquid n-hexane, its mixtures 
with ethanol, and also UHF-cracking of n-hexane in the presence 
of other additives. The products were chiefly mixtures of light 
saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. It was demonstrated that 
with UHF-cracking of n-hexane at atmospheric pressure, the 
ethylene content in the products exceeded 44 mole percent. The 
presence of hydroxyl-containing additives suppresses processes 
leading to the formation of coke, so that the yield of useful 
products is practically unaltered. Figures 2; references 15: 5
