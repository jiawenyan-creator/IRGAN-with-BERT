Leo's Discontinues Manufacturing: Leo's Industries said it would close down its 
30-employee home stereo manufacturing and wholesaling division to focus 
resources on its cellular telephone business. Leo's, which operates a 39-store 
stereo and electronics chain, said executives at its Long Beach-based ESS 
stereo subsidiary have offered to buy the division. The company blamed losses 
from ESS and one-time costs associated with closing the division for most of 
Leo's $2.4-million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31.
