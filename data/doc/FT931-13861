FT  21 JAN 93 / Observer: Dolorous
The most notable thing about the government's New Horizons for Women
exhibition, which employment secretary Gillian Shephard opened in Manchester
yesterday, was that there was only one proper employer among the 36
exhibitors - Tesco.
The Conservative Women's Association, the TUC, the Soroptimists and the
Pre-School Play Groups Association are jolly good things, but they can't do
much to reduce the number of women in the dole queues.
