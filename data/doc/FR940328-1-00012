 

By telefax dated March 10, 1994 (Administrative Record No. IND1339), Indiana submitted a version of the proposed
amendment which differs from that provided to OSM during the original submittal of April 2, 1993. OSM is, therefore,
reopening the public comment period and inviting comment on the substantive changes identified below.


1. 310 IAC 0.612.5Ultimate Authority for the Department


Subsection 2.5(b) is amended by deleting the words ``permit revision application.'' With this change, the administrative
law judge (ALJ) is the ultimate authority for the IDNR except for proceedings concerning the approval or disapproval
of a permit application or permit review under IC 134.145 and proceedings for suspension or revocation
of a permit under IC 134.1116.



2. 310 IAC 0.6117Record of the Director of the IDNR for Surface Coal Mining Permits


Subsection 17(c) is amended to add the following language after the first sentence. ``However, nothing in this subsection
precludes the admission of testimony or exhibits which are limited to the explanation or analysis of materials included
in the record before the director, or the manner in which the materials were applied, used, or relied upon in evaluating
the application.''
Indiana is also amending the third sentence (formerly the second sentence) to provide that timely objections may
be made ``before or during'' a hearing. Prior to this change, timely objections were to be made at a hearing.
Finally, subdivision 17(c)(2) is amended to read: ``[T]he permit application as defined at 310 IAC 120.510.''
Prior to this change, the proposed language did include the words ``as defined at 310 IAC 120.510.''


III. Public Comment Procedures


OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Indiana program amendment to provide the public an opportunity
to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional changes submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Indiana
program.


Written Comments


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under ``

DATES

'' or at locations other than the Indianapolis Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the Administrative Record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


Executive Order 12866


This proposed rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866
(Regulatory Planning and Review).


Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by Indiana, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.


List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 914


Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.
