  [Summary] Moscow, 4 Jun -- At the end of his official visit 
to Russia, Republic of Korea President Kim Yong-sam had a 
meeting this morning with Yevgeniy Primakov, head of the Russian 
Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS). The ITAR-TASS correspondent 
learned from reliable sources that they met one-to-one. Yuriy 
Kobaladze, head of the FIS press service, declined to reveal any 
details of the meeting. 
  A top-ranking FIS official told the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that one should not look for any hidden agenda in the meeting. 
Primakov and Kim first met in 1989, when the former was the 
head of the foreign relations institute and the latter the head 
of an opposition party. They have been on good terms ever 
since, and have often discussed bilateral and international 
issues of mutual interest, including nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons.
