  [Text] Tehran, May 17, IRNA -- A Persian daily Tuesday 
commented on the cancellation of the "Deliverance From 
Unbelievers" ceremony, scheduled to be held in Mecca today, and 
said the silent kept by Hajj pilgims was an indication to the 
oppression of Islam and Muslims even in the land of revelation.

  Reports from Mecca said that the Saudi police have stationed 
armoured personnel carriers, various weaponry and a large number 
of infantry around the headquarters of the leader's 
representative in Hajj-related affairs, creating a state similar 
to that of martial law. 
  It is crystal clear, said "JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" in its 
editorial, that Riyadh government has been under pressure by 
both the U.S. Administration and the Zionists for cancelling the 
ceremony. 
  But, added the article, the problem is that if Riyadh has 
some undertakings towards the U.S., Muslims also have undeniable 
responsibilities towrads Islam and other Muslims. 
  The Hajj season is an exceptional opportunity for Muslims to 
get acquainted with the sufferings and problems of other nations 
in order to find solutions for them, it said. 
  Deliverance from unbelievers and enemies of Islam is among 
the political principles of Hajj rituals and the least Hajj 
pilgrims can perform compared to the broad dimensions of the 
problems engulfing the Islamic world, the daily concluded.
