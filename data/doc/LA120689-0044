PRESIDENT SIGNS LAW ADDING WILDERNESS AREAS IN NEVADA 
President Bush signed legislation Tuesday designating 733,400 acres of 
protected wilderness in Nevada and opening 2.4 million more acres to multiple 
use under the management of the Agriculture Department. 
The measure creates 13 new wilderness areas in Nevada and adds to one other 
existing area. That would put 2% of the state's land under wilderness 
protection, preventing development and such uses as timber harvesting, mineral 
exploration or intrusion by campers in vehicles.
