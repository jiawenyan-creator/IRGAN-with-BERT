FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lifeline from Platt Saco creditors
Creditors of Platt Saco Lowell, the UK's biggest remaining textile machinery
manufacturer, yesterday agreed to keep the business going for four weeks
while the administrators try to sell it.
Some 120 people have been sacked this week as part of a survival plan drawn
up by Mr Mike Seery and Mr Peter Terry of KPMG Peat Marwick, the
administrators, reducing the business to a core of about 70 people.
The Lancashire - based company went into administration in February to
protect it against creditors. Its financial difficulties followed a slump in
sales because of recession. Creditors were told total debts were Pounds
3.6m, mainly to suppliers.
However, there is no secured debt and the company's US owner capitalised
Pounds 2.8m of inter-company debt last October to stave off possible
closure. Assets have a book value of Pounds 3.4m but are unlikely to make
half that figure on sale.
