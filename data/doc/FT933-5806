FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Board changes at Gencor
GENCOR, the South African mining house, has announced various changes to the
board of directors which will take effect after it unbundles its industrial
interests in November.
Three of the existing directors will leave the board, and four new
appointments have been announced. The most significant of these is the
appointment of Mr Mick Davis, currently executive director (finance and
services) of Eskom, the national electricity utility. Mr Davis will join
Gencor in January as executive director: finance. In due course he will take
over as chairman of Trans-Natal, the coal company in the Gencor stable.
Leaving the board are Mr Tom de Beer, Mr Eugene van As and Mr Jaco Fouche.
The first two were on the board in their capacities as chairmen respectively
of Genbel and Sappi, two of the companies that are being unbundled.
Mr Grant Thomas and Mr Rob Angel, respectively chief executives of Malbak
and Engen, will be staying on the Gencor board as non-executive directors,
despite their groups ceasing to be under Gencor control after the
unbundling.
