Since I grew up with the classic cartoons of Walt Disney and Warner Bros., I 
find contemporary cartoons, which my 2-year-old is stuck with, virtually 
intolerable to sit through. What is supposed to be humorous lacks all creative 
humor whatsoever. It makes me laugh that people have voiced complaints of 
violence depicted in some of the old classics, yet no one minds the warfare 
depicted in "Ninja Turtles," "Beetlejuice" and the "G.I. Joe" and "RoboCop" 
cartoons.
