FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Postipankki sinks deeper into
the red
Postipankki, the state-owned Finnish banking group, yesterday reported
sharply deeper losses in the first eight months compared with the same
period last year as falling income from financial operations and rising
costs eclipsed a promising decline in credit losses.
Operating losses mounted to FM463m (Dollars 85.7m) compared with a loss of
FM66m in the first eight months of 1993. Mr Seppo Lindblom, chief executive,
said the result was worse than expected and warned of further losses.
Net income from financial operations tumbled by FM361m to FM1.42bn due to
lower-than-anticipated returns from treasury operations. The bank said it
was 'not entirely successful' in predicting domestic and international
market trends and had incurred heavy bond trading losses. These included a
FM237m loss on Finnish government bonds for which Postipankki is a market
maker.
Group expenses jumped to FM1.85bn from FM1.43bn mainly due to costs
associated with Postipankki's takeover in 1993 of a one-fourth share of the
Savings Bank of Finland.
