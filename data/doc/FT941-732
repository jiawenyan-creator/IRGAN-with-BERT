FT  29 MAR 94 / Netherlands ferry route may restart
P&amp;O European Ferries yesterday said it may resume ferry freight services -
due to close in May - from Sheerness in Kent to Vlissingen in the
Netherlands.
P&amp;O has acquired two new 33,000-ton ferries from the German Olau line, which
is closing its Sheerness passenger and freight operation. P&amp;O's new ships
will operate between Portsmouth and Le Havre in northern France.
