Colonel I. Kozachok and Colonel A. Logachev: "Method for 
Calculating a Formation (Unit) Man-Made Obstacle System"] 
  [Text] This method is designed for a formation (unit) 
engineering services chief to conduct an expanded calculation of 
the manpower and equipment required to create a system of 
man-made obstacles when the decision has been made for engineer 
support of a battle. 
  The method permits him to determine the manpower and 
equipment requirements to create obstacles, to manufacture 
rubble, and to assess the effectiveness of the system of 
obstacles that has been created. 
  The following data may be required to conduct the 
calculations: 

  -  the enemy disposition of forces in the zone of action; 
  -  the 
formation (unit) combat formation and its composition; 
  -  the 
length of the defensive frontage that is accessible for enemy 
troop operations on the axes -- on the enemy's main axis of 
attack [napravleniye glavnogo udara] (MAA) and on the other axis 
of attack [napravleniye drugogo udara] (OAA); 
  -  the required 
density of the obstacles; 
  -  the availability of time, manpower and 
equipment to create the obstacle system.

<H3>  2.1. Determination of the Required Quantity of Landmines and 
Demolition Materials To Install the Obstacles </H3>
  The quantity of landmines and demolition materials required 
to create the system of man-made obstacles while preparing the 
defense is determined based upon the known density of the 
obstacles and the length of the defensive frontage that is 
accessible for enemy troop operations and in accordance with 
Table 2-1. The calculations are conducted first for the main 
axis of attack and then for the other axis. The results are 
summarized in the table below.

  For less precise calculations, you can determine the 
required 
quantity of landmines and demolition materials not by axes but 
by the total width of the front of likely armor approach terrain 
along the formation's entire defensive zone. 
  The required quantity of landmines and demolition materials 
that are installed during the course of the battle is determined 
according to that same initial data in accordance with Table 2.2.

  Summing up the quantity of munitions required to install 
obstacles while preparing the defense and during the course of a 
battle provides the desired value -- the required quantity of 
landmines and demolition materials to create a system of 
man-made obstacles. 
  The recommendations set forth in Table 2-3 need to be 
utilized in calculations in those cases when the required 
density of the obstacles on the axes has not been specified.

  The number of engineer subunits needed to reinforce the 
formation during preparations for (during the course of) a 
battle is determined from the expression: 
  Dengrco[.sup]rf[/] = (D[.sup]MAA[/] x La[.sup]MAA[/] 
+ D[.sup]OAA[/] x La[.sup]OAA[/]/Cengrco x Tco) - Nengrco, 
(1) 
  where: D[.sup]MAA[/], D[.sup]OAA[/] -- is the required 
density of the minefields being installed on the main and other 
axis of enemy attack; 
  La[.sup]MAA[/] La[.sup]OAA[/] -- the length of 
defensive frontage that is accessible for enemy troop operations 
on the main and other axis of enemy attack, respectively, in 
kilometers; 
  Cengrco -- the calculated capabilities of an engineer 
company to install minefields (3 km per day -- when preparing 
the defense when not in contact with the enemy, 1.5 km per day 
under conditions of direct contact with the enemy, 3.2 km per 
day during the course of a battle); 
  Tco -- the time allotted for the creation of obstacles 
while preparing the defense, in days (during the course of a 
battle Tco = 1 day); and, 
  Nengrco[.sup]f[/] -- the number of calculated engineer 
companies in a formation (unit), Table 2.4.

<H5>  2.2. Assessment of the Effectiveness of Obstacles </H5>
  The assessment of the effectiveness of obstacles is 
conducted 
according to two criteria: Losses of enemy tanks and BMP's 
[armored personnel vehicles] in the obstacles and the rate of 
advance reduction ratio. 
  Losses of tanks and BMP's are determined according to the 
formula: 
  N[.sup]T[/] = (D[.sup]MAA[/] x La[.sup]MAA[/] + 
D[.sup]OAA[/] x La[.sup]OAA[/]) x N, (2) 
  where: N -- is the enemy tank and BMP loss standard per 1 
kilometer of obstacles, in units per kilometer (this is accepted 
as being equal to 0.75/1 km). 
  The enemy rate of advance reduction ratio is determined 
according to the axes from the expression: 
  Rarr[.sup]MAA[/](Rarr[.sup]OAA[/]) = 1 + 1.5D x V/L, (3) 
  where: V - is the prescribed enemy advance rate (it is 
advisable to utilize 3 kph in the calculations); and, 
  L -- is the depth of the formation's (unit's) defense, in 
kilometers. 
  An example of the calculation of a formation man-made 
obstacle system that was prepared when not in contact with the 
enemy. 
  Initial data: 
  During preparations of the defense (not in contact with the 
enemy): 
  D[.sup]MAA[/] = 2.0, D[.sup]OAA[/] = 1.0, 
  L[.sup]MAA[/] = 8 km, D[.sup]OAA[/] = 12 km, 
  Tco = 2 days, L[.sup]def[/] = 30 km. 
  During the course of a battle: D[.sup]MAA[/] = 1.2, 
D[.sup]OAA[/] = 0.7. 
  D[.sup]MAA[/] = 1.2, D[.sup]OAA[/] = 0.7. 
  Solution: 
  1. The quantity of landmines and demolition materials 
required to create a system of man-made obstacles while 
preparing the defense is determined according to Table 2.1, 
initially on the main axis of attack and then on the other axis. 
The results are noted in Table 1. 
  2. The number of engineer subunits required to reinforce a 
formation during preparation for the defense is determined from 
the expression (1): 
  Dengrco[.sup]rf[/] = (2.0 x 8 + 1.0 x 12)/(3.0 x 2) - 4.5 
= 0.1 
  3. The number of engineer subunits required to reinforce a 
formation during the course of a battle is determined in a 
similar manner: 
  Dengrco [.sup]rf[/] = (1.2 x 8 + 0.7 x 12)/(3.0 x 2) -3.2 
= 0.2. 
  Because the results are close to zero in both cases, 
reinforcement of a division with engineer subunits is not 
required. 
  4. Tank and BMP losses are determined using the formula (2): 
  N[.sup]T[/] = [(2.0 +1.2) x 8] = [(1.0 = 0.7) x 12] x 0.75 
= 34. 
  5. The enemy advance rate reduction ratio is determined from 
the expression: 
  Rarr[.sup]MAA[/] = 1 + 1.5 x (2.0 + 1.2) x 3.0/30 = 1.48. 
  (Rarr[.sup]OAA[/]) = 1 + 1.5 x (1.2 + 0.7) x 3.0/30 = 
1.29.
