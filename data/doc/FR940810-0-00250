As mentioned in step 13 of Section 6.6.2., a ``blind recount'' of 10% of the slides is performed. In all cases, differences
will be observed between the first and second counts of the same filter wedge. Most of these differences will be due
to chance alone, that is, due to the random variability (precision) of the count method. Statistical recount criteria
enables one to decide whether observed differences can be explained due to chance alone or are probably due to systematic
differences between analysts, microscopes, or other biasing factors. 

The following recount criterion is for a pair of counts that estimate AC in fibers/cc. The criterion is given at the
type-I error level. That is, there is 5% maximum risk that we will reject a pair of counts for the reason that one might
be biased, when the large observed difference is really due to chance. 
Reject a pair of counts if:

AC

2

AC

avg

=average of the two concentration estimates 

CV

FB

=CV for the average of the two concentration estimates 

 


If a pair of counts are rejected by this criterion then, recount the rest of the filters in the submitted set. Apply the
test and reject any other pairs failing the test. Rejection shall include a memo to the industrial hygienist stating
that the sample failed a statistical test for homogeneity and the true air concentration may be significantly different
than the reported value. 



7.4. Reporting Results 



Report results to the industrial hygienist as fibers/cc. Use two significant figures. If multiple analyses are performed
on a sample, an average of the results is to be reported unless any of the results can be rejected for cause.

Quality Control 



The OSHA asbestos regulations require each laboratory to establish a quality control program. The following is presented
as an example of how the OSHASLTC constructed its internal CV curve as part of meeting this requirement. Data
for the CV curve shown below is from 395 samples collected during OSHA compliance inspections and analyzed from October
1980 through April 1986. 

Each sample was counted by 2 to 5 different counters independently of one another. The standard deviation and the CV
statistic was calculated for each sample. This data was then plotted on a graph of CV vs. fibers/mm2. A least squares
regression was performed using the following equation: 




CV=antilog

[A(log

(x))2+B(log
