FT  22 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Kuwait chemicals plant to go ahead
KUWAIT has signed an agreement with Union Carbide of the US to construct and
operate a KD700m (Pounds 1.5bn) petrochemical complex at Shuaiba, near
Kuwait City.
The complex, due to be completed by 1997, will be the most important
petrochemicals complex in the country. It is expected to have an annual
ethylene capacity of about 650,000 tonnes a year. Production will be based
on ethane.
Downstream capacity will include 350,000 tonnes a year of ethylene glycol
and 450,000 tonnes a year of polyethylene.
The complex will present further difficulties for Europe's hard-pressed
petrochemicals industry, where there is over-capacity and most plants are
operating at a loss. World average ethylene capacity for 1993 is estimated
at 73.9m tonnes, while demand stands at 63.3m tonnes, according to Chemical
Marketing Associates, the Houston-based consultants.
The joint venture, which took more than a year to negotiate, will be 45 per
cent owned by Kuwait's Petrochemical Industries Company, 45 per cent by
Union Carbide and 10 per cent by private Kuwaiti investors.
