Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A320 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS).
This proposal is prompted by a report of leakage from some of the hydraulic pipe fittings after a lightning strike.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such leakage from hydraulic pipe fittings, which
could result in the loss of the pilot's ability to control the moveable surfaces of the THS.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments must be received by February 6, 1995.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94NM143AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 980554056.
Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal
holidays. 



The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Airbus Industrie, 1 Rond Point Maurice
Bellonte, 31707 Blagnac Cedex, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate,
1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington.

Discussion 



The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC
advises that one operator found leakage from some of the hydraulic pipe fittings on one airplane after a lightning
strike. Investigation revealed that the electrical bonding of the hydraulic pipe fittings and actuator servo control
units of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) has insufficient protection from a lightning strike. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in the loss of the pilot's ability to control the moveable surfaces of the THS, which
could adversely affect the controllability of the airplane. 

Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320291058, dated July 16, 1993, which describes procedures for
modification of the THS. This modification involves installing bonding leads across all return hydraulic pipe fittings
in the THS area and across the actuator return line elbows. This modification also involves replacing the existing
clamps with items of increased electrical conductivity. 

Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320271041, Revision 2, dated April 20, 1994, which describes
procedures for modification of the THS. This modification involves installing bonding plates and leads between
the elevator and the THS, and bonding leads between the actuator bodies and the THS bonding strip. This modification
also connects bonding leads to the return hydraulic pipes across all the fittings in the THS area.
