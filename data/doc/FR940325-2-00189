</FOOTNOTE>


The purpose of the Rule 476A procedure is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful sanction is
appropriate but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under Rule 476 is not suitable because such a proceeding
would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. Rule 476A
provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules while preserving the due process
rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. The list of rules which are eligible for 476A
procedures specifies those rule violations which may be the subject of fines under the rule and also includes a schedule
of fines.
In SRNYSE8427, which initially set forth the provisions and procedures of the Rule 476A, the
Exchange indicated it would amend the list of rules from time to time, as it considered appropriate, in order to phase-in
the implementation of Rule 476A as experience with it was gained. The Exchange's regulatory divisions have amended
the list since its initial implementation to include either existing rules or newly approved ones, which are appropriate
for inclusion in this particular disciplinary process when violations occur.
