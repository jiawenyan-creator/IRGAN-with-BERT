 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is 
proposing to amend its capital adequacy rules to revise the 
definition of common stockholders' equity to include unrealized 
holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of 
applicable tax effects. Inclusion of such unrealized gains and 
losses as a separate component of stockholders' equity is 
consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 
115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity 
Securities,'' and would keep the OCC's definition of common 
stockholders' equity consistent with generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP). As Tier 1 capital under the OCC's capital 
adequacy rules is defined to include common stockholders' equity, 
this proposal, if adopted, would require these net unrealized 
holding gains and losses to be considered in determining the amount 
of an institution's Tier 1 capital.

 Comments should be submitted on or before May 18, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Under the current OCC minimum capital requirements (leverage 
ratio) and the risk-based capital guidelines set forth at 12 CFR 
part 3, a major component of Tier 1 capital is common stockholders' 
equity. Common stockholders' equity is defined to include (1) 
common stock, (2) common stock surplus, (3) undivided profits, (4) 
capital reserves, (5) adjustments for the cumulative effect of 
foreign currency translation, and (6) net unrealized losses on non-
current marketable equity securities. The net unrealized losses 
are those recorded under Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 12, ``Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities'' 
(SFAS 12). 

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, ``Accounting 
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,'' (SFAS 115). 
This statement supersedes SFAS 12 and establishes a new component 
of common stockholders' equity consisting of net unrealized holding 
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. Under SFAS 115, 
available-for-sale securities are those securities which a bank 
does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, 
but does not intend to trade actively as part of its trading 
account. 

In August 1993, the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, The 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, announced the adoption of SFAS 115 for regulatory 
reporting purposes. The OCC now proposes to adopt SFAS 115 for 
regulatory capital purposes as well.
