JEWEL THIEVES WALK INTO POLICE STAKEOUT 
Three men who put on Halloween masks and tried to treat themselves at a jewelry 
store instead found a trick -- 12 undercover police officers waiting on a 
stakeout, officials said. 
The men, carrying automatic weapons including a sawed-off shotgun, arrived 
Thursday night at the Diamond Jewelry store and ordered two clerks to kneel on 
the floor while they cleaned out their jewelry cases and vault, police said. 
But 12 undercover officers, who were staking out the store because of a theft 
two weeks earlier, captured all three men in a brief gunfight that ended with 
one of the intruders getting grazed by a shot, Westford Police Sgt. Joseph Roy 
said. 
"We were in the right place at the right time," Roy said.
