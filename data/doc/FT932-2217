FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Political uncertainty depresses
Nikkei - At a Glance
Uncertainty over the Japanese political situation this week pushed the
Nikkei share index under the 20,000 mark for the first time since April 26.
Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, lost a parliamentary vote of
no confidence on Friday. Parliament was dissolved, and a snap election is
now due to be called by the end of July. The news came after the close of
the Tokyo stock exchange, but jitters in the run-up to the confidence vote
depressed the Nikkei share index, which closed down 120.97 at 19,804.54 on
Friday. Further large falls are not expected as political factors have
already been discounted. The yen continued to weaken against the dollar.
