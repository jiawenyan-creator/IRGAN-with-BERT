FT  30 JUN 94 / Two German Bank Officials Offer to resign over Schneider
Two senior German bank officials have offered to resign in the scandal
surrounding the collapsed Jurgen Schneider property group, Deutsche Bank's
mortgage banking unit said yesterday. Mr Joachim Plesser, a management board
member of Deutsche's Centralbodenkredit mortgage unit, said fellow board
members, Mr Detlev Rode and Mr Jurgen Huvendick, had offered to step down.
Centralboden's supervisory board will consider the resignations on July 4.
Mr Jurgen Schneider abandoned his property empire in April, leaving it to
file for bankruptcy with DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) of bank debts. Deutsche Bank was
Schneider's largest creditor, owed some DM1.2bn, most of which had been
funneled through Centralboden.
