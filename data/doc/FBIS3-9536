  [Text] Prague, March 24 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec and Dutch Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans 
discussed primarily the situation in the European Union at their 
meeting today. Kooijmans is accompanying Queen Beatrix on a 
three-day official visit to the Czech Republic. The visit ends 
today. 
  The Dutch minister said it was impossible to speak of an 
exact date for the Czech Republic to become a full member of the 
EU when it hadn't even applied for membership yet. It is up to 
individual governments to decide when and under what conditions 
to apply, he said. Nevertheless, if the admission of Austria, 
Norway, Sweden and Finland is not postponed, he saw no reason 
for the Czech Republic not to be admitted around the year 2000, 
if it applies. 
  Zieleniec said he considered the present discussions in the 
EU important and dramatic, even if they're only about technical 
things like voting rules and blocking minorities. At heart, its 
vision of the future and entire philosophy are at stake, he said. 
  In conclusion, both ministers praised the state of good 
relations between the two countries.
