FT  17 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Chef's accolade - Appetisers
Flemish chef Roger Souvereyns has been crowned king of Belgian cuisine on
his 56th birthday. Souvereyns, owner of Scholteshof restaurant in Hasselt,
was awarded 19.5 out of 20 in Gault-Millau's guide to restaurants in
continental Europe, 1995. That rating, the highest Gault-Millau ever gives,
earns him the title of Chef of the Year. He has two Michelin stars.
From your table in the restaurant, you can watch Souvereyns in the kitchen,
composing carefully concentrated flavours. He works closely with Nicolas
Santi, his young French sommelier, who this year won the title of Best
Sommelier in Belgium for French wines. Says Souvereyns: 'For me, the wine is
as important as the food. If the wine does not balance the food in its
flavours and spices, it can kill the dish, and the reverse is also true.'
Scholteshof, literally the bailiff's house, is an 18th century manor in
Limbourg, Flanders, near the Dutch and German borders. Souvereyns has
attracted a loyal following of cross-border diners.
The restaurant is set in grounds planted with a maze, a vineyard, orchards,
a traditional herb and vegetable garden, and a lawn with an ornamental
border, pond and gazebo and is about 45 minutes from Brussels.
Scholteshof is refreshingly relaxed. If you want to drink - rather than
merely taste - the wine, think about staying the night at the comfortable
hotel that is part of the complex. It is worth noting that Belgium has just
tightened its drink-driving laws.
Three-course seasonal lunch BFr1,700 (Pounds 33) or BFr2,550 including wine.
Scholteshof Kermstraat 130, 3512 Hasselt-Stevoort, Belgium. Tel: 32 2 11 25

Once again, Oddbins has released a range of malt whiskies for the Christmas
season, all keenly-priced and sold at cask strength.
They are: the Bruichiaddich 1980, at Pounds 29.99; the Highland Park 1976
(59 per cent), at Pounds 32.49; Glengarioch 1971, at Pounds 39.99;
17-year-old Port Ellen (59.6), at Pounds 29.99; 22-year-old Brora, at Pounds
39.99; 23-year-old St Magdalen (58.1), at Pounds 39.99; and Dallas Dhu
24-year-old (60.6), also at Pounds 39.99. It should be remembered that these
high strengths mean that you are getting a bottle and a half of a whisky at
40 per cent alcohol, but you will need to add more water.
The Highland Park is a gorgeous dram with all the peatiness you would expect
from this Orkney stalwart; the Glengarioch has classic Speyside sweetness;
the Port Ellen has a surprising fruitiness, rather like raspberries (you try
it]); the St Magdalen is as elegant and understated as a good Lowland should
be; the Dallas Dhu a classic in honey and heather.
I have had better bottlings of Bruichiaddich; and the Brora has an odd
redolence of summer road works which might frighten off the less committed
whisky buff.

Correction: In my article of December 3, 'A good but not great vintage' I
stated that M Andre Porcheret, wine-maker of the Hospices de Beaune, had
previously been with the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, whereas he had been at
Dom Leroy.
