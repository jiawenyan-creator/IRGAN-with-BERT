SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL; 
ZONE CHANGE FOR THEATER 
Progress toward construction of a 2,100-seat multiscreen theater at the 
southwest corner of Arroyo Parkway and Green Street advanced Tuesday with a 
zoning change that provides less-stringent parking and design requirements for 
the $8.89-million project. 
Under the change approved by the Board of Directors, the Arroyo Cinema Plaza 
Project will provide 420 parking spaces instead of 559 and will be subject to 
design review under Old Pasadena district guidelines instead of the more 
specific Downtown Pasadena district guidelines. 
Director Rick Cole cast the lone vote against the zoning change, saying 
developer George Krikorian will no longer be required to provide parking for an 
estimated 100 employees who will hold jobs in the structure, "I think the 
record should be clear," Cole said. "Break after break after break has been 
accorded to Mr. Krikorian in order to make this innovative project work." 
Plans call for a five-story, 79,510-square-foot complex that will include an 
11-screen theater, 8,214 square feet of retail space, 24,379 square feet for 
offices and a 3,980-square-foot restaurant. Two years ago, the directors 
approved a $1.5-million loan to Krikorian to help his secure the land for the 
project.
