  [Text] In an exclusive interview with the "TV Today" 
newscast, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has affirmed his 
determination to punish drug traffickers. He stressed the need 
for U.S. cooperation in this task with whatever evidence it may 
have, and he denounced a discredit campaign which seems to be 
underway. 
  [De Greiff] "I think this is a mistake, because if they 
really want us to put criminals in jail, they must help us with 
evidence; it would be absurd not to do so. 
  "In addition, they cannot expect us to throw people in jail 
without evidence. What we need is evidence, and that is the 
whole purpose of international cooperation." 
  Regarding the Cali Cartel drug traffickers, the prosecutor 
general added the Prosecutor General's Office has some evidence 
against them. 
  [De Greiff] "We have some evidence against them, but the 
more 
evidence we have the better." 
  De Greiff said the Prosecutor General's Office has the 
desire 
and determination to punish drug traffickers firmly. 
  [De Greiff] "What happens is that naturally, when the 
government demands and states drug traffickers be severely 
punished, it is implying there is someone who does not want to 
punish them, who might be me. This perception is absolutely 
wrong." 
  De Greiff added there is a campaign under way to discredit 
him. 
  [De Greiff] "I think this campaign is being handled 
erroneously. It is a very disloyal campaign that I think is 
affecting Colombia's image." 
  Despite everything, the prosecutor general affirmed his 
determination to fight crime. 
  [De Greiff] "My aim is to fight drug trafficking in all 
forms 
and to open the door to those who want to surrender to justice 
within the legal framework promulgated by the government." 
  Finally, de Greiff said he is expecting to receive an 
official communication from the U.S. State Department on 
judicial aid to Colombia.
