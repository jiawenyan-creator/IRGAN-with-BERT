PRESIDENT BUSH ON GUN CONTROL 
I cannot afford a large ad in The Times as did the NRA (Part I, Feb. 13). I am 
sorry that others seem to think an AK-47 or an Uzi is a necessity for 
law-abiding citizens. Hopefully, our legislators will pass a law that will get 
rid of some of them. 
I am not under the illusion that gangs and criminals will turn theirs in. But a 
journey begins one step at a time.
