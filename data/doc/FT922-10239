FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: IBM seeks multi-media deal
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines says it is 'pursuing and being pursued' by
potential partners as it seeks to form an independent joint venture company
to provide interactive multi-media services to US businesses and consumers.
Time Warner, the media and entertainment giant seeking to raise cash and
reschedule Dollars 7.2bn of debt, is believed to be among the companies in
talks with IBM about the venture.
IBM declined to identify its potential partners, but said it was in talks
with several long distance and local telephone companies, television cable
service operators, entertainment companies and others.
'We are forming business and technology relationships with companies that
have the core skills that will be needed to implement an inter-active
multi-media network, says Ms Lucie Fjeldstad, IBM vice-president and general
manager of multi-media.
IBM had been exploring the business potential of multi-media - the
confluence of computer, consumer electronics and telecommunications
technologies - for the past two years, Ms Fjeldstad said.
'Movies on demand', where subscribers can watch a film of their choice at
any time, will be one of the first applications. Time Warner's vast library
of movies and television shows, as well as its cable television systems,
could become a key element of the service.
Time Warner's wants to attract cash from IBM in exchange for making
entertainment 'software' available to the project.
The amount of cash it might attract if the venture is agreed would be far
less than the Dollars 1bn investment by two Japanese companies - Toshiba and
C. Itoh - who recently bought 12.5 per cent of Time Warner Entertainment
(TWE), a new subsidiary of Time Warner that contains the movie and cable
assets of the group.
