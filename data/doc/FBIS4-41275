  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has used his 
constitutional right of veto against the law on the formation of 
local bodies of power and self-government which was recently 
passed by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The president has 
referred the law to the parliament for amendment. He announced 
this on Wednesday during a meeting with ministers and heads of 
departments on security issues. According to Leonid Kravchuk, 
some articles of the law contradict the constitution and the 
current legislation.
